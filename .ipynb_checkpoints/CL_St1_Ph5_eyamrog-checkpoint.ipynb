As part of an ongoing project treating the ferns and lycophytes from the region of Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, we here present the taxonomic treatment of the early divergent lineages of the leptosporangiate ferns: the families Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae and Saccolomataceae. We have been sampling the remnant forest patches since 2012; we also fully reviewed the collection of herbarium VIC and other online collections: F, IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. In the region of Viçosa, six taxa belonging to those families occur Dennstaedtia cicutaria and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Dennstaedtiaceae); Lindsaea lancea var. lancea, L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta var. stricta (Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma elegans (Saccolomataceae). Among these taxa, only L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest; the remaining are widespread in the Neotropics. We present keys, descriptions, illustrations, examined specimens, and comments.'"

       "'At the end of the era in which the plant Classification Systems were mostly based on morphological data, Dennstaedtiaceae was considered a big family, comprehending three subfamilies (or tribes) and about 17 genera (Tryon & Tryon 1982, Kramer 1990). With the advent of molecular data, those subfamilies were raised to family-level, some families were created, and now the early- diverging leptosporangiate ferns are represented by Cystodiaceae (one genus), Dennstaedtiaceae with a stricter circumscription (11-12 genera), Lindsaeaceae (seven genera), Lonchitidaceae (one genus), Saccolomataceae (one or two genera), as well as the great Pteridaceae (+50 genera) (Smith et al. 2006, PPG I 2016, Shang et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2020).'"

       "'Whether the purpose of NATO expansion is seen as an attempt to prevent the formation of a Eurasian alliance (KLARE, 2022), a “justifiable response to the […] entreaties of new Central and Eastern European democracies” (SAROTTE, 2021) that contributed to the frustration of East-West cooperation, or “the most fateful error in the entire post-Cold War era” (KENNAN, 1997) always depends on one’s standpoint; there is no “objective position”. It is a central contention of Bakhtinian dialogism that we do not only engage in talk about discourse, but with discourse, and that a form of dialogical understanding always includes evaluation and response Todorov (1984, p.16). In the continuously changing realm of politics, any analyst not only observes political processes, but also shapes them, so that “decision and standpoint are inseparably bound up together” (MANNHEIM, 1936, p.152).
