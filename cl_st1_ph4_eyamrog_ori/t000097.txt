Objectives: This study aimed at identifying and characterizing the physical activity 
and/or physical exercise intervention study protocols for breast cancer treatment.  The 
types, frequency, duration, intensity and timing of the therapeutic intervention with 
physical activity are highlighted, in addition to showing the results found. 

Methods: Based on the guidelines of PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR), a search was carried out in five databases (Cochrane Library; PubMed 
Central®; ScienceDirect; Scopus Elsevier and Web of science). There was no restriction 
regarding idiom or year of publication. The studies found were evaluated manually and 
with the assistance of the Rayyan software by two researchers, blindly and independently. 
The following keywords were used as a search strategy:  ‘breast cancer’ AND ‘physical 
activity’ OR ‘physical exercise’, AND ‘protocol study’ OR ‘study protocol’. The 
inclusion criteria comprised study protocols of randomized clinical trials with the 
intervention of physical activity and/or physical exercise in women undergoing breast 
cancer treatment and during post-treatment. 

Results: 806 articles were found. The duplicates and the ones that did not meet the 
inclusion criteria were excluded, thus, 17 articles remained for the review. The Cochrane 
Risk-of-Bias tool was used for the methodological evaluation of the studies classified as 
having a ‘low risk’ of bias, which showed methodological rigor. Aerobic exercises, 
endurance training, dance, Pilates, exercises guided by applications and internet software 
were highlighted. Moderate intensity exercises were evidenced, with a frequency of three 
times a week and duration of 30 minutes. The great majority of the women who 
participated in the interventions were between stages 0 and III of the disease. The study 
protocols showed improvement with regard to the physical aspects (physical fitness, 
physical activity level, cognitive function and body composition), and psychological 
aspects (quality of life, fatigue, depression and anxiety), which reinforces the use of 
physical activities for this public. 

Discussion: Study protocols are essential to provide research transparency, which 
facilitates the reproducibility and understanding of the interventions, and contributes to 
scientific advancement. 

Impact: This scoping review provides a survey that will help further research on physical 
activity and/or physical exercise for women with breast cancer. 

Breast cancer has been considered the most common type of cancer in women 
worldwide since 2018. That year it accounted for more than 24% of the total cancer cases 
diagnosed in the female world population, with approximately 2.1 million new cases, in 
addition to also being identified as the fifth cause of cancer death1. Current evidence 
suggests physical activity practice as an alternative therapy2,3, which provides health 
benefits for women undergoing breast cancer treatment or during post-treatment; 
moreover, such activities can be significantly associated with these women postoperative 
stage4.    

Therefore, randomized clinical trials that investigate interventions with physical 
activity in women with breast cancer have been shown to be effective in improving 
fatigue.5–7, quality of life5,8,9, decreased body mass index (BMI) and body weight5, 
increased muscle endurance5, muscle strength10,11, decreased symptoms of depression and 
anxiety6,7,9, improvement in shoulder range of motion9,10, sleep disorders12, body image12, 
pain13 and cardiorespiratory fitness11,13.  

The search in the databases (PubMed Central®; Cochrane Library; Web of 
science - main collection, Scopus Elsevier e ScienceDirect) showed that the international 
literature has published studies on physical activity and chronic diseases since 1983 with 
the investigation by Metzner et al14.Such study suggested that the practice of physical 
activity contributes to reduce the risks of chronic diseases. Regarding study protocols, 
one of the first findings dates from 1955 with the study by Sakheim15 that aimed at 
validating a study protocol in a psychiatric hospital. Only in 1989, with the investigation 
by Dickhuth et al16 the study protocols started to associate physical activity. 

The fact that the publication of study protocols provides transparency to research17 
is notorious, in addition to reducing publication bias18. When published, such protocols 
become significant research instruments, since they help in the reproducibility of 
interventions by other researchers and contribute to the scientific community to identify 
what has been produced in a given area17. However, despite their benefits, not all clinical 
trials are concerned with publishing the physical activity intervention protocols that have 
worked as an instrument. 

In this sense, by mapping the scenario of randomized clinical trials protocols that 
include physical activity for women with breast cancer, the present scoping review can 
contribute with new perspectives of interventions for the professionals in the area. In 
addition, this review is intended to collaborate for the improvement in physical and 
mental health of women with breast cancer through complementary therapies.  Thus, this 
scoping review aimed at identifying and characterizing the physical activity and/or 
physical exercise intervention study protocols for breast cancer treatment. The types, 
frequency, duration, intensity and timing of the therapeutic intervention with physical 
activity were highlighted, in addition to showing the results found. 

The present scoping review is based on the guidelines of PRISMA Extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR)19. The guiding question was formed according to 
PICOS acronym: what are the characteristics of the physical activity and/or physical 
exercise intervention protocols for breast cancer treatment? 

A search was performed in five databases: Cochrane Library; PubMed Central®; 
ScienceDirect; Scopus Elsevier and Web of science - main collection. The descriptors are 
shown in Table 1.  All the titles and abstracts found in the electronic search were manually 
assessed by two researchers (JS, VBL), blindly and independently, from January to 
February 2021. Such researchers are members of a Brazilian laboratory referred to as 
Laboratório de Pesquisa em Lazer e Atividade Física – LAPLAF/CNPq (Leisure and 
Physical Activity Research Laboratory). The Rayyan software (Intelligent Systematic 
Review) was also used to assist in the selection of references. The discrepancies were 
resolved by a third researcher (ACAG). The reference lists of all the relevant articles were 
examined to identify other eligible studies. 

The eligibility criteria for the studies were defined according to PICOS acronym 
by considering the population, intervention, comparison, outcome and study design 
(Table 2). Some randomized clinical trials carried out with adult women (≥18 years old) 
undergoing breast cancer treatment and during post-treatment were eligible for this 
review.  

The studies should investigate interventions that included physical activities 
and/or physical exercise for breast cancer treatment. The abstracts and full texts were 
available from January to February, 2021. There was no restriction regarding the idiom 
or the year of publication. 

The researchers (JS and VBL) carried out the searches on the databases mentioned 
and, then, they systematized the organization of the articles selected according to the title 
and abstract. Those that did not meet the objectives of the study were excluded. After this 
screening, the articles were read in full, so that the selection process of the ones that would 
be included in this study was completed (Figure 1). 

After searching for the studies to be included in the present scoping review, those 
that addressed physical activity and/or physical exercise protocols for the treatment and 
post-treatment of women with breast cancer were selected. Thus, the following variables 
were investigated:  study protocols, breast cancer and physical activity and/or physical 
exercise. 

Study protocols provide guidelines for research performance, in addition to being 
a basis for recording and facilitating the evaluation itself20. These are studies that establish 
detailed steps and sequences so that an investigation can then be carried out by answering 
both, the questions that are sought according to the purposes and any other questions that 
may arise.21.                                                                              

Breast cancer is characterized by an uncontrolled growth of abnormal breast 
cells22 and it is the type of cancer with the highest incidence among women worldwide23. 
The first articles published on this theme date from the 1880s, with the study by Snow24, 
and in 1889 with the study by Cheyne25. Currently, there is an increasing number of 
studies related to breast cancer, with more than 500,000 articles in the databases. Such 
investigations have been in evidence since the 1960s with clinical trials26–28, which 
increasingly intensified and deepened the search for early diagnosis and types of 
treatment with the purpose of improving the quality of life of these women. 

Physical activity is defined as any body movement produced by skeletal muscles 
that require energy expenditure29. According to Krebs, Berling-Ernst, Halle30 physical 
activity represents a therapy option and support for cancer patients. There are studies 
related to the practice of physical activity and/or physical exercise during the treatment 
and post-treatment of cancers29,31,32, especially breast cancer, which recommend at least 
150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week33.  

The analysis and discussion of the study protocols was carried out by extracting 
the data referring to the authors, year of publication, journal, country where the study was 
carried out, number of citations according to the Web of Science base (until February 7, 
2021), number of databases, search period and whether the 27-item PRISMA checklist 
was followed (yes or no). In addition, the objectives, total sample size, intervention 
groups, control group, age, the location where the study was carried out, the variables 
investigated (physical and psychological ones), particularities of the intervention with 
physical activity, duration, number and frequency of the sessions, and duration of the 
intervention were scored. 

The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool was used34 in order to assess the methodological 
quality of the studies. The following criteria were evaluated: (1) random sequence 
generation, (2) allocation sequence hiding, (3) the participants and researchers’ masking, 
and (4) selective reporting. The masking items regarding the evaluation of the outcomes, 
as well as the incomplete data were not included in the study, since study protocols do 
not show intervention results. The researchers' judgment (JS, ACAG) on the review was 
rated as low, unclear, or as having a high risk of bias. 

806 articles were found in the first database search, that is, 290 in Science Direct, 
46 in Web of Science, 87 in Scopus, 170 in Cochrane and 213 in PubMed. 102 duplicate 
articles were excluded. After reading the titles and abstracts, 686 articles were excluded 
for not meeting the inclusion criteria, besides being characterized as another type of study 
or for investigating individuals with other diseases. Thus, 18 articles remained to be read 
in full and, after doing so, one article was excluded.  

Therefore, 17 articles were included in this scoping review, all of them 
characterized as study protocols with randomized clinical trials35–51.  

The 
study 
participants 
comprised 
women 
diagnosed 
with 
breast 
cancer34,35,36,37,39,41–45,46–49, metastatic breast cancer50, overweight or obese women with 
breast cancer48 and elderly women with breast cancer35. The age criterion varied from 
being over 18 years old36,40,42–46,50,51, between 18 and 6540, 18 and 7547,49, 19 and 7045,  20 
and 5941, 30 and 7542, 40 and 7546, and, finally, 65 and 70 years old35.  

The women were between stages 0 and III of the disease36,37,47–49,51,38–45; some of 
them with metastasis or severe cancer35,50. One study did not show the disease stage of 
the participants46. 

Regarding treatment, some studies included women undergoing treatment, such 
as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or adjuvant therapies35–37,39,41,44,47,49; some who had 
completed adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy therapies40,43,48, in addition to a study 
in which the individuals received neoadjuvant therapy42; four studies included women 
scheduled to undergo chemotherapy38,45,46,51 and one study did not specify the treatment 
period of the female participants50.  

Considering the studies included, the oldest are the ones by Carayol et al47 and 
Schmidt et al38, in addition to other more recent investigations, that is, the ones by 
Andersen et al35, Boing et al36, Pudkasam et al37, Smith-Turchyn et al39, Foulkes et al46, 
and Meier-Girard et al50. The impact factor of the journals varied from 1.55240 to 
3.15045,46,51. Out of the 17 articles found, only twelve were mentioned in the Web of 
Science, with one36,38,41, two45,46,51, four42, five40, six43, seven44, eigth48 and twelve47 
citations until April 12, 2021.  

Regarding the locations where the studies were performed, nine of them were 
developed in Europe, that is, Spain40, Holland42, Denmark35, Italy48, United Kingdom49, 
France47, Germany51,38, and Switzerland50; three investigations were carried out in North 
America, more specifically in the United States44 and Canada45,39, one in South America, 
in Brazil36, two in Oceania, specifically in Australia37,46, and two in Asia, in China43 and 
Japan41.  

All the studies were registered on clinical trial registry platforms, that is, Clinical 
Trial35,36,50,52,38–40,42,44,45,47,48, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR)43, UMIN Clinical 
Trial Registry (UMIN-CTR)41, German Clinical Trials Register (GermanCTR)51 and  
Clinical Trials Registry from Australia and New Zealand37,46.  

Considering the studies selected, 15 had a control group35,36,48,49,51,39,41–47. The 
approaches of the control groups included usual and routine care35,36,39,42,43,45–47,49; general 
health advice and guidelines for reducing body weight48; in addition to the provision of a 
device to monitor physical activity and physical exercise practice41; active control 
(CoordiFit)50; guidance on physical exercises for postoperative recovery and breast 
cancer treatment44; supervised myofascial release training three times a week51, and 
guidelines for performing aerobic activity and taking at least 10,000 steps per day40.  

Among the studies selected, 2 of them had a comparison group37,38. The 
approaches of the comparison groups comprised immediate intervention group and a late 
intervention group, with self-directed physical activity37; a progressive endurance training 
program, and a supervised program in muscle relaxation training38.  

Physical activity and/or physical exercise interventions in study protocols vary 
from 
home walking49, walking and supervised exercises35,46, aerobic and 
strength/endurance exercises38,40,42,45, eurythmy and coordfit therapy50, Pilates and belly 
dance36; supervised exercises, exercises guided by applications and/or internet software 
and use of watches to monitor the activity39,41; internet software and Qigong43, self-
directed exercises37, rehabilitation exercises44, high-intensity interval training (HIIT)51, 
personalized exercises and a diet program47, besides motivational meetings, diet and the 
use of watches to monitor the activity48. 

The duration of the interventions ranged from 12 weeks35,38,40,41,43,49, 16 weeks36, 
20 weeks50, 24 weeks42,48, 12 to 24 weeks45, 12 to 18 weeks51, 26 weeks47 and 48 weeks39. 
A study was carried out in three phases, that is, 12 weeks, 14 weeks and 26 weeks46, and 
another one did not provide the duration of the intervention44. 

The frequency proposed for the interventions varied from 1 to 3 times a 
week35,36,51,38–40,42,43,45,46,50, 4 to 5 times a week47,49, 6 meetings divided into 6 months41,48, 
and two studies did not provide the frequency according to which the interventions 
occurred37,44. 

The duration of each intervention session ranged from 20 to 25 minutes51, 20 to 
40 minutes per session45, 30 minutes per session35,39,41,43,49, 30 to 45 minutes per session47, 
45 minutes per session50, 30 to 60 minutes46, 60 minutes per session36,38,40,48, 60 to 120 
minutes per session42. Two studies did not provide the session duration of the 
interventions37,46. 

The intensity of the interventions varied from light40, light to moderate35,50, 
moderate37–39,47,48, light to vigorous51, and moderate to high/vigorous42,45. Six studies did 
not show the intensity of the interventions36,41,43,44,46,49. 

The interventions were performed by Physical Education professionals or 
professionals who worked with physical exercise39,40,45,47, in addition to physiologists46, 
physiotherapists35,42–44, Physical Education professionals and/or physiotherapists36,38, 
clinical staff (doctor, physiotherapist, Physical Education professional, nurses)41,48, 
therapists or specialists in eurythmy50 or by the researcher himself49, one per 
application37. An article did not specify the professionals51.  

Interventions were carried out at universities38,42,45,46, hospitals35–37,43,47,51, at 
home41,49,50, at physiotherapy clinics and at home44; city hall exercise rooms40, research 
center,39 at home and in the presence of support groups48.  

Physical and psychological outcomes were assessed. All the study protocols 
proposed to evaluate the female participants in the baseline and post-intervention periods. 
Some studies included evaluations in the middle of the intervention, on the 6th week35, 
15th week47, 8th and on 14th weeks50, and on the 12th week37. Some investigations 
included follow-up assessments, that is,  24 weeks after the intervention35, 6 months after 
the intervention51, 6, 12 and 24 months after the intervention36, 24 and 36 weeks after the 
intervention41, 6 and 12 months after the intervention39,44, 12 and 18 months after the 
intervention47, 12 and 24 months after the intervention48, and 18 months after the 
intervention42. 

The physical outcomes assessed in the protocol studies are shown in Figure 2. 
More specifically, they included physical fitness36,38–43,45, physical function35,41,46, body 
composition35,40,47,48, total, regional and mineral bone body composition46, physical 
activity level36,41,44–48, functional status50, muscle strength36,39,46, flexibility36, 
inflammatory biomarkers35,51, hospitalization35, survival35, upper limb mobility40,44, arm, 
shoulder and hands function36,40,44, range of motion36, lymphedema36,40,44, pain44,50, work 
performance42, memory49, brain function45, executive function49, attention49, spatial 
visual skills49, cognitive function38,45,46,49,51, self-perceived cognitive performance51, food 
intake/diet46–48, health condition48, use of health services39, biological assessments41, 
neutrophic levels51, cardiac reserve46, cardiac structure and function46, central vascular 
stiffness46, blood pressure46, sedentary behavior46, side effects related to cancer51 and 
immune function37. 

Figure 3 shows the psychological variables evaluated, that is, quality of 
life35,36,45,46,48,50,37–44, welfare35, fatigue36,38,40–42,46,47,49,50, anxiety37,42,47,49,50, depression36–
38,40–42,47,49,50, stress37, mood46,49, self-esteem36,49, body image36, sexual function36, sleep 
quality36,41,50, suffering50, life satisfaction40, psychological health45 and fear of cancer 
recurrence41. 

In general, the study protocols were classified as having a ‘low’ risk of bias in most of 
the items assessed. Only one study had a ‘high’ risk of bias classification39, and there 
were two ‘unclear’ studies47,53  concerning the random sequence generation item. Five 
studies39,42,47–49 showed an ‘unclear’ classification with regard to the allocation sequence 
hiding.  Considering the participants and researchers’ masking, three studies42,48,49 were 
classified as having an ‘unclear’ classification. Twelve studies35,36,50,51,37,38,40,41,43–46 
showed a ‘low risk’ of bias in all items, which points to a more detailed methodological 
rigor. 

This scoping review aimed at identifying and characterizing the physical activity 
and/or exercise intervention study protocols for breast cancer treatment by highlighting 
the types, frequency, duration, intensity and timing of the therapeutic intervention with 
physical activity, in addition to showing the outcomes found. Seventeen protocol studies 
met the inclusion criteria adopted in this scoping review, which configured a group of 
randomized clinical trials registered on official platforms. Considering this universe, the 
evidence with regard to the risk of bias was adapted, since protocol studies do not show 
the results. The study protocols followed the standards of the SPIRIT checklist20; thus, 
after being assessed, such studies were shown to have a low risk of bias because they 
clearly showed a random sequence generation, allocation sequence hiding, the 
participants and researchers’ masking, as well as selective reports, which are in 
accordance with Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool34. 

The types of physical activity and/or physical exercises found in the study 
protocols included in this scoping review comprised aerobic exercises, endurance 
training, dance and Pilates, and exercises guided by applications and Internet software. 
This shows a wide range of modalities that have been investigated in the context of breast 
cancer. Thus, these study protocols provided a series of intervention options, which 
outlines possibilities and structure, in addition to providing a basis for further randomized 
clinical trials. Some studies have previously investigated some of these modalities, such 
as aerobic and endurance exercises, which have been shown to be viable and safe in the 
literature for women undergoing breast cancer treatment54,55. The results found in the 
randomized clinical trials by Paulo et al12, García-Soidán et al56, and Sweeney et al57, 
showed significant improvement in strength, flexibility, musculoskeletal improvement, 
body composition, reduction of side effects regarding breast cancer treatment, besides 
improving the quality of life and emotional level of these women after interventions with 
aerobic and endurance exercises. 

Regarding the interventions with walking, the study protocols have shown that it 
can be an effective training to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, physical performance, 
in addition to being a safe and beneficial intervention for women who have lymphedema 
due to breast cancer58,59. Walking also stands out for being an accessible physical activity 
with a low cost and that can be used as a means of dislocation60, which makes it an 
interesting option in low and middle income countries. The exercises provided by a High 
Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), in turn, are suggested in the study protocols by Tsuji 
et al41 and Oberste et al51. This new modality has also been addressed for breast cancer 
patients during chemotherapy with positive effects61. 

Two study protocols assessed in this scoping review included interventions 
through dance36,50. Others, such as the ones by Loo et al62 and Ho et al63 showed that 
dance practice enabled to achieve an increased physical activity in breast cancer 
survivors. The quality of life was also improved by increasing vigor and reducing 
problems associated with obesity, and reducing stress and pain in these women. 
Considering the interventions with Pilates, the study by Eyigor et al64 showed that such a 
method is a safe and effective exercise for breast cancer patients, since it enables the 
improvement of functional capacities, fatigue, quality of life and helps to reduce 
depression. According to the results shown in the study by Alpozgen et al65, Pilates also 
provided improvement in pain, muscle strength, besides being effective as a rehabilitation 
exercise for women with breast cancer. Thus, this method can be considered an alternative 
treatment for this public.  

Current modalities seen in the protocols, that is, exercises performed at home with 
interventions using electronics, such as watches to monitor physical activity, internet 
software and smartphone applications, have been encouraged for providing changes in 
living standards, especially considering the pandemic and relocation of professional 
activities for home-office. In other previously studies, such as that by Dong et al10, the 
findings of an intervention based on combined exercises of an internet software showed 
positive effects on muscle strength and quality of life in patients during breast cancer 
postoperative period. Galiano-Castillo et al66 indicated a physical exercise program that 
uses an Internet software, through which it was possible to improve and maintain the 
quality of life of breast cancer patients, as well as to reduce pain and fatigue, and improve 
muscle strength, which resulted in improved functionality related to daily activities. 
These strategies, such as the use of online tools and the fact that the interventions are 
carried out at home, can be adequate alternatives to assist both, researchers and 
participants, since they provide a larger network for a great number of participants. The 
current moment, with the recommendations for staying at home, has led us to increase the 
demand for digital tools, in addition to raising people’s awareness on how much these 
methods can be explored. It would not be possible to carry out the interventions without 
such tools. Problems related to the capability of some software, the lack of skills to use 
the applications, difficulties in accessing the Internet and a possible lack of interest by the 
participants are likely to be limitations. However, these strategies can work as a useful 
tool in changing behavior, besides facilitating and bringing the researchers and 
participants closer together67. 

It was also identified that the interventions were mainly proposed to work with 
moderate intensity exercises, which corroborates with Spence et al33 who recommended 
physical activity for breast cancer patients at least 150 minutes per week, as proposed in 
the randomized clinical trial studies by Ligibel et al68, Arem et al69 and Mijwel et al70. 
Lack of information regarding the intensity of the interventions was one of the limitations 
of some study protocols. These recommendations should be suggested by the researcher 
so that benefit is proven, in addition to facilitating subsequent implementation and 
performance of other intervention study protocols. 

The physical outcomes most found in the study protocols comprised the physical 
conditions and limitations of women with breast cancer, such as decreased function of the 
upper limb71, decreased range of motion and muscle strength19, and cardiovascular 
consequences72. In almost all studies, the limiting factors related to the disease were 
investigated, given that there is a concern with the return of these women to daily 
activities. Thus, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) test, the Sitting-
rising test in 30 seconds (30s - SRT) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) were the 
instruments most often used by the studies assessed. These instruments have a low cost 
and are fast to be applied. 

The consequences of the treatments considering the conditions or psychological 
health of the women undergoing treatment and during post-treatment of breast cancer can 
lead to problems of anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Thus, 
there is a great concern with quality. In view of this, several studies show quality of life 
as their main outcome, followed by depression and anxiety, which are possibly more often 
addressed due to the worrying factors related to the disease73. 

Regarding the instruments used, it is noteworthy that there is a wide range of 
possibilities, which makes later comparisons between studies difficult. Regarding quality 
of life, for example, which was shown to be the main outcome in most study protocols, 
the instruments used included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EuroQol Five-
dimensional Instrument (EQ-5D-5L), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy 
- Breast (FACT-B). All of them are validated and used in studies on cancer patients. The 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is one of the most used instruments to 
assess depression and anxiety.  

The study protocols showed different possibilities of intervention through 
physical activity and/or physical exercise; however, some have limitations due to the lack 
of information, such as intensity, frequency or timing of the sessions, which are necessary 
for a better use of these interventions. It should be highlighted that the first study protocol 
found in this scoping review dates from 2013, which shows that previous clinical trials 
did not have protocol publications, and that the practice of publishing study protocols is 
still expanding. Not all scientific journals accept this type of study, and some authors of 
randomized clinical trials choose not to publish their protocols. 

Considering the study protocols included in this scoping review, a range of 
interventions with different modalities of physical activity and/or physical exercise was 
found, that is, endurance training, aerobic exercises, dance, Pilates, HIIT, Qigong, and 
activities by using technologies, such as software and applications and/or watches to 
monitor physical activity. The frequency of interventions ranged from one to five times a 
week, lasting from 12 to 48 weeks, in a low-to-vigorous intensity. Regarding the disease 
stages, the study protocols mainly included stages between 0 and III. Considering the 
treatment period, the women were mainly undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy or 
other adjuvant therapies. Physical fitness, physical activity level, cognitive function and 
body composition were the main outcomes seen. Quality of life, fatigue, depression and 
anxiety were the psychological outcomes that stood out the most. 

Even considering this range of modalities, more study protocols are necessary so 
that research transparency is obtained, in addition to facilitating the reproducibility and 
understanding of interventions. These protocols, on the other hand, provide tools to assist 
in further research and contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge.  

The present study provides insight into the characteristics of study protocols with 
randomized clinical trials by showing which protocols might be more suitable for a given 
study, as well as which instruments are most used for obtaining physical and 
psychological outcomes. The survey carried out and shown in this scoping review will 
help further research that involves physical activity and/or physical exercise for women 
with breast cancer.
