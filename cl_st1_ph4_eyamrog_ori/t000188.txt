Purpose: We estimated the potential number of COVID-19 deaths for Brazil for the 
next months. 

Methods: The study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 deaths, 
from the first confirmed death on March 17 until May 15, 2020. These data were 
collected from an official Brazilian website of the Ministry of Health. The Boltzmann 
function was applied to a data simulation for each set of data regarding to all states of 
the country. 

Results: The model data were well-fitted, with R2 values close to 0.999. Up 
to May 15, 14,817 COVID-19 deaths were confirmed in the country. Amazonas has the 
highest rate of accumulated cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants (321.14), followed by Ceará 
(161.63). We estimated that Rio de Janeiro, Roraima, Amazonas, Pará, and Pernambuco 
will experience a substantial increase in the rate of cumulative cases until July 15. Mato 
Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina will show 
lower rates per 1,000,000 inhabitants. 

Conclusion: We estimate a substantial increase in 
the rate of cumulative cases in Brazil over the next months. The Boltzmann function 
proved to be a simple tool for epidemiological forecasting that can assist in the planning 
of measures to contain COVID-19. 

The world is facing a serious and acute public health emergency due to the 
spread of the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, known as COVID-19. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared on January 30, 2020, that the outbreak 
of the disease was characterized as a Public Health Emergency of International 
Importance, the highest alert level of the Organization, as provided for in the 
International Health Regulations, beginning to be considered, on March 11, 2020, as a 
pandemic.1 

Despite the restrictive social isolation measures imposed by health authorities 
around the world in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus and, consequently, reduce 
the number of patients who may need hospitalization and avoid overloading the health 
system and its collapse, the number of infected people continues to grow, as well as the 
number of deaths caused by the disease.  

According to the COVID-19 world map, presented in real time by the Johns 
Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center by the end of the evening of May 31, 2020, 
6,194,508 cases of the disease and 372,501 deaths were confirmed worldwide. At that 
date, the three countries with the highest number of confirmed cases were the United 
States (1,790,191), Brazil (514,849), and Russia (414,878). Those who lead the number 
of deaths were the United States (104,383), the United Kingdom (38,571), and Italy 
(33,415), with Brazil in the fourth position (29,314) until that time.2 

A study published by a group of researchers from the United Kingdom already 
predicted different scenarios of the pandemic in 202 countries, until the epidemiological 
week ending on April 26, 2020, when it proposed three possible models regarding 
mitigation strategies: (1) without any interventions’ mitigation, that is, without non-
pharmacological intervention, without social distance and others; (2) with social 
distance from the entire population; and (3) with improved social distance for the 
elderly. According to the adopted mitigation strategy, estimates for the total number of 
infected people in Brazil would be 187,799,806, 122,025,818, and 120,836,850 cases, 
respectively. As for the number of deaths from COVID-19, the respectively forecast 
was 1,152,283 for the first condition, 627,047 for the second, and 529,779 for the third 
condition. The mentioned report concluded that measures such as social isolation, 
school closures and services considered non-essential, among others, can save million 
lives.3 

In support of the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the Pan American Health 
Organization (PAHO) has developed a series of tools to assist governments in decision-
making regarding the tightening or loosening of measures, such as the technical guide 
“Considerations on adjustments to social distance measures and travel-related measures 
in the context of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic”. Another important tool is 
the “Epidemic Calculator”, which produces scenarios (and not predictions about the 
future) from values, data, and parameters (number of available beds, transmission 
speed, and social contact). The effectiveness of the model is directly related to the 
quality of the information used in the calculation.4 

Despite the availability of these tools, the low testing of suspected cases of 
COVID-19, combined with an upward curve of new deaths, generates an enormous 
underreporting of cases and, to a lesser extent, of deaths from the disease. Other factors, 
such as a still very high rate of contagion and the low adherence of the population to 
social isolation measures, have projected an extremely critical scenario for Brazil until 
the end of May. Three months after the first case confirmed by the Ministry of Health, 
and two months after the first announced death, Brazil surpassed the mark of more than 
one thousand daily deaths due to the coronavirus.5 The current lethality rate of the 
disease is 6.3%, being among the 10 highest in the world, and the mortality rate is 
currently 10.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.6 

When the growth of an event is exponential, the uncertainties also grow 
exponentially, as is the case with the COVID-19 pandemic. Several mathematical 
models built from the knowledge and data available can simulate different scenarios and 
identify trends. Even considering the possibility of a certain level of uncertainty, like 
any scientific result, the discoveries made from mathematical models are considered of 
paramount importance for the planning of public policies.7 A simpler model in terms of 
understanding and application, which has already been used in studies carried out in 
China, is Boltzmann's model.8-10 Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the 
total potential number of deaths by COVID-19 for Brazil in the next two months, using 
Boltzmann's function - based on regression analysis. 

This was an epidemiological study that used mathematical modeling and 
geoprocessing techniques. The spatial units of analysis were all twenty-seven states of 
Brazil, a country with continental dimensions and a territorial extension of 8,514,876 
km2. Its area corresponds to about 1.6% of the entire surface of the planet and occupies 
20.8% and 48% of the area of all of America and South America, respectively.11  

The study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 deaths, from the first 
confirmed death until May 15, 2020. COVID-19 was defined as a case with a positive 
result for viral nucleic acid testing in respiratory specimens or with a positive 
serological test. This data was collected from the official website6 that reports on the 
situation regarding COVID-19 in Brazil. The data for model development were updated 
on May 16, 2020. The rates of cumulative cases of disease per 1,000,000 inhabitants 
were calculated considering the number of COVID-19 deaths in each state divided by 
the population at risk based on the estimates for the states, according to the Brazilian 
Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística- 
IBGE).11 

Data were organized in Microsoft Excel (Windows version 2016, Microsoft 
Corporation; Redmond, WA, USA) and incorporated into Microcal Origin software 
version 6.0. The Boltzmann function8-10,12 was applied to the data simulation for each 
set of data regarding different geographical regions in the northeast of Brazil. We 
obtained the parameters of each function, with the potential total number of confirmed 
cases being directly given by the parameter A2. The Boltzmann function for future 
simulation is expressed as follows: <>, 
where C(x) is the cumulative number of confirmed cases after the first day x; A1, A2, 
x0, and dx are constants. X0 corresponds to the inflection point and indicates the date 
on which the daily cases will reach their maximum. After that date, there will be a 
downward trend in total daily cases; dx is the adjustment coefficient, indicating the 
degree of increase in y (number of COVID-19 deaths) as a function of the increase in x 
(days after the first case); A2 represents the estimated potential total number of deaths.16 
Data from parameter A2 was used to calculate the rate of cumulative COVID-19 deaths 
per 1,000,000 inhabitants. 

Density maps with inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation type were 
setup with the spread of the cumulative COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 habitants, 
using actual and modelled Boltzmann data. For this, we used the cartographic base of 
Brazil available in the IBGE electronic database and reported data on COVID-19.11 
Terra Datum model SIRGAS 2000 and the cartographic projection corresponding to the 
Mercator Transversal Universal system were used. The georeferenced data were 
incorporated into Quantum GIS (Open Source Geospatial Foundation, OSGeo, CHI, 
USA, Version 3.10.5). 

The first case of COVID-19 death in Brazil was documented in the state of São 
Paulo on March 17, 2020. From that date until May 15, 2020, 14,817 COVID-19 deaths 
were confirmed across the country. São Paulo is one of the states with the highest 
number of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 (4,501 deaths) and is the seventh among 
the states with the highest death rates (98.02) per 1,000,000 inhabitants (Figure 1). It is 
considered the epicenter of the disease in Brazil, followed by Rio de Janeiro, Ceará, 
Pernambuco, and Amazonas, which total almost 11,000 deaths.  

The state of Amazonas had the highest cumulative rate of COVID-19 deaths per 
1,000,000 inhabitants (321.14) during this period, followed by the states of Ceará 
(161.63), Pernambuco (144.50), Rio de Janeiro (141.21) and Pará (133.10). The lowest 
rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants were reported by the 
states of Mato Grosso do Sul (5.04), Minas Gerais (6.90), Mato Grosso (7.46) and Goiás 
(9.55). 

For Boltzmann data analysis, each region was well-fitted and all R2 values were 
close to 0.999 (from March 17 to May 15, 2020) (Table 1). The potential total numbers 
of COVID-19 deaths in Brazil for the next 60 days after May 15 were estimated and the 
results and are shown in Table 1. The potential number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths 
per 1,000,000 inhabitants until June 15, 2020 will be higher for Roraima (881.98), Rio 
de Janeiro (761.45), Amazonas (665.56) Pará (559.62) and Pernambuco (316.87), and 
lower for Mato Grosso do Sul (6.32), Minas Gerais (12.07), Paraná (12.18), Rio Grande 
do Sul (18.24) and Santa Catarina (19.86).  

For July 15, the total number of deaths predicted in the country will be 56,955. 
However, the total number of deaths according to model A2 may be of 64.262. This 
value can be higher or lower according to the standard deviation presented for each state 
(table 1). The potential number of cumulative cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants will be 
higher for Rio de Janeiro, Roraima, Amazonas, Pará, and Pernambuco, with 1586.02, 
1054.57, 697.91, 586.77 and 353.16, respectively. For the state of São Paulo, a rate of 
152.12 COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants is estimated. Mato Grosso do Sul, 
Paraná, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina will show lower death 
rates per 1,000,000 inhabitants (6.68, 12.32, 13.79, 18.90 and 30.24 respectively). The 
mapping of the country shows the all states with the potential of rates of cumulative 
COVID-19 deaths along June 15 (Figure 2), and July 15 (Figure 3), according the 
smoothing or intensification of colors. 

In this study, we provide an estimation of the rate of cumulative of COVID-19 
deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants in Brazil for the next two months, specifically for June 
15 and July 15, 2020, using the existing available data from March 17, 2020 to May 15, 
2020 and a mathematical model. 

We estimated that states located in the southeast and north regions will see a 
substantial increase in the rate of cumulative COVID-19 deaths up to 5.39, 13.36, and 
4.20 times in a month and 11.23, 15.97 and 4.41-fold increases until July 15, for Rio de 
Janeiro, Roraima and Pará, respectively. We also observed that the states of Amazonas 
(north region) and Pernambuco (northeast region) are in the potential period of 
stabilization of death cases  with a slight increase in the mortality rate (2.17 and 2.44, 
respectively), although it is predicted that these states will still be among the states with 
the highest death rate at the end of the period. States located in the midwest and south 
regions will show a more discreet increase in the modeling with the lowest potential 
cumulative case rates until the end of the estimated period. 

Death data caused by COVID-19 in territorial spaces is of paramount importance 
not only to assess the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection but also to indirectly determine 
the number of accumulated cases and, consequently, to assess the quality of the 
assistance provided, since prevention until the diagnosis and treatment of patients. 
These data also can contribute to the planning of strategic measures to contain the 
pathogen transmission cycle. 

Brazil has been presenting a series of failures that may be related to the high 
record of deaths by COVID-19 in its territory. The severity of the coranavirus pandemic 
in a nation depends to a great extent the promptness of government authorities to 
provide adequate support to diagnose the infection and treat the patients. The current 
situation shows that Brazil is among the countries carrying out the lower number tests 
for the diagnosis of coronavirus per million inhabitants, different from what is observed 
in other countries that have a mass testing strategy.13-15 

In addition, the results of tests performed with the real-time molecular test of the 
reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) still take more than 15 days to be released 
in many places of the country. This factor leads to underreporting of cases, excludes the 
diagnosis of asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms who do not seek health 
care or who cannot access health institutions, and delays the early diagnosis of cases 
with a higher risk of developing the severe form of COVID-19.13,16 

Social isolation measures and the use of masks adopted in several countries and 
recommended by local governments in Brazil were constantly contradicted by the 
central government, which speeches and attitudes minimize their importance as 
prevention measures.17,19 In the state with the highest death rate due to COVID-19 
(Amazonas), no city reached the minimum ideal adherence rate (70%) to social 
isolation.20  As many Brazilian cities have experienced low rates of social isolation in 
the world, the rate of transmission of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil is one of 
the highest.21 

In addition to the scope of prevention and diagnosis, it is worth mentioning that 
the prediction of deaths by COVID-19 is also useful in the hospital organization for the 
provision of care to individuals who evolve to the severe form of infection. A study 
carried out in Brazil showed that health regions with the highest averages in mortality 
from hypertension, neoplasms, diabetes, heart, and respiratory diseases are located in 
regions with scarcity of beds in intensive care units and mechanical ventilators.22 This 
leads to the understanding that an efficient planning on the distribution of assistance 
resources is necessary for an equitable confrontation of the epidemic by COVID-19 in 
Brazil. Otherwise, a breakdown in the health system can further aggravate the number 
of deaths in the country. 

Finally, our results suggest that the model used is adequate to analyze and 
predict cumulative cases of deaths caused by COVID-19, since all data sets were well 
adjusted to the Boltzmann function. Factors related to the host and its behavior, the 
pathogen's ability to survive, and environmental influences can also alter the analyzed 
estimate because the estimate of the model is based on the assumption that the general 
conditions are maintained. In addition, predicted deaths may be even greater when 
considering the possibility of underreporting. Despite this, the main advantage of the 
model used is that it only needs the cumulative number of confirmed cases or deaths, 
and this represents a quick method that can assist in the decision of measures to contain 
the pandemic by COVID-19.
