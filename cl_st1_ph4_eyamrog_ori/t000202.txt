This study is a partial advance of ongoing research whose main objective is the creation, 
contribution, and analysis of cultural indicators in the Ecuadorian university context. This work 
focuses specifically on providing a series of indicators on the equipment, use, and consumption of 
the TIC of students of the National University of Education of Ecuador (UNAE). The methodology 
used is the quantitative of descriptive-analytical order, based on the data collected in a survey 
applied on a population sample, made up of 438 students of the total universe between the different 
careers and cycles offered by the UNAE. The sample has a margin of 95% reliability and an error 
of 5%. The obtained results showed a high level of equipment, use, and consumption of the 
different technological devices. Also, this university population spends daily hours in academic 
and free time activities in cellphones, television, videos, and internet. 

The search for cultural indicators has a broad trajectory since the mid-twentieth century through 
the impulse given by international organizations and government institutions. In recent decades, 
the objective has been widely developed in several Latin American countries. However, Ecuador 
is one of the territorial entities that still lacks its own indicators, studies, and analysis of the cultural 
sector.  

In any case, there are two works made up to the present: the Latin American Survey of cultural 
habits and practices 2013, prepared by the Organization of Ibero-American States, based on the 
work of the Ibero-American Observatory of Culture (OIBC) with the collaboration of Latino 
Barómetro, that collects a sample about Ecuador; and the analysis of habits and cultural practices 
in the Machala canton 2014, capital of El Oro. 

From another analytical setting, there is an extensive bibliographic repertoire on cultural topics 
based on theoretical-methodological constructions and empirical research from the classical 
contributions of the Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birmingham and the Bourdieu's 
studies. While in the Latin American social sphere, the contributions of Canclini (2006) and Sunkel 
(2006) should be referenced, among others. 

In recent years, the interest in this object of study has been transferred to the university context 
with the studies of Ben (2006) and De Garay (2016), although their productions are still scarce. In 
any case, the great majority of these contributions focus on specific and particular aspects with 
different objects and approaches.  

Regarding territorial studies developed in university contexts, we need to highlight the significant 
contributions made in Mexico by Rosas (2002), also in Flores et al. (2009), Bañales (2014) and, 
to a lesser extent, studies that have been made on university population in Chile by Güell, Morales 
and Nuñez (2011); Colombia by Arango, Castañeda and Ramírez (2016); and Cuba by Gómez, 
Riverón, Griñan, León and Yarenis (2017) among others.  

In terms of their analysis topics, they address almost exclusively to the consumption of new 
technologies through the studies of Aguilar-Barceló and Ramírez-Angulo (2006); Hinojosa-
Córdova and Silva-Corpus (2008); Santamaría and Yurén (2010); Pini, Musanti, Kaufman and 
Amaré (2012); Osorio, Molero, Pérez and Mercader (2014); Fernández-Villa et al. (2015); 
Sanvicén and Molina (2015); Casillas, Ramírez and Ortega (2016); Gisbert and Esteve (2016); 
López (2016); Romero-Rodríguez and Aguaded (2016); Ruano, Congote and Torres (2016); 
Paspuel and Palacios (2018) and Rojas, Jiménez-Fernández and Rodríguez (2018). 

This line of research in the university field has not had an impact on the Ecuadorian scientific 
production until now; therefore, justifies this study as part of a larger project that aims to provide 
data on cultural habits and practices in the Ecuadorian university context. In addition, these 
indicators do not only outline the profile of the student but can also contribute to a process of 
integral formation and may also provide valuable information to the institution when making 
decisions in the design of its cultural offer as indicated by Hinojosa-Córdova and Silva-Corpus 
(2008) and Flores et al. (2009). 

This research is aimed to obtain indicators and evaluation of the main consumption, habits, and 
cultural practices of university students of the UNAE, this constitutes the main objectives of the 
research. Its theoretical foundation rests on the initial framework proposed by Canclini (2006) and 
Bigott (2007), although bearing in mind the socio-historical changes generated from the new forms 
and ways of consumption derived from the incorporation and development of new technologies. 
From this perspective, previous conceptualizations are necessary. In the first place, this process of 
appropriation and use of technological and cultural devices are not conceived from an economic 
perspective, but from the construction of meanings that can decipher social behaviors. On the other 
hand, a habit is understood as the frequent cultural behavior of some cultural activities, which 
should not necessarily be associated with the practice of such activities while the concept practice 
is used for specific sectors such as recorded music, video, television, radio, computer, and the 
Internet. 

Generally, we investigate to know different periods in order to estimate the frequency of the habit 
without this indicating its practice, as we have already mentioned. While a specific cultural activity 
carried out in a certain period, intensity, that is, how many times or how much time is dedicated 
to it, is conceived as a cultural practice.  

The methodology used is quantitative of descriptive-analytical order, based on the data collected 
in a survey applied on a population sample, made up of 438 students between the different careers 
and cycles offered by the UNAE.  

A proportional stratified sampling made the selection of the population of the undergraduate 
students of the five careers of the National University of Education corresponding to the period 
September-February 2018 with a margin of 95% reliability and a 5% error. 

The sample amounted to 438 students, and its selection responded to the distribution by gender in 
the total enrollment of the university, 63% female 37% male. The groups corresponded to the five 
undergraduate courses and the subgroups of the different cycles: Basic Education (six cycles), 
Intercultural Bilingual Education (six cycles), Initial Education (six cycles), Special Education 
(four cycles) and Education in Experimental Sciences (two cycles). Each degree presents a 
different amount of population; therefore, the selected sample responded to that characteristic. In 
Basic Education, 234 students were selected, in Initial Education 78, in Intercultural Bilingual 
Education 50, in Special Education 53 and Experimental Sciences 26. 

From the practical point of view, the methodological-technical considerations contemplated in the 
various surveys prepared by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport of Spain, the Ibero-
American Observatory of Culture and the Satellite Accounts of Culture have been studied and 
incorporated. The result of this process has been the design of a base instrument adapted and 
contextualized to the university scenario, which has been subjected to a pilot test procedure and 
continuous checking. 

The applied survey is structured in three general modules (students' identification data, cultural 
facilities and interest in cultural activities), and twelve sectorial modules (museums, art galleries, 
archives, arts and craft fairs, House of Culture, monuments, archaeological sites, reading and 
library, ballet or dance, opera and theater, concerts of classical and modern music, film and video, 
music, television, radio, computer and Internet, use of free time practices related to leisure and 
culture, and finally, a section dedicated to the cultural actions and programs deployed by UNAE 
and to the participation and interest of the student population. 

In the specific case of the essential aspects addressed in this work, it has been tried to detect the 
availability by the students of the supports and typologies related to the new technologies 
(computer, the Internet and cellular phones, etc.) as well as to probe their use, characteristics, 
frequency and intensity of temporary habit, motives, preferences and tastes, habit of the different 
modalities of acquisition, time allocated to those activities, etc. 

The data collection was carried out through a survey that contained 194 questions distributed in 
fifteen sections, referring to cultural habits and practices. The questions corresponding to ICT 
amounted to 39, which are distributed in all the sections. 

The survey was applied face-to-face and online, through the Google Forms platform and carried 
out in the computer labs of the University, with the assistance of the members of the research team. 
The reference period for collecting the information was carried out during February 2018. The 
intervention was carried out in cycles, and the students responded to the survey in an approximate 
time of 30 to 40 minutes. 

The different characteristics of the surveyed students are in direct consonance with the totality of 
the UNAE university population. From the point of view of territorial origin there is a 
predominance of the provinces of Azuay (56%) and Cañar (24%). While the rest of the seventeen 
provinces represented contribute with scarcely relevant indexes (Table 1). 

In terms of gender distribution, the presence of women stands out (63%) compared to men (37%). 
With respect to the age groups, the established classification shows that a little more than ¼ of the 
students have advanced ages related to the common age of the university students in 
correspondence to the cycles they attend. Thus, 71% are grouped between 18 and 22 years; 22% 
between the ages of 23 and 27; 5% between the ages of 28 and 32; 1.4% between 33 to 47 years 
old; and 1% has more than 38 years. 

The configuration of the marital status reflects a majority of single (90%) as opposed to married 
(6%), free union and separated 2% respectively. However, 13% of students have family 
responsibilities, 10% are parents of a child, 2% are parents of two children and 0.5% have three 
children. 

From ethnic self-recognition, 96% define themselves as mestizos, 2% indigenous, 1% montubio 
and 1% afro-Ecuadorians. 

In relation to the classes they attend, we must point out that 53% are enrolled in Basic General 
Education, 18% in Initial Education, 12% in Special Education, 11% in Intercultural Bilingual 
Education and 6% in Education. Experimental sciences. And since its distribution by semester 
cycles, 34% correspond to the first cycle, 20% to the second, 18% to the third, 10% to the fifth, 
and 9% respectively to the fourth and third cycle. 

It should also be noted that 75% of the students surveyed have scholarship grants awarded by the 
University itself and the Institute for the Promotion of Human Talent. Finally, 62% of the students 
analyzed are in a state of family dependence and 80% are in the most precarious quintiles (see 
Figure 1). 

The analysis of the data obtained is divided into two sections: one related to the technological 
equipment (see figure 2) available to students and a second on the use of them (see figure 3). 

The majority of tested students have Internet access (92%), although more than half of them do 
not have a mobile data plan (internet) and only 15.1% have this service, 9.4% women and 5.7% 
men. 

36.1% of university analyzed students have a desktop computer and 84.7% have a laptop. These 
data reflect that a significant percentage of students have both devices. 

24.9% Of these young people have digital book readers and 52.7% have digital music devices. 
With regard to the availability of specialized software supports, 30.1% have editing and video 
programs, followed by educational programs (26.5%). Both types of software are distributed in 
similar proportions between genres. In third place we find the game programs with 22.1%, with a 
differentiated distribution between males (23.3%) and females (13.9%). 

More than 3/4 of the university students have books in digital format (75.6%) and a little more 
than 1/4 (27.2%) of their own digital encyclopedias. 

Almost all of the analyzed student population has a cell phone (96%) and a high percentage has a 
smartphone (70%). With respect to the cost of acquiring smart telephony, it can be seen that it is 
females (14.4%) who make the biggest investment in these devices, between 200-299 dollars, 
compared to males (10.5%), which ranges from 100 to 199 dollars. Regarding the monthly cost in 
cellular telephony, the range of 0 to 19 dollars predominates, both in males (35.2%) and in females 
(25, 3%).  

63% Of the analyzed university students are press or magazine readers, distributed in 42% of 
women and 21% of men. The frequency of reading general information press, both paid and free 
on the Internet, is a daily 13%; 15% only on weekends; 19% at least once a week; 9% at least once 
a month; 4% at least once a quarter; 3% at least once a year; and 2% never or almost never. 

The frequency of reading sports press, both free and paid on the internet, is 10% daily; 8% only 
on weekends; 12% at least once a week; 10% at least once a month; 6% at least once a quarter; 
5% at least once a year; and 12% never or almost never.  

In contrast, the frequency of cultural magazine reading reaches a rate of 4% daily; 12% only on 
weekends; 16% at least once a week; 15% at least once a month; 7% at least once a quarter; 6% at 
least once a year; and 2% never or almost never (see figure 4). 

The way they obtain or acquire the press or magazine readings in the last month in free paper 
format, the information press (16%), the sports press (3%), cultural reviews (9%), other journals 
(6%). 

The press sections most read every day are those about culture (17%), science and technology 
(15%), TV critic (7%), music critic (5%), film critic (3%) and critics of art and exhibitions (2%). 
Regarding the disbursement made in the purchase of newspapers in the last year, 50% spent 
between 0 to 20 dollars; 8% between 21 to 30 dollars; 3% between 31 to 40 dollars; and 2% more 
than 51 dollars. While with regard to spending on magazines in the last year, 55% between 0 to 20 
dollars; 6% between 21 to 30 dollars; 2% between 31 to 40 dollars, 1% between 41 to 50 dollars. 

61% Of students usually listened to the radio, distributed among 37% females 23% of males. Of 
which 28% with a daily frequency; 26% at least once a week; and 7% at least once a month. 47% 
of the university students surveyed dedicate between one to two hours a day to listen to the radio 
from Monday to Friday; 8% between three to four hours a day; 4% between five to six hours a 
day; and 2% more than six hours a day.  
With regard to the most listened radio programs, the musical ones stand out (27%), news and 
information (12%), entertainment programs (8%), music concerts (6%), sports (3%) cultural 
programs (1 %) and gatherings (1%) (see Figure 5). 

72% Of the examined population tends to watch TV, 46% of women and 26% of men. With respect 
to the female gender, 21% do it with a daily frequency and 20% at least once a week. While it’s 
13% of men with a daily frequency and 10% at least once a week. The most used media to watch 
TV are television (80%), computers (14%), cell phones (5%) and tablets (1%). With regard to the 
time they spend watching TV every day from Monday to Friday, 54% spend from one to two 
hours; 14% between three to four hours; 3% between five to six hours; and 1% more than six 
hours. While on weekends, 36% spend between one and two hours; 27% between three and four 
hours; 6% between five and six hours; and 2% more than six hours (see Figure 6). 
In relation to the television offer, their preferences are movies (24%), series and novels (17%), 
sports (8%), entertainment programs (7%), news and information (5%), children's programs (4%), 
documentaries (4%) and music concert (1%). And as for how often you watch TV, 34% do it daily, 
30% at least once a week, 5% at least once a month and 2% never or almost never. 

21.7% Of university students tested devote between three and four hours a day to the use of the 
smartphone, 19.6% more than six hours and 16.9% between five and six. This time is distributed 
almost equally between academic activities (67.8%) and social networks (69.6%) (see Figure 6). 
Among the activities of leisure and free time made through the cell phone, we should highlight 
taking pictures or videos (92.9%) and listening to music (74.9%). While these rates are below 50% 
related to other activities such as viewing videos, in terms of television and radio, we can state that 
71.2% of the population watches television and 61% listens to the radio. However, those same 
activities carried out through the cell phone are rated below 10%. 

The majority of students (96.80%) connect to the internet daily. The activities of leisure and free 
time made through this media are reduced to viewing videos and listening to music. 86.3% 
consume videos, 50% through streaming service and 36.3% illegally on the internet. Regarding 
music, 85.2% make downloads for free over the Internet. And with respect to the acquisition of 
books, 58.2% do so through the Internet, distributed in free download (28.8%), download with 
payment (14.8%) and online shopping (14.6%). 

The use of the computer for study purposes, under a daily frequency, is the majority (91.1%) 
compared to daily use for other reasons (60%). While a lower percentage (35.4%) is at least once 
a week. 

47.3% of the university students analyzed acquired a computer in the last year, of which 34.5% 
did it for reasons of studies and 12.8% for other reasons. So, the purchase of this device is 
predominantly due to academic needs. 

Regarding leisure and free time activities carried out through the computer, watching videos 
(42.2%) and television (19.6%) stand out while the indexes of other activities, such as listening to 
music and radio, are below 5%. 

100% of university students tend to watch videos, 63% of women and 37% of men, with a daily 
frequency of 77%. As for its themes, they watch musicals (31%), series (23%), documentaries 
(15%) and educational programs (5%). Among the equipment used to watch them, the cell phone 
stands out (47%), the computer (42%) and the tablet (3%). The videos are mainly obtained from 
the internet illegally (50%), through streaming service (6%) and in video stores (5%). 

63% of the analyzed university students accessed a library online in the last quarter, 14% in the 
last year, 6% more than a year ago and 17% never or almost never. In terms of the number of times 
they access a library online, 47% do it from one to ten times; 19% between eleven and twenty 
times; 3% between twenty-one to thirty, 6% between forty-one to fifty. 

82% of university students use the technological resources of the UNAE library, 11% with a daily 
frequency; 42% at least once a week; 21% at least once a month; and 8% at least once a year. 
26% of university students access digital databases, 3% with a daily frequency; 9% at least once a 
week; 9% at least once a month; and 5% at least once a year.  

The student body of the National University of Education of Ecuador owns a very high 
technological equipment, led by the cell phone and followed by the internet and laptop. This 
ownership (acquisition) of the new technological devices seems not to be conditioned by the 
individual and family socioeconomic situations, since 82% of the university students are assigned 
to the most precarious social segments in family income (56% in quintile 1 and 26% in quintile 2). 
The new technological devices are the main information and communication tools of UNAE 
students and a common feature is the high number of hours devoted to the use of videos, internet, 
cellular and television, both daily and weekly. Likewise, there is a general balanced tendency 
among genders, as well as an almost proportional distribution in the use of these devices for 
academic tasks as well as social networks.
