Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to be associated with a strong 
thrombotic tendency, due to different mechanisms still unknown1, which may predispose to 
arterial and venous thrombosis1,2,3. However, risk estimates for these complications are still 
preliminary1. 

We report a case of an 89-year-old female patient admitted to the emergency room of 
a tertiary hospital with right hemiparesis, aphasia, and dysarthria. Cranial computed 
tomography (CT) (Figs. 1,2) and cranial CT angiography (Fig. 3) showed findings suggestive 
of acute ischemic stroke in the area of the left middle cerebral artery. The patient declared 
having flu-like symptoms for about two weeks, and chest CT findings were suggestive of viral 
infection (Fig. 4). The rapid test was performed, and the result was positive for SARS-CoV-2.
