Tumor marker (TM) requests are common in the clinical practice when screening for 
neoplasms. 

Objectives: To investigate, within a private health insurance, the ordering 
frequency and the costs related to inappropriate TM test orders. 

Methods: This study 
analyzed data regarding TM requests within a private health insurance between 2010 
and 2017. Patients included in this analysis were ≥ 50 years old, had available medical 
records, and had at least 1 TM tested within the study period. Tests were considered 
inappropriate when TMs were used in screening for neoplasms, ie, when there was no 
previous diagnosis. We evaluated data regarding age, sex, the ordering physician’s 
medical specialty, and test costs. 

Results: Between 2010 and 2017, 1112 TM tests 
were performed and increased from 52 to 262 per year. Our sample consisted mostly 
of women (69.5%) with a mean age of 59.4 (SD, 8.2) years. Most orders were 
inappropriate (87.8%) and represented 79.4% of all expenses with TM tests. 
Cardiology professionals were the medical specialty that requested the most TM tests 
(23.9%), followed by internal medicine specialists (22.7%) and gynecologists (19.2%). 

Conclusion: We observed a high percentage of inappropriate test orders in the study 
period, resulting in elevated costs. Studies of this nature deserve the attention of health 
care managers, and interventions should be performed in order to reduce the 
inappropriate use of TM tests in clinical practice. 

The technological advances of medicine in recent years are undeniable, 
especially regarding new diagnostic tests and laboratory prognoses. However, along 
with this development, new technologies have also brought substantial increases in 
financial costs to health care services, thus burdening patients and governments, 
particularly in countries with limited financial resources. The inappropriate use of new 
health care technologies has grown in many countries, and despite attempts by several 
publications and guidelines to standardize their use, impactful statistics are shown in 
the literature regarding the excessive use of these technologies.1 Beyond financial 
costs, other possible damages are associated with the inappropriate use of diagnostic 
tests, especially the risk of excessive diagnostic test requests and unnecessary 
treatments.2 The definition of inappropriate or unsuitable test is broad and can be 
interpreted in many ways. According to Zhi et al. (2013), an inappropriate test is one 
which is requested without a clear indication of a diagnostic hypothesis for a specific 
case.3 Additionally, an adequate clinical indication for testing should also consider 
sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value studies for the diseases it aims to diagnose; 
these are generally established by guidelines published by governments, institutes, or 
medical specialties such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force 
(USPSTF). However, unlike pharmaceutical clinical studies, studies on the sensitivity 
and specificity of diagnostic tests are not commonly found in the literature. 

In this context, tumor markers (TMs) have been frequently used in clinical 
practice as screening tests for people aged 50 years and older.4 TMs include various 
substances such as cell surface antigens, cytoplasmic proteins, enzymes, hormones, 
oncofetal antigens, receptors, and oncogenes and their products. According to Sharma 
(2009), the 3 most important characteristics of an ideal TM are high specificity for a 
certain type of tumor, reasonable lead-time over the clinical diagnosis, and high 
sensitivity to avoid false-positive results.5,6 Unfortunately, these characteristics are 
relatively hard to come by in clinical practice, which has led to a general 
recommendation of not ordering TM tests in routine screening procedures in 
asymptomatic patients.7-9 

Considering that the financial costs of health care services have grown 
significantly in recent years, optimizing expenses is important. Conversely, various 
studies have indicated a high percentage of inadequate orders for TM tests. In Greece, 
Ntaios et al. (2009) identified only 10% of correctly requested TM tests among 10921 
tests, notably cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigen 
19-9 (CA 19-9), cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), and neuron-specific enolase 
(NSE).10 

Studies evaluating the inadequate request of TM tests are scarce in Brazil. 
This study investigated, within a private health insurance, the ordering frequency and 
the costs related to inadequate orders of TM tests such as CA 125, carcinoembryonic 
antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3), cancer antigen 72-4 (CA 72-
4), and cancer antigen 27-29 (CA 27-29). 

This retrospective study was performed within a non-profit, private 
employer-sponsored health insurance. This health insurance is managed by a federal 
public institution located in Brasília, Federal District, Brazil. Its financial resources are 
mostly provided by the government, whereas a smaller fraction is funded by the users 
(approximately 20%). This health insurance covers an annual average of 5979 users, 
including current or retired employees and their dependents. 

The study population consisted of all the individuals who performed 
complementary blood tests through their health insurance plans between 2010 and 
2017. Only active employees (and not those retired or dependents) aged 50 years and 
older with accessible medical records were included. This age threshold was 
established in order to select patients who commonly undergo screening tests. The 
year 2012 was not analyzed due to data inconsistency, since there was a change in 
the management software that could result in possible methodological bias. 

The “inappropriate tests” variable was considered present when no previous 
neoplasm diagnosis had been performed and at least one of the following TMs were 
present on the medical records: CA 125, CEA, CA 15-3, CA 72-4, CA 19-9, and CA 
27-29; these were grouped under the “TM” variable. The criteria for this classification 
were established following recommendations by USPSTF11-13, The Royal Australian 
College of General Practitioners (RACGP)14, and the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO)15. 

Other variables analyzed in this study include age (completed years at the 
time of testing), sex (male/female), the ordering physician’s medical specialty, and 
information on costs (individual test costs and user co-participation) as informed by the 
insurance manager. Values in reais (Brazilian currency, R$) were converted to US 
dollars considering the exchange rate in February 2020 (US$ 1.00 = R$ 4.06). 

It is reasonable to consider that all cancer diagnoses were recorded, since 
any sick leave, notification, or even early retirement due to cancer are reported on the 
patients’ medical records. The medical records were reviewed by the study’s 
designated physician. 

All statistical analyses used SPSS v. 25.0. Descriptive statistics were used 
in measures of position (mean, median, and standard deviation), and the chi-square 
test, Fisher’s exact test, and binary logistic regression were performed as appropriate. 

The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Medical 
School of the University of Brasília (CAAE 88696318.9.0000.5558). 

Between 2010 and 2017, 1112 TM tests were ordered, and yearly orders 
increased from 52 to 262. Our sample consisted mostly of women (69.5%) with a mean 
age of 59.4 (SD, 8.2) years. 

The analysis of medical records showed that 12.2% (n = 136) of tests were 
appropriately ordered (that is, were ordered after cancer diagnosis) and 87.8% (n = 
976) were inappropriately ordered. 

Of 136 orders considered appropriate, 80.9% were for female patients, with 
a mean age of 60.4 (SD, 7.4) years. The odds of adequate test ordering were 
associated with patient age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% [confidence interval] CI: 1.03-
1.13) and female patients (OR = 8.37, 95%CI: 4.08-17.17) (X2(2) = 43.965; p < 0.001, 
Nagelkerke R2 = 0.273). 

A progressive increase was observed in absolute and per capita numbers 
of inappropriate test orders over the years, from 48 test orders in 2010 (mean of 8.7 
orders per 1000 registered users) to 227 orders in 2017, corresponding to 34.9 orders 
per 1000 registered users. 

The total costs of TM tests in the study period were US$ 156 452.60. Of 
these, US$ 124 222.91 (79.4%) were spent on inappropriate orders, which increased 
from US$ 3127.17 in 2010 to US$ 26 776.83 in 2017. The mean cost of inappropriate 
tests was US$ 16.81 (SD, US$ 15.58) for the patient and US$ 110.43 (SD, US$ 91.16) 
for the government. Between 2010 and 2017, the mean cost of inappropriate test 
orders was US$ 2.90 for every health insurance user (Table 1). 

Regarding the medical specialty of ordering physicians, most were 
cardiologists (23.9%), internal medicine specialists (22.7%), obstetricians and 
gynecologists (19.2%), and general practitioners (10.14%). Although clinical 
oncologists were ranked seventh on this list, with only 5.6% of all orders, they 
presented the most adequate test orders in comparison with other specialties, with a 
statistically significant association. Data on test orders by medical specialty are shown 
in Table 2. 

In this study, performed within a private health insurance, we observed a 
significant and progressive increase in the number of inappropriate TM test orders 
without the appropriate cancer diagnosis and in contrast with what is recommended by 
scientific societies. We observed a substantially high rate of inappropriate requests 
(85.2%), generating expenses that accounted for 79.4% of all expenses with TM tests. 

Brazilian studies on this field are scarce. However, a high frequency of 
inappropriate test requests was also observed in other countries. In Greece, 90% of 
TM test orders were inappropriate.10 In Modena, Italy, a study reported that 62% of 
patients admitted to an internal medicine unit were ordered at least one TM test.18 In 
Padua, less than 40% of 23 059 TM test orders within a university hospital were 
considered adequate.19 Another broad Italian study revealed an estimate of more than 
one request for biomarker testing for every 5 people, which did not correspond to the 
cancer prevalence in the country.20 In Turkey, inappropriate TM test orders were also 
impressive: around 90% of 1858 patients were ordered TM tests in benign conditions.21 
In Canada, studies showed that the rate of inappropriately ordered tests (not only TMs) 
could reach 20%, leading to unnecessary costs of the order of millions of dollars.1,22  

Regarding medical specialties, we observed that oncologists ordered a 
larger number of appropriate TM tests compared with other specialists. To the best of 
our knowledge, to date, no studies have investigated this relationship. Moss et al. 
(2008), evaluating the knowledge of medical professionals regarding the sensitivity and 
specificity of CA 125 for ovarian cancer, reported that 54% of general practitioners 
believed that this marker should not be restricted to disease monitoring, but 40% of 
these physicians were unable to identify the causes of false-positive results despite 
believing they were fit to request this type of test.23 In addition, a study by the same 
authors showed that general practitioners did not feel confident on how to manage 
patients with a raised CA 125, even in the presence of a normal ultrasound scan, thus 
referring these patients for secondary evaluations; this reflects an unfamiliarity of these 
physicians with the interpretation of TM results.24 Considering our results, test orders 
by oncologists may have had an enhanced sensitivity and consequent appropriateness 
since these, even when indicated for screening, were based on other diagnostic clues. 

Some studies have attempted to explain the reasons that lead physicians to 
request inappropriate tests, and these reasons include technical unfamiliarity, pressure 
by the patient and family members, financial gain, and fear of ethical and legal 
complaints.25,26 One study involving 1768 primary care physicians in the United States 
identified that one-third of them were unfamiliar and uncertain when requesting and 
interpreting laboratory results for diagnoses in primary care.27 It is well known that 
patients usually ask their doctors for tests and referrals to other specialties. Kravitz et 
al. (2003) reported that 1 in every 5 patients made this type of request.28 Moreover, the 
patient’s family influences half of all medical decisions.29 It seems that oncologists are 
less influenced by patients when it comes to requesting procedures and tests. 
Gogineni et al. (2015), studying the demands and requests of patients receiving 
anticancer treatment, showed that the physician complied with less than 1% of these 
demands or requests.30  

In this context, some studies have proposed strategies and interventions to 
reduce the number of inappropriately requested tests.25,26 Adopting clinical protocols 
to guide the medical conduct in order to reduce unnecessary or redundant diagnostic 
tests seems to generate savings of up to 57%.31 A study performed within a laboratory 
of a university hospital in Croatia showed that standardizing minimum intervals for 
performing tests could lead to a significant reduction (approximately 50%) in TM test 
orders, and consequently to a reduction in overall costs.32 Similarly, Torre et al. (2015) 
indicated that the number of adequately requested TMs increased from 31 to 78% once 
their utilization protocol was standardized.33 Educational programs directed at primary 
care physicians could lead to a reduction of up to 51% in performed tests (TMs or not), 
saving approximately US$ 60 000 per year.34 In Northern Ireland, researchers showed 
that 72% of TM tests were adequately requested, justifying these results by effective 
audit methods combined with the publication of guidelines.35 Physicians believe that 
evidence-based practice supported by the use of electronic medical records, structured 
care programs, and continuous quality monitoring and by the identification of barriers 
and facilitators of clinical practice guidelines are effective strategies to avoid the 
unnecessary use of tests.36 

Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, the fact that only 
one health insurance and not all its users were included in the sample, and the absence 
of information from year 2012. Grouping all TMs (CA 125, CEA, CA 15-3, CA 72-4, CA 
19-9, and CA 27-29) into one category precluded a more thorough analysis. 
Nevertheless, the strengths of this study include its large sample size, the period 
evaluated (7 years), and the quality of the medical records and performed tests, in 
addition to the fact that this is the first Brazilian study on this topic. 

In the present study, performed within a private health insurance over 7 
years, we observed a high frequency (87.8%) of inappropriate TM test orders. 
Oncologists were apparently the professionals with the best judgement for ordering 
these tests. Considering the perspective of a substantial increase in health care costs 
in the next years, especially in countries such as Brazil, initiatives that aim to reduce 
the use of unnecessary technologies/tests are of utmost importance. It is possible that 
audits, physician education programs, well-established protocols, and patient 
education may contribute to the correct use of these tumor biomarkers.
