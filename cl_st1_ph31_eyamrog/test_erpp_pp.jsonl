As part of an ongoing project treating the ferns and lycophytes from the region of Vi\u00e7osa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, we here present the taxonomic treatment of the early divergent lineages of the leptosporangiate ferns: the families Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae and Saccolomataceae. We have been sampling the remnant forest patches since 2012; we also fully reviewed the collection of herbarium VIC and other online collections: F, IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. In the region of Vi\u00e7osa, six taxa belonging to those families occur Dennstaedtia cicutaria and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Dennstaedtiaceae); Lindsaea lancea var. lancea, L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta var. stricta (Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma elegans (Saccolomataceae). Among these taxa, only L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest; the remaining are widespread in the Neotropics. We present keys, descriptions, illustrations, examined specimens, and comments. \nAt the end of the era in which the plant Classification Systems were mostly based on morphological data, Dennstaedtiaceae was considered a big family, comprehending three subfamilies (or tribes) and about 17 genera (Tryon & Tryon 1982, Kramer 1990). With the advent of molecular data, those subfamilies were raised to family-level, some families were created, and now the early-diverging leptosporangiate ferns are represented by Cystodiaceae (one genus), Dennstaedtiaceae with a stricter circumscription (11-12 genera), Lindsaeaceae (seven genera), Lonchitidaceae (one genus), Saccolomataceae (one or two genera), as well as the great Pteridaceae (+50 genera) (Smith et al. 2006, PPG I 2016, Shang et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2020). \nBrazil is represented by Dennstaedtiaceae with eight genera and 26 species, Lindsaeaceae with one genus and 34 spp., Lonchitidaceae with one genus and one sp., and Saccolomataceae with one genus and nine spp., leaving Pteridaceae apart (which is subject to another paper) (Kramer 1957, Pena et al. 2020, Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd & Pena 2020). In general, these plants present characters considered plesiomorphic that are typical of the early-diverging lineages of Polypodiales, such as solesnotelic rhizomes clothed with hairs or primitive scales, large, highly dissected leaves, the sori that are truly marginal and protected by inner and outer indusia, and trilete spores (Tryon & Tryon 1982, Kramer 1990, PPG I 2016, Schwartsburd et al. 2020). \nPteridium is spread all across the globe (except for Antarctic) and may be the one most important to mankind by if directly affects the local human populations: it behaves as a pioneer weed invading croplands; it spreads its underground rhizomes making it hard to be removed; it intoxicates the cattle and horses; and it also intoxicates humans, when ingested - some studies also pointed out the transmission of its toxins (the psilatoquinis) via cow milk (e.g., Tryon 1941, Evans 1976, Page 1976, Marrs et al. 2000, Martini-Santos et al. 2010, Oliveira et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2018). \nIn the State of Minas Gerais, Dennstaedtiaceae is represented by 14 species, Lindsaeaceae by 11 spp., and Saccolomataceae by three spp. (Pena et al. 2020 Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd & Pena 2020, Schwartsburd 2022). Here, we present the taxonomic treatment of these families for the region of Vi\u00e7osa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, as part of the ongoing project on the Fern Flora of this region with fascicles in preparation and others already published: Miranda & Schwartsburd (2016 - Salviniales), Rabelo & Schwartsburd (2016 - Schizaeales), and Gon\u00e7alves da Silva & Schwartsburd (2017 - Polypodiaceae). \nIn the region of Vi\u00e7osa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, the remaining forest patches are classified as Semi-Deciduous Seasonal Forest (IBGE 2012). The local elevation ranges from 600 to 900 m.a.s.l. (pers. obs.), and the annual temperatures range from 5\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C (INMET 2021). \nWe have been sampling the remnant forest patches since 2012. Specimens were collected and dried according to usual methods for fern collections (Windisch 1992) and then incorporated in herbarium VIC (acronyms following Thiers, continuously updated), with duplicates to be sent to other herbaria. We also fully reviewed the collection of herbarium VIC and collections of other herbaria online: F, IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. Although the classification system adopted for the previous fascicles was based on an adaptation of Kenrick & Crane (1997) and Smith et al. (2006), we here adopt the system of PPG I (2016). Morphological terms are according to Lellinger (2002). \nDennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and Saccolomataceae, presented a total of four genera and six species occurring in the region of Vi\u00e7osa. Four of those species have also infra-specific classifications, which were adopted here. The six taxa are: Dennstaedtia cicutaria (Sw.) T. Moore, and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Kaulf.) J.A. Thomson (Dennstaedtiaceae); Lindsaea lancea (L.) Bedd. var. lancea, L. quadrangularis Raddi subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta (Sw.) Dryand. var. stricta (Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma elegans Kaulf. Among them, only L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest; the remaining taxa are widespread in the Neotropics. Differently from the other studied families: Salviniaceae (Miranda & Schwartsburd 2016); Anemiaceae (Rabelo & Schwartsburd 2016); Polypodicaeae (Gon\u00e7alves da Silva & Schwartsburd 2017), we have not recollected half of the taxa involved in this paper, which were collected on the 1930s and never again. Probably, they went locally extinct due to forest fragmentation and disturbance. We have not recollected D. cicutaria, L. lancea var. lancea, nor L. quandrangularis subsp. quadrangularis. \nRhizomes generaly long-creeping, solenostelic or rarely dictyostelic or polycyclic, bearing hairs or rarely with primitive scales. Leaves monomorphic; stipes often with epipetiolar buds, usually with a omega-shaped vascular strand; laminae 2-5-pinnate, rarely less dissected; veins free or rarely anastomosing and then without included veinlets; indument formed by hairs or glandular hairs, or absent. Sori marginal or submarginal, linear or discrete, introrse or extrorse, protected by outer and\/or inner indusia or rarely not protected; spores tetrahedral and trilete, or reniform and monolete (Smith et al. 2006). \nThe family is cosmopolitan, composed of eleven genera and ca. 270 species (PPG I 2016, Shang et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2020). The clade containing Dennstaedtia, Leptolepia, Microlepia, and Oenotrichia still needs recircumscriptions, due to a polyphyletic Dennstaedtia (Schwartsburd et al. 2020). \nRhizomes short to long-creeping, glabrous or with catenate hairs. Leaves large, to 4 m long; laminae 2-4-pinnate; veins free; indument formed by catenate hairs, acicular hairs, or absent; sori marginal, discrete, at the tip of single veins; inner and outer indusia fused into purse- or cup-shaped or hemi-globose indusia (Smith et al. 2006). \nDennstaedtia is polyphyletic in current circumscription (Schwartsburd et al. 2020), with about 70 species. In Brazil occur six species (Schwartsburd & Pena 2020), but there are probably about eight to ten species (pers. obs.). \nPlants terrestrial. Rhizomes long-creeping, with brownish catenate hairs. Leaves 1-3.5 m long; stipes 0.5-2.5 m long, proximally brown, lighter brown above, with acicular hairs or glabrescent; laminae 0.5-2 m long, proximally 3-pinnate-pinnatifid to 4-pinnate; rachises light brown, pilose, with brownish catenate hairs, without proliferous buds; basal pinnae 25-100 cm \u00d7 12-35 cm, subequilateral; pinnules sessile, lanceolate to oblong, margins dentate; costae abaxially and adaxially pilose, with light brown to reddish catenate hairs; costules abaxially and adaxially pilose, with light brown to reddish catenate hairs; veins free,  abaxially and adaxially hirsute, with erect, light brown to reddish acicular hairs; laminar tissue between the veins abaxially and adaxially with catenate and acicular hairs; sori oblong or rounded, born at the tip of single veins, in sinuses of segments; indusia purse-shaped, commonly with acicular and catenate hairs. \nSpecimens examined: BRAZIL.

Mexia 4866 (IAN, F, U, UC, US, VIC, WTU); Escola Superior de Agricultura e Veterin\u00e1ria, I-1934, J.G. Kuhlmann s.n. (VIC-1309). \nDennstaedtia cicutaria is recognized by veins and laminar tissue between the veins densely with catenate and acicular hairs, indusia purse-shaped with acicular and catenate hairs.           \nRhizomes long-creeping, with setose hairs. Leaves large, to 4.5 m long; laminae 3-5-pinnate; veins free; indument formed by catenate hairs, acicular hairs, arachnoid hairs, and\/or minute gnarled hairs; sori marginal, linear, continuous along the laminar margins, born on comissural veins; inner indusia vestigial; outer indusia linear (Smith et al. 2006).  \nTwo species plus two species with hybrid origin are currently recognized (Thomson 2012, Zhou et al. 2014, Schwartsburd et al. 2018, 2020). In addition, a total of ca. 20 morpho-taxa are also recognized as infra-specific entities, such as subspecies, varieties, forms, or combinations of more than one rank (e.g., Tryon 1941, Page 1976, Thomson 2012, Schwartsburd et al. 2018). In Brazil, the following taxa are currently recognized: Pteridium caudatum (L.) Maxon, P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, P. esculentum subsp. campestre (Schrad.) Schwartsb. & J. Prado, P. esculentum subsp. gryphus Schwartsb., P. esculentum var. harpianum Schwartsb. & A. Ya\u00f1ez, and P. esculentum var. paedomorficum Schwartsb. & J. Prado (Schwartsburd 2020). The most common taxon in southeastern Brazil is P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, which invades crops and is toxic for cattle, horses, and human ingestion (Schwartsburd et al. 2018). \nPlants terrestrial, ticket-forming. Rhizomes long-creeping, with ciliform hairs. Leaves 1.5-4.5m long; stipes 0.75-2.5 m long, proximally dark brown, stramineous above, glabrous; laminae 0.75-2.5m m long, proximally 3-4-pinnate-pinnatifid; rachises stramineous, glabrous; basal pinnae 60-100 \u00d7 25-70cm, equilateral; pinnae and pinnules distally with free lobes between the segments; compound distal segments inequilateral, irregularly dissected, caudate at apex; simple distal segments linear, up to 3(-4) cm long; costae abaxially with reddish catenate hairs, adaxially glabrous; costules abaxially with reddish catenate hairs, adaxially glabrous; veins abaxially lanose, with lax, arachnoid hairs, adaxially glabrous; laminar tissue between the veins abaxially and adaxially glabrous; sori marginal, linear, along segment margins, born at the tip of multiple veins; inner indusia vestigial; outer indusia linear. \nSpecimens examined: BRAZIL.

The analysis discusses the way the meanings are constructed by these students and reflects on interpretation and meaning construction in accordance with new epistemological perspectives that have been postulated recently (Morin, 1998; Lankshear & Knobel, 2003). It, thus, considers the present needs of the multimodal and hypertextual communication approached in the multiliteracy studies (Cope & Kalantzis, 2000), and the university preparation for a critical and participative cultural and social practice (Castells, 1999).   \nThis article presents an investigation that is part of a broader exploratory research projecti that aims at knowing about the impact of digital language on Brazilian university students. The research is related to interpretation and epistemology, considering that it proposes 1) to investigate students' ability to make meaning in digital environments (Internet and movies) and 2) to observe their knowledge construction in these environments. For such intent, a series of qualitative investigations of ethnographic characteristics, has been designed for accomplishing systematic research of university classroom practices that could show the researcher (and her group of researchers) traces about Brazilian university students\u2019 learnings and familiarity with critical literacy, according to the new literacies and multiliteracies theories. The researcher of this investigation is also the article's author who expects that the article may generate discussion towards the adequacy or the necessary changes in university curriculum, considering that this research outcome complements the analysis of two other related investigations that have already been published.ii. \nThe investigation presented in this paper follows an exploratory and qualitative research orientation in accordance with research methodologies described by Andr\u00e9 (1995), a Brazilian methodologist who emphasizes the need for ethnographic perspective in the analysis of local studies about environments, participants and cultures. It is an exploratory investigation considering that it plans to allow the exploration of data that would not conventionally compose the same research corpus, in this case, chat-room users that would then be categorized as actors of earlier forms of social networking (letter-writing; book clubs; telephoning) and movie viewers that would be in the same category of computer game players, for instance, in an attempt to know the intertwining of a new assembly of practices and knowledge, epistemologically thinking. The investigation is also qualitative, considering that its analysis represents the researcher\u2019s theoretical reference, values and view of the world, conferring a qualitative dimension to the investigation itself, as claimed by Andr\u00e9.   \nThe investigation required that participants be chat-room users, planning to count on their perceptions about the elements (participants, nicknames, encounters, disruptions, treatments) and play of structures (committed \/ uncommitted relationships, entertaining \/ misleading \/ committed conversation, veiled \/ unveiled feelings, constructed \/ deconstructed \/ reconstructed narratives, plural identities) that build chat-room discourse. Thirty-four university-level students participated in the investigation: aged 21-25 years old, all of them coincidentally being female (it was not a requirement for being part of the investigated group). They were explained that the process consisted of seeing a movie, writing the description of their views on certain aspects of the film, and taking part of a collective interview. The option for the two research tools\u2013the written description and the collective interview\u2013lies in the fact that the former should provide written individual reports of the students\u2019 perspectives about the movie that they would be shown; the latter should clarify and complement information that could be necessary for data analysis. In the sequence, the participants were shown a movie and then described the aspects to which they were guided. The collective interview sought for more clarifications about some of the written descriptions that showed relevance to the research itself. The choice for adopting these research instruments is due to the concern that new knowledge\u2013such as the one that has been generated by digital language\u2013naturally raises new epistemological studies. In these studies, the research methodologies were expected to show congruence with the theories of the focused knowledge.  \nIt should be noted that the new literacies studies as well as researches on this theme are in a starting phase in Brazil, demanding a wide range of surveys and researches about a broad spectrum of issues related to the topic, different from other countries that may already count on available research and analysis of their literacy education. It should also be observed that despite using the theoretical reference that is shared by researchers in various countries, this investigation evidences its social and cultural construction, as one would probably expect. That means, it may show Brazilian characteristics in which participants (university students that are chat room users), environments and processes reveal their own social and cultural construction.   \nThe outcome shown in the present paper focuses on an epistemological concern: understanding the relationship between the network mind and the typographic mind  (Castells, 1999), considering that the interlocutors\u2019 perception may benefit from the enhancement that is likely to be promoted by their dealing with the internet. Castells notes a difference between the \u201ctypographic mind\u201d and the \u201cnetwork mind\u201d produced in different social and historic moments of societies, being the first the one that resembles the typographic-produced text, the result of a linear and conventional education, and the second the result of a non-linear and networklike reasoning and epistemology that is observed in the digital societies. This investigation, therefore, observes whether an \u201cability\u201d, which is developed with the aid of this new medium, is transferred to another environment that does not necessarily or apparently require mind networking. This proposal searches for expanding views on \u201cdigital epistemologies\u201d (Lankshear & Knobel, 2003) under the premise that the stability in the rules of the game as the norm represents conventional epistemology built on propositional knowledge of what already exists, which sounds inadequate to explain language and discourse in contemporary society, as it is adverted by the cited authors. They assert: Rethinking epistemology in a digital age might involve thinking of it as practices of knowing that reflect a range of strategies for assembling, editing, processing, receiving, sending, and working on information and data to transform diverse resources of \u2018digitalia\u2019 into \u2018things that work (Lankshear & Knobel, 2003, p. 173).  \nWith such concern in mind, this investigation is interested in describing university-level students\u2019 meaning making in terms of a \u2018performance epistemology\u2019, when the investigated are both chat-room users and movie viewers, verifying the interweaving of experiences between the two media. Lankshear & Knobel (2003) see the notion of \u2018performance epistemology\u2019 as central in an increasingly intensely digitized world considering that it is related to knowing how to proceed in the absence of existing models and exemplars (p. 173), or knowing how to proceed in a quest for new meanings, a practice that may permit breaking rules and innovating. Besides the cited authors, this preoccupation about a renovated epistemology is shared by several other researchers, as seen in Cope & Kalantzis\u2019s acknowledgement of the inadequacy of conventional knowledge for the practices and needs of a digital society: The role of pedagogy is to develop an epistemology of pluralism that provides access without people having to erase or leave behind different subjectivities. This has to be the basis of a new norm (2000, p. 18). The authors acknowledge that a new view of society is emerging, that a view of mind, meaning, and society converges on a language of awareness of the socioculturally and sociohistorically workings that go beyond fixed patterns or standardizations and adopt plural values and perspectives.  \nThe idea of pluralism is brought to the interpretation of data in this article under the premise that the new literacies studies allow and expect that knowledges that have conventionally and paradigmatically belonged to their proper and specific areas may now have a dialogical treatment in the analyses weaving. The theoretical frame in this article comes from critical literacy and digital epistemologies, both in the new literacies or multiliteracies studies, besides critical hermeneutics, in an attempt to go beyond a possible cultural imprinting that patterns or models the structures of people\u2019s cultural and social reading of their environments, as Morin (1998) critiques when alluding to conventional epistemologies. To this author, culture is imprinted when education provides each person with principles, rules and instruments of knowledge through language. Therefore, culture works on the spirit and mind, modeling their cognitive structures that co-produce knowledge. Understanding how culture and knowledge are constructed in the technologically influenced language of the digital societies gains relevance in the new literacies and multiliteracies studies, then.    \nThe critical literacies studies have evidenced the relevance of an education that is engaged in \u201csocial change, cultural diversity, economic equity, and political enfranchisement\u201d, as stated by Luke & Freebody (1997, p. 1), through \u201cthe technologies of writing and other modes of inscription\u201d. The authors acknowledge that literacy education has made a difference in people's lives. Yet, they advocate that the traditional teaching of reading and writing does not cope with the contemporary needs of the digital socities. In addition, the authors report that over the last decades there has been great interest among educators in critical literacy, although they have followed inadequate approaches in such a practice. This practice has shown itself to be connected to a traditional curricula as well as traditional educational approaches that would not favor the practice of a critical literacy, or critical literacies in the plural, considering the possibility of approaches and designs that respond to the local needs of educational projects. According to the perspective of critical education, the design of critical literacies projects should often address innovative proposals, such as cross-discipline ones, as a way to 1) respect the new ways of knowledge construction, as evidenced by researchers as Morin (1998; 2000), Lankshear & Knobel (2003) and 2) develop meaning making (Gee, 1997), a term that revisits the concept of reading and interpretation, reinforcing critique \u2013 according to which \u201cmeaning is not in the head, but in social practices; and that in acquiring social practices one gets 'deep' meanings 'free'\u201d (Gee 1997, p. 274) \u2013  as a requisite of the reader to make meaning (or interpret) of the texts and contexts (in their various modalities of communication) with which they interact. For critical literacies then, meaning making becomes a fundamental ability to be considered in the new educational assumptions.  \nIn this sense, the inclusion of movies for the purposes of meaning making seems to meet the objectives of a critical literacies project. The studies about images in academic research have received growing interest. Besides, images have undeniably had increasing participation in communication nowadays, thus acquiring high relevance in the language and discourse studies of schools and universities. The inclusion of movies in the critical literacies project allows the study and reading of images (meaning making) and, at the same time, allows the observation of the ways that this reading and knowledge are constructed (the epistemological focus of the study).   \nIn terms of image, French movie director Carriere (1995) asserts that cinema has provided the greatest contribution to images development and its respective theories considering that as an art-form the image of cinema has developed more than that of any other media. Carriere explains that the images evolved from sequential, static takes to a process that allowed editing, assembling and the juxtaposition of scenes. Later, he adds, still points of view began to be introduced into the film image to guarantee particular effects. The use of image effects evolved with the ever-growing availability of technical resources and became definitely independent or \u201cmature\u201d with the advent of video and computer-generated images. This assertion finds echoes in Manovich\u2019s studies (2001, p. xiv-xxxix) of Dziga Vertov\u2019s Man with a Movie Camera (1929) in which Manovich recognizes the revolutionary seeds of digital cinema in Vertov\u2019s avant-garde aesthetic strategies, since he claims: \u201cThe avant-garde strategy of collage reemerged as the \u2018cut-and-paste\u2019 command, the most basic operation one can perform on digital data. The idea of painting on film became embedded in paint functions of film-editing software. The avant-garde move to combine animation, printed texts, and live-action footage is repeated in the convergence of animation, title generation, paint, compositing, and editing systems into all-in-one packages\u201d.  \nManovich (2001, p. 9) then adds that computation \u201chas redefined existing cultural forms, as photography and cinema\u201d. As this author refers to cinema images, he emphasizes the role of special effects in the construction of the desired images by directors and producers. \u201cArranging physical reality to be filmed through the use of sets, models, art direction, cinematography, and so forth\u201d, Manovich explains (op. cit., p. 303), has been replaced by \u201cmaterial that is manipulated on a computer, where the real construction of a scene will take place\u201d. This author also affirms that there has been \u201ca shift from rearranging reality to rearranging its images\u201d (p. 303), which shows new ways of culture producing \/ knowledge generating and signals to new reflections in education.     \nVirillo's views on movie images (1994) corroborate the assertions developed by both Carriere and Manovich. Acknowledging the advent of technology as the responsible scaffold that has led to the paradigm shifts in the image-viewer interaction, Virillo uses the term logics when he describes the development of images. He identifies three logics in different socio-cultural periods in the Western history of man\u2019s relationships with labor. Men\u2019s imagination and the physical labor of their hands are embedded in the formal logic seen in the engravings, paintings and architecture of a period that ends in the 18th century. In the dialectic logic \u2013 stood by photography and cinema, arts that characterize the 19th century \u2013 the advent of industry, technology and machinery enables the production then, of devices that capture images, extending human capacity by means of the camera lens in a dialectical, and thus intervening relationship between humans and the environment. In our present computerized society, the logic of paradox is the prevailing one and is represented in video, holography and computer-generated images, inventions of the 20th century. The last term alludes to the possibility provided by technology to merge the time in which the image is produced into the time that it is presented, destabilizing the certainties of \u2018real time\u2019 and \u2018real space\u2019 developed by the dialectic logic.  \nAlthough the way that Virillo describes his notions of logics may be seen as conventional classificatory knowledge, his perspective opportunizes expanding views about images within the epistemological perspective that is inherent in the socio-cultural development of images, which relates to hermeneutic studies as well. In Virillo's first notion of logics, engravings, paintings and architecture as artifacts required contemplation and elicited message or meaning decoding. In hermeneutic studies, to decode embedded a concept of interpretation in the early accounts of what to interpret signified, as Ricoeur (1977) explains. In dialectic logic, photography and video film disseminated the idea of factual evidence. Television and the printed press in their beginning stages used images as proof of the time and space of the reported occurrence. As television developed, it enhanced the credibility of the evidence that was desired to be conveyed by first diminishing the distance between image-capturing and image-releasing and later extinguishing this distance in live news reporting. The notion of evidence consolidated the principle of \u2018seeing is believing\u2019 that apparently dispensed interpretation. The meaning \u2013 of what was \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d \u2013 seemed to be anticipated by the spectator, considering that it followed a course of reasoning that would end up with the certainty about what was seen, raising recognition before the facts or identification with the narratives. In the logic of paradox of digital communication, however, image and discourse allow and require an active role in communication. Their interlocutor may as well be the fl\u00e2neur that Manovich (2001) sees in an analogy to the present-day computer navigator, who is user and co-producer of his own discourse. The anonymous observer, as this author states, records and erases faces and figures of passersby as he meets a passing woman that raises more interest to his engaging in a virtual affair, until he meets the next interesting female passerby. It is an allusion to the navigators' hypertext interactions in which they build their reading path according to their own interest. This apparent behavior of unfaithfulness, discontinuity, uncontrollability \u2013 attributes that would more likely match the parameters of, for instance, the dialectic logic user \u2013 actually characterizes the interaction of the navigator in the digital communication and environment, in which he makes choices and changes, intervenes and creates, for the sake of his participating and surviving in this new \u201cmilieu\u201d or way of life, though in a society that is built differently from the one of the fl\u00e2neur described by Manovich.  \nAs for the hermeneutic perspective in meaning making, the hermeneutics theorized by Ricoeur (1977) provides the basis for the investigation analysis. Ricoeur identifies two major tendencies in the interpretations that permeate social discourse, and proposes a critical revision of the two tendencies that compose a socio-cultural interpretive cycle. The first tendency reflects the influence of religious values learned from biblical exegesis in which the interpretation of biblical passages was based on notions of analogy, allegory and symbolic meaning, which would connect the teachings of the sacred texts to everyday life. To Ricoeur, this interpretive practice went beyond the domain of religion, reaching other fields such as the reading of literature and even social living. The second tendency refers to the influence of traditions. The author observes that the hermeneutic practice based on the preservation of traditions from generation to generation has promoted effective teaching about the way that social occurrences, behaviors, thoughts, and discourses should be interpreted, creating interpretive patterns in society and helping to preserve values, morals, beliefs, and guide [as well as curb] social discourse and interpretation. Ricoeur sees limitations in both interpretive tendencies and explains that they confer authority to the writer of the text, as in religious influence, and do not consider the dynamic dialectics inherent in social living and discourse, as in traditional and fixed interpretive patterns, neglecting the reader, the locus of enunciation, besides social and cultural changes. Ricouer, thus, proposes that a hermeneutics of suspicion may be more congruent with the exercise of interpretation, considering that it allows the interlocutors to question the meanings that are given by religious-oriented or tradition-oriented interpretive practices, and to build up their own contextualized and situated meanings. This is a practice that has been identified as critical hermeneutics by academics due to the possibility that it raises for desconstructing and reconstructing meanings, a premise that is undertaken in the critical literacies projects. The above theoretical assumptions \u2013 critical literacies, the studies about images and meaning making \u2013 constitute the thread of analysis in the focused investigation.   \nThe phenomenon of online relationships through the use of chat- rooms and online dating\u2013besides chat-rooms and chat lists with other characteristics\u2013has been widely studied in its various aspects as discourse, narrative construction, psychological effects, cultural and social meanings. In Brazil a doctorate research project developed by Castro (2006) focuses on this type of chat-room for analyzing women\u2019s narrative building in virtual relationships. The study identifies that this alternative choice of meeting people and making conversation virtually enables the emergence of \u201con-line personae\u201d that search for virtual company and that allow themselves freedom of speech, imagination and narrative construction. The researcher uses the concept of performativity and states that it explains the female identity within the perspective of displacement, in which women allow leaving their own places \/ suspending their own identities (or loci of identity) for a while and wear any masks they wish in a way to interact with their virtual relationships, and by doing so, they construct their performative narratives. In this performance they play an identity of their own choice or creation to participate in the chat-rooms. In the environment of virtual intimacy, where the social masks are significantly reduced if compared to face-to-face communication, the on-line personae assume uncommitted and circumstantial existence, having freedom to act without the concerns and the expected sanctions of other conventional situations, as Castro depicts. Thus, the mental representations (or virtual images) in their narratives may be created infinitely. As can be observed, the participation in virtual dating involves a few elements of the following: participants\u2019 initiative (search for virtual company, for instance) and certain rules for participation, such as the use of a nickname (to hide or \u2018mask\u2019 their identities, under which they \u201csuspend their own identities for a while and wear any masks they wish\u201d, and build up their performative narratives, as stated by Castro).  \nFor the investigation about the movie viewers\u2019 meaning making, the selected film was Eyes Wide Shut (Stanley Kubrik, 2003), that focuses on the relationship of a couple. The movie narrative shows a long-standing, apparently successful relationship between a couple. Nevertheless, both spouses somewhat experience situations of relationships with other partners: Alice describes a fantasy she has but, mainly, Bill looks for a \u201csecret community\u201d (or a club) about which he becomes curious to know, thus, showing characteristics often found in chat-room users. Bill\u2019s experience, for instance, requires initiative, and the need of a password to integrate a \u201csecret community\u201d (or a club), literally wearing a mask and a disguise, a condition with which all the participants of that secret community must agree so that nobody could ever be identified. Besides, whatever happened inside that place (uncommitted, immediate, circumstantial, ephemerous relationships, freedom to act without the concerns and the expected sanctions of other conventional situations, as online relationships are portrayed) should not be seen or known by people that did not belong to the community itself. Both participations\u2013in the secret community that is visually represented in the movie and in the chat-room that is mentally \/ virtually represented in chat-room users\u2019 narratives\u2013describe similar rituals of relationships, however in their specific contexts of discourse. In this sense, an interest was raised in observing chat-room users making meaning to a movie in which they [chat-room users] could find some familiarity with the narratives that online relationships allow building. \nFrom an epistemological perspective, the survey had an interest in investigating students\u2019 ability to transfer the perceptions they develop in the relationship with the modality of a text (\u2018online dating\u2019\/\u2019virtual relationships\u2019 in chat-rooms) to another modality (movies). That is, by promoting an interpretative activity through the use of a movie, the survey expected to see 1) the meanings made by the students for the movie plot; 2) meaning making in terms of a \u2018performance epistemology\u2019, being investigated both the chat-room users and movie viewers, verifying the interweaving of practices between the two media. The question related to meaning making in terms of a \u2018performance epistemology\u2019 conveyed the expectation of perceiving the meanings that are made by students when they meet themselves before a text that does not show linear sequence, or clear evidence of facts or scenes, requiring from them that some meanings be made \u201cin the absence of a model or exemplar\u201d (Lankshear & Knobel, 2003, p 173), expressing some traces of a practice of assemblage of elements (as in \u2018bricolage\u2019), of transferring materials (or knowledge) from one context to another (such as in \u2018colage\u2019), or of disseminating borrowings in a new setting (as in \u2018montage\u2019). These mental processes of creation have been observed in young people's creations as they communicate and interact on the Internet, by creating their specific multimodal communication (adding color to the fonts, emoticons, sound and image, for instance), by making short movies for the YouTube site, and by having active participation in the production of the discourse of their communities or societies. The present investigation counted on such premises in its design, data collecting and analysis.  \nThe investigation shows that students\u2019 interpretations of the movie converge on the storyboard that could be found in IMDb.comiii. They evidence a couple\u2019s relationship that is likely to be worn and its consequences, which can be summarized in the following sequence: Alice\u2019s revealing that she had felt attracted to another man; Bill\u2019s feeling bewildered by his wife\u2019s revelation; Bill\u2019s going to a kind of a private club, the surprising scenes that he happens to see (as well as the viewers) and the appalling experience that he has inside that club; Bill and Alice\u2019s making up at the end. Other investigations about how students make meanings in Brazilian universities (see final note 3) have already shown the interpretive tendency that is identified in hermeneutics as \u2018preservation of cultural traditions\u2019, understood (and critiqued) as a conventional strand in the interpretative practices by Ricoeur (1977). As already presented in this article, the traditional-oriented interpretive practice supports, among others, a dualistic view of society,  in which one may distinguish good from evil, true from untrue and other binarisms. This view would underlie a social learning in which standards or patterns should be apprehended or cultivated. For the students who responded to the request, the movie mainly focuses on the troubled waters that couples may find themselves in; however, the plot soothes the spectators by bringing the conflicts into a happy ending. Some of their most frequent depictions veil the maxim \u2018real love overcomes the downfalls of a relationship\u2019 in which one of the readings may be that \u2018the institution of marriage\u2019 should be preserved and love may represent an ancillary idea towards it.  \nStill, in this part in which the investigated are expected to describe the meaning that they construed for Eyes Wide Shut, there is much reference to the rituals and experiences visualized in the fictional private club created by Kubrick. Nevertheless, the meanings are expressed through qualifications, being \u2018shocking\u2019, \u2018threatening\u2019 and \u2018confusing\u2019 the most frequent ones that portray the \u201csecret community\u201d that the character Bill once visits, conveying a certain difficulty that the students may have had to integrate the out-of- standards private club scenes into their narration of a couple\u2019s standard relationship. Thus, the first finding in the investigation indicates that students practice a tradition-oriented hermeneutics highlighting the traditional values of a couple's relationship and rejecting the socially unacceptable ones, as the learnings of the traditional hermeneutics would lead one to interpret. \nMore meaning making can be observed in another session of the investigation, the one in which the investigated students are asked about the connection between the virtual relationships in chat-rooms and in the movie. Their response reveals that a hundred percent of the investigated students see no connection between online relationships in chat-room communication and the relationships plotted in the movie directed by Kubrick. They express being surprised and intrigued with the question in some of their written comments: Should there be any relation between the two situations? writes one of the viewers; No, the chat-room narratives are more natural and real, they are constructed on-line in accordance with the ideas and interests of the users, whereas the movie narratives are built in a film script before the movie, and are fictional, defines one more surveyed student, showing her understanding and beliefs about the fictional\/non-fictional aspect of narratives on the internet and on the movie screen. It should be recalled that within an exploratory purpose the interest in this question relates to the observation of the practice of transferring materials [or knowledge] from one context to another or using borrowings in a new setting, as expected in a performance epistemology, although the connection may sound unusual. Another finding is registered in this focus of analysis: the ability the students have to make meaning within a certain context or environment is not naturally or spontaneously transferred to another modality of communication, as observed in the chatroom and movie ones, and it would require stimulated practice as the subsequent description suggests.  \nIn a later collective interview that had been planned for data expansion or clarification, the intrigued students wondered about the \u2018connection between online relationships and the couple\u2019s relationship in the movie\u2019 that they had been asked about. They were explained the possibility that the students would associate the virtual relationships in chat-rooms with the fictional-but-representative relationships in Eyes Wide Shut due to the fact that both types count on similar elements: the participants\u2019 initiatives, a reserved place (online chat-room or a private club) that requires a password or a nickname to be in, displacement of identities, masks, some level of permissiveness. Most of the students, then, found the comparison coherent, though added that it would be very hard to come to this perception on their own, and some claimed they would need more time to think about the comparison and demonstrated indecision about the presented possibility of interpretation. \nIn this session, they added that although they had achieved identification of the movie content with social situations of their own knowledge, they felt surprised (as some described) or shocked (as most stated) with the images that portrayed the relationships inside the private club shown in Eyes Wide Shut. When interrogated about the analogy between the environments in chat-rooms and in the club visualized in the movie, they agreed that some chat-room narratives, if turned into visual representations, could be visualized as some of the scenes shown in the club, or scenes that show one\u2019s search for a mate\/another mate. Nevertheless, their most shared comment was \u201cI would never take part in a club like that\u201d. They explained that in spite of the connection between the two exposed situations [chat-rooms and the club in Eyes Wide Shut], mental representations of relationships in chat-rooms are private and bring no constraint or restriction to the user. One student added that she would never tell her partner about her chat-room experiences if he did not belong in the same environment. She referred to the film character Bill\u2019s feeling insecure about his wife\u2019s revelation of a fantasy, explaining her belief that people who do not practice the language\/discourse of a certain community may find it hard to understand its communication and conventions.  \nAccording to the critical literacies studies, meaning making involves interference, making choices and changes, breaking down pre-established meanings and creating others, initiatives that would allow the interpreter to transfer the virtual or non-virtual images from one environment to another and a play with the conventions of \u201creal time\u201d. However, it was observed from the viewers\u2019 responses that before the movie screen that shows a narrative that is conventionally thought to be \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201cfinished\u201d by the spectator, the interlocutor that allows intervention in digital communication does not necessarily transfer the logic learned and developed in that environment to the relationship with the image-language of the movie. The relationships seem to be built in accordance with what is conventionalized and \u201cdictated\u201d by the modalities of environments. Thus, if on the one hand this session outcome may seem disappointing, on the other it may provide indications for the design of future changes in university curricula (considering digital epistemologies), which is one of the aims of the ongoing research.   \nA reading that can be reached from this analysis, which nevertheless should still be further expanded, is that the students\u2019 response may reflect an education that is inadequate in face of the necessities of a network society, as Castells (1999) describes our present-day society. The contemporary society individuals, citizens, workers, livers are no longer required to limit themselves to a \u201ctypographic mind\u201d, and should, additionally, have a \u201cnetwork mind\u201d developed; that is to say, they are supposed to transfer learnings, to make connections between discourses, to make new meanings of images and image-language whenever needed, and to review communication conventions and relationships.  \nThe findings of the investigation data indicate that conventional standard epistemology predominates in this university group, and that the network mind within a digital epistemology notion is still more frequently seen in the net environment where digital language is evident. Likewise, in the reading of movies and image there has been a predominance of the conventional interpretative process that is defined by Ricoeur (1977) as a traditional hermeneutic strand considering that it strengthens the apprehension of a given meaning rather than on meaning making by the interlocutor.  As for the image perceptions by the viewer, the medium or the modality seems to dictate the expected relationships allowing no or very few traces of networking (Castells, 1999) among different environments. In face of the investigation outcome, in this article it is claimed that due to the new technological influences, the images demand a new way of being understood, that network interaction \u2013 in the logic of paradox described by Virillo (1994) \u2013 should still be broadly promoted so that more practice about the transfer of reasonings may occur across discourses in their various modalities and contexts, as expected from the participants of a network society. It, therefore, leads to the need for changes in education in regard to what concerns literacies. \nThe epistemological studies have emphasized that the standard conventional \u201cmodels\u201d of knowledge construction, based on dividing the whole into as many parcels as necessary so that it becomes possible to be studied and understood and on organizing reasoning in terms of degrees of pre-established complexity (from easy to difficult), may not be adequate or sufficient for reason in the contemporary society, as defended by Morin (2000).  Similarly, Lankshear & Snyder (2000, p. 39) call attention to the necessity of enhancing awareness in relation to technology and education. They remark that the rapid changes which everyone may witness in our societies, which asks people to re-imagine and re-invent themselves in their institutions, concomitantly ask for new ways of thinking, coming to terms with re-imagined and re-invented forms of literacy, subject matter and learning.   \nMuch more about digital language and the knower of the digitized society may be learned for the purposes of understanding and making adequate choices about which literacies should be designed, planned or promoted to reflect the undeniable new needs of the vastly described new societies. Finally, this investigation signals what should be enhanced to meet the purposes of the critical literacies that are expected to be practiced in  the surveyed environment. "}

In spite of its current limitations, massive investment in the technology from leading AI enterprises and the world\u2019s ever growing demand for productivity are expected to increase the adoption of the technology to a point where its use is not going to be an option. This study aims to developing a better understanding about the influence AI-powered tools might have on texts composed by Brazilian Applied Linguistics English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP) authors of a Higher Education institution's graduate programme via a corpus-based approach known as Multi-Dimensional Analysis (MDA) (BERBER SARDINHA, 2000, p. 100) over a period of three terms (from the second term of 2023 to the second term of 2024). Its insights are considered to be critical for designing strategies for better preparing Brazilian ERPP researchers and students for the highly demanding requirements of mainstream English-only journals and fostering their participation in the global research community. Exploring data visualisation technologies, the research project is going to create computer-generated visual representations of its outcomes in order to enable the assessment of complex relationships between variables and also to streamline the interchange of research data. A preliminary plan aimed to complete the research project before the end of the first term of 2025 is proposed.\nThe adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has recently reached a new level with the release of large language models capable of assisting humans with content creation.\nConsidering the research question \u2018What is the relevance of the use of AI-powered tools for Brazilian Applied Linguistics English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP) authors?\u2019, the present study aims to employ a Corpus Linguistics approach known as Multi-Dimensional Analysis (MDA) (BERBER SARDINHA, 2000, p. 100) in the context of a group of Brazilian Applied Linguistics ERPP writers in a Higher Education institution's graduate programme.\nThe insights produced by this proposed research project are considered to be essential for enhancing the participation of Brazilian scholars in the global research community especially in Humanities. Furthermore, they could also be a key asset to inform new pedagogical approaches for better preparing students of ERPP for the highly demanding requirements of the mainstream English-only journals.\nThe project is going to contribute to the development of innovative initiatives for AI-driven data visualisation within the scope of the CNPq\u2019s institutional project \u2018Intelig\u00eancia artificial na pesquisa em linguagem e discurso: Galerias multimodais e multidimensionais de visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019 seeking to explore computer-generated visual representations of data. It will also add to the creation of data visualisation galleries as specified in the aforementioned institutional project.\nIn the next section, the theoretical basis is going to be outlined.\nDespite the continuing advance of the English Language (EL) as lingua franca in a multitude of contexts of the human activity, off-network English as an International Language (EIL) scholars continue to be strikingly disadvantaged in the competition for publication in mainstream English-only journals (BELCHER, 2007), which stifles their participation in the global research community.\nBelcher (2007) questions to which degree the rules of the Anglosaxon publication system are responsible for this monocultural trend. In her study, Belcher (2007) argues that EIL academics who eventually have their papers published have to undergo a cumbersome process of revision and resubmission in a \"story of reviewer patience and author persistence\".\nIn a piece of research dedicated to study how multilingual Brazilian writers reacted to the demands to comply with the mainstream linguistic and cultural conventions, Monteiro and Hirano (2020) reported that \"scholars from the [H]umanities and [S]ocial [S]ciences publish substantially less in international journals, reporting challenges particularly with language\".\nIn that respect, the recent emergence of AI-powered large language models, such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, represents an opportunity to users of English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP) for their academic production. Despite its currently known limitations, \u201c[g]enerative AI tools can produce a wide variety of credible writing in seconds, then respond to criticism to make the writing more fit for purpose.\u201d (WHAT IS CHATGPT, DALL-E, AND GENERATIVE AI? | MCKINSEY, 2023).\nJudging by the massive investment the development of the technology has been receiving from leading AI enterprises and as its use becomes widespread, it can be assumed that those AI-based tools will soon become reliable enough to influence a large volume and variety of text genres produced in human activities. The world\u2019s ever growing demand for productivity is unlikely to pose the use of this technology as an option.\nAccording to an article by McKinsey (WHAT IS CHATGPT, DALL-E, AND GENERATIVE AI? | MCKINSEY, 2023), generative AI algorithms are trained on massive amounts of data, which makes their responses appear highly creative and even more lifelike with the inclusion of random elements.\nConsidering the specific case of ERPP academics, their writing would probably become a combination of their own creation and excerpts composed with an AI-powered tool (please refer to APPENDIX A - Writing review via ChatGPT sample). Therefore, from a linguistic point of view, the use of AI-powered tools may introduce distinctive language features that could lead to a register variation in their pieces of text.\nA register variation study via MDA is expected to produce insights on the nature of variation introduced in the writers\u2019 Academic Writing. According to Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 100), the approach known as MDA, originally proposed by Biber in 1988, allows for the analysis of a large volume of texts of a certain register, identifying patterns of co-occurring grammatical features (also known as functional dimensions) that characterise the variation of that register.\nBiber (2009, p. 823) argues that registers can be defined by their situational (e.g. informality, orality, etc.) and linguistic characteristics:\nAlthough registers are defined in situational terms, they can also be compared with respect to their linguistic characteristics: the study of register variation. Register variation is inherent in human language: a single speaker will make systematic choices in pronunciation, morphology, word choice, and grammar reflecting a range of situational factors. (BIBER, 2009, p. 823)\nA complete MDA follows eight methodological steps (BIBER, 2009, p. 825-826):\nAn appropriate corpus is designed based on previous research and analysis. Texts are collected, transcribed (in the case of spoken texts), and input into the computer;\nResearch is conducted to identify the linguistic features to be included in the analysis, together with functional associations of the linguistic features;\nComputer programs are developed for automated grammatical analysis, to identify or \u2018tag\u2019 all relevant linguistic features in texts;\nThe entire corpus of texts is tagged automatically by computer, and all texts are edited interactively to ensure that the linguistic features are accurately identified;\nAdditional computer programs are developed and run to compute normed frequency counts of each linguistic feature in each text of the corpus;\nThe co-occurrence patterns among linguistic features are identified through a factor analysis of the frequency counts;\nThe \u2018factors\u2019 from the factor analysis are interpreted functionally as underlying dimensions of variation;\nDimension scores for each text are computed; the mean dimension scores for each register are then compared to analyse the salient linguistic similarities and differences among registers.\nIn a study about discourse of academia from a multidimensional perspective, Berber Sardinha (2020, p. 302-303) proposed the use of a derivation of MDA known as lexical MDA which\nUnlike a \u201ctraditional\u201d MD Analysis, which uses mostly grammatical features and whose general goal is to identify functional dimensions of register variation, a lexical MD Analysis uses lexical units (words, n-grams, collocations) to identify the dimensions. (BERBER SARDINHA, 2020, p. 302-303)\nAccording to Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 103-104), MDA, due to its cumulative nature, is an appropriate approach for analyses of corpora that grow incrementally.\nResearch in Corpus Linguistics requires judicious design and preparation of corpora. Sanchez (1995, p. 8-9 apud BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338) defines a corpus as\nA set of linguistic data (pertaining to the oral or written use of the language, or both), systematised according to certain criteria, sufficiently extensive in breadth and depth, so that they are representative of the totality of the linguistic use or of any of its scopes, arranged in such a way that they can be processed by computer, in order to provide various and useful results for the description and analysis. (SANCHEZ, 1995, p. 8-9 apud BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338, author\u2019s translation)\nBerber Sardinha (2018, p. 338-339) enumerates four prerequisites for preparing a corpus:\nThe corpus should consist of authentic texts in natural language, not specifically produced for linguistic research nor artificially produced by computer programmes;\nIf the texts were produced by non-native speakers, the corpus should be qualified as a learner corpus;\nThe corpus should be fit for purpose in the sense that it should be designed according to the requirements of its corresponding research;\nThe corpus should be representative. Although this is a requisite that cannot be objectively determined, a larger corpus is generally more representative than a smaller one because it may contain more instances of low frequency linguistic features (BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 343).\nAccording to Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 345), it should be the researcher\u2019s responsibility to demonstrate how representative and adequate a corpus is for their study.\nHaving defined the theoretical basis of this study, the methodological procedures are going to be detailed in the next section.\nThe study is going to be designed to test the following hypothesis: The revision via an AI-powered tool (ChatGPT or Google Bard) of papers authored by Brazilian ERPP scholars in the area of Applied Linguistics should present a magnitude of register variation that should be larger than the magnitude obtained from applying the same AI-powered tool on papers of the same area that were recognised by mainstream journal reviewers as ready for publication.\nTherefore, the relevance of the AI-powered \u200b\u200btool will be as great as the register variation obtained by its use when compared with the register variation obtained in a paper that was accepted by one of the mainstream journals.\nTo that end, the research project is going to consider the following procedures:\nA corpus of Applied Linguistics Published Papers (ALPP) is going to be designed and have its dimensions analysed via MDA;\nThe texts of the ALPP corpus are going to be reviewed via an AI-powered tool and used to design a corpus of AI-revised Applied Linguistics Published Papers (AI-ALPP). Its dimensions are going to be analysed via MDA;\nThe magnitude of register variation verified in steps 1 and 2 should be named \u2018AI-assisted Variation - Published Reference\u2019 (AI-VPR);\nA corpus of Applied Linguistics Brazilian-authored Papers (ALBP) is going to be designed and have its dimensions analysed via MDA;\nThe texts of the ALBP corpus are going to be reviewed via an AI-powered tool and used to design a corpus of AI-revised Applied Linguistics Brazilian-authored Papers (AI-ALBP). Its dimensions are going to be analysed via MDA;\nThe magnitude of register variation verified in steps 4 and 5 should be named \u2018AI-assisted Variation - Brazilian-authored Reference\u2019 (AI-VBR);\nAI-VPR and AI-VBR are going to be analysed for interpretation of results.\nThe four corpora should be designed according to the high-level requirements depicted in Table 1.\nEven though a corpus should consist of authentic texts in natural language, not produced by computer programmes, texts produced by ERPP writers assisted by AI-powered tools are going to be considered authentic for the purpose of this study.\nThe ALPP and ALBP corpora are going to be sourced and designed to meet the required level of representativeness and adequacy according to the criteria to be determined and validated with the supervisor.\nA possible strategy for the ALBP corpus would be to incrementally build it from the second term of 2023 to the second term of 2024. It is expected that there is going to be one group of 20 ERPP writers per term that will compose papers with 1,350 words on average, resulting in a final word count estimated at 162,000 words as shown in Table 2. This strategy might be reconsidered according to the mentioned criteria of corpora representativeness and adequacy.\nIn principle, the study is going to employ the traditional (functional) MDA. This assumption should be validated at the establishment of the research project.\nThe research project is going to explore data visualisation technologies to create computer-generated visual representations of its outcomes in order to enable the assessment of complex relationships between variables and also to streamline the interchange of research data.\nA few readily available open source libraries such as D3.js, ECharts, Vega and deck.gl may be employed for this purpose (WHAT IS DATA VISUALIZATION? | IBM, 2023).\nDetails about how the research project is expected to be executed are the subject of the next section.\nThe project is expected to start in the second term of 2023 with an initial validation with the supervisor. The first task should be the corpora design.\nThe ALBP corpus is going to be designed and populated initially with the texts produced in the second term of 2023. As the project progresses it is expected to incrementally grow.\nThe required computer scripts are going to be prepared in parallel. The Multi-Dimensional Analyses are going to be performed, refined and expanded as the project progresses according to Figure 2.\nThe project is expected to be concluded by the end of the first term of 2025 with the presentation of the final revision of the dissertation."}
