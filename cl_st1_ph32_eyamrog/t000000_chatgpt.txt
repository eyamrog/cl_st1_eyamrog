In this research article focusing on the fern flora of Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, specifically addressing the families Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and Saccolomataceae, we provide a taxonomic treatment of these early divergent lineages of leptosporangiate ferns. Our work is part of a continuous project dedicated to studying ferns and lycophytes in the Viçosa region, where we have been conducting sampling in remnant forest patches since 2012. Additionally, we meticulously reviewed the herbarium collection at VIC and various online collections such as F, IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. Within the Viçosa region, we identified six taxa from these families: Dennstaedtia cicutaria and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Dennstaedtiaceae); Lindsaea lancea var. lancea, L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta var. stricta (Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma elegans (Saccolomataceae). Notably, L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, while the others have a broader distribution in the Neotropics. Our study includes keys, descriptions, illustrations, examined specimens, and insightful comments on these taxa.
In the era preceding the dominance of molecular data in plant classification systems, Dennstaedtiaceae was perceived as a substantial family encompassing three subfamilies or tribes and approximately 17 genera (Tryon & Tryon, 1982; Kramer, 1990). However, with the introduction of molecular data, these subfamilies were elevated to the family level, new families emerged, and the early-diverging leptosporangiate ferns now include Cystodiaceae (one genus), a more precisely defined Dennstaedtiaceae (11-12 genera), Lindsaeaceae (seven genera), Lonchitidaceae (one genus), Saccolomataceae (one or two genera), and the extensive Pteridaceae family (over 50 genera) (Smith et al., 2006; PPG I, 2016; Shang et al., 2018; Schwartsburd et al., 2020).
Brazil is represented by Dennstaedtiaceae with eight genera and 26 species, Lindsaeaceae with one genus and 34 species, Lonchitidaceae with one genus and one species, and Saccolomataceae with one genus and nine species, excluding Pteridaceae (which is the subject of a separate paper) (Kramer 1957, Pena et al. 2020, Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd & Pena 2020). Generally, these plants exhibit characters considered plesiomorphic, typical of early-diverging lineages of Polypodiales, such as solesnotelic rhizomes covered with hairs or primitive scales, large, highly dissected leaves, sori that are truly marginal and protected by inner and outer indusia, and trilete spores (Tryon & Tryon 1982, Kramer 1990, PPG I 2016, Schwartsburd et al. 2020).
Pteridium, found worldwide with the exception of Antarctica, holds significant importance for mankind due to its direct impact on local human populations. Acting as a pioneer weed, it invades croplands and spreads through its underground rhizomes, making eradication challenging. Furthermore, it poses a threat to livestock such as cattle and horses, causing intoxication. Ingestion by humans can also lead to toxicity, with some studies suggesting the transmission of its toxins, specifically the psilatoquinis, through cow milk (Tryon 1941, Evans 1976, Page 1976, Marrs et al. 2000, Martini-Santos et al. 2010, Oliveira et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2018).
In the State of Minas Gerais, Dennstaedtiaceae comprises 14 species, Lindsaeaceae includes 11 species, and Saccolomataceae consists of three species (Pena et al. 2020, Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd & Pena 2020, Schwartsburd 2022). This article presents the taxonomic treatment of these families in the Viçosa region of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, as part of an ongoing project on the Fern Flora of the area. Various fascicles are currently in preparation, with some already published, including works by Miranda & Schwartsburd (2016 - Salviniales), Rabelo & Schwartsburd (2016 - Schizaeales), and Gonçalves da Silva & Schwartsburd (2017 - Polypodiaceae).
In the Viçosa region of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, the existing forest patches are categorized as Semi-Deciduous Seasonal Forest according to IBGE (2012). The local elevation varies between 600 and 900 meters above sea level, as observed personally, while the annual temperatures fluctuate between 5° and 30°C, as reported by INMET (2021).
Since 2012, we have been conducting sampling in remnant forest patches. Specimens were gathered and dried following standard fern collection methods as outlined by Windisch (1992), subsequently integrated into the herbarium VIC (abbreviations in line with Thiers, regularly updated), with duplicates intended for dispatch to other herbaria. Our study also encompassed a comprehensive examination of the herbarium VIC's collection and online collections from other herbaria: F, IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. While the classification system utilized in prior fascicles was derived from an adaptation of Kenrick & Crane (1997) and Smith et al. (2006), we have now transitioned to the system outlined in PPG I (2016). Morphological terminology adheres to the guidelines set forth by Lellinger (2002).
The region of Viçosa harbors a total of four genera and six species from the families Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and Saccolomataceae. Among these taxa, four species have infra-specific classifications that are considered in this study. The six identified taxa include Dennstaedtia cicutaria (Sw.) T. Moore and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Kaulf.) J.A. Thomson from Dennstaedtiaceae; Lindsaea lancea (L.) Bedd. var. lancea, L. quadrangularis Raddi subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta (Sw.) Dryand. var. stricta from Lindsaeaceae; and Saccoloma elegans Kaulf. Notably, only L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, while the rest are distributed across the Neotropics. Unlike other families studied previously, such as Salviniaceae, Anemiaceae, and Polypodiaceae, where half of the taxa were recollected, we did not find D. cicutaria, L. lancea var. lancea, or L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis during our fieldwork. It is likely that these species have become locally extinct over time due to forest fragmentation and disturbance, as they were last collected in the 1930s and have not been found since.
Rhizomes typically exhibit long-creeping growth patterns, characterized by solenostelic structures, although instances of dictyostelic or polycyclic formations are rare, occasionally adorned with hairs or primitive scales. The leaves are generally uniform in appearance; their stipes often feature epipetiolar buds and an omega-shaped vascular strand, while the laminae are typically 2-5-pinnate, occasionally less dissected. Veins are typically free-flowing, with rare instances of anastomosis, devoid of included veinlets; the indument may consist of hairs, glandular hairs, or be absent altogether. Sori are typically found at the margins or submargins, appearing linear or discrete, introrse or extrorse, often shielded by outer and/or inner indusia, although some may lack protection. Spores are typically tetrahedral and trilete, or reniform and monolete, as described by Smith et al. in 2006.
The family is cosmopolitan, comprising eleven genera and approximately 270 species (PPG I 2016, Shang et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2020). The clade encompassing Dennstaedtia, Leptolepia, Microlepia, and Oenotrichia requires further clarification, as Dennstaedtia is polyphyletic (Schwartsburd et al. 2020).
Rhizomes are short to long-creeping, either glabrous or bearing catenate hairs. The leaves are notably large, reaching up to 4 meters in length, with laminae that are 2-4-pinnate and veins that are free. The indument on the leaves can consist of catenate hairs, acicular hairs, or may be absent altogether. Sori are found marginally, discrete, located at the tip of single veins. The inner and outer indusia are fused, forming purse- or cup-shaped, or hemi-globose structures, as described by Smith et al. in 2006.
Dennstaedtia, as currently circumscribed, is considered polyphyletic according to Schwartzburd et al. (2020), encompassing approximately 70 species. Within Brazil, there are documented occurrences of six species (Schwartsburd & Pena 2020), although personal observations suggest that the actual number may range between eight to ten species.
Terrestrial plants with long-creeping rhizomes bearing brownish catenate hairs. The leaves are 1-3.5 m long, with stipes measuring 0.5-2.5 m, brown proximally and lighter brown above, adorned with acicular hairs or becoming glabrescent. The laminae are 0.5-2 m long, 3-pinnate-pinnatifid to 4-pinnate proximally, with light brown pilose rachises bearing brownish catenate hairs and lacking proliferous buds. Basal pinnae are 25-100 cm × 12-35 cm, subequilateral, with sessile pinnules that are lanceolate to oblong with dentate margins. Both costae and costules are pilose on both sides, with light brown to reddish catenate hairs. Veins are free, hirsute on both sides with erect, light brown to reddish acicular hairs, while the laminar tissue between the veins is covered in catenate and acicular hairs. Sori are oblong or rounded, located at the tip of single veins within segment sinuses, and are covered by purse-shaped indusia typically adorned with acicular and catenate hairs.
Specimens examined from Brazil include those from Minas Gerais: Viçosa, specifically from the Agricultural College land at Horticultural Hill, 670 m, collected on 7th July 1930 by Y. Mexia (4846) and deposited in F, MO-n.v., U, UC, and US herbaria; also from the base of Horticultural Hill at Escola Superior de Agricultura e Veterinária, 668 m, collected on 17th July 1930 by Y. Mexia (4866) and stored in IAN, F, U, UC, US, VIC, and WTU herbaria; and from Escola Superior de Agricultura e Veterinária, collected in January 1934 by J.G. Kuhlmann (s.n.) and housed in VIC-1309.
Dennstaedtia cicutaria is distinguished by its densely veined laminar tissue, which is covered with catenate and acicular hairs. The indusia of this species are purse-shaped and also adorned with acicular and catenate hairs.
Rhizomes are long-creeping, adorned with setose hairs. The leaves are notably large, reaching up to 4.5 meters in length, with laminae that are 3-5-pinnate and veins that are free. The indument is comprised of catenate hairs, acicular hairs, arachnoid hairs, and/or minute gnarled hairs. Sori are situated marginally, appearing linear and continuous along the laminar margins, and are borne on comissural veins. The inner indusia are vestigial, while the outer indusia are linear, as described by Smith et al. in 2006.
Currently, two species along with two species of hybrid origin have been officially recognized (Thomson 2012, Zhou et al. 2014, Schwartsburd et al. 2018, 2020). Furthermore, approximately 20 morpho-taxa have been identified as infra-specific entities, including subspecies, varieties, forms, or combinations of multiple ranks (e.g., Tryon 1941, Page 1976, Thomson 2012, Schwartsburd et al. 2018). In Brazil, the following taxa are acknowledged: Pteridium caudatum (L.) Maxon, P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, P. esculentum subsp. campestre (Schrad.) Schwartsb. & J. Prado, P. esculentum subsp. gryphus Schwartsb., P. esculentum var. harpianum Schwartsb. & A. Yañez, and P. esculentum var. paedomorficum Schwartsb. & J. Prado (Schwartsburd 2020). The predominant taxon in southeastern Brazil is P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, known for its invasion of crops and toxicity to cattle, horses, and humans upon ingestion (Schwartsburd et al. 2018).
Terrestrial plants with a tufted growth habit, characterized by long-creeping rhizomes adorned with hair-like structures. The leaves are notably large, ranging from 1.5 to 4.5 meters in length, with stipes measuring 0.75 to 2.5 meters long. The stipes exhibit a dark brown hue at the base, transitioning to a straw-like color towards the top, and are devoid of hair. The laminae, ranging from 0.75 to 2.5 meters in length, are proximally 3-4-pinnate-pinnatifid. The rachises are straw-colored and hairless, while the basal pinnae are equilateral, measuring 60-100 by 25-70 centimeters. Both pinnae and pinnules display free lobes between segments, with compound distal segments being irregularly dissected and caudate at the apex. Simple distal segments are linear, reaching up to 3 to 4 centimeters in length. The costae and costules are adorned with reddish catenate hairs on the abaxial side, while being hairless on the adaxial side. Veins are lanose on the abaxial surface, with loose, cobweb-like hairs, and smooth on the adaxial side. The tissue between veins is hairless on both surfaces. Sori are linear and marginal, running along segment margins and emerging at the tips of multiple veins, with vestigial inner indusia and linear outer indusia.

Schwartsburd et al. collected specimens 2837 and 2838 (VIC); at the State Agricultural School on 24th February 1957, H.S. Irwin collected specimen 2721 (F, TEX-n.v., UC, US, VIC); at Escola Superior de Agricultura e Veterinária in 1943, P. Alvin collected specimen VIC-3537; at Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Fazendinha on 11th September 1977, Rosane & Rosângela collected specimens VIC-7962, 7963, 7964, 7965; at the same location, in Mata do Paraíso, Trilha dos Alpes on 9th February 2017, P.B. Schwartsburd et al. collected specimens 3877 and 3879; and in Mata da Biologia on 27th March 2019, N.T.L. Pena et al. collected specimens 783 and 784 (VIC).
Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum is distinguished by the presence of free lobes between the segments on the pinnae and pinnules distally, abaxial veins adorned with arachnoid hairs, and a smooth, hairless laminar tissue between the veins. Notably, this subspecies consistently exhibits outer indusia, even in sterile leaves.
Rhizomes range from short to long-creeping, typically protostelic with internal phloem, occasionally solenostelic, and are adorned with basally attached, nonclathrate scales or hairs. The leaves are monomorphic, featuring laminae that can be simple to 3-pinnate or occasionally more dissected; veins are typically free, with occasional anastomosing, lacking included veinlets, and generally devoid of indument or occasionally adorned with 2-celled glandular hairs. Sori are found marginally or submarginally, extrorse, elongate to linear, shielded by outer (unmodified) and inner (modified) indusia; spores are typically tetrahedral and trilete, occasionally bilateral and monolete (Smith et al., 2006).
Rhizomes are short-creeping and characterized by primitive scales. The leaves range in size from small to medium, measuring approximately 20 cm to 1 m in length. The laminae can be simple or 3-pinnate, with an indument that may be absent or composed of 2-celled glandular hairs. Veins are typically free, and sori are either marginal or submarginal, elongate, and situated on comissural veins. The inner indusia are elongate and modified, while the outer indusia remain unaltered (Smith et al., 2006).
Approximately 180 species are known, with 34 of them being found in Brazil according to various sources (Kramer, 1957; PPG I, 2016; Pena et al., 2020).
Terrestrial plants with short-creeping rhizomes bearing dark brown, lanceolate scales. The leaves measure 30-50 cm in length, with stipes ranging from 15-25 cm, dark brown at the base and stramineous towards the top, quadrangular in shape. Proximally adorned with dark brown, acuminate scales and sparse 2-celled glandular hairs, the laminae are 15-25 cm long and 2-pinnate. The rachises lack wings, are stramineous, and feature sparse 2-celled glandular hairs. Basal pinnae are equilateral, measuring 10-15 cm × 2.5-3.5 cm, with petiolulate, dimidiate pinnules that are 1.5-2 cm long. Costae on both sides are sparsely covered with 2-celled glandular hairs or are glabrescent, while veins are glabrous on both sides. The laminar tissue between the veins is also glabrous. Sori are continuous, located at the tip of multiple veins, with inner indusia ranging from membranaceous to papyraceous, featuring entire, wavy, glabrous margins.
Specimens examined in this study were collected in Brazil, specifically in Minas Gerais. The collection site was Viçosa, and the specimens were obtained in 1930 by Y. Mexia, with the voucher number 4639-a. These specimens are currently housed in several herbaria, including GH (not vouchered), UC, US, and VIC.
All Lindsaea species found in Viçosa exhibit 2-pinnate laminae and dimidiate pinnules. Lindsaea lancea var. lancea stands out from the other two due to its continuous sori; L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis distinguishes itself with reddish-brown, winged rachises; and L. stricta var. stricta is unique in its terete abaxially petioles. Furthermore, there are variations in pinnule lengths among the three taxa: 1.5-2 cm in L. lancea var. lancea, 1.2-1.5 cm in L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, and up to 1 cm in L. stricta var. stricta.
Terrestrial plants with short-creeping rhizomes bearing light brown, lanceolate scales. The leaves measure 40-75 cm in length, with stipes 25-40 cm long, entirely reddish-brown and quadrangular, proximally adorned with light brown, acuminate scales and sparse 2-celled glandular hairs. The laminae are 20-40 cm long and 2-pinnate, with winged reddish-brown rachises featuring sparse 2-celled glandular hairs. Basal pinnae are 10-18 × 2-3 cm, with short-petiolulate, dimidiate pinnules measuring 1.2-1.5 cm long. Costae on both sides are sparsely covered with 2-celled glandular hairs, while veins are glabrous. Laminar tissue between the veins is sparsely covered with 2-celled glandular hairs on the abaxial side and glabrous on the adaxial side. Sori are interrupted, located at the tip of multiple veins, with membranaceous indusia featuring dentate margins and being glabrous.
Specimens examined from Brazil include those from Minas Gerais: Viçosa, specifically from the Agricultural College lands on the Hillside of Cha-Cha Valley collected on 1st March 1930 by Y. Mexia (4410-a) and another specimen collected at an unspecified location in 1935 by J.G. Kuhlmann (s.n. VIC-1894). These specimens are housed at UC and US-n.v. respectively.
Terrestrial plants with short-creeping rhizomes bearing dark brown, lanceolate scales. The leaves measure 35-80 cm in length, with stipes ranging from 15-50 cm, dark brown at the base and stramineous towards the top. The abaxial side is terete while the adaxial side is flattened, initially adorned with dark brown, acuminate scales. The laminae are 20-35 cm long, either 2-pinnate or occasionally 1- or 3-pinnate; the rachises lack wings, are stramineous, and may have sparse 2-celled glandular hairs or be glabrescent. Basal pinnae are 12-25 cm × 1-2 cm, with short-petiolate, dimidiate or flabellate pinnules up to 1 cm long. Both abaxial and adaxial sides of the costae bear sparse 2-celled glandular hairs or are glabrescent, while the veins exhibit a similar pattern. The laminar tissue between the veins also shows sparse 2-celled glandular hairs or is glabrous. Sori are interrupted, located at the tip of multiple veins, with inner indusia being membranaceous, dentate at the margins, and glabrous.
Specimens examined from Brazil, Minas Gerais, Viçosa include: Y. Mexia 5486 collected on the road to Cajurí, Moro Grande at 750m on January 7, 1931, deposited in various herbaria; M.G. Bovini 1624 from Silvestre on April 10, 1999; P.B. Schwartsburd et al. 3421, 3423 from Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Mata da Silvicultura towards Cristo at 740m on October 31, 2014; P.B. Schwartsburd et al. 3881 from Mata do Paraíso, Trilha dos Alpes on February 9, 2017; and N.T.L. Pena et al. 1049 from Recanto das Cigarras on July 8, 2019, all deposited at VIC herbarium.
Rhizomes are typically erect, occasionally short-creeping, and may develop into small trunks, exhibiting a dictyostelic structure and adorned with peltate scales. The leaves are monomorphic, characterized by stipes featuring an omega-shaped vascular strand, while the laminae are 1-4-pinnate with free veins. The indument is typically composed of caduceus scales, occasionally interspersed with scattered catenate hairs. Sori are found either marginally or submarginally, discrete, extrorse, and shielded by outer (unmodified) and inner (modified) indusia. The spores are tetrahedral-globose and trilete in nature (Smith et al., 2006).
One pantropical genus comprising approximately 24 species has been extensively studied (Rojas-Alvarado 2010, Luong et al. 2015, Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd 2022). The decision to assign the Paleotropical species to the genus Orthiopteris is supported by phylogenetic evidence, although it lacks morphological backing; therefore, focusing solely on Saccoloma within Saccolomataceae is deemed more appropriate (Schwartsburd 2022). In Brazil, a total of nine species have been officially identified (Schwartsburd 2022).
Terrestrial plants with erect to decumbent rhizomes that are stout to trunk-like and glabrescent. The leaves are 1.2-2.2 m long, with petioles that are proximally burgundy and stramineous above, measuring 40-80 cm long and proximally wrinkled to minutely spiny. Petiolar scales are peltate, blackish, with or without lighter, dentate margins. The laminae are 1-pinnate, 80-140 cm long, with stramineous, glabrous rachises. Basal pinnae measure 15-25 × 2.5-3.5 cm, with abaxially and adaxially glabrous costae. Veins are commonly 1-furcate, rarely simple or 2 or 3-furcate at the base of pinnae, and are abaxially and adaxially glabrous. Sori are marginal, discrete, born at the tip of single veins, placed side by side, and open extrorsely. The outer indusia are not modified, while the inner indusia are hemi-umbonate, commonly forming wings connecting adjacent sori. This plant is endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, found from Pernambuco to Santa Catarina.
