The emergence of new-generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard is poised to revolutionize content creation, including Academic Writing. Despite current limitations, substantial investments from leading AI companies and the escalating global demand for enhanced productivity are expected to drive widespread adoption of this technology to a point where its utilization becomes imperative. This study seeks to deepen our understanding of the potential impact of AI-powered tools on texts produced by Brazilian Applied Linguistics English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP) authors within a Higher Education institution's graduate program. Employing a Multi-Dimensional Analysis (MDA) approach, the research will span three terms (from the second term of 2023 to the second term of 2024). The findings are crucial for developing strategies to better equip Brazilian ERPP researchers and students for the rigorous standards of English-only journals and to facilitate their integration into the global research community. Leveraging data visualization technologies, the project will generate computer-generated visual representations of its results to facilitate the analysis of intricate relationships between variables and enhance the exchange of research data. A tentative timeline aims to conclude the research project by the end of the first term of 2025.
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has advanced significantly, particularly with the introduction of expansive language models that possess the ability to aid individuals in content generation.
The current study seeks to investigate the significance of utilizing AI-powered tools for Brazilian authors in the field of Applied Linguistics, specifically focusing on English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP). To address the research question concerning the relevance of these tools, the research employs a Corpus Linguistics methodology, specifically utilizing Multi-Dimensional Analysis (MDA) as outlined by Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 100). This investigation is conducted within the framework of a group of Brazilian Applied Linguistics ERPP writers enrolled in a graduate program at a Higher Education institution.
The findings generated by this research endeavor are deemed crucial for bolstering the involvement of Brazilian academics in the international research sphere, particularly within the Humanities. Additionally, these insights could serve as valuable resources in shaping innovative pedagogical strategies aimed at equipping students of ERPP with the necessary skills to meet the rigorous standards of predominant English-language journals.
The project aims to enhance the advancement of innovative AI-driven data visualization initiatives under the CNPq's institutional project 'Artificial Intelligence in Language and Discourse Research: Multimodal and Multidimensional Visualization Galleries,' which focuses on exploring computer-generated visual representations of data. Additionally, it will contribute to the establishment of data visualization galleries as outlined in the aforementioned institutional project.
In the subsequent section, the theoretical framework will be delineated.
Despite the ongoing prevalence of English as a lingua franca across various domains of human activity, scholars of English as an International Language (EIL) who operate outside established networks still face significant challenges in getting their work published in mainstream English-only journals (Belcher, 2007). This disparity hampers their ability to fully engage with the global research community.
Belcher (2007) raises concerns about the extent to which the rules of the Anglosaxon publication system contribute to the prevailing monocultural trend. In her study, Belcher (2007) contends that EIL academics who succeed in getting their papers published must endure a laborious cycle of revising and resubmitting, characterized as a narrative of reviewer patience and author perseverance.
In a study focused on examining how multilingual Brazilian writers responded to the expectations of adhering to dominant linguistic and cultural norms, Monteiro and Hirano (2020) found that scholars in the Humanities and Social Sciences tend to publish significantly less in international journals, citing language-related difficulties as a major obstacle.
The recent rise of AI-powered large language models like ChatGPT and Google Bard presents a promising opportunity for users engaged in English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP) to enhance their academic output. Although these tools have acknowledged constraints, they have the capacity to swiftly generate a diverse range of credible content and adapt it based on feedback, thereby refining the writing to better suit its intended purpose (McKinsey, 2023).
Given the substantial investment that leading AI enterprises are making in the development of this technology, coupled with its increasing prevalence, it is reasonable to anticipate that AI-based tools will soon attain a level of reliability that enables them to significantly impact a wide array of text genres across various human activities. The escalating global need for enhanced productivity suggests that the adoption of this technology will likely become a necessity rather than a choice.
As per McKinsey's article on generative AI (WHAT IS CHATGPT, DALL-E, AND GENERATIVE AI? | MCKINSEY, 2023), these algorithms undergo training using extensive datasets, resulting in responses that exhibit a high degree of creativity and realism, often enhanced by the incorporation of random elements.
In the context of ERPP academics, their writing is likely to be a blend of their original content and passages generated with an AI-powered tool (see APPENDIX A for a sample of writing reviewed via ChatGPT). Consequently, the utilization of AI tools may introduce unique linguistic characteristics that could result in a variation in register within their written work.
A study utilizing register variation through MDA is anticipated to offer valuable insights into the types of variations present in academic writing by authors. As outlined by Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 100), the MDA approach, initially introduced by Biber in 1988, enables the examination of extensive text collections within a specific register, pinpointing consistent patterns of grammatical features that commonly appear together (referred to as functional dimensions) and define the variation within that register.
According to Biber (2009, p. 823), registers can be delineated based on their situational features, such as informality and orality, as well as their linguistic attributes.
Registers, while primarily defined in situational terms, can also be analyzed and compared based on their linguistic features, a field known as register variation. This variation is a natural aspect of human language, where speakers consistently make decisions regarding pronunciation, morphology, vocabulary, and grammar influenced by various situational factors (Biber, 2009, p. 823).
A comprehensive MDA involves eight methodological steps as outlined by Biber (2009, p. 825-826):
An appropriate corpus is meticulously crafted through a synthesis of prior research and analysis. Texts are diligently gathered, transcribed (in the instance of spoken texts), and subsequently inputted into the computer system for further examination.
Research is undertaken to identify the linguistic features that will be included in the analysis, as well as the functional associations of these linguistic features.
Computer programs are designed to automate grammatical analysis, enabling the identification or 'tagging' of all pertinent linguistic features within texts.
The complete corpus of texts undergoes automatic tagging by a computer, followed by interactive editing to guarantee the accurate identification of linguistic features.
Additional computer programs are developed and executed to calculate normed frequency counts of each linguistic feature in every text within the corpus.
The co-occurrence patterns among linguistic features are discerned by conducting a factor analysis on the frequency counts.
The factors derived from the factor analysis are interpreted as fundamental dimensions of variation, serving a functional role in understanding the data.
Dimension scores are calculated for each text, followed by a comparison of the mean dimension scores for each register to examine the prominent linguistic similarities and differences across registers.
In a study on the discourse of academia from a multidimensional perspective, Berber Sardinha (2020, p. 302-303) introduced the concept of lexical MDA, a derivative of MDA.
In contrast to a conventional MD Analysis that primarily relies on grammatical features and aims to pinpoint functional dimensions of register variation, a lexical MD Analysis employs lexical units such as words, n-grams, and collocations to identify these dimensions (Berber Sardinha, 2020, p. 302-303).
According to Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 103-104), the Methodology of Data Analysis (MDA) is deemed suitable for the examination of corpora that expand gradually, owing to its cumulative nature.
In Corpus Linguistics research, the creation and preparation of corpora necessitate careful planning. According to Sanchez (1995, p. 8-9 as cited in BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338), a corpus is defined as...
A collection of linguistic data, encompassing both oral and written language usage, organized based on specific criteria to ensure comprehensive coverage and representation of linguistic use in its entirety or within specific domains. This data is structured in a manner conducive to computer processing, enabling the generation of diverse and valuable insights for descriptive and analytical purposes (Sanchez, 1995, p. 8-9 as cited in Berber Sardinha, 2018, p. 338, translated by the author).
In his work, Berber Sardinha (2018, pp. 338-339) outlines four essential prerequisites for corpus preparation.
The corpus should comprise authentic texts in natural language that have not been specifically created for linguistic research or artificially generated by computer programs.
If the texts were authored by individuals who are not native speakers of the language, the corpus should be categorized as a learner corpus.
The corpus must be tailored to meet the specific needs and objectives of the research it is intended for. It should be meticulously crafted to align with the particular demands and goals of the study, ensuring that it serves its intended purpose effectively and efficiently.
Ensuring the representativeness of the corpus is essential. While objectivity in determining this requirement is challenging, a larger corpus typically offers better representation than a smaller one. This is due to its potential to encompass a greater number of instances of low-frequency linguistic features (Berber Sardinha, 2018, p. 343).
As per Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 345), it is incumbent upon the researcher to illustrate the representativeness and adequacy of the corpus utilized in their study.
With the theoretical framework of this study now established, the subsequent section will elaborate on the methodological procedures employed.
The study aims to test the hypothesis that revising papers authored by Brazilian ERPP scholars in Applied Linguistics using an AI-powered tool (such as ChatGPT or Google Bard) will result in a greater magnitude of register variation compared to papers in the same field deemed ready for publication by mainstream journal reviewers after being revised with the same AI-powered tool.
Hence, the significance of the AI-powered tool will be determined by the extent of register variation it achieves in comparison to the register variation observed in a paper accepted by a mainstream journal.
In pursuit of this objective, the research project will examine the following methodologies:
A corpus of Applied Linguistics Published Papers (ALPP) will be constructed and its dimensions will be analyzed using Multidimensional Analysis (MDA).
The texts from the ALPP corpus will undergo review using an AI-powered tool and will be utilized in the creation of a corpus consisting of AI-revised Applied Linguistics Published Papers (AI-ALPP). The dimensions of this corpus will be analyzed through Multidimensional Analysis (MDA).
The extent of register variation observed in steps 1 and 2 warrants the designation of 'AI-assisted Variation - Published Reference' (AI-VPR).
A corpus of Brazilian-authored papers in Applied Linguistics (ALBP) will be constructed and analyzed using Multidimensional Analysis (MDA).
The texts from the ALBP corpus will undergo review using an AI-powered tool to create a corpus of AI-revised Applied Linguistics Brazilian-authored Papers (AI-ALBP). The dimensions of this corpus will be analyzed through Multidimensional Analysis (MDA).
The register variation observed in steps 4 and 5 should be designated as 'AI-assisted Variation - Brazilian-authored Reference' (AI-VBR).
AI-VPR and AI-VBR will be analyzed to interpret the results.
The four corpora must be structured in accordance with the detailed specifications outlined in Table 1.
While the conventional understanding dictates that a corpus should primarily comprise authentic texts in natural language, devoid of computer-generated content, this study opts to regard texts generated by ERPP writers with the aid of AI-powered tools as authentic.
The ALPP and ALBP corpora will be sourced and designed to ensure they meet the necessary standards of representativeness and adequacy, as per the criteria that will be established and validated in consultation with the supervisor.
One potential approach for the ALBP corpus could involve gradually constructing it from the second term of 2023 to the second term of 2024. The plan anticipates the formation of a single cohort comprising 20 ERPP writers each term, tasked with producing papers averaging 1,350 words in length. This process is projected to culminate in a total word count of approximately 162,000 words, as outlined in Table 2. However, the viability of this strategy may need to be reassessed in light of the stipulated criteria concerning the representativeness and sufficiency of corpora.
The study will utilize the traditional (functional) MDA methodology. This assumption must be verified during the initiation of the research project.
The research project aims to investigate data visualization technologies for generating computer-generated visual representations of its findings. This approach facilitates the evaluation of intricate relationships between variables and enhances the efficiency of exchanging research data.
Several open-source libraries, including D3.js, ECharts, Vega, and deck.gl, are readily accessible for the purpose of data visualization (IBM, 2023).
The subsequent section delves into the operational details of the research project, outlining the anticipated execution plan.
The project is scheduled to commence in the second term of 2023, beginning with an initial validation process with the supervisor. The primary task at hand will involve designing the corpora.
The ALBP corpus will be designed and initially populated with texts generated during the second term of 2023. It is anticipated that the corpus will gradually expand as the project advances.
The necessary computer scripts will be developed concurrently. The Multi-Dimensional Analyses will be conducted, enhanced, and broadened as the project advances in accordance with Figure 2.
The project is anticipated to be completed by the conclusion of the first term of 2025, culminating in the submission of the final revised dissertation.
