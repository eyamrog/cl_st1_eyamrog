This article presents a research analysis focusing on Brazilian university students and their interpretation of cinema images. The analysis delves into how these students construct meanings and reflects on interpretation and meaning construction through recent epistemological perspectives (Morin, 1998; Lankshear & Knobel, 2003). It considers the current requirements of multimodal and hypertextual communication within multiliteracy studies (Cope & Kalantzis, 2000), as well as university readiness for critical and participative cultural and social practices (Castells, 1999).
This article presents an investigation that is part of a broader exploratory research project aiming to understand the impact of digital language on Brazilian university students. The research focuses on interpretation and epistemology, seeking to 1) assess students' ability to derive meaning in digital environments (such as the Internet and movies) and 2) observe their knowledge construction within these contexts. To achieve this goal, a series of qualitative ethnographic investigations has been designed to systematically study university classroom practices, providing insights into Brazilian students' learning processes and their engagement with critical literacy, as informed by new literacies and multiliteracies theories. The researcher, who is also the author of this article, anticipates that the findings may spark discussions on the adequacy of, or necessary changes to, university curricula. This research complements two previously published investigations, contributing to a broader understanding of the topic.
The study outlined in this paper adopts an exploratory and qualitative research approach, aligning with the methodologies advocated by André (1995), a Brazilian methodologist known for emphasizing the importance of an ethnographic perspective in analyzing local studies concerning environments, participants, and cultures. This investigation is exploratory in nature as it aims to delve into data that typically wouldn't form part of the same research framework. For instance, it focuses on chat-room users, who could be classified as participants in earlier forms of social networking such as letter-writing, book clubs, and telephoning, as well as movie viewers who might be grouped with computer game players. This exploration seeks to understand the interplay between emerging practices and knowledge, viewed through an epistemological lens. Furthermore, the research is qualitative, as it reflects the researcher's theoretical framework, values, and worldview, thereby imbuing the investigation with a qualitative essence, as posited by André.
The study necessitated participants who were active chat-room users, relying on their perceptions of various elements (participants, nicknames, encounters, disruptions, treatments) and the dynamics of chat-room discourse (such as committed/uncommitted relationships, entertaining/misleading/committed conversations, veiled/unveiled feelings, constructed/deconstructed/reconstructed narratives, and plural identities). Thirty-four university students, aged 21-25, all coincidentally female, took part in the study (gender was not a prerequisite). They were informed that the process involved watching a movie, writing a description of their perspectives on specific aspects of the film, and participating in a group interview. The utilization of both research tools—the written descriptions and the group interview—was based on the former providing individual written accounts of the students' views on the movie they watched, while the latter aimed to offer additional insights necessary for data analysis. Subsequently, participants viewed a movie and then detailed the aspects they were directed to focus on. The group interview aimed to seek further clarification on relevant written descriptions for the research. The decision to employ these research instruments stemmed from the recognition that emerging knowledge, such as that derived from digital language, prompts new epistemological inquiries. In these investigations, research methodologies were anticipated to align with the theories underpinning the specific area of study.
The new literacies studies and research on this theme are still in their nascent stages in Brazil, necessitating a comprehensive array of surveys and investigations into a wide spectrum of issues related to the topic. This sets Brazil apart from other countries that may already have access to established research and analyses on literacy education. Furthermore, despite drawing upon a theoretical framework that is commonly shared among researchers internationally, this study underscores its social and cultural context, as one would anticipate. This implies that it may exhibit distinct Brazilian characteristics, wherein participants (university students who are chat room users), environments, and processes reflect their unique social and cultural milieu.
The current study delves into an epistemological inquiry, specifically examining the correlation between the typographic mind and the network mind as elucidated by Castells (1999). Castells distinguishes between these two mental frameworks, with the typographic mind resembling text produced through linear and traditional education, while the network mind embodies a non-linear, network-oriented mode of thinking prevalent in digital societies. This research aims to ascertain whether skills honed through internet interaction can be transferred to environments seemingly unrelated to networked cognition. By exploring the concept of "digital epistemologies" (Lankshear & Knobel, 2003), the study challenges the notion of conventional epistemology based on static rules, proposing instead a dynamic understanding of knowledge construction in the digital era. Lankshear and Knobel advocate for a reevaluation of epistemology in light of contemporary practices of knowledge acquisition and dissemination, emphasizing the transformative potential of digital resources in shaping our understanding of the world.
This investigation aims to describe university-level students' meaning-making through a 'performance epistemology' when they engage as both chat-room users and movie viewers, exploring the interconnected experiences across these two media. Lankshear & Knobel (2003) emphasize the significance of a 'performance epistemology' in a highly digitized world, highlighting the ability to navigate uncharted territories and seek new meanings, potentially leading to rule-breaking and innovation. This concern for a redefined epistemology is echoed by other scholars, such as Cope & Kalantzis, who stress the inadequacy of traditional knowledge in a digital society. They advocate for an epistemology of pluralism that respects diverse subjectivities without erasure, forming the foundation for a new societal norm. These scholars recognize a shift towards a more inclusive understanding of society, mind, and meaning, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging socio-cultural and historical dynamics that transcend fixed norms and embrace diverse values and perspectives.
The concept of pluralism is central to the data interpretation in this article, operating on the premise that new literacies studies facilitate and anticipate the integration of knowledge that traditionally resided within distinct domains into a dialogical framework for analysis. Drawing on critical literacy and digital epistemologies within the context of new literacies and multiliteracies studies, alongside critical hermeneutics, the theoretical foundation of this article aims to transcend potential cultural biases that shape individuals' interpretations of their cultural and social surroundings, as highlighted by Morin (1998) in his critique of conventional epistemologies. Morin argues that culture leaves an imprint through education, imparting principles, rules, and tools of knowledge through language, thereby shaping cognitive structures that contribute to knowledge production. The examination of how culture and knowledge are shaped within the technologically influenced language of digital societies becomes crucial within the realm of new literacies and multiliteracies studies.
The critical literacies studies have highlighted the importance of an education focused on "social change, cultural diversity, economic equity, and political enfranchisement," as articulated by Luke & Freebody (1997, p. 1), utilizing "the technologies of writing and other modes of inscription." While literacy education has proven impactful in individuals' lives, the authors argue that traditional reading and writing instruction falls short in meeting the demands of contemporary digital societies. Educators have increasingly shown interest in critical literacy over recent decades, yet often employ inadequate approaches. This approach remains tethered to conventional curricula and educational methods that do not facilitate critical literacy practices, or critical literacies in a broader sense, which could better cater to local educational needs. From a critical education standpoint, critical literacies projects should frequently incorporate innovative strategies, including interdisciplinary ones, to both honor evolving knowledge construction methods, as highlighted by scholars like Morin (1998; 2000) and Lankshear & Knobel (2003), and foster meaning-making, a concept revisited by Gee (1997). Gee emphasizes that "meaning is not in the head, but in social practices," underscoring the importance of acquiring social practices to grasp profound meanings freely. In this light, readers must engage in meaning-making and interpretation of texts and contexts across various communication modalities. For critical literacies, the ability to construct meaning emerges as a pivotal skill within new educational paradigms.
The incorporation of movies into critical literacies projects appears to align well with the project's objectives. Academic research on images has garnered significant attention, reflecting the growing importance of visual media in contemporary communication. This trend underscores the relevance of images in language and discourse studies within educational institutions. Integrating movies into critical literacies projects facilitates the examination and interpretation of visual content, aiding in the understanding of how meaning is constructed. Additionally, it provides insight into the processes through which this understanding and knowledge are developed, emphasizing the epistemological focus of the study.
French movie director Carriere (1995) posits that cinema has made the most significant contribution to the development of images and their respective theories, asserting that as an art form, the image in cinema has progressed more than in any other medium. Carriere elucidates that images have transitioned from sequential, static takes to a process allowing for editing, assembly, and juxtaposition of scenes. Furthermore, he notes the introduction of still points of view in film images to achieve specific effects. The evolution of image effects has been closely tied to the increasing availability of technical resources, culminating in independence and maturity with the emergence of video and computer-generated images. This perspective is echoed in Manovich’s analysis (2001, p. xiv-xxxix) of Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera (1929), where Manovich identifies the revolutionary potential of digital cinema in Vertov’s avant-garde aesthetic strategies. Manovich highlights the reemergence of avant-garde collage strategies in digital data manipulation, emphasizing the integration of animation, printed texts, and live-action footage in contemporary editing systems.
Manovich (2001, p. 9) asserts that computation has redefined established cultural forms such as photography and cinema. In discussing cinema images, the author underscores the significance of special effects in crafting the intended visuals by directors and producers. Manovich (op. cit., p. 303) elaborates on how the traditional method of arranging physical reality for filming, involving sets, models, art direction, and cinematography, has been supplanted by the manipulation of material on a computer, where the actual scene construction occurs. Furthermore, he notes a transition from rearranging reality to manipulating its images, indicating novel approaches to cultural production and knowledge generation that prompt fresh considerations in the realm of education.
Virillo's perspectives on movie images (1994) align with the arguments put forth by both Carriere and Manovich. Recognizing technology as the pivotal framework responsible for the transformative shifts in the interaction between images and viewers, Virillo introduces the concept of logics to delineate the evolution of images. He delineates three distinct logics across various socio-cultural epochs in Western history concerning man's engagement with labor. The formal logic, prevalent in engravings, paintings, and architecture until the 18th century, intertwines men's imagination and manual labor. Transitioning to the dialectic logic embodied by photography and cinema in the 19th century, advancements in industry, technology, and machinery facilitated the creation of image-capturing devices, expanding human capabilities through the camera lens in a dialectical relationship with the environment. In our contemporary computerized society, the logic of paradox reigns supreme, manifesting in video, holography, and computer-generated imagery - innovations of the 20th century. This concept alludes to technology's ability to blend the time of image production with its presentation time, disrupting the certainties of 'real time' and 'real space' established by the dialectic logic.
Virillo's conceptualization of logics, while seemingly rooted in traditional classificatory knowledge, offers a unique perspective that enriches our understanding of images within the epistemological framework inherent in the socio-cultural evolution of visual representations, intersecting with hermeneutic studies. Initially, Virillo's exploration of logics centered on artifacts like engravings, paintings, and architecture, emphasizing the need for contemplation and the decoding of messages or meanings. This aligns with hermeneutic studies, where interpretation was fundamental in deciphering embedded concepts, as elucidated by Ricoeur (1977). Moving into dialectic logic, the advent of photography and video introduced the concept of visual evidence, with television and print media utilizing images as proof of reported events. Television's evolution further blurred the line between image capture and dissemination, bolstering the credibility of conveyed evidence and reinforcing the notion of 'seeing is believing,' seemingly eliminating the need for interpretation. However, the paradoxical logic of digital communication challenges this notion, emphasizing the active role of both image and discourse in communication. Here, the interlocutor, akin to the flâneur described by Manovich (2001), becomes a user and co-producer of their discourse, navigating through a virtual landscape where choices, changes, and interventions shape their experience. This dynamic interaction, characterized by fluidity, discontinuity, and personal agency, reflects the essence of digital communication, where individuals construct their paths based on personal interests and engagement, diverging from the traditional parameters of dialectic logic. This transformative milieu, distinct from the flâneur's world, underscores the adaptive nature of individuals in navigating and thriving within this new digital environment.
In terms of the hermeneutic perspective on meaning-making, Ricoeur's (1977) theorization serves as the foundation for the analytical investigation. Ricoeur delineates two primary tendencies in interpretations prevalent in social discourse and advocates for a critical reevaluation of these two tendencies that form a socio-cultural interpretive cycle. The first tendency reflects the impact of religious values derived from biblical exegesis, where interpretations of biblical passages were rooted in concepts of analogy, allegory, and symbolic meaning, linking sacred text teachings to everyday life. Ricoeur extends this interpretive approach beyond religious realms to encompass fields like literature and social interactions. The second tendency pertains to the influence of traditions, with hermeneutic practices centered on passing down traditions across generations, effectively teaching how social events, behaviors, thoughts, and discourses should be understood, thereby establishing interpretive norms in society and aiding in the preservation of values, morals, and beliefs while guiding social discourse and interpretation. Ricoeur notes limitations in both interpretive tendencies, highlighting their tendency to confer authority to the text's author, as seen in religious contexts, and their failure to account for the dynamic dialectics inherent in social interactions and discourse, as evident in traditional interpretive patterns, thereby overlooking the reader, the enunciative locus, and societal and cultural shifts. Ricoeur suggests that a hermeneutics of suspicion might align better with the interpretive process, enabling interlocutors to question meanings derived from religious or tradition-based interpretive practices and construct their own contextualized and situated interpretations. This approach, known as critical hermeneutics in academic circles, offers the potential to deconstruct and reconstruct meanings, a principle central to critical literacy projects. These theoretical underpinnings, including critical literacies and studies on images and meaning-making, form the analytical framework for the focused investigation.
The phenomenon of online relationships, encompassing chat-rooms, online dating, and other virtual platforms, has been extensively researched in terms of discourse, narrative construction, psychological impacts, and cultural implications. In Brazil, a doctoral study conducted by Castro (2006) delves into the realm of chat-rooms, specifically focusing on women's narrative development within virtual relationships. The research highlights how engaging in virtual interactions allows individuals to adopt "on-line personae," facilitating freedom of expression, imagination, and storytelling. Through the lens of performativity, the researcher explores how women temporarily displace their identities to assume various roles and masks in virtual spaces, constructing performative narratives. In this context, individuals can freely experiment with different personas, unbound by the constraints of traditional social norms. The virtual environment offers a unique platform for individuals to engage in intimate interactions, where social masks are shed, enabling the creation of limitless virtual representations. Participation in virtual dating involves elements such as the participants' proactive engagement in seeking virtual companionship and adherence to certain participation norms, like the use of pseudonyms to conceal identities and craft performative narratives, as elucidated by Castro.
In the investigation concerning movie viewers' interpretation processes, the film chosen for analysis was "Eyes Wide Shut" (Stanley Kubrick, 2003), which delves into the dynamics of a couple's relationship. The narrative of the movie portrays a seemingly enduring and successful partnership between the couple. However, both partners find themselves in situations where they engage with other individuals: Alice shares a fantasy she harbors, while Bill is drawn to a "secret community" or club that piques his curiosity, exhibiting traits commonly associated with chat-room users. Bill's involvement, for instance, necessitates initiative and the acquisition of a password for entry into the clandestine group, where participants don masks and disguises to ensure anonymity and confidentiality. The activities within this covert setting, characterized by fleeting, uncommitted interactions and the freedom to act without the constraints of conventional relationships, mirror the dynamics of online relationships. The parallels between participation in the visually depicted secret community in the film and engagement in the mentally or virtually represented chat-room among users highlight similar relationship rituals within distinct discursive contexts. Consequently, the study aimed to explore how chat-room users interpret a movie that resonates with the narratives they construct in online relationships, thereby fostering a sense of familiarity and connection.
From an epistemological standpoint, the survey aimed to explore students' capacity to transfer the perceptions they cultivate in their interactions with one form of text (such as 'online dating' or 'virtual relationships' in chat-rooms) to another form (movies). By engaging students in an interpretative exercise using a movie, the survey sought to uncover: 1) the interpretations students derived from the movie's plot; 2) the process of meaning-making through a 'performance epistemology', examining both chat-room users and movie viewers to understand the interconnected practices across these two mediums. The inquiry into meaning-making through a 'performance epistemology' aimed to reveal how students construct meaning when faced with a non-linear text lacking clear sequences or definitive evidence, necessitating them to create interpretations "in the absence of a model or exemplar" (Lankshear & Knobel, 2003, p. 173). This process involves elements of assemblage (akin to 'bricolage'), transferring materials or knowledge between contexts (similar to 'collage'), and integrating borrowed elements into a new context (resembling 'montage'). These creative mental processes have been observed in young people's online activities, where they engage in multimodal communication (using colored fonts, emoticons, sound, and images), create short films for platforms like YouTube, and actively contribute to the discourse within their communities. The study was designed, data collected, and analyzed based on these foundational principles.
The study reveals that students' interpretations of the movie center around the storyboard available on IMDb.com. They depict a couple's relationship that appears strained, showcasing the aftermath of Alice confessing her attraction to another man, leaving Bill bewildered. Subsequently, Bill visits a private club, encountering shocking scenes that both he and the audience witness, leading to a harrowing experience within the club. Ultimately, the couple reconciles by the movie's conclusion. Previous research on how students construct meaning in Brazilian universities has highlighted a prevalent interpretive tendency known in hermeneutics as the 'preservation of cultural traditions', a concept critiqued by Ricoeur as a conventional aspect of interpretative practices. As discussed earlier, this traditional interpretive approach often reinforces a dualistic societal perspective, distinguishing between good and evil, true and untrue, and other binary distinctions. This perspective suggests a social learning process where norms and patterns are to be understood and upheld. The students' responses indicate that the movie primarily explores the challenges faced by couples, yet ultimately resolves these conflicts in a positive manner. Their interpretations often convey the message that 'real love can overcome relationship obstacles', hinting at the importance of preserving the institution of marriage with love serving as a supporting element.
In this section where participants are tasked with elucidating the significance they derived from Eyes Wide Shut, there is a notable emphasis on the rituals and scenarios depicted within Kubrick's fictional private club. However, these interpretations are often qualified with terms like 'shocking,' 'threatening,' and 'confusing,' which frequently characterize the "secret community" visited by the character Bill. This suggests a certain challenge faced by students in integrating the unconventional private club scenes into their understanding of a conventional couple's relationship. The initial findings of the study reveal that students tend to engage in a tradition-oriented hermeneutic approach, emphasizing the traditional values associated with a couple's relationship while simultaneously rejecting those deemed socially unacceptable, as prescribed by traditional hermeneutic principles.
In another session of the investigation, further instances of meaning-making were observed as students were questioned about the correlation between virtual relationships in chat rooms and those depicted in a movie. Surprisingly, all the students interviewed, without exception, failed to identify any connection between the two. Some expressed their astonishment and curiosity through written comments, with one viewer questioning the necessity of any relationship between the two scenarios. Another student highlighted the distinction, stating that chat room narratives are more authentic and organic, shaped online based on user ideas and interests, while movie narratives are preconceived in a script and inherently fictional. This insight underscores the students' comprehension of the dichotomy between fictional and non-fictional narratives in online and cinematic contexts. The study, conducted with an exploratory intent, aimed to explore the practice of transferring knowledge across different contexts or utilizing borrowed elements in new settings, aligning with a performance epistemology. Despite the seemingly unconventional link between chat room interactions and movie narratives, the research also revealed that students do not naturally transfer their ability to derive meaning from one communication modality to another. This suggests that such skills require deliberate practice, as indicated in subsequent discussions.
During a subsequent group interview intended for data elaboration and clarification, the students expressed their curiosity regarding the correlation between online relationships and the couple's relationship depicted in the movie. They were informed about the potential association between the virtual relationships in chat-rooms and the fictional yet illustrative relationships in Eyes Wide Shut, highlighting common elements such as participant engagement, exclusive spaces (online chat-rooms or private clubs) necessitating passwords or nicknames for access, identity displacement, masks, and a degree of permissiveness. The majority of students found this comparison logical, although they acknowledged that arriving at this insight independently would have been challenging. Some students expressed the need for additional time to contemplate the comparison, revealing uncertainty regarding the proposed interpretation.
During the session, participants noted that while they were able to identify the movie content with social situations based on their own knowledge, they were either surprised or shocked by the images depicting the relationships within the private club in Eyes Wide Shut. When asked about the comparison between chat-room environments and the club depicted in the movie, they acknowledged that certain chat-room narratives, if visually represented, could resemble scenes from the club, particularly those illustrating the pursuit of a partner. However, the prevailing sentiment among them was a reluctance to participate in such a club. They elaborated that despite the parallels drawn between chat-rooms and the club, the mental representations of relationships in chat-rooms are private and do not impose any constraints on the user. One student emphasized that she would not disclose her chat-room interactions to her partner if he was not part of that online community. Drawing a parallel to the character Bill's insecurity in the film, she expressed her belief that individuals unfamiliar with the language and norms of a specific community may struggle to comprehend its communication and practices.
According to critical literacy studies, the process of meaning-making involves interference, decision-making, and transformation, which includes dismantling established meanings and constructing new ones. These actions enable interpreters to shift virtual or non-virtual images between different contexts and engage in a playful exploration of the conventions of "real time." However, feedback from viewers suggests that while individuals may interact with digital communication platforms that allow for intervention, they do not necessarily apply the same logic to their engagement with the visual language of cinema. Instead, relationships appear to be shaped by the norms and expectations dictated by specific environments. While this observation may initially seem disappointing, it offers valuable insights for potential revisions to university curricula, particularly in light of digital epistemologies, which is a key objective of the ongoing research.
An insight gleaned from this analysis, which warrants further exploration, suggests that students' responses may indicate an educational system ill-equipped to meet the demands of a networked society, as described by Castells (1999) in his depiction of contemporary society. In today's world, individuals—be they students, citizens, or professionals—are no longer confined to a "typographic mind" but are expected to cultivate a "network mind." This entails the ability to synthesize information, forge connections between various discourses, construct new meanings from images and visual language as necessary, and reassess communication norms and dynamics.
The research findings suggest that within this university group, traditional epistemology remains prevalent, while the concept of a networked mind within a digital epistemology framework is more commonly observed in online environments characterized by digital language. Moreover, the analysis of films and images reveals a dominance of conventional interpretative methods, aligning with Ricoeur's (1977) traditional hermeneutic approach that emphasizes understanding existing meanings rather than co-creating meaning with the audience. When it comes to viewer perceptions of images, the medium or format appears to determine the expected relationships, limiting opportunities for networking across different contexts, as noted by Castells (1999). In light of these findings, the article argues that technological advancements necessitate a fresh approach to interpreting images, advocating for increased network interactions to facilitate the exchange of ideas across diverse discourses and settings, as emphasized by Virillo's (1994) concept of paradoxical logic. This underscores the importance of reevaluating educational practices to address evolving literacy needs in a networked society.
Epistemological studies have underscored that traditional models of knowledge construction, which involve breaking down complex concepts into manageable parts and organizing reasoning based on predetermined levels of complexity, may no longer suffice in today's society, as argued by Morin (2000). Similarly, Lankshear & Snyder (2000, p. 39) highlight the importance of increasing awareness regarding technology and education. They note the rapid societal changes that necessitate individuals to rethink and reshape themselves within their institutions, thereby requiring new modes of thinking to adapt to reimagined forms of literacy, subject matter, and learning.
A deeper understanding of digital language and the individuals within a digitized society is essential for informing the development, planning, and promotion of appropriate literacies that cater to the evolving needs of modern societies. This research highlights the necessity of enhancing critical literacies to align with the demands of the surveyed environment, ensuring that individuals are equipped to navigate and engage effectively in the digital landscape.
