The initial significant wave of emigration from Timor occurred following the Indonesian invasion and subsequent occupation of the eastern region of the island in 1975. Many individuals and entire families fled as refugees, aided by the International Red Cross, in search of a new and more peaceful life abroad, primarily relocating to Australia or Portugal. During this tumultuous period, some Timorese also sought refuge in countries like Mozambique, which had similarly experienced Portuguese colonization. In the 1990s, amid the final phase of resistance against Indonesian rule, a notable number of Timorese students took refuge in foreign embassies in Jakarta, Indonesia, as a result of student-led demonstrations both in Timor and Indonesia (FERNANDES, 2011). Most of these students eventually made their way to Portugal, where they received financial support for several years to continue their education, with some later migrating to the UK as workers.
