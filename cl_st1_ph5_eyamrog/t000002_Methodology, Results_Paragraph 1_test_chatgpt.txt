Analyzing discursive interaction is an inherently subjective endeavor that involves constructing meaning from the thoughts and voices of others, which are influenced by social, cultural, and contextual factors. This analytical process requires significant interpretation and is closely tied to reflexivity, as researchers inevitably bring their own preconceptions, interests, biases, and agendas to the analysis (Cohen et al., 2007).
