By narrowing our research focus to the various activities surrounding football clubs, we gained valuable insights into the complex and multifaceted processes of identity formation within this migration context. The construction of diverse Timorese identities was intricately linked to both historical and contemporary factors. These identities were manifested through linguistic resources as well as a variety of semiotic elements, including imagery, color, and an array of material, textual, and online resources. As illustrated in Table 2, some clubs emphasized regional identity, while others promoted inclusivity and a broader sense of Timorese identity. Certain branding practices, such as the incorporation of national flag colors in logos (as shown in Figure 1) and in the ribbons for medals (depicted in Figure 3), signified national identity. Additionally, some clubs embraced symbols of cultural heritage, including woven tais and the image of the crocodile. Moreover, linguistic resources and symbols associated with international football culture were intricately intertwined with these diverse representations of Timorese identity.
