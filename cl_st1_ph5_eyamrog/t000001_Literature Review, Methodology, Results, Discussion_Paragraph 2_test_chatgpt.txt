If culturing and DNA extraction are performed multiple times—for instance, once for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing and again for Illumina sequencing—there is a risk of genomic discrepancies between the DNA samples. Such discrepancies can complicate the polishing process; therefore, we recommend utilizing a single DNA extract for all sequencing runs. Additionally, it may be advisable to freeze extra DNA or bacterial pellets to facilitate any potential future sequencing needs.
