When heterogeneity occurs at a low level (e.g. 95% of the reads support one sequence and 5% another), it does not typically cause problems as assemblers\/polishers will use the more common alternative. However, balanced heterogeneity (e.g. a 50:50 mixture) can cause misassemblies and polishing mistakes. The phase variation of the fim switch is one cause of heterogeneity in Enterobacteriaceae44 (Figure 2E). Another common example occurs with bacteriophages, which can integrate into and excise from bacterial chromosomes45 (Figure 2F). Heterogeneity can be identified by incomplete assembly graphs and dense clusters of changes made by a polisher.

Researchers operating within this framework contend that meanings are not predetermined but are co-created through interaction, prompting them to engage with participants in various activities and solicit their perspectives (Treagust et al., 2014). According to Guba and Lincoln (1994), this approach is rooted in a relativist ontology and a subjectivist epistemology. Relativist ontology posits that \"realities are apprehendable in the form of multiple, intangible mental constructions, socially and experientially based\" (p. 110), while subjectivist epistemology suggests that \"the investigator and the object of investigation are assumed to be interactively linked so that the 'findings' are created as the investigation proceeds\" (p. 111). Within this paradigm, human beings are regarded as agents of their own actions and architects of their environments, leading to the characterization of this perspective as both subjectivist and voluntarist (Cohen et al., 2007)."}

Sociolinguists conducting research in multilingual contexts have engaged with the concept of mobility in various ways, adopting new theoretical frameworks.

The concept of trajectory allows for the consideration of the intersecting dimensions of time and space, moving beyond synchronic analyses. Furthermore, it facilitates the exploration of the complexities inherent in contemporary transnational movements, including those characterized by extended sojourns in various countries, which provide access to a range of linguistic resources and bodies of knowledge."}

Two main political developments lay behind this increase in migration: First, the culmination of the Peace Process in Northern Ireland on December 2, 1999, and the subsequent change in the political economy of this region of the UK, including inward investment in infrastructure. Second, the accession of different nation-states in Eastern Europe and the Baltic to the European Union, from 2004. This expansion of the European Union facilitated labour migration, to the Republic of Ireland (in the south) and to Northern Ireland, from Poland and from the Baltic States, especially from Lithuania (CORRIGAN et al., 2015, DOYLE; McAREAVEY, 2016).

While the initial groups of Timorese migrants found work almost immediately and even had their passage from Portugal financed (Interview with RS and HA, June 2015), more recent arrivals have encountered a significantly longer wait, typically ranging from 5 to 8 months before securing full-time positions. Additionally, there has been a notable increase in the casualization of employment, leading to newcomers often being offered part-time work on an ad hoc basis. One interviewee vividly described the insecurity and anxiety experienced by him and his colleagues over an eight-month period due to the precariousness of their situation, stating, \u201cNe\u2019eb\u00e9 telefone ami tau deit iha ulun leten \u2026kualk\u00e9r tempu deit [sira] liga ona\u201d (We slept with our phones above our heads \u2026they could call us at any time) (Interview with CX, June 2015).

Additionally, the club manager remarked (in English) that all football clubs had increasingly become vital in fostering community connections and had become \"better organized in the last few years\" (Same interview with MFB, June 5, 2015)."}

The tournaments brought all the clubs together in sports events so that, in this Irish context, they were seen as part of one diasporic community, with its origins in the nation of Timor-Leste. Of particular significance too is that fact, mentioned above, that details of these tournaments were regularly posted on Facebook and YouTube and viewed by people in Timor-Leste and across the diaspora. These regular postings were part of wider digital practices and intense uses of mobile technology across the transnationally connected Timorese diaspora. One further insight that we have gleaned thus far is that the particular migration trajectories, communicative repertoires and funds of knowledge of some Timorese in this setting in Northern Ireland have positioned them in ways that enable them to take a lead in setting up group activities of a distinctive nature, whether it be a football club with a particular ethos, or cultural groups (such as the choir mentioned earlier) that are oriented to particular aspects of Timorese cultural heritage. So, for some, there is considerable scope for exercising individual agency, at least within local life worlds \u2013 scope for creating spaces of solidarity and conviviality, through organisational practices that involve complex and situated uses of linguistic and semiotic resources.

These tournaments united various clubs in sporting events, fostering a sense of belonging to a single diasporic community rooted in Timor-Leste, particularly within the Irish context. Notably, details of these tournaments were frequently shared on platforms such as Facebook and YouTube, garnering views from individuals in Timor-Leste and the broader diaspora. These regular digital postings were part of extensive digital practices and the intensive use of mobile technology among the transnationally connected Timorese diaspora. Additionally, we have observed that the unique migration trajectories, communicative repertoires, and funds of knowledge of certain Timorese individuals in Northern Ireland have empowered them to take the initiative in establishing distinctive group activities, whether through football clubs with specific ethos or cultural groups, such as the aforementioned choir, that celebrate particular aspects of Timorese heritage. Consequently, for some individuals, there exists significant potential for exercising agency within local contexts, creating spaces of solidarity and conviviality through organizational practices that involve complex and contextually situated uses of linguistic and semiotic resources. Simultaneously, these processes of adaptation to a new country are fostering a robust sense of shared history and belonging linked to their nation of origin."}
