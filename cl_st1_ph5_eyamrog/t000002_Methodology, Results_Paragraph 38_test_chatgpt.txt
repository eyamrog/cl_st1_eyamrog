In the following extract (3), students had just read a brief text on particle theory and were collaboratively answering questions from a handout. During these interactions, the teacher accepted a range of responses, including terms such as "separate," "get further away from each other," and "move faster." She also explicitly solicited two additional terms (lines 50 and 53), successfully eliciting "energy" and "freely." The teacher appeared to be seeking key concepts from the text as expressed by the students. With these anticipated responses, or their synonyms, the teacher delivered a comprehensive explanation in the final line. However, the questions posed were not classified as dialogic (lines 50, 53, and 55) because the expected answers were already provided in the handout; thus, students were merely vocalizing these responses, albeit hesitantly, as indicated in line 56. While it can be argued that students' comprehension of the text was assessed, it is more challenging to assert that their understanding of the explanations was thoroughly explored.
