Consequently, our broader research project encompasses the various social spaces navigated by the young Timorese migrants involved in our study. While this paper primarily concentrates on the convivial spaces they are cultivating within their local life worlds, as well as the processes through which they are constructing diverse identities in these contexts and utilizing digital resources to communicate these practices and identities to family and friends in Timor-Leste, the overarching project also examines their lived experiences of daily social life in the small-town environments they inhabit and their efforts to access different employment opportunities. Additionally, we consider how their positioning within these workplaces is influenced by the language resources and knowledge assets at their disposal.
