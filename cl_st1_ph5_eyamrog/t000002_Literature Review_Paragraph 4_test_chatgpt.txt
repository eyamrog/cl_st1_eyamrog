Different research paradigms can exhibit markedly contrasting characteristics, particularly when examining the two predominant perspectives. The first paradigm, which is positivist, nomothetic, and confirmatory, focuses on definitive and objective knowledge, aims to identify general patterns or laws, and tests hypotheses. The foundational assumption of this paradigm is that “it is possible to report unambiguous truth, in terms of observable phenomena and verified facts” (Taber, 2013, p. 49). Guba and Lincoln (1994) noted that this approach is rooted in a realistic ontology and an objectivist epistemology. Realistic ontology posits that “an apprehendable reality is assumed to exist, driven by immutable natural laws and mechanisms” (p. 109), while objectivist epistemology maintains that “the investigator and the investigated ‘object’ are assumed to be independent entities, and the investigator is capable of studying the object without influencing it or being influenced by it” (p. 110). This perspective on social science is characterized as objectivist and determinist, as it views human beings as products of their environment and as responses to it (Cohen et al., 2007).
