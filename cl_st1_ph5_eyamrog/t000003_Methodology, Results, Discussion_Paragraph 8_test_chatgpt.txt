All members of the core group possessed modest material resources at the time of their decision to migrate north, sufficient to cover the costs of their long-haul flights from Timor-Leste to Europe as well as their living expenses while seeking employment. For instance, MFB had worked at an Indonesian bank during the Indonesian occupation (1975-1999) and subsequently joined a non-governmental organization following Timor-Leste's independence in 2002 (Interview with MFB, June 2015). Similarly, CX, a male nurse, served with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) during the three-year UN administration (1999-2002) before transitioning to the national health service in Timor-Leste after independence (Interview with CX, June 2015). DA had worked as a driver for a government department post-independence (Interview with DA, June 2015), while AX was employed as a porter in a warehouse in Dili, where he carried sacks of rice, and also worked as a construction laborer.
