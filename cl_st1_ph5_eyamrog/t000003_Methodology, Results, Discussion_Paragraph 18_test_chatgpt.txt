Two local employment agencies serve as gatekeepers for individuals seeking employment. While the initial groups of Timorese migrants found work almost immediately and even had their passage from Portugal financed (Interview with RS and HA, June 2015), more recent arrivals have encountered a significantly longer wait, typically ranging from 5 to 8 months before securing full-time positions. Additionally, there has been a notable increase in the casualization of employment, leading to newcomers often being offered part-time work on an ad hoc basis. One interviewee vividly described the insecurity and anxiety experienced by him and his colleagues over an eight-month period due to the precariousness of their situation, stating, “Ne’ebé telefone ami tau deit iha ulun leten …kualkér tempu deit [sira] liga ona” (We slept with our phones above our heads …they could call us at any time) (Interview with CX, June 2015). For those Timorese who do manage to secure full-time employment, the working hours are extensive, typically involving twelve-hour shifts; however, overtime is no longer compensated, as the work schedule now alternates weekly, requiring employees to work five days one week and only two days the following week.
