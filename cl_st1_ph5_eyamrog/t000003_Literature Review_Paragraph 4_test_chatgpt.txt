In conjunction with the critique of essentialized notions of community, a significant shift has emerged within the social sciences towards the study of contemporary mobilities. This broad epistemological transition has moved away from "sedentarist approaches" (HANNAM et al., 2006, p. 5) and has fostered a heightened focus on mobility, deterritorialization, and the intensification and diversification of transnational population movements. Sociolinguists conducting research in multilingual contexts have engaged with the concept of mobility in various ways, adopting new theoretical frameworks. For instance, Heller (2011, p. 5-6) contends that we must redirect our attention "from stability to mobility" and fundamentally rethink both theory and methodology in this field of study. She asserts, "Tools of enquiry refined when the focus was on boundaries, stability and homogeneity require refashioning for addressing movement, diversity and multiplicity" (HELLER, 2007, p. 6). Rather than concentrating on "stable communities," Heller emphasizes the importance of examining the trajectories of diverse social actors over time and space, thereby fostering an understanding of how their communicative repertoires are shaped within these trajectories. The concept of trajectory allows for the consideration of the intersecting dimensions of time and space, moving beyond synchronic analyses. Furthermore, it facilitates the exploration of the complexities inherent in contemporary transnational movements, including those characterized by extended sojourns in various countries, which provide access to a range of linguistic resources and bodies of knowledge.
