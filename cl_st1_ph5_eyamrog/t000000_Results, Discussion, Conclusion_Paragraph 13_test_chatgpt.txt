The rhizomes are characterized as short-creeping and possess primitive scales. The leaves range from small to medium-sized, measuring approximately 20 cm to 1 m in length, with laminae that can be simple or up to 3-pinnate. The indumentum is either absent or consists of 2-celled glandular hairs, while the veins are generally free. Sori are located marginally or submarginally, appearing elongate and borne on the commissural veins. The inner indusia are modified and elongated, whereas the outer indusia remain unmodified (Smith et al. 2006).
