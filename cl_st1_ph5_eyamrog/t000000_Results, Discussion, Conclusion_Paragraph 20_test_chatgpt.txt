The genus Orthiopteris, which encompasses approximately 24 species and is distributed pantropically (Rojas-Alvarado 2010; Luong et al. 2015; Schwartsburd 2020; Schwartsburd 2022), has been phylogenetically justified for the Paleotropical species; however, it lacks sufficient morphological support. Consequently, it is more appropriate to consider only Saccoloma within the Saccolomataceae family (Schwartsburd 2022). In Brazil, a total of nine species are currently recognized (Schwartsburd 2022).
