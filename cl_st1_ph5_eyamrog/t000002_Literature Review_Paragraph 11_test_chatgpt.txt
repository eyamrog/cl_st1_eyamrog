At this stage, three critical aspects must be considered regarding the adoption of a research paradigm. First, the chosen paradigm should provide a consistent and coherent framework throughout all phases of the study (Taber, 2013, p. 55). Second, various paradigms serve distinct purposes and employ different methodologies, which ultimately lead to divergent outcomes (p. 68). Third, any research inherently aligns with a paradigm; if this alignment is not explicitly stated, it is often implicitly reflected in the formulation and addressing of the research questions (p. 68). These considerations underscore the necessity of carefully examining the relationship between the research objectives and the most suitable methods for achieving them.
