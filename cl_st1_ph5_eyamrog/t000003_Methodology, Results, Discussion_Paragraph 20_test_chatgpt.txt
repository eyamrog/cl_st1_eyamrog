As demonstrated in the preceding discussion, Timorese migrants in Dungannon and Cookstown have encountered significant social, economic, and linguistic obstacles in their pursuit of housing and employment while establishing their new lives in these communities. Concurrently, within their local environments, they are actively cultivating spaces that foster solidarity and conviviality. By examining how Timorese men and women are anchoring (or, in some instances, re-anchoring) themselves in these small Northern Irish towns, we gain valuable insights into their agency in constructing new lives within unfamiliar contexts, despite the myriad challenges they face.
