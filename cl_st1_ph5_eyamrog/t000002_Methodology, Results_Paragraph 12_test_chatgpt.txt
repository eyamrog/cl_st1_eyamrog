In conclusion, this framework enabled a comprehensive analysis of classroom discourse and the assessment of dialogicity, which were central to the research questions. The characterization of classroom talk was achieved by comparing the frequency of various codes across different contexts—namely content, instruction, and off-topic discussions—while dialogicity was evaluated by examining the ratio of dialogic utterances to simple utterances.
