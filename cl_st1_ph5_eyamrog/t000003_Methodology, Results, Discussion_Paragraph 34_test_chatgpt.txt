In addition to the annual tournaments, individual clubs organize friendly matches with Timorese teams located in various regions of the UK. For instance, in 2014, the FC Lao Rai United football team expanded its schedule of fixtures by traveling to Northwich, just south of Manchester, to compete in a friendly match against a local Timorese team. Since that time, additional friendly matches and tournaments have taken place in locations such as Oxford and Peterborough. Photographs and video recordings of these events, along with the accompanying festivities, are shared on platforms like Facebook and YouTube, where they receive views and comments—predominantly in Tetum—from friends and family members in Timor-Leste, as well as from other members of the Timorese diaspora in the UK, Portugal, South Korea, and Australia. Football enjoys significant popularity in Timor-Leste, evidenced by the existence of a national team; notably, a former member of this team was playing for FC Lao Rai in Dungannon at the time of our research. While football is also played in local schools throughout Timor-Leste, a lack of resources hampers the organization of regional teams. Furthermore, matches featuring prominent European football clubs, such as the national team of Portugal and regional clubs in the UK like Manchester United, are accessible for viewing on television or online in Timor-Leste, leading to a growing trend of supporters aligning themselves with specific football teams.
