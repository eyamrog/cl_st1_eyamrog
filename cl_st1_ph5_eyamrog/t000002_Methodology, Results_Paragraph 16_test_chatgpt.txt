The data warrant further investigation by examining variations in the frequencies of codes across different tasks (question 2) and employing statistical analyses to identify significant differences. The dataset demonstrated suitability for non-parametric tests aimed at comparing three or more populations, as evidenced by Fligner-Killeenâ€™s test, which remained above the significance threshold for all codes except the D_EVA code when comparing tasks or groups (p > 0.05). This finding facilitated the use of non-parametric tests, specifically the Kruskal-Wallis test and the post-hoc Nemenyi test, to analyze group comparisons. Additionally, the codes labeled as 'other' and 'inaudible' were excluded from the analysis to ensure the integrity of the results.
