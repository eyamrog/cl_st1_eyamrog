Rhizomes may vary from short to long-creeping and can be either glabrous or covered with catenate hairs. The leaves are notably large, reaching lengths of up to 4 meters, with laminae that are 2-4 pinnate. The venation is free, and the indumentum may consist of catenate hairs, acicular hairs, or may be entirely absent. Sori are marginal and discrete, located at the tips of individual veins, while the inner and outer indusia are fused, forming structures that are purse-shaped, cup-shaped, or hemi-globose (Smith et al. 2006).
