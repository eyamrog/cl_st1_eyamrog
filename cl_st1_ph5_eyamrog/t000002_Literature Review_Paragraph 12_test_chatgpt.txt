All paradigms can be effectively applied to generate new insights when analyzing classroom interaction. For instance, the positivist approach necessitates the simplification of social practices to render research manageable, typically involving the selection of specific dialogue variables while controlling for others related to learning outcomes (Asterhan et al., 2020). This methodology enables researchers to draw conclusions about the impact of dialogic teaching on student learning. Conversely, the interpretivist paradigm offers a more nuanced understanding of dialogue dynamics, often through ethnographic case studies that explore the cultural context of the classroom setting (Asterhan et al., 2020). Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, distinct methods are required for each paradigm when addressing research questions of varying natures. Ultimately, this discussion paper aims to elucidate these methodological distinctions.
