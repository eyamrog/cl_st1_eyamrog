Positivist research is characterized by its pursuit of objectivity, measurability, predictability, controllability, and the establishment of laws and rules governing behavior, all aimed at generating causal explanations to substantiate claims (Cohen et al., 2007, p. 26; Treagust et al., 2014). In this framework, quantitative methods are particularly suited to this perspective, as they endeavor to represent social reality through predetermined categories and measurements while also offering causal-effect explanations.
