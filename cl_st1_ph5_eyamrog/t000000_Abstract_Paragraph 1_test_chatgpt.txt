As part of an ongoing project focused on the ferns and lycophytes of the Viçosa region in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, this study provides a taxonomic treatment of the early divergent lineages of leptosporangiate ferns, specifically the families Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and Saccolomataceae. Since 2012, we have been sampling the remnant forest patches in this area and have conducted a comprehensive review of the herbarium collection at VIC, as well as other online collections, including F, IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. In the Viçosa region, we identified six taxa belonging to these families: Dennstaedtia cicutaria and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Dennstaedtiaceae); Lindsaea lancea var. lancea, L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta var. stricta (Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma elegans (Saccolomataceae). Notably, only L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, while the other taxa are more widely distributed throughout the Neotropics. This article includes keys, detailed descriptions, illustrations, examined specimens, and additional comments to support the taxonomic assessment.
