Our interviews with football club organizers and managers provided valuable insights into the extensive organizational efforts involved in running these clubs. Most individuals in leadership positions demonstrated a commendable level of English proficiency, enabling effective communication. They possessed substantial knowledge of UK fundraising practices and the logistics associated with scheduling and organizing sports events in Northern Ireland. Their responsibilities included securing funding for the team and tournaments, booking pitches, and hiring Irish referees. Additionally, they were tasked with arranging local sponsorships; for instance, a local law firm sponsored Ramkabian, while a taxi company in Cookstown supported Fitun Unidade. These sponsorships facilitated the acquisition of football shirts, jackets for players, and awards such as medals and cups for the tournaments. Notably, two players from the Lao Rai club had previously represented the national team of Timor-Leste before migrating to Northern Ireland, thereby contributing a professional dimension to the organization of the club's activities.
