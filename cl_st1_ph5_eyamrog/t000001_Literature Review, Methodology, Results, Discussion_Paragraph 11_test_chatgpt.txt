Long-read polishing is conducted prior to short-read polishing due to its reduced susceptibility to the effects of genomic repeats. In this context, a 'repeat' refers to a sequence that causes reads to align to multiple or incorrect positions within the genome. For instance, certain 150-bp short reads may fall within the rRNA operon, resulting in alignment to multiple locations and categorizing the operon as a repeat, which hinders the ability of polishing algorithms to correct errors effectively. In contrast, 20 kbp long reads can encompass the entire rRNA operon, allowing for unique alignment and thereby preventing the operon from being classified as a repeat. This unique alignment ensures that polishing modifications are applied accurately to the correct instances of the operon.
