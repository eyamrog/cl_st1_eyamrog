To address the question of whether the groups became more dialogic (question 3), we compared the aggregated results of non-dialogic utterances, which encompass the sum of codes 1, 3, and 5, with those classified as dialogic, represented by codes 2, 4, and 6. Given that the measures of dialogic and non-dialogic utterances are complementary, it is sufficient to perform the statistical analysis on only one of these categories.
