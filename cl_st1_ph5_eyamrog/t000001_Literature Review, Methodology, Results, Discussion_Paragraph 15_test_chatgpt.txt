Due to its conservative nature, Polypolish may overlook errors that other short-read polishers are capable of correcting, particularly in regions with low Illumina coverage. However, it is important to note that alternative polishers may inadvertently introduce new errors, which is unacceptable when striving for optimal accuracy. Consequently, we recommend exploring other short-read polishers while ensuring that any modifications are manually evaluated using a tool such as IGV. By examining the read alignments at a specific locus before and after polishing, researchers can determine whether a change has rectified an error—thus warranting its retention—or has introduced a new error, which should be discarded. Recommended polishers include POLCA, noted for its low rate of error introduction, and FMLRC2, recognized for its capability to correct errors that other polishers may miss.
