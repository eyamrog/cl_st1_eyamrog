The Young Crocs team was established for Timorese boys aged 14 to 19 who were growing up in Northern Ireland and speaking Irish English. The team's name reflects their new orientation towards English, while the reference to young crocodiles serves as a cultural marker of Timorese identity, as the shape of the island of Timor is often likened to that of a crocodile. Additionally, the name FC Tahi Calu carries multiple connotations, including gendered implications; it literally translates to "male sea," which geographically refers to the southeastern region of Timor-Leste, known for its stronger tides. This name also possesses a masculine connotation, as in Fataluku (similar to Tetum), a calm sea is metaphorically described as a "female sea," whereas a rough sea is referred to as a "male sea."
