The data utilized in this study originates from a prior project that implemented a classroom-based intervention aimed at fostering dialogue among students. The second module of the Teacher Professional Development (TPD) program was structured around a predetermined set of classroom materials designed to facilitate significant student engagement in both discussion and critical thinking. This approach enabled students to formulate their own theories regarding water evaporation, drawing upon their observations and everyday experiences (SPRinG, n.d.).
