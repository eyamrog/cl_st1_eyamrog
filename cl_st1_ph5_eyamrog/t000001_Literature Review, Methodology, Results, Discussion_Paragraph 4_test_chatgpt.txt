Another important consideration is the length of the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads, specifically the N50 length, which is a widely utilized metric representing the length-weighted median. To achieve a comprehensive genome assembly, it is essential for the read set to have an N50 length that exceeds that of the longest repeat sequence present in the genome. In many bacterial genomes, this longest repeat is typically the rRNA operon, which measures approximately 5 kilobases (kbp) and is usually found in multiple copies. Consequently, an ONT read N50 of around 20 kbp is considered an appropriate target. In rare instances where the genome contains an exceptionally long repeat, as discussed in the section on Pitfalls, it may be necessary to employ ultra-long DNA extraction protocols.
