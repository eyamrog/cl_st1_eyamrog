The second method examined in this paper is sociocultural discourse analysis, which emphasizes the contextual and situational aspects of speech acts while enhancing the interpretation of participants' contributions. This qualitative approach can illuminate the underlying intentions and responses of participants, allowing researchers to transcend the data and identify missed opportunities for elaboration or challenge (Hennessy et al., 2020, p. 6). By categorizing extracts in their entirety, this method facilitates the development of models rather than merely documenting the presence or absence of specific discourse moves, resulting in the generation of categories and typologies as emergent outcomes rather than predetermined classifications (Mercer, 2010).
