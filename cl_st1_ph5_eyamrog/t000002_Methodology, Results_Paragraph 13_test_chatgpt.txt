This positivist approach to coding presupposes that the codes can effectively encapsulate the components or characteristics of the discursive interaction. In pursuit of objectivity, the coding scheme was subjected to testing for inter-rater reliability. To facilitate this process, three Master's students collaborated with the researcher to pilot and refine the scheme, establish coding rules, and ensure consistency in the application of the codes.
