In the research conducted by Author (XXXX), three key questions were explored regarding group-work interaction: 1) How can small-group dialogue in a Brazilian primary school be characterized? 2) How did this dialogue evolve throughout the course of the intervention? and 3) Did the groups become more dialogic? This study was situated within a teacher professional development program aimed at fostering dialogic discourse in both small-group settings and whole-class instruction.
