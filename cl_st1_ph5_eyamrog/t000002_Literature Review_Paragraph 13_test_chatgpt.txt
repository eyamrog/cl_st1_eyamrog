For didactic purposes, the following sections are organized into quantitative and qualitative methods. Each section includes a concise overview of a specific analytical procedure, accompanied by its application to authentic classroom discursive data derived from a prior project. The research questions and findings are presented as illustrative examples of how to operationalize various paradigms and methods. Consequently, the aim is not to engage in a discussion of the new insights on dialogic teaching that emerge from this data.
