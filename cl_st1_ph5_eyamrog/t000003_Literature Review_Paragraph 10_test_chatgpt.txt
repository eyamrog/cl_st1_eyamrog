Simultaneously, we recognize that south-north migration is intricately linked to global power asymmetries and significant economic transformations characteristic of late capitalism. As Adey (2006, pp. 85-86) observes, “Mobility, like power, is a relational thing,” and its distribution is inherently uneven. The mobility experienced by certain social actors must be contextualized within the framework of the immobility faced by others; thus, migration from the global south to the north and west seldom allows individuals to maintain their previous status within the social hierarchy. Furthermore, as Duchêne and Heller (2012, pp. 15-16) emphasize, “The landscape is uneven, unbounded and fluid,” indicating that social actors occupy varying and often disparate positions regarding their access to the resources that traverse this landscape.
