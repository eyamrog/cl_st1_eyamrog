In October 2014, we discovered the existence of nine Timorese football teams for men and boys in the Dungannon/Cookstown area, as detailed in Table 2 below. The names of these clubs reflect the diverse identities of the players, drawing upon various linguistic resources, including Portuguese. For instance, the players of FC Tahi Calu and FC Moko United predominantly spoke Fataluku and hailed from Lospalos in the eastern region of Timor-Leste, with their club names signifying a distinct regional identity. Similarly, the name of FC Matebian also indicates the regional identity of its players, who primarily originated from the Baucau area and the eastern and central regions, with most communicating in Makasai.
