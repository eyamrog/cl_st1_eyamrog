In this article, we present a contemporary methodology for achieving a highly accurate bacterial genome assembly by integrating long reads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) with short reads from Illumina (see Figure 1). These sequencing platforms were selected due to their accessibility and widespread utilization in the field of microbial genomics. While traditional hybrid assembly techniques have typically employed a short-read-first strategy—where a short-read assembly graph is constructed and subsequently scaffolded with long reads—recent advancements in the yield and precision of long-read sequencing have enabled the adoption of a long-read-first hybrid assembly approach. This method involves creating an assembly solely from long reads, which is then refined using short reads, resulting in enhanced accuracy. We employ this innovative approach in our study and also offer an online tutorial (available at github.com/rrwick/perfect-bacterial-genome-tutorial) that includes sample data from the hybrid sequencing of Staphylococcus aureus strain JKD61596, allowing readers to replicate and apply this method independently.
