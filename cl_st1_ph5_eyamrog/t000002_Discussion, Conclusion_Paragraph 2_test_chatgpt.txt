This method enabled us to establish a general pattern of small-group discussions that emerged in a Brazilian primary school, while also allowing for an examination of variations over time. This latter aspect was achieved by measuring the relative frequencies of the occurrence of specific codes. Consequently, the findings presented here illustrate the positive aspects previously highlighted. However, a significant limitation of this analysis is the temporal development of meanings and the inherent ambiguity, as utterances can serve multiple functions. In certain instances, coding has been criticized for being atheoretical or dogmatic in its conclusions (Hennessy et al., 2020).
