Numerous long-read assemblers have been developed for bacterial genomes, including Canu, Flye, NECAT, NextDenovo, and Raven, each employing distinct methodologies that confer specific advantages and disadvantages. Despite the assembler utilized, most long-read bacterial genome assemblies exhibit avoidable errors, and different assemblers are likely to generate assemblies with varying error profiles when provided with the same read set. Trycycler capitalizes on this variability by constructing a consensus from multiple alternative assemblies of the same genome, thereby mitigating structural errors, eliminating spurious contigs, and ensuring that circular sequences do not have missing or duplicated bases at their termini. Consequently, we recommend the use of Trycycler for generating long-read bacterial genome assemblies; however, it is important to note that Trycycler is not an automated tool and necessitates human judgment and interaction.
