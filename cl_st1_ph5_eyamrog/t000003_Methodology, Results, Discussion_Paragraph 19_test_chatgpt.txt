The ability to communicate effectively in English has become a critical criterion for employment agencies in their selection processes. For instance, many agencies implement an initial screening phase where applicants are interviewed in English prior to receiving an application form. Candidates who demonstrate proficiency in English are subsequently considered for positions of greater responsibility within the workplace, such as supervisory roles or assisting veterinary staff with poultry inspections. This practice reflects the establishment of a linguistic hierarchy, as articulated by DuchÃªne et al. (2013), which is evident in both recruitment and workplace dynamics. In this context, Timorese migrants are undergoing a re-stratification of their linguistic resources; those who previously benefited from their knowledge of Portuguese in Timor-Leste now find that these skills are undervalued in their new professional environments.
