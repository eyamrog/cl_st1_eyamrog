The second paradigm is interpretivist, idiographic, and centered on discovery, positing that knowledge, or nature, is fundamentally a subjective human interpretation. This paradigm emphasizes specific and contextual cases, focusing on the meanings that participants in educational settings attribute to their experiences (Taber, 2013, p. 52). Researchers operating within this framework contend that meanings are not predetermined but are co-created through interaction, prompting them to engage with participants in various activities and solicit their perspectives (Treagust et al., 2014). According to Guba and Lincoln (1994), this approach is rooted in a relativist ontology and a subjectivist epistemology. Relativist ontology posits that "realities are apprehendable in the form of multiple, intangible mental constructions, socially and experientially based" (p. 110), while subjectivist epistemology suggests that "the investigator and the object of investigation are assumed to be interactively linked so that the 'findings' are created as the investigation proceeds" (p. 111). Within this paradigm, human beings are regarded as agents of their own actions and architects of their environments, leading to the characterization of this perspective as both subjectivist and voluntarist (Cohen et al., 2007).
