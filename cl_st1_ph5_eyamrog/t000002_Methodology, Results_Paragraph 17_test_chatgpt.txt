Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of codes related to group talk contexts and discursive functions across various tasks. The analysis revealed only a limited number of significant differences between the groups. Specifically, a significant difference in content was identified (H(6) = 17.575, p = .007) between Tasks 3 and 4 (p = .037) and between Tasks 3 and 5 (p = .022). Additionally, a significant difference in off-topic discussions was observed (H(6) = 14.007, p = .029) between Tasks 3 and 5 (p = .046). No significant differences were noted in the instruction category. Overall, it was found that students engaged in more content-related discussions and fewer off-topic conversations during Tasks 2 and 3.
