Some club organizers and managers integrated Timorese cultural practices and values into the management of club funds, as exemplified by the FC Lao Rai club. This integration was highlighted during an interview with one of the managers (Interview with MFB, June 2015), who, while blending Tetum with Portuguese and English, emphasized that the club prioritized the welfare of its players beyond mere football-related concerns. For instance, when a player required assistance to cover the cost of a return trip to Timor-Leste for a family funeral, club funds were allocated to help with airfare expenses. The manager explicitly referenced the Timorese cultural practice known as "lia mate, lia moris," which denotes the customary obligations of extended family members in Timor-Leste, encompassing cultural rituals (lia) associated with death (mate) and life (moris). These obligations and cultural practices are fundamental to the organization of the life worlds of Timorese individuals both in Timor-Leste and in the diaspora, involving the provision of material and moral support during significant events such as funerals, weddings, and christenings. Each member associated with the Lao Rai club contributed Â£10 per month to support the club's operations. Additionally, the club manager remarked (in English) that all football clubs had increasingly become vital in fostering community connections and had become "better organized in the last few years" (Same interview with MFB, June 5, 2015).
