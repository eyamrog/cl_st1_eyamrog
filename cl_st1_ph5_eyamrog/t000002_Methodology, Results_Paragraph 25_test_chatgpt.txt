One of the key strengths of sociocultural discourse analysis lies in its emphasis on the actual dialogue as the primary data source throughout the analytical process, allowing for a detailed examination of the collaborative construction of knowledge (Mercer, 2004, p. 143). Consequently, the focus shifts away from the discursive functions or the linguistic elements themselves, directing attention instead to the substantive content of the conversation and the engagement in joint intellectual activities (Mercer, 2004). This approach is inherently inductive, facilitating the emergence of themes or categories directly from the data (Evans, 2013; Taber, 2013).
