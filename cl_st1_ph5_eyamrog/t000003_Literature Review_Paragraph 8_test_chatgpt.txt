Mooring and remooring entail significant agency among the social actors involved. In the context of labor migration, this process encompasses not only the search for accommodation and employment but also the identification of spaces where recreational activities linked to one's place of origin can be organized. Additionally, it involves determining the logistics of how these activities will be arranged and by whom. Furthermore, the process of remooring inherently requires these social dynamics to be iterative.
