The plants are terrestrial and possess short, creeping rhizomes adorned with light brown, lanceolate scales. The leaves measure between 40 to 75 cm in length, with stipes ranging from 25 to 40 cm; these stipes are entirely reddish-brown, quadrangular in shape, and feature light brown, acuminate scales and sparse two-celled glandular hairs proximally. The laminae are 20 to 40 cm long and exhibit a 2-pinnate structure, while the rachises are winged, reddish-brown, and also bear sparse two-celled glandular hairs. The basal pinnae measure 10 to 18 cm by 2 to 3 cm, and the pinnules are short-petiolulate and dimidiate, approximately 1.2 to 1.5 cm in length. Both the costae and veins are glabrous on the abaxial and adaxial surfaces, although the laminar tissue between the veins on the abaxial side contains sparse two-celled glandular hairs, while the adaxial side remains glabrous. The sori are interrupted and located at the tips of multiple veins, with indusia that are membranaceous, featuring a dentate margin and a glabrous surface.
