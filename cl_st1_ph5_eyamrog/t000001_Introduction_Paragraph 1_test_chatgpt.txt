In contrast to eukaryotes, which possess complex genomes often exceeding one billion base pairs (bp) in length, prokaryotic genomes are relatively small, typically comprising a single circular chromosome that spans a few million bp, along with smaller extrachromosomal plasmids. For many genomic applications, obtaining the complete bacterial genome sequence—defined as the full nucleotide sequence of each DNA component within the cell—is highly desirable. However, DNA sequencing technologies operate by fragmenting the genome and subsequently sequencing these fragments, resulting in reads that are randomly ordered, small segments of the genome. These reads are inherently imperfect, with the frequency and nature of errors varying according to the sequencing platform employed. Additionally, redundancy is a characteristic of this process, as it is necessary to generate reads that collectively exceed the genome size multiple times to ensure comprehensive coverage. Consequently, there exists a significant disparity between the output of sequencing technologies, which consists of small, imperfect, and redundant sequences, and the objective of obtaining a complete and error-free genome.
