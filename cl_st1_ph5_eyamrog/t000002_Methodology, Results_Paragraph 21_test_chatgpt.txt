For instance, Extract 1 presents a clear example of dialogic talk that emerged within these groups, specifically chosen to demonstrate the high levels of dialogicity exhibited by the students. The identification of this particular episode among others was made possible through systematic codification and frequency analysis of the entire dataset. Quantitatively, over half of the utterances were classified as dialogic, with 17 out of 30 utterances, representing approximately 57%. In comparison, the average level of dialogicity across the seven tasks was around 33%, as illustrated in Figure 3.
