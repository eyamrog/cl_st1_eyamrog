Our initial field visits to Northern Ireland occurred in October 2014 and June 2015, during which we engaged in participant observation across various public settings, including the Catholic Church in Dungannon and local sporting events, particularly football matches, while meticulously documenting our observations in detailed field notes. Additionally, we employed still photography and collected a diverse array of texts and artifacts, encompassing digital materials such as Facebook posts and YouTube videos. Furthermore, we conducted semi-structured face-to-face interviews with twelve Timorese men residing and working in Dungannon and Cookstown. These interviews were primarily conducted in Tetum, occasionally incorporating elements of Portuguese and English, and each lasted approximately one hour, with all sessions audio-recorded. Among these, six were individual interviews, while the remainder involved joint discussions with members of football teams, focusing on the interviewees' migration trajectories and their lived experiences of establishing or re-establishing their sense of belonging within the Northern Irish context. The six individual interviewees formed a core group of research participants, as detailed in Table 1 below.
