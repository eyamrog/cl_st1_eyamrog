In this paper, we examine two research paradigms and their corresponding methodological approaches to analyzing educational dialogue: systematic coding, which aligns with positivism and quantitative methods, and sociocultural discourse analysis, which is rooted in interpretivism and qualitative methods. The systematic coding approach involves a coding scheme that categorizes utterances into predefined categories, which can be further expanded or refined as needed. Hennessy et al. (2020) identify several advantages of frequency counting, including the ability to process large volumes of data, highlight key markers, efficiently search the dataset to explore correlations between specific actions, detect patterns, measure changes in practice, and facilitate comparisons that can be subjected to statistical analysis.
