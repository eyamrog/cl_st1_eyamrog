Despite the diversity in team-specific identification practices, the annual scheduling of tournaments around significant national dates in Timor-Leste highlighted the players' shared national identity. These tournaments united various clubs in sporting events, fostering a sense of belonging to a single diasporic community rooted in Timor-Leste, particularly within the Irish context. Notably, details of these tournaments were frequently shared on platforms such as Facebook and YouTube, garnering views from individuals in Timor-Leste and the broader diaspora. These regular digital postings were part of extensive digital practices and the intensive use of mobile technology among the transnationally connected Timorese diaspora. Additionally, we have observed that the unique migration trajectories, communicative repertoires, and funds of knowledge of certain Timorese individuals in Northern Ireland have empowered them to take the initiative in establishing distinctive group activities, whether through football clubs with specific ethos or cultural groups, such as the aforementioned choir, that celebrate particular aspects of Timorese heritage. Consequently, for some individuals, there exists significant potential for exercising agency within local contexts, creating spaces of solidarity and conviviality through organizational practices that involve complex and contextually situated uses of linguistic and semiotic resources. Simultaneously, these processes of adaptation to a new country are fostering a robust sense of shared history and belonging linked to their nation of origin.
