The plants are terrestrial, characterized by short-creeping rhizomes adorned with dark brown, lanceolate scales. The leaves measure between 30 to 50 cm in length, with stipes ranging from 15 to 25 cm; these stipes are dark brown proximally and stramineous above, exhibiting a quadrangular shape and featuring dark brown, acuminate scales along with sparse two-celled glandular hairs. The laminae are 15 to 25 cm long and exhibit a 2-pinnate structure, while the rachises are not winged, presenting a stramineous coloration and sparse two-celled glandular hairs. The basal pinnae are equilateral, measuring 10 to 15 cm by 2.5 to 3.5 cm, and the pinnules are petiolulate and dimidiate, approximately 1.5 to 2 cm in length. Both the costae and veins, on the abaxial and adaxial surfaces, are either sparsely covered with two-celled glandular hairs or glabrescent, and the laminar tissue between the veins is glabrous on both surfaces. The sori are continuous and located at the tips of multiple veins, with the inner indusia being membranaceous to papyraceous, featuring entire, wavy, and glabrous margins.
