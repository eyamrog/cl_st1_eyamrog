In this article, I advocate for a complementary approach primarily within the analytical-empirical dimension, as the nature of the research questions necessitates the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods in educational studies (Souza & Kerbauy, 2017). By adopting a mixed-methods approach to methodology (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998), researchers can effectively juxtapose different methodologies to address research questions in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Consequently, while exploratory research questions tend to favor qualitative analysis, those that exhibit a confirmatory bias should incorporate quantitative characterizations and comparisons.
