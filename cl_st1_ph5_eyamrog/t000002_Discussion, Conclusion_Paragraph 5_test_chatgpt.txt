Although quantitative and qualitative methods have often been contrasted, both methodologies play significant roles and can be viewed as complementary (Snell & Lefstein, 2011). Systematic coding serves as a method for managing extensive data sets, facilitating the identification of general patterns across multiple lessons and tasks while enabling statistical comparisons and developmental analyses (Mercer et al., 2004). Conversely, sociocultural discourse analysis allows for a nuanced exploration of classroom dialogue, providing a multi-dimensional understanding of its complexities (Asterhan et al., 2020). While the former constrains discursive interactions to measurable variables, reflecting a positivist ideal, the latter uncovers the richness and intricacy of these exchanges through a more interpretative lens.
