Qualitative methods grounded in the interpretivist paradigm typically consider the cultural and social contexts that influence classroom interactions (e.g., Gee & Green, 1998). It is posited that knowledge is socially constructed through language. These methods encompass various approaches, including linguistic ethnography, sociolinguistics, and discourse analysis, among others (Hennessy et al., 2020). Generally, they emphasize the contextual and sociocultural dimensions over the mere mechanics of verbal exchange, such as turn-taking, primarily because discourse is understood in a broader sense, encompassing "the text (speech, writing, or image), the discursive practice of analysis within the text, and the social practices and structures bound to notions of power and knowledge" (Gregory, 2020).
