Brazil is home to several families of ferns, including Dennstaedtiaceae, which comprises eight genera and 26 species; Lindsaeaceae, represented by one genus and 34 species; Lonchitidaceae, with one genus and a single species; and Saccolomataceae, which includes one genus and nine species, while the Pteridaceae family is addressed in a separate study (Kramer 1957; Pena et al. 2020; Schwartsburd 2020; Schwartsburd & Pena 2020). Generally, these ferns exhibit plesiomorphic characteristics typical of the early-diverging lineages within the Polypodiales order, such as rhizomes that are solenoidal and covered with hairs or primitive scales, large and highly dissected leaves, truly marginal sori that are protected by both inner and outer indusia, and trilete spores (Tryon & Tryon 1982; Kramer 1990; PPG I 2016; Schwartsburd et al. 2020).
