While there has been a notable trend of labor migration to England since the mid-twentieth century, large-scale migration to Northern Ireland is a more recent development, beginning to rise significantly only in the early twenty-first century. According to Doyle and McAreavey (2016, p. 52), "Between the 2001 Census and the 2011 Census, the number of non-UK/Ireland migrants to Northern Ireland tripled (from 1.6% to 4.5% [of the local population])." This increase in migration can be attributed to two primary political developments: first, the culmination of the Peace Process in Northern Ireland on December 2, 1999, which led to a transformation in the region's political economy, including increased inward investment in infrastructure; and second, the accession of several Eastern European and Baltic nation-states to the European Union in 2004, which facilitated labor migration to both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, particularly from Poland and the Baltic States, especially Lithuania (Corrigan et al., 2015; Doyle & McAreavey, 2016). However, following the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the migration pathway from the European Union to Northern Ireland has effectively been closed.
