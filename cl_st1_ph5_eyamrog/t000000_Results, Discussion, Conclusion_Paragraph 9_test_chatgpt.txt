Currently, two species and two hybrid-origin species are recognized (Thomson 2012; Zhou et al. 2014; Schwartsburd et al. 2018, 2020). Additionally, approximately 20 morpho-taxa are classified as infra-specific entities, including subspecies, varieties, forms, or combinations of multiple ranks (e.g., Tryon 1941; Page 1976; Thomson 2012; Schwartsburd et al. 2018). In Brazil, the recognized taxa include Pteridium caudatum (L.) Maxon, P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, P. esculentum subsp. campestre (Schrad.) Schwartsb. & J. Prado, P. esculentum subsp. gryphus Schwartsb., P. esculentum var. harpianum Schwartsb. & A. Ya√±ez, and P. esculentum var. paedomorficum Schwartsb. & J. Prado (Schwartsburd 2020). The most prevalent taxon in southeastern Brazil is P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, which poses a threat to crops and is toxic to cattle, horses, and humans (Schwartsburd et al. 2018).
