The presence of multiple research paradigms is not inherently problematic, particularly within the field of educational research. Treagust et al. (2014) argue that this diversity fosters the development of more comprehensive knowledge and encourages a broader range of efforts. Similarly, Taber (2013) recognizes that each paradigm possesses its own strengths and limitations, suggesting that all paradigms can yield valuable insights and can be utilized in complementary manners.
