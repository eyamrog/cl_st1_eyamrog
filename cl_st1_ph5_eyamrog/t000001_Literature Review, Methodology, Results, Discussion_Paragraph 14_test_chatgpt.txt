Our tool, Polypolish30, was developed with two primary objectives. The first objective is to utilize all-per-read alignments to address certain limitations associated with repetitive sequences. The second objective is to adopt a conservative approach, thereby minimizing the likelihood of introducing errors during the polishing process. Polypolish exclusively implements changes that are unequivocally supported by the read alignments; consequently, in instances where multiple possibilities exist at a given locus (for example, when a base could be either A or C, with some alignments supporting each option), Polypolish refrains from altering the sequence. For these reasons, we recommend employing Polypolish prior to utilizing any other short-read polishing tools.
