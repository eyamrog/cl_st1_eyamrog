The preparation of ONT libraries, along with the chemistry and basecalling processes, plays a crucial role in sequencing outcomes. Both ligation-based and rapid library preparations are suitable for bacterial whole-genome sequencing; however, ligation-based methods tend to enhance sequencing yield, while rapid preparations are more conducive to achieving longer read lengths. Currently, ONT provides MinION and GridION flow cells equipped with two distinct pore types: R9.4.1, introduced in 2017, and R10.4.1, released in 2022. The R10.4.1 flow cells feature longer pores, which significantly improve homopolymer resolution and consensus accuracy, thereby making them the preferred option for genomic assembly. Basecalling, the computational process that converts the raw signals generated by the sequencer into nucleotide sequences, is continually evolving; therefore, users are advised to utilize the latest version of ONT's recommended basecaller and to select its highest-accuracy model. Additionally, for users without an ONT sequencer equipped with a GPU, such as the GridION, access to a computer with a GPU is necessary to perform basecalling effectively.
