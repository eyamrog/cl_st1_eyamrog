In the latter half of the twentieth century, the influx of migrants to Northern Ireland was relatively limited, with most settling in major urban centers such as Belfast, rather than in smaller towns like those that form the basis of our study. Consequently, the local populations in towns such as Dungannon and Cookstown had minimal exposure to newcomers. However, labor migration to these towns experienced a marked increase during the first two decades of the twenty-first century. Utilizing data from the 2011 Census, Doyle and McAreavey (2016, p. 59) illustrated that by 2011, there was a notable concentration of migrants from diverse backgrounds in specific wards within Dungannon. They noted, “Dungannon, a town in rural County Tyrone, has four wards with over 20% combined migrant levels and two with over 30%, a significant change to occur in 10 years.” In light of these demographic shifts, the Timorese participants in our study, who arrived in Dungannon in the early twenty-first century, reported experiencing considerable hostility from the small-town community towards newcomers, accompanied by frequent instances of racist language. Additionally, they faced significant challenges in comprehending the local variety of Irish English (Interview with RS and HA, June 2015).
