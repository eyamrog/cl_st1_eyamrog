Our research elucidates the complex and context-specific ways in which Timorese migrants construct their identities within a particular life world, highlighting the agentive strategies they employ to draw upon diverse linguistic, cultural, and semiotic resources. This study underscores the necessity of re-evaluating the design and scope of contemporary research on language, migration, and deterritorialization. It is essential not only to document how linguistic repertoires and language practices are influenced by language policies and educational experiences in migrants' countries of origin but also to consider the social processes related to reterritorialization, including what Hannam et al. (2006) describe as "mooring," as well as the communicative practices that emerge during these specific, situated mooring processes. By adopting a dual focus on migration and mooring, we can develop a comprehensive understanding of how multilingual resources are reconfigured in the context of transnational migration and how identities are constructed across various domains of social life.
