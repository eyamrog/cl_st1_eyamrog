Nevertheless, individuals who reported experiencing early hostility also acknowledged a gradual transformation over time, coinciding with the arrival of additional migrant groups from Poland, Portugal, and the Baltic States (Interview with RS and HA, June 2015). A local non-governmental organization, the South Tyrone Empowerment Project (STEP), has played a significant role in facilitating this change by providing support to local migrant communities in securing appropriate housing, navigating interactions with local authorities, addressing legal issues, and offering interpretation and translation services in bureaucratic and healthcare contexts. During our field visits, we observed tangible signs of a shift in public sentiment, including the presence of children's books in various languages at the public library and the organization of a multicultural festival by Dungannon Town Council.
