With the advent of molecular data, those subfamilies were raised to family-level, some families were created, and now the early- diverging leptosporangiate ferns are represented by Cystodiaceae (one genus), Dennstaedtiaceae with a stricter circumscription (11-12 genera), Lindsaeaceae (seven genera), Lonchitidaceae (one genus), Saccolomataceae (one or two genera), as well as the great Pteridaceae (+50 genera) (Smith et al. 2006, PPG I 2016, Shang et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2020)."}

In many genomic applications, it would be most useful to know the bacterial genome sequence in its entirety, i.e. the full sequence of nucleotides for each piece of DNA in the cell. However, DNA sequencers work by fragmenting the genome and sequencing the fragments, producing reads: randomly ordered small pieces of the genome2. Reads are imperfect, with the frequency and type of errors depending on the platform. They are also redundant, because it is necessary to produce reads that total to many times the genome size to ensure that the genome is well covered. There is thus a disconnect between what sequencers provide (small, imperfect, redundant sequences) and what we want (a complete, error-free genome)."}

There are two broad goals to consider with genome assembly: accuracy and completeness. Accuracy refers to the number of errors present in the assembled sequences (contigs). Such errors can be small in scale (e.g. an incorrect base) or larger in scale (e.g. the addition\/removal of hundreds of bases). Completeness refers to the length of the contigs relative to the corresponding genomic sequence, i.e. how fragmented the assembly is. Longer contigs are better, ideally each contig representing an entire replicon in the genome. We define a \u2018perfect\u2019 assembly as one which maximises both accuracy and completeness. A perfect assembly of a bacterial genome would contain one complete and error-free contig per replicon and no additional contigs."}

While the best method for extracting DNA can vary by organism, one should aim to maximise purity and molecular weight. High purity will allow for better ONT yields, as chemical and biological impurities can damage or clog nanopores, shortening the life of flow cells7. High molecular weight will produce longer ONT reads, so one should avoid vortexing, minimise handling\/pipetting and minimise freeze-thaw cycles to reduce shearing of DNA molecules8. Extraction methods for most bacteria should incorporate cell lysis by enzymatic digestion, using lysozyme (Sigma Aldrich, L6876) followed by proteinase K digestion (as provided in DNA extraction kits). This method is suitable for most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, but optimisation with additional enzymes may be required for difficult-to-lyse bacteria. Magnetic bead-based DNA extraction is recommended to reduce DNA shearing and maximise throughput. Recommended kits (in order of preference) are: GenFind V3 (Beckman Coulter, C34881) and MagAttract HMW DNA (Qiagen, 67563). For bacterial isolates that are difficult to lyse enzymatically, bead-beating can be used, but ONT read length may be compromised."}

When aiming for a perfect assembly, consider 100\u00d7 depth to be a minimum, with 200\u00d7 being ideal. Depths above 200\u00d7 are better but will give diminishing returns. Using a single ONT flow cell for one bacterial isolate may provide excessive depth, so multiplexing is common in microbial genomics.

Nextera XT library preparations produce variable read depth (i.e. some regions of the genome may have low depth), so Illumina DNA Prep (a.k.a. Nextera DNA Flex) and TruSeq are preferable16. If Nextera XT is used, aim for a high mean depth (e.g. 300\u00d7) to compensate for depth variation, otherwise 100\u00d7 should be sufficient. For highly repetitive genomes, mate-pair preparations may improve short-read polishing performance (see Pitfalls). After Illumina reads are produced, we recommend using a QC tool such as fastp17 to remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences."}

When heterogeneity occurs at a low level (e.g. 95% of the reads support one sequence and 5% another), it does not typically cause problems as assemblers\/polishers will use the more common alternative. However, balanced heterogeneity (e.g. a 50:50 mixture) can cause misassemblies and polishing mistakes. The phase variation of the fim switch is one cause of heterogeneity in Enterobacteriaceae44 (Figure 2E). Another common example occurs with bacteriophages, which can integrate into and excise from bacterial chromosomes45 (Figure 2F).

The first part discusses the two main research paradigms and their ontological and epistemological bases: positivism and interpretivism. Next, two methods for analyzing discursive interactions are presented and discussed, one for each paradigm. Systematic coding - within the quantitative context - is indicated to treat data from large samples, to describe general patterns and, by transforming the discourse into variables, to statistical comparisons or temporal analyses. The method is applied in a set of 42 episodes of group dialogue and the results are discussed in light of the nature of the research questions, showing what types of statistical tests can be performed. Within the interpretivist paradigm, sociocultural discourse analysis is presented as an example of qualitative method an it is applied to excerpts from classroom dialogues. The main finding is the identification of typologies that describe the ways in which teacher and students construct scientific explanations. In the final part, some possibilities and limits of each method are discussed and the conclusion defendes that both can be seen as complementary for the advancement of knowledge in the educational field."}

Another relevant finding is framed in the triadic discourse: initiation, response, and feedback or evaluation (Mehan, 1979; Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975). This pattern is possibly the most common feature in whole-class talk and can account for up to 70% of all teacher-student interactions (Cazden, 1988; Nassaji & Wells, 2000; Wells, 1993). Although much of these studies have taken place in Anglo-Saxon countries, this pattern is recognised worldwide (Alexander, 2001)."}

However, instead of directly departing to analytical methods, it is firstly offered a broad methodological discussion starting from research paradigms that considers elements such as epistemology and ontology. In the second part of this paper, methods and procedures for discursive data analysis are presented in two veins: quantitative and qualitative approaches. Both methods are discussed and illustrated based on examples from previous research."}

The first paradigm is positivist, nomothetic, and confirmatory, which means that it deals with definitive and objective knowledge, seeks general patterns or laws, and tests hypotheses. The underlying assumption is that \u201cit is possible to report unambiguous truth, in terms of observable phenomena and verified facts\u201d (Taber, 2013, p. 49). Guba and Lincoln (1994) pointed out that this approach is grounded in realistic ontology and objectivist epistemology. Realistic ontology entails that \u201can apprehendable reality is assumed to exist, driven by immutable natural laws and mechanisms\u201d (p. 109), whereas an objectivist epistemology assumes that \u201cthe investigator and the investigated \u2018object\u2019 are assumed to be independent entities, and the investigator to be capable of studying the object without influencing it or being influenced by it.\u201d (p. 110).

As knowledge (or nature) is viewed as an inherently subjective human interpretation, this paradigm focuses on specific and contextual cases. It deals with \u201cmeanings that those participating in educational situations give to what they experience\u201d (Taber, 2013, p. 52). Researchers under this paradigm believe that meanings are not pregiven but co-created through interaction. Therefore, they might engage with participants in activities and seek their views (Treagust et al., 2014). Guba and Lincoln (1994) said that this approach is grounded in a relativist ontology and subjectivist epistemology. Relativist ontology conceives that \u201crealities are apprehendable in the form of multiple, intangible mental constructions, socially and experientially based\u201d (p. 110). In contrast, a subjectivist epistemology denotes that \u201cthe investigator and the object of investigation are assumed to be interactively linked so that the \u2018findings\u2019 are created as the investigation proceeds\u201d (p. 111). In this approach, human beings are seen as agents of their own actions and producers of their own environment. Because of this, this perspective is deemed subjectivist and voluntarist (Cohen et al., 2007)."}

It is such a method that allows us to state something about how dialogic teaching affects students' learning. On the other side, the interpretivist paradigm might provide a more nuanced frame on the dynamics of dialogue through, for example, ethnographic case studies that stretch the cultural context of the classroom setting (Asterhan et al., 2020).

Within this method, the analytic process of discursive data involves the reduction of the data through the marking of relevant points about what is looked for. Very frequently, this procedure is called \u2018coding\u2019 and enables the researcher to \u201corganise and structure the data\u201d at the same time that \u201ctranslate raw data into particular conceptual references\u201d and then \u201cidentify links to the different categories\u201d (Evans, 2013, pp. 158\u2013159). Objectivity is a key aspect of systematic coding as it encompasses the development of a scheme that needs to be unambiguous; that is, the criteria for coding must be clear enough so that different observers assign the same code\/category to the discursive unit (Galton et al., 1980). Quite frequently, codes come from a theoretical framework or previous research. In this case, this research may be labelled as \u2018template\u2019 since the analytical framework is informed by the theoretical perspective, \u201cso that the analyst knows just what they are looking for in the data from the start\u201d (Robson, 2002; Taber, 2013, p. 293)."}

As dialogue remains untouchable throughout the analysis, the emerged typologies offer a heuristic device for making sense of the talk in relation to one particular issue (Mercer, 2004). For instance, Mercer\u2019s studies identified three types of group talk: disputational, cumulative, and exploratory; and verified that this last have a positive impact on student learning. Thus, the point is not to reduce the data to a categorical tally, but set broad features that involve the context and the discursive dynamic regarding an educational learning goal (Mercer et al., 2004).

Very briefly, looking at the data and theory reiteratively, two structural aspects was set: forms of explanations and causation (Braaten & Windschitl, 2011). Thus, the analysis would search for sequences of utterances that convey instances of explanation (definitions, descriptions, and reasoning) and causation (cause-effect accounts of an observable event). Finding examples of these occurrences might make it possible to generate typologies, comment on and describe them, and discuss potential outcomes."}

Students just needed to give a few-word response to follow the explanation across the scientific point of view. In the first case, the lesson aim was to compare water and perfume evaporation. As students could not see or feel the water evaporating, the perfume played the role of showing that something was leaving the water and spreading into the air. The teacher developed this reasoning (Extract 2)."}

On the other hand, sociocultural discourse analysis can explore fine-grained and offer a multi-dimensional understanding of the complexities of classroom dialogue (Asterhan et al., 2020). While the former constricts the discursive interactions into measured variables (positivist ideal), the latter reveals the complexity and richness of the discursive exchanges with greater interpretative vein."}

The ones who advocate in favour of complementarity say that both paradigms are legitimate as they are not in necessarily conflict. Moreover, in the empirical domain, each paradigm aligns to goals that could not be tackled with another. Finally, the unity between these paradigms is considered mainly by pos- positivist and critical philosophers who defend that there is no logical and consistent way to divide knowledge into radical terms."}

Through this research we traced their migration trajectories (via Portugal or England), and we documented the agentive ways in which they were dealing with local conditions of settlement and employment, and, at the same time, creating new spaces of solidarity and conviviality within local life worlds. We focus here on one particular life world \u2013 that of sport \u2013 and on the nine football clubs formed for Timorese men and boys in this local Irish setting.

While we need to document the specific ways in which linguistic repertoires and language practices are shaped by language policies and educational experiences in countries of origin, attention also need to be given to the social processes associated with reterritorialization, and what Hannam et al. (2006) referred to as mooring and to the communicative practices that unfold during specific, situated processes of mooring. It is only by adopting a dual focus on migration and mooring that we can build a full picture of the ways in which multilingual resources are reconfigured in the context of transnational migration and the ways in which identities are constructed in different domains of social life."}

In the third section, we trace the broad temporal and spatial dimensions of transnational population movements from Timor-Leste, focusing in on recent Timorese migration to Northern Ireland. In the fourth section, we describe the research approach adopted in our study and we detail the range of ethnographic, textual and photographic data that we have gathered. In the fifth section, we draw attention to the diverse origins and migration trajectories of the participants in our study and to the ways in which their communicative repertoires have been shaped over time. In the sixth and most detailed section, we describe the local conditions of settlement and employment. The seventh section then focuses in on the nine football clubs and on the ways in which linguistic and semiotic resources are drawn upon in the naming and organisation of the clubs, and in their distinctive branding. We also show how cultural resources and different funds of knowledge are drawn upon by club organisers and managers in the organisation of the clubs. In addition, we point to the complex processes of identification at work in this sports context, and to the multifaceted local ways of representing what counts as being Timorese. Then, in the two final sections, we offer reflections on the significance of the insights we have gleaned from the research that we have done thus far."}

A broad epistemological shift took place away from \u201csedentarist approaches\u201d (HANNAM et al., 2006, p. 5) and towards a new concern with mobility, deterritorialization, and the intensification and diversification of transnational population movements. Sociolinguists engaged in research in multilingual contexts picked up on the notion of mobility in a number of ways and adopted new conceptual compasses: For example, Heller (2011, p. 5-6) argued that we need to turn our gaze away \u201cfrom stability to mobility\u201d and engage in a fundamental rethink of both theory and method in this area of research. As she put it: \u201cTools of enquiry refined when the focus was on boundaries, stability and homogeneity require refashioning for addressing movement, diversity and multiplicity\u201d (HELLER, 2007, p 6). Instead of focusing on \u201cstable communities\u201d, she stressed that we need to focus on the development of the trajectories of different social actors over time and space and build an understanding of how the communicative repertoires of these social actors are shaped within these trajectories. The notion of trajectory provides a way of taking account of the intersecting dimensions of time and space, and of moving away from synchronic accounts. In addition, it enables us to capture some of the complexity of contemporary transnational movements, including those that involve extended sojourns in different countries and, hence, access to diverse language resources and funds of knowledge"}

(2006, p. 2) put it: \u201cmobilities and mooring occur dialectically\u201d. We need to trace the historical specificity of particular migration trajectories and, at the same time, we need to capture the situated ways in which mooring (or re-mooring) occurs, along with the ways in which new forms of social organization, new communities of practice (WENGER, 1998) and new social activities come to be imbued with meaning. Studies of migration, within the disciplines of anthropology and cultural studies (e.g. BRAH, 1996, FORTIER, 2000, AHMED et al., 2003) have sustained this dual focus. They have provided accounts of dislocation and displacement, while also throwing light on the social and cultural processes involved in mooring, reterritorialization or what Ahmed et al.

We are focusing, in particular, on the creation of spaces of solidarity and conviviality in local life worlds, on the construction of new identities and new forms of belonging in those spaces and on diverse representations, on and offline, of what it means to be Timorese, well beyond the borders of Timor-Leste.

Most moved to Australia or Portugal. During this period, other Timorese took refuge in countries such as Mozambique which had also been colonised by Portugal. Later on, in the 1990s, during the final phase of the struggle against the Indonesian occupation, a significant number of Timorese students sought refuge in foreign embassies in Jakarta, Indonesia, as a consequence of student-led demonstrations in Timor and in Indonesia (FERNANDES, 2011). Most of these students eventually made their way to Portugal, where they received financial support for several years to continue their studies.

This was because, under international law, the eastern region of the island of Timor remained a colony of Portugal until Independence in 2002. Neither Portugal nor the United Nations recognised the Indonesian occupation and administration of the territory from 1975 to 2002.

This has led to the clustering of Timorese migrant workers in small towns and in rural areas of England (e.g. in Devon and Lincolnshire) and Northern Ireland (in County Tyrone). In Northern Ireland, factories linked to food production have been established (e.g. factories designed for the processing and packaging of poultry and other meat) (DOYLE; MCAREAVEY, 2016). Other Timorese migrants have moved into urban areas (e.g., Bridgewater, Bristol, Oxford, Peterborough, Leeds, London and Northwich, near Manchester) and have found work within the service sector (e.g. supermarkets, department stores, online shopping\/packing services). Whether they are based in rural or urban areas, they occupy precarious positions with the local economy and are part of what Standing (2010) refers to as the growing \u201cglobal precariat\u201d. They are generally recruited by employment agencies and are expected to work to flexible schedules."}

Northern Ireland only began to see an increase in inward migration at the beginning of the twenty first century. This increase was quite significant. Doyle and McAreavey (2016, p. 52) point out that: \u201cBetween the 2001 Census and the 2011 Census, the number of non- UK\/Ireland migrants to Northern Ireland tripled (from 1.6% to 4.5% [of the local population])\u201d. Two main political developments lay behind this increase in migration: First, the culmination of the Peace Process in Northern Ireland on December 2, 1999, and the subsequent change in the political economy of this region of the UK, including inward investment in infrastructure. Second, the accession of different nation-states in Eastern Europe and the Baltic to the European Union, from 2004. This expansion of the European Union facilitated labour migration, to the Republic of Ireland (in the south) and to Northern Ireland, from Poland and from the Baltic States, especially from Lithuania (CORRIGAN et al., 2015, DOYLE; McAREAVEY, 2016). However, following the UK exit from the European Union on 31st January, 2020, the migration route to Northern Ireland, from the European Union, has no longer been open."}

The local population in towns such as Dungannon and Cookstown had had relatively little experience of incomers. However, labour migration to these towns increased significantly in the first two decades of the twenty first century. Drawing on the 2011 Census data, Doyle and McAreavey (2016, p. 59) have demonstrated that, by 2011, there was a significant concentration of migrants of different origins in particular wards in Dungannon. As they put it: \u201cDungannon, a town in rural Country Tyrone, has four wards with over 20% combined migrant levels and two with over 30%, a significant change to occur in 10 years\u201d. Because of these significant demographic changes, the Timorese in our study who came to Dungannon in the early part of the twenty first century reported that they encountered considerable small-town hostility to incomers and frequent use of racist language. They also had considerable difficulty in understanding the local variety of Irish English (Interview with RS and HA, June 2015)."}

When we interviewed the two organisers of the Ramkabian club, they explained that they had created a name that included parts of the names of three different mountains in Timor-Leste: Ramelau, Kablake and Matebian. They had done this as a way of emphasising inclusivity, dealing with difference and the building of solidarity. One of the organisers outlined the aims of the club. Blending Portuguese with Tetum as he spoke, he pointed out that one of the aims was: \u201cCriar amizade que [\u00e9] forte, la\u2019os ba iha ne\u2019\u00e9 deit maib\u00e9 iha fatin hotu-hotu\u201d (Creating friendship that is strong, not only for this [club] but everywhere). (Interview with both RS and HA, June 7, 2015 \u2013 all Portuguese words are shown in italics). FC Lao Rai United was also represented in a similar way. One of the organisers said that he saw the football club and participation in tournaments as giving an opportunity for Timorese from different districts of Timor-Leste to get to know one another. The use of the term Lao Rai (Travellers) in the name of this club indexed the shared identity of the players as people on the move. A third club, AS Bidau also had an inclusive ethos. The name, AS Bidau, refers to a linguistically diverse neighbourhood of Dili. The players in this team had mixed language backgrounds."}

They had to find funding for the team and for the tournaments. They also had to book pitches for the tournaments and hire Irish referees. In addition, they had to arrange local sponsorship. A local law firm sponsored Ramkabian and a local taxi firm in Cookstown sponsored Fitun Unidade. The sponsorship funded the purchase of football shirts and jackets for the players, along with medals and cups for the football tournaments.

This was, for instance, the case with the FC Lao Rai club. This practice came to our attention during an interview we held with one of the managers (Interview with MFB, June 2015). Blending Tetum with Portuguese and English as he spoke, he pointed out to us that this football club took care of the welfare of its players well beyond matters pertaining to football. For example, if someone needed help to pay for a return trip to Timor-Leste (e.g., for a family funeral), club funds were contributed towards the cost of the airfare. As he described this practice, he made explicit reference to the Timorese cultural practice known as lia mate, lia moris. This refers to the customary obligations on members of an extended family in Timor-Leste, and cultural rituals (lia), relating to death (mate) and life (moris). These obligations and cultural practices constitute a key aspect of the organisation of the life worlds of Timorese in Timor-Leste and in the diaspora. They involve providing material and moral support at times such as funerals, weddings, christening and so on. All those associated with the Lao Rai club paid \u00a310 each per month towards the running of the club. The club manager also noted (in English) that all the football clubs had grown in importance in bringing people together and had become \u201cbetter organised in the last few years\u201d (Same interview with MFB, June 5, 2015)."}

Thus, we learned that, in 2014, the FC Lao Rai United football team extended its range of football fixtures and travelled to Northwich, just south of Manchester, in England for a friendly match with a Timorese football team there. Since then, there have been other friendly matches and tournaments (e.g. in Oxford and in Peterborough). Photographs and video-recordings of all of these matches, and the festivities following the matches, are posted on Facebook and on YouTube. They are viewed and commented on (mostly in Tetum) by friends and family members in Timor-Leste and by other Timorese across the diaspora, in the UK, in Portugal, in South Korea and in Australia. There is considerable interest in football in Timor-Leste. There is a national team and, as noted earlier, a former member of that team was playing for the FC Lao Rai team in Dungannon when we carried out our research. Football is also played in local schools in Timor-Leste but there are insufficient resources to organise regional football teams. The matches of leading football clubs in Europe (e.g., the national team of Portugal or regional clubs in the UK, such as Manchester United) can be viewed on television or online in Timor-Leste and choosing to support particular football teams has become quite popular."}

Diverse Timorese identities were being constructed in ways that related to the past and the present. These identities were indexed in the use of linguistic resources, and also in a range of semiotic resources, including images, colour and different material, textual and online resources. As we saw in Table 2, there were clubs that asserted a regional identity and others that emphasised inclusivity and a broader Timorese-ness. Some of the branding practices, such as the use of the colours of the national flag in the logos in Figure 1, and in the ribbons for the medals, in Figure 3, indexed national identity. In addition, some clubs adopted symbols of cultural heritage, such as the woven tais and the image of the crocodile. Furthermore, linguistic resources and symbols associated with international football culture were imbricated with these diverse ways of representing Timorese-ness."}

The tournaments brought all the clubs together in sports events so that, in this Irish context, they were seen as part of one diasporic community, with its origins in the nation of Timor-Leste. Of particular significance too is that fact, mentioned above, that details of these tournaments were regularly posted on Facebook and YouTube and viewed by people in Timor-Leste and across the diaspora. These regular postings were part of wider digital practices and intense uses of mobile technology across the transnationally connected Timorese diaspora. One further insight that we have gleaned thus far is that the particular migration trajectories, communicative repertoires and funds of knowledge of some Timorese in this setting in Northern Ireland have positioned them in ways that enable them to take a lead in setting up group activities of a distinctive nature, whether it be a football club with a particular ethos, or cultural groups (such as the choir mentioned earlier) that are oriented to particular aspects of Timorese cultural heritage. So, for some, there is considerable scope for exercising individual agency, at least within local life worlds \u2013 scope for creating spaces of solidarity and conviviality, through organisational practices that involve complex and situated uses of linguistic and semiotic resources. At the same time, through these processes of mooring in the new country, a strong sense of shared history and belonging, tied to the nation of origin, is also emerging."}
