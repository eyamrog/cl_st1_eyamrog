Rhizomes may vary from short to long-creeping and are typically protostelic with internal phloem, although they can occasionally be solenostelic. These rhizomes bear basally attached, non-clathrate scales or hairs. The leaves are monomorphic, with laminae that range from simple to three-pinnate, and, in rare instances, may be more finely dissected. The venation is usually free, though it can occasionally exhibit anastomosis without included veinlets. Indumentum is generally absent or consists of two-celled glandular hairs. Sori are positioned marginally or submarginally, are extrorse, and can be elongate to linear in shape, with protection provided by outer (unmodified) and inner (modified) indusia. The spores are typically tetrahedral and trilete, although bilateral and monolete forms are rare (Smith et al. 2006).
