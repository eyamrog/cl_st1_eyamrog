All of these logos feature elements that connect them to Timor-Leste, including the map of Timor-Leste in the logo for FC Lao Rai United, the prominent depiction of a crocodile in the logo for the Young Crocs, and the incorporation of the star from the national flag along with the flag's colors—red, yellow, black, and white—in the logos for the Ramkabian and Young Crocs teams. These logos were designed online and primarily functioned as virtual images that circulated within digital texts.
