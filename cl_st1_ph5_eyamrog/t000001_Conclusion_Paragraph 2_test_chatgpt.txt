Although achieving perfect bacterial genome assemblies is now feasible, the process remains complex and challenging. Future advancements in Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) chemistry, basecallers, and polishing algorithms are anticipated; however, it remains uncertain whether these improvements will suffice to enable flawless ONT-only assemblies, thereby eliminating the necessity for Illumina reads. Additionally, further software innovations are essential to eliminate the need for human intervention, facilitating the generation of perfect assemblies through a fully automated pipeline, even in intricate scenarios such as genomes exhibiting heterogeneity. The ultimate objective is to reach a point where genome assembly can be accomplished with such ease and reliability that it becomes a standard expectation in the field.
