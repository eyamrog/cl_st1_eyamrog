The plants described are terrestrial and form a ticket-like structure, characterized by long-creeping rhizomes adorned with ciliform hairs. The leaves range from 1.5 to 4.5 meters in length, with stipes measuring between 0.75 and 2.5 meters; the proximal portion of the stipes is dark brown, while the upper part is stramineous and glabrous. The laminae vary in length from 0.75 to 2.5 meters and exhibit a 3-4 pinnate-pinnatifid structure proximally. The rachises are stramineous and glabrous, while the basal pinnae measure 60-100 cm by 25-70 cm and are equilateral. Distally, the pinnae and pinnules feature free lobes between the segments, with the compound distal segments being inequilateral, irregularly dissected, and caudate at the apex. The simple distal segments are linear, reaching lengths of up to 3-4 cm. The costae are covered with reddish catenate hairs on the abaxial side, while remaining glabrous on the adaxial side; similarly, the costules exhibit reddish catenate hairs abaxially and are glabrous adaxially. The veins on the abaxial side are lanose, featuring lax, arachnoid hairs, whereas they are glabrous on the adaxial side. The laminar tissue between the veins is glabrous on both sides. Sori are marginal and linear, located along the segment margins and borne at the tips of multiple veins, with vestigial inner indusia and linear outer indusia.
