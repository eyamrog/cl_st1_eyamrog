This paper is based on sociolinguistic ethnographic research conducted with young migrant workers from Timor-Leste residing in a small town in Northern Ireland (Cabral & Martin-Jones, 2017). The primary objectives of this research were: (1) to construct a comprehensive account of the life histories of a select group of these young Timorese individuals, considering their educational backgrounds and prior work experiences in Timor-Leste, as well as their migration trajectories to Northern Ireland via Portugal or England; (2) to document how they navigated the local conditions of settlement and employment; (3) to explore the agentive strategies they employed to create new spaces of solidarity and conviviality within their local communities; and (4) to examine the diverse linguistic, cultural, and semiotic resources, including Portuguese, that they utilized in the formation of new transnational and transcultural identities within their local contexts.
