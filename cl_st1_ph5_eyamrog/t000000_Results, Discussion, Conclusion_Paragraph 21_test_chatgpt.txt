The plants are terrestrial, characterized by erect to decumbent rhizomes that are stout and resemble trunks, exhibiting a glabrescent texture. The leaves measure between 1.2 and 2.2 meters in length, with petioles that are burgundy at the base and stramineous above, ranging from 40 to 80 cm long and displaying a proximal wrinkled or minutely spiny appearance. The petiolar scales are peltate and blackish, occasionally featuring lighter, dentate margins. The laminae are 1-pinnate, measuring 80 to 140 cm long, with stramineous and glabrous rachises. The basal pinnae are 15 to 25 cm long and 2.5 to 3.5 cm wide, with both abaxial and adaxial costae being glabrous. The veins are typically 1-furcate, though they may rarely be simple or 2 to 3-furcate at the base of the pinnae, and are also glabrous on both surfaces. The sori are marginal and discrete, located at the tips of single veins, arranged side by side, and opening extrorsely. The outer indusia are not modified, while the inner indusia are hemi-umbonate, often forming wings that connect adjacent sori.
