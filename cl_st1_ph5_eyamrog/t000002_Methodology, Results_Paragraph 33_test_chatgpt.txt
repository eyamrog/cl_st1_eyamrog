In contrast to 'exploring explanations,' which focused on the advancement, extension, and enhancement of students' ideas, 'guiding explanations' referred to sequences that directed students toward scientific explanations, emphasizing the precise use of scientific terminology. These two categories were further subdivided into four distinct typologies. Additionally, 'providing explanations' described sequences in which the teacher presented explanations to the students. Within this sample of talk-intensive lessons, this form of direct instruction was notably interactive; while students contributed some input, the teacher predominantly facilitated the conceptual development.
