A critical consideration in Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing is the required read depth, which significantly influences both assembly and polishing processes. High read depth enhances assembly by facilitating the generation of more independent read sets in Trycycler (refer to Step 3) and improves polishing accuracy (see Step 4). For optimal assembly outcomes, a minimum depth of 100× is recommended, with 200× being the ideal target; while depths exceeding 200× may yield better results, they often provide diminishing returns. It is important to note that utilizing a single ONT flow cell for a single bacterial isolate can result in excessive read depth, prompting the common practice of multiplexing in microbial genomics. Although this approach does not pose significant challenges for assembly, it is essential to be mindful of potential barcode leakage (see Pitfalls).
