Rhizomes are generally long-creeping and can be classified as solenostelic, although instances of dictyostelic or polycyclic structures are rare. They may bear hairs or, less commonly, primitive scales. The leaves are monomorphic, with stipes frequently featuring epipetiolar buds and typically possessing an omega-shaped vascular strand. The laminae are usually 2-5 pinnate, though less dissected forms can occur. The venation is predominantly free, with anastomosing veins being rare and, when present, lacking included veinlets. The indumentum may consist of hairs or glandular hairs, or it may be absent altogether. Sori can be found in marginal or submarginal positions, appearing either linear or discrete, and can be introrse or extrorse. They are typically protected by outer and/or inner indusia, although there are instances where they are unprotected. Spores are characterized as tetrahedral and trilete, or alternatively, as reniform and monolete (Smith et al. 2006).
