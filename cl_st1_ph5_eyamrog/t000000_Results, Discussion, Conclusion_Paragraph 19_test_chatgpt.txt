Rhizomes are typically erect or, less commonly, short-creeping, occasionally developing into small trunks; they are dictyostelic and bear peltate scales. The leaves are monomorphic, with stipes featuring an omega-shaped vascular strand, and laminae that are 1-4 pinnate, exhibiting free veins. The indumentum consists of caduceus scales or, less frequently, scattered catenate hairs. Sori are either marginal or submarginal, discrete, and extrorse, and are protected by outer (unmodified) and inner (modified) indusia. The spores are tetrahedral-globose and trilete (Smith et al. 2006).
