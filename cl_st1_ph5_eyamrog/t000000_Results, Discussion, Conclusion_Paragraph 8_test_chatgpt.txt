The rhizomes are characterized by a long-creeping growth habit and are covered with setose hairs. The leaves are notably large, reaching lengths of up to 4.5 meters, and exhibit a 3-5-pinnate structure. The venation is free, and the indumentum consists of a combination of catenate hairs, acicular hairs, arachnoid hairs, and minute gnarled hairs. Sori are located marginally, appearing linear and continuous along the laminar margins, and are borne on the commissural veins. The inner indusia are vestigial, while the outer indusia are linear in shape (Smith et al. 2006).
