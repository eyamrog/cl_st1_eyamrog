Interventionist research has explored and identified various forms of enhanced teacher-student interactions that facilitate effective teaching and learning (e.g., Mercer, 2002). A key conclusion from this body of work is that the nature of discourse significantly influences the learning opportunities available to students (Howe & Mercer, 2007; Kelly, 2014; Lemke, 2001); as Nystrand (1997) asserts, “the quality of student learning is closely linked to the quality of classroom talk” (p. 29).
