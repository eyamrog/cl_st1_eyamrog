In the UK, young migrants from Timor-Leste have pursued two overlapping pathways into employment. Firstly, some have engaged with the long-established labor migration routes originating from mainland Portugal and Madeira, which has resulted in the concentration of Timorese migrant workers in small towns and rural areas, particularly in regions such as Devon and Lincolnshire in England, as well as County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, this migration has facilitated the establishment of factories associated with food production, including those dedicated to the processing and packaging of poultry and other meats (Doyle & McAreavey, 2016). Conversely, other Timorese migrants have relocated to urban centers, including Bridgewater, Bristol, Oxford, Peterborough, Leeds, London, and Northwich near Manchester, where they have secured employment in the service sector, encompassing roles in supermarkets, department stores, and online shopping/packing services. Regardless of their rural or urban settings, these migrants find themselves in precarious positions within the local economy, embodying what Standing (2010) characterizes as the expanding "global precariat." Typically recruited through employment agencies, they are subject to flexible work schedules that further contribute to their economic vulnerability.
