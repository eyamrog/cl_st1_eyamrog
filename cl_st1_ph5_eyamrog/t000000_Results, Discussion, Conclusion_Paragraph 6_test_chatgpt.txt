The plants are terrestrial and characterized by long-creeping rhizomes adorned with brownish catenate hairs. The leaves range from 1 to 3.5 meters in length, with stipes measuring between 0.5 and 2.5 meters; the proximal stipes are brown, transitioning to a lighter brown above, and are either covered in acicular hairs or glabrescent. The laminae can reach lengths of 0.5 to 2 meters and exhibit a proximal structure that is 3-pinnate-pinnatifid to 4-pinnate. The rachises are light brown and pilose, featuring brownish catenate hairs, and lack proliferous buds. The basal pinnae measure 25 to 100 cm by 12 to 35 cm and are subequilateral in shape. The pinnules are sessile, lanceolate to oblong, with dentate margins. Both the costae and costules are pilose on both the abaxial and adaxial surfaces, exhibiting light brown to reddish catenate hairs. The veins are free and hirsute on both surfaces, presenting erect, light brown to reddish acicular hairs. The laminar tissue between the veins is similarly covered with catenate and acicular hairs. Sori are either oblong or rounded, located at the tips of single veins within the sinuses of the segments, and the indusia are purse-shaped, typically featuring acicular and catenate hairs.
