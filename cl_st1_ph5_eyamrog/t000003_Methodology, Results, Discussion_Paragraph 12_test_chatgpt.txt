The communicative challenges encountered by new arrivals in their interactions with Irish authorities and in accessing social services are underscored by recent statistics pertaining to health and social care in Northern Ireland. According to Doyle and McAreavey (2016), Tetum ranked among the top six languages for interpreter requests within the health and social care sector between April 1 and June 30, 2014. During this three-month period, a total of 24,158 interpreter requests were recorded for 41 different languages across Northern Ireland.
