It is important to highlight that the findings regarding classroom interaction were derived without providing the reader with any discursive extracts. In certain instances, researchers include only brief excerpts to demonstrate the application of their analytical framework, rather than as integral components of the analysis itself. Consequently, the results rely entirely on the explanatory power of the coding system and the reliability of the coding process. Furthermore, given the nature of the research questions, it is evident that a qualitative approach would neither facilitate generalization in the descriptions nor provide the objectivity necessary to compare changes in discursive variables over time.
