Recent publications, including review books on methods for analyzing classroom dialogue (Kershner, Hennessy, et al., 2020; Kumpulainen et al., 2009; MÃ¤rtsin, 2012), have contributed to the expanding field of research in this area. This discussion paper aims to reflect on the methodologies and methods used to analyze classroom discursive interaction. Rather than immediately delving into analytical techniques, the paper begins with a comprehensive methodological discussion that encompasses research paradigms, including considerations of epistemology and ontology. In the second part, the paper presents methods and procedures for discursive data analysis, categorized into two main approaches: quantitative and qualitative. Both approaches are thoroughly discussed and illustrated with examples drawn from previous research.
