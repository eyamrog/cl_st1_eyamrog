There is no clear and straightforward distinction between the sequences of exploring and guiding explanations, as real classroom interactions often involve unplanned utterances, deviations, and uncontrolled flows that complicate the categorization of these sequences (Barnes, 1976). Consequently, these explanatory sequences should not be regarded as neat or crystalline; rather, different categories may overlap in certain utterances. This concern was previously articulated by Mercer (1995), who proposed three distinct types of group talk.
