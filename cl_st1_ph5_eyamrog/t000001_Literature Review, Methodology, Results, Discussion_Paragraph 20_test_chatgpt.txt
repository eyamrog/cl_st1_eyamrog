Certain bacterial taxa have experienced a proliferation of insertion sequence elements throughout their evolutionary history, leading to genomes characterized by hundreds of 1â€“2 kbp repeats. Achieving a perfect assembly of such genomes presents significant challenges, as short-read polishers often struggle to correct errors within high-copy-number repeats. Consequently, it is essential to optimize the accuracy of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing by employing high ONT depth, utilizing R10.4.1 pores, implementing 'super' basecalling, and applying Medaka polishing to minimize the residual errors that short-read polishing must address. Furthermore, the incorporation of mate-pair Illumina sequencing may facilitate the Polypolish tool in rectifying errors within repeat sequences by decreasing the number of ambiguous short-read alignments.
