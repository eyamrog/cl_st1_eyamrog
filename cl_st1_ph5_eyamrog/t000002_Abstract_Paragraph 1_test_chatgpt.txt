This article presents a theoretical exploration aimed at discussing methodologies and methods in educational research, particularly those that analyze discursive interactions within the classroom. The initial section examines the two predominant research paradigms—positivism and interpretivism—along with their respective ontological and epistemological foundations. Subsequently, two methods for analyzing discursive interactions are introduced and evaluated, one corresponding to each paradigm. Systematic coding, situated within a quantitative framework, is employed to analyze data from large samples, enabling the identification of general patterns and facilitating statistical comparisons or temporal analyses by transforming discourse into variables. This method is applied to a dataset comprising 42 episodes of group dialogue, with the results interpreted in relation to the nature of the research questions, thereby illustrating the types of statistical tests that can be conducted. Within the interpretivist paradigm, sociocultural discourse analysis is presented as a qualitative method, applied to excerpts from classroom dialogues. The primary finding reveals typologies that characterize the ways in which teachers and students construct scientific explanations. In the concluding section, the article discusses the potentialities and limitations of each method, ultimately arguing that both approaches can be viewed as complementary in advancing knowledge within the educational field.
