Although the approximately 5 kbp rRNA operon represents the longest repeat found in many bacterial genomes, longer repeats can occur. For instance, Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 possesses a 56 kbp duplication within its chromosome. In these instances, the typical read lengths produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), which are around 20 kbp, may prove inadequate for effective assembly, necessitating the use of ultra-long reads that can reach up to 100 kbp (see Figure 2C).
