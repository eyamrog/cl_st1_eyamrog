The football tournaments featuring Timorese teams in Dungannon and Cookstown are strategically scheduled to align with dates of national and political significance in Timor-Leste, specifically May 20, which marks the anniversary of Independence, and August 30, commemorating the pivotal Referendum on Independence in 1999. In Figure 3 below, we present two photographs of the cup awarded to Fitun Unidade during the May 20 tournament in 2014, alongside the medals earned by individual players for various achievements, such as 'man of the match' and 'highest goal scorer.'
