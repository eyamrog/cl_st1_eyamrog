In addressing the first research question, the results are presented based on the entire dataset. Initially, the overall group discourse was analyzed, with relative code frequencies calculated to quantify the number of content-related utterances (codes 1 to 6), instruction-related utterances (code 7), and off-topic utterances (code 8), all divided by the total number of utterances. As illustrated in Figure 1, groups dedicated nearly half (56%) of their utterances to discussing the content of the task, approximately one-quarter (25%) to negotiating task instructions, and a notable portion (19%) to off-topic discussions. This indicates that only half of the group work was focused on content, which is the type of discourse most directly associated with conceptual and disciplinary learning gains.
