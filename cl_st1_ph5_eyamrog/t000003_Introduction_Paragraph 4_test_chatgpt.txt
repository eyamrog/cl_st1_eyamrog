The theoretical framework for our research is grounded in the field of multilingualism, drawing from the sociolinguistics of globalization, anthropological studies on migration and diaspora, and contemporary sociological writings on mobilities and mooring. In the subsequent section of this paper, we explore the intersecting theoretical frameworks across these diverse fields, highlighting the concepts most pertinent to our investigation. The third section delineates the extensive temporal and spatial dimensions of transnational population movements originating from Timor-Leste, with a particular emphasis on recent Timorese migration to Northern Ireland. In the fourth section, we outline the research methodology employed in our study, detailing the variety of ethnographic, textual, and photographic data we have collected. The fifth section draws attention to the diverse origins and migration trajectories of our study participants, as well as the ways in which their communicative repertoires have evolved over time. The sixth section provides an in-depth examination of the local conditions surrounding settlement and employment. The seventh section focuses on nine football clubs, analyzing how linguistic and semiotic resources are utilized in their naming, organization, and distinctive branding. We also illustrate how club organizers and managers leverage cultural resources and various forms of knowledge in the management of these clubs. Furthermore, we address the intricate processes of identification that manifest within this sporting context and the multifaceted local representations of what it means to be Timorese. Finally, in the concluding two sections, we reflect on the significance of the insights gained from our research to date.
