In alignment with this body of research, we assert that to comprehensively account for the lived experiences of migration among diverse social actors, it is essential to consider both mobility and mooring (or re-mooring) simultaneously, as articulated by Hannam et al. (2006, p. 2), who state that "mobilities and mooring occur dialectically." This necessitates an exploration of the historical specificity of various migration trajectories while simultaneously capturing the contextualized processes through which mooring (or re-mooring) takes place, as well as how new forms of social organization, communities of practice (Wenger, 1998), and social activities acquire meaning. Research in the fields of anthropology and cultural studies (e.g., Brah, 1996; Fortier, 2000; Ahmed et al., 2003) has maintained this dual focus, offering insights into dislocation and displacement while illuminating the social and cultural processes associated with mooring, reterritorialization, or what Ahmed et al. (2003) refer to as regrounding.
