In June 2015, we interviewed two individuals, RS and HA, who were among the earliest groups to arrive in Dungannon from Portugal in 2001 and 2002. They secured employment through an agency in Portugal (Interviews, June 2015). Additionally, another interviewee, MFB, had previously worked in England before relocating to Northern Ireland, which provided him with prior exposure to English in a professional setting (Interview with MFB, June 2015).
