This paper aims to contribute to the emerging field of sociolinguistics concerning multilingualism and mobility, with a specific focus on a particular transnational migration from the Global South to the North and West. The case of Timorese migrants in Northern Ireland highlights several critical points: Firstly, it underscores the necessity of moving beyond purely synchronic descriptions and analyses to consider the historical contexts of specific migration movements, the unique dynamics of South/North entanglements, and the ways in which memories of significant moments in past political struggles, along with symbols of national identity, play a vital role in shaping a sense of solidarity and belonging among migrants.
