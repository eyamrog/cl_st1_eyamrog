The final decade of the twentieth century and the initial decade of the twenty-first century witnessed a significant increase in interest in globalization within the social sciences. During this period, the sociological and anthropological literature produced a rich array of theoretical frameworks and critical analyses addressing the evolving social and cultural conditions characteristic of the late modern era (e.g., Harvey, 1989; Appadurai, 1996; Castells, 2000; Hannerz, 1996). Scholars highlighted various dimensions of change brought about by globalization, including the intensification of transnational population movements, the rapid advancement of new communication technologies, and the transformation of the political and economic landscapes across diverse regions of the world.
