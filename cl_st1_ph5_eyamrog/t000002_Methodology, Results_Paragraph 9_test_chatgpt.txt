A coding scheme was developed based on existing literature and consisted of ten codes pertinent to dialogic classroom discourse at the utterance level. This scheme categorized the utterances into three contexts: content, task, and off-topic, thereby allowing for a nuanced analysis of the tenor of each utterance. Specifically, the codes enable the differentiation of utterances that pertain to the content of the task (the topic under discussion), those that relate to task procedures or classroom management, and those that are off-topic, which do not focus on either content or task (see Table 1).
