The data corpus was analyzed to identify instances where explanations were constructed as a collaborative activity between teachers and students. In the 18 episodes of whole-class instruction recorded in this module, five distinct types of explanatory sequences were developed and categorized into three overarching discursive acts, based on whether the teachers were exploring, guiding, or delivering an explanation.
