The objective of long-read assembly is to generate complete sequences devoid of structural errors, meaning that the only permissible errors in the assembly should be small-scale, such as single-base pair substitutions, insertions, or deletions. This is important because subsequent polishing steps can effectively correct small-scale errors, whereas they may not be capable of addressing larger structural errors.
