By the first decade of the twenty-first century, sociolinguists began to make significant contributions to the emerging body of research through empirical investigations and theoretical development. Their work enhanced the understanding of the political, economic, and cultural conditions of late modernity, as well as the ways in which language practices and ideologies organize and legitimize these conditions (Coupland, 2003; Heller, 2007, 2011; Blommaert, 2010; DuchÃªne & Heller, 2012; Heller et al., 2016). In this article, we focus on the specific epistemological shifts that have occurred within the sociolinguistics of multilingualism, illustrating how the debates within this field have informed our own perspectives as we conducted research with Timorese individuals in the UK.
