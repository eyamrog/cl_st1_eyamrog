A perfect bacterial genome assembly is defined as one in which the assembled sequence precisely matches the organism's genome, with each replicon sequence being complete and devoid of any errors, regardless of their scale. Although achieving such perfection has historically posed significant challenges, advancements in long-read sequencing technologies, assembly algorithms, and polishing techniques have made perfect assemblies increasingly attainable. In this article, we present our recommended methodology for achieving optimal bacterial genome assembly by integrating Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads with Illumina short reads. Our approach involves the use of Trycycler for long-read assembly, followed by Medaka for long-read polishing, and Polypolish for short-read polishing, in addition to other short-read polishing tools complemented by manual curation. Furthermore, we address potential pitfalls that may arise when assembling complex genomes and provide an online tutorial complete with sample data (github.com/rrwick/perfect-bacterial-genome-tutorial) to facilitate the assembly process.
