The six other teams comprised a diverse group of adult players hailing from various districts of Timor-Leste. Within these football clubs, members were united by a common national identity as Timorese. During interviews with the two organizers of the Ramkabian club, they elaborated on their choice of name, which incorporates elements from the names of three prominent mountains in Timor-Leste: Ramelau, Kablake, and Matebian. This naming strategy was intended to promote inclusivity, address differences, and foster solidarity among members. One organizer articulated the club's objectives, blending Portuguese and Tetum in his explanation, stating that one of the aims was: “Criar amizade que [é] forte, la’os ba iha ne’é deit maibé iha fatin hotu-hotu” (Creating friendship that is strong, not only for this [club] but everywhere) (Interview with both RS and HA, June 7, 2015 – all Portuguese words are shown in italics). Similarly, FC Lao Rai United was positioned as a platform for fostering connections among Timorese from different districts, with one organizer noting that participation in tournaments provided an opportunity for players to become acquainted with one another. The term "Lao Rai" (Travellers) in the club's name symbolically represented the shared identity of its members as individuals in transit. Additionally, the third club, AS Bidau, embodied an inclusive ethos, with its name referencing a linguistically diverse neighborhood in Dili, reflecting the mixed language backgrounds of its players.
