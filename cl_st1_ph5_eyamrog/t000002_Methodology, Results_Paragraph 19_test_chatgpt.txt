The analysis revealed three task pairs exhibiting significant differences (H(6) = 24.881, p < .001), specifically between tasks 1-2 (p = .008), tasks 2-6 (p = .001), and tasks 4-6 (p = .04). As illustrated in Figure 3, task 2 emerged as the most dialogic, followed by task 4, whereas tasks 1 and 6 predominantly featured non-dialogic utterances. Consequently, the hypothesis positing an enhancement in the use of dialogic utterances across the tasks was not supported. Additionally, the observed differences between tasks were minimal and could not be attributed to the effects of the intervention.
