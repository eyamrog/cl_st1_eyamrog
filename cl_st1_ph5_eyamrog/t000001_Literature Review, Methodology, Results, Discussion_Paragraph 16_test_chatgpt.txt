The aforementioned method necessitates human judgment and interaction, particularly during the Trycycler and short-read polishing stages. This involvement enables users to identify and address unexpected results, thereby preventing subpar data from advancing to subsequent steps. While this approach is well-suited for scenarios where accuracy is critical, such as reference genome assembly, it cannot be executed in an automated fashion (e.g., using Nextflow35) and is therefore unsuitable for high-throughput assembly processes.
