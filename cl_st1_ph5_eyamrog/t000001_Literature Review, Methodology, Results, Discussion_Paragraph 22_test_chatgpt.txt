Demultiplexing errors can arise during multiplexed sequencing runs, where reads associated with one barcode may inadvertently 'leak' into another, leading to low-level contamination. When a sequence associated with a particular barcode is present at a significantly high depth, it may also be detected in other barcodes at sufficient depths to allow for assembly. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent with high-copy-number plasmids (see Figure 2D). Consequently, when multiple genome assemblies derived from the same sequencing run exhibit identical plasmids, it is essential to consider cross-barcode contamination as a potential contributing factor.
