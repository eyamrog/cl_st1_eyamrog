This article presents an analysis of three distinct aspects of football-related activities observed during our fieldwork in June 2015, while also introducing key social actors involved in these dynamics. The first aspect pertains to the naming and branding of the clubs, where we examine how linguistic and semiotic practices reflect various Timorese identities. The second aspect focuses on the leadership structures and organizational practices of club managers, highlighting how these individuals leveraged available linguistic resources and knowledge in their administrative roles, as well as how Timorese cultural practices were integrated into the ethos of certain clubs. The third aspect addresses the scheduling of football tournaments, which coincided with significant dates in the history of Timor-Leste's establishment as a nation; in this context, we also emphasize the role of friendly away matches and the utilization of social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube in the representation of both tournament and friendly matches.
