Throughout much of the twentieth century, the primary focus in the sociolinguistics of multilingualism was on delineating patterns of language use within local "communities," which were often conceptualized as stable, homogeneous, and bounded entities. Pratt (1987, p. 60) was the first to advocate for a re-evaluation of the concept of "community," proposing a shift towards a "linguistics of contact." She contended that this approach should emphasize the interactions and intersections between dominant and dominated groups, as well as among individuals with diverse and multiple identities who speak different languages.
