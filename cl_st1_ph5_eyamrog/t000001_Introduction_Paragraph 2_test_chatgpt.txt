The resolution to this challenge lies in de novo assembly, a computational methodology employed to reconstruct a genome from sequencing reads. Two primary objectives must be considered in genome assembly: accuracy and completeness. Accuracy pertains to the frequency of errors within the assembled sequences, known as contigs, which can manifest as minor discrepancies, such as incorrect nucleotide bases, or more significant alterations, including the addition or deletion of hundreds of bases. Completeness, on the other hand, relates to the length of the contigs in comparison to the corresponding genomic sequence, indicating the degree of fragmentation within the assembly; longer contigs are preferable, with the ideal scenario being that each contig represents an entire replicon of the genome. We characterize a 'perfect' assembly as one that optimally balances both accuracy and completeness, wherein a flawless assembly of a bacterial genome would consist of a single, complete, and error-free contig for each replicon, with no extraneous contigs present.
