Since 2012, we have been conducting sampling of remnant forest patches. Specimens were collected and dried following standard protocols for fern collections (Windisch, 1992) and subsequently deposited in the VIC herbarium (acronyms as per Thiers, continuously updated), with duplicates prepared for distribution to other herbaria. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive review of the VIC herbarium collection as well as the online collections of other herbaria, including F, IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. While the classification system utilized in previous fascicles was based on adaptations of Kenrick and Crane (1997) and Smith et al. (2006), we have adopted the classification system proposed by PPG I (2016) for this study. Morphological terminology follows Lellinger (2002).
