This step focuses on correcting as many remaining errors as possible by utilizing only long reads. We recommend employing Medaka, which has demonstrated greater accuracy compared to Nanopolish. Medaka leverages a neural network and includes trained models tailored to specific combinations of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) chemistry and basecaller; therefore, it is essential to select the Medaka model that most closely aligns with the ONT reads being analyzed. Alternatively, long-read variant callers such as Clair3 can serve as effective polishers by applying the identified variants to the assembly.
