The plants are terrestrial, characterized by short-creeping rhizomes adorned with dark brown, lanceolate scales. The leaves measure between 35 and 80 cm in length, with stipes ranging from 15 to 50 cm; the proximal portion of the stipes is dark brown, while the upper part is stramineous. The abaxial surface of the stipes is terete, and the adaxial surface is flattened, featuring dark brown, acuminate scales proximally. The laminae are 20 to 35 cm long and exhibit a 2-pinnate structure, although 1- or 3-pinnate forms are occasionally observed. The rachises are not winged and are stramineous, displaying sparse 2-celled glandular hairs or becoming glabrescent. The basal pinnae measure 12 to 25 cm by 1 to 2 cm, and the pinnules are short-petiolate, dimidiate, or flabellate, reaching up to 1 cm in length. Both the costae and veins, on the abaxial and adaxial surfaces, are sparsely covered with 2-celled glandular hairs or are glabrous. The laminar tissue situated between the veins, on both surfaces, also exhibits sparse 2-celled glandular hairs or is glabrous. The sori are interrupted and located at the tips of multiple veins, while the inner indusia are membranaceous, with dentate margins that are glabrous.
