In contrast to previous short-read-first hybrid assembly approaches, such as Unicycler, our recommended method adopts a long-read-first paradigm. Long reads, due to their superior ability to manage repetitive sequences, provide a robust foundation for genome assembly, with short reads utilized solely for final polishing. We contend that this approach can facilitate the achievement of perfect genome assemblies with zero errors. However, establishing a definitive ground truth genome sequence poses significant challenges; therefore, when assembly accuracy is paramount, we advocate for the execution of multiple alternative assemblies that differ in data and methodologies, including sequencing platforms, assemblers within the Trycycler pipeline, read quality control thresholds, and short-read polishing tools. The generation of identical assemblies from these alternative approaches enhances confidence in their accuracy, while discrepancies among the assemblies necessitate further investigation, such as visualizing read alignments in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).
