The first large-scale study on classroom dialogue was likely conducted by Flanders (1970), who introduced the concept of the "two-thirds rule," which posits that in typical classroom settings, two-thirds of the time is occupied by verbal communication, with two-thirds of this communication being attributed to the teacher, and two-thirds of the teacher's discourse consisting of lecturing. Another significant finding is encapsulated in the framework of triadic discourse, which includes initiation, response, and feedback or evaluation (Mehan, 1979; Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975). This interactional pattern is arguably the most prevalent characteristic of whole-class discussions and can account for as much as 70% of all teacher-student interactions (Cazden, 1988; Nassaji & Wells, 2000; Wells, 1993). While much of the research in this area has been conducted in Anglo-Saxon countries, this pattern is recognized globally (Alexander, 2001).
