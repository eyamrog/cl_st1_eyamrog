Long-read polishing typically enhances assembly accuracy; however, it is important to note that a decrease in accuracy can occasionally occur. Consequently, it may be ambiguous at this stage whether the unpolished assembly, the Medaka-polished assembly, or an alternative such as the Clair3-polished assembly is the most suitable option. To address this uncertainty, ALE serves as a valuable tool for quantifying the concordance between an assembly and a set of short reads, thereby enabling the assessment of the relative accuracy of various assemblies. Therefore, we recommend utilizing ALE to inform the decision regarding which version of the assembly should advance to the subsequent step of short-read polishing.
