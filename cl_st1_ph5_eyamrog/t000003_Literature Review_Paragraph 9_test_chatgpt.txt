Positioning our research on Timorese migrants in Northern Ireland within the framework of the new sociolinguistics of multilingualism, we integrate a dual focus on the social processes of mobility and mooring with an exploration of how language and other semiotic resources (Kress, 2010) are utilized in the mooring process. Our primary emphasis is on the creation of spaces of solidarity and conviviality within local lifeworlds, the construction of new identities and forms of belonging within these spaces, and the diverse representations—both online and offline—of what it means to be Timorese, extending well beyond the borders of Timor-Leste. We adopt the term "lifeworld," as proposed by Habermas (1987), to denote spaces that exist outside institutional contexts. Additionally, we employ the term "spaces of conviviality" in a broad sense, encompassing both the everyday understanding of "spaces where we engage in enjoyable activities together" and the interpretation offered by Gilroy (2004), which reflects on the potential for conviviality in contemporary urban environments where individuals from diverse backgrounds coexist, where differences are normalized, and where cultural resources are shared and blended across generations.
