Neither of the examples provides clear evidence of an exploration or deepening of students' ideas. Instead, it can be argued that the teachers had well-defined objectives and sought to achieve them collaboratively with the students. They were notably successful in illustrating the comparative analogy between the evaporation of water and that of perfume, while also emphasizing a microscopic explanation of the evaporation process. The student contributed minimally to the discussion and appeared to follow the teachers' line of reasoning without significant engagement.
