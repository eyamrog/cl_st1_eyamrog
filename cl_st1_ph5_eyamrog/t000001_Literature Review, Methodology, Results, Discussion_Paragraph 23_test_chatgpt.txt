Heterogeneity arises when there is not a singular underlying genome but rather a combination of two or more variants. This phenomenon can manifest at both small scales, such as a mixture of different bases at a specific locus, and larger scales, such as a variety of structural configurations. When heterogeneity is present at low levels—illustrated by a scenario where 95% of the reads support one sequence while 5% support another—it typically does not pose significant challenges, as assemblers and polishers tend to favor the more prevalent alternative. Conversely, balanced heterogeneity, exemplified by a 50:50 mixture, can lead to misassemblies and errors during the polishing process. One notable source of heterogeneity in Enterobacteriaceae is the phase variation of the fim switch (Figure 2E), while another prevalent instance occurs with bacteriophages, which can integrate into and excise from bacterial chromosomes (Figure 2F). Heterogeneity can be detected through incomplete assembly graphs and dense clusters of modifications introduced by a polisher. In such cases, it may be necessary to manually exclude reads that support one variant, thereby facilitating a cleaner assembly and polishing of the alternative variant.
