At the conclusion of the period during which plant classification systems predominantly relied on morphological data, Dennstaedtiaceae was regarded as a large family encompassing three subfamilies (or tribes) and approximately 17 genera (Tryon & Tryon, 1982; Kramer, 1990). However, with the introduction of molecular data, these subfamilies were elevated to family status, leading to the establishment of new families. Consequently, the early-diverging leptosporangiate ferns are now represented by Cystodiaceae (one genus), a more narrowly defined Dennstaedtiaceae (11-12 genera), Lindsaeaceae (seven genera), Lonchitidaceae (one genus), Saccolomataceae (one or two genera), and the extensive Pteridaceae, which includes over 50 genera (Smith et al., 2006; PPG I, 2016; Shang et al., 2018; Schwartsburd et al., 2020).
