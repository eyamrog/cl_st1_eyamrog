Both paradigms face criticism. Positivist researchers are often perceived as superficial and restrictive, as they tend to overlook underlying contradictions and assume that findings or solutions are universally applicable across different contexts (Taber, 2013). Conversely, interpretivist studies have been criticized for their anecdotal nature and lack of methodological rigor, which can lead to challenges in generalization and scalability.
