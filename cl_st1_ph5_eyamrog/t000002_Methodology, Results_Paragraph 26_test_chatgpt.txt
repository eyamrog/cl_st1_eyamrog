Such analyses are often exemplified through selected extracts accompanied by commentary that references both the relevant field and contextual knowledge. This examination may focus on the syntax and cohesive structure of language, illustrating how knowledge is socially constructed within the classroom (Mercer, 2004). As the dialogue remains unaltered throughout the analysis, the resulting typologies serve as heuristic tools for interpreting the discourse in relation to specific issues (Mercer, 2004). For example, Mercer's research identified three distinct types of group talk: disputational, cumulative, and exploratory, demonstrating that the latter has a positive impact on student learning. Therefore, the objective is not to reduce the data to a mere categorical tally, but rather to establish broad characteristics that encompass the context and the discursive dynamics pertinent to educational learning goals (Mercer et al., 2004). The subsequent subsection presents an example of the types of research questions and findings that sociocultural discourse analysis can yield.
