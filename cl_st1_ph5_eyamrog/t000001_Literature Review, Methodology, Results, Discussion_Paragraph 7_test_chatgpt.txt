Illumina reads, utilized primarily for final polishing (refer to Step 5), are of lesser significance compared to ONT reads. Most contemporary Illumina platforms generate comparable data, such as 150-bp paired-end reads, and are equally effective for bacterial whole-genome sequencing, with the selection of instruments primarily influenced by cost considerations and multiplexing requirements. Nextera XT library preparations can result in variable read depths, meaning that certain genomic regions may exhibit low coverage; therefore, Illumina DNA Prep (also known as Nextera DNA Flex) and TruSeq are generally preferred. If Nextera XT is employed, it is advisable to target a high mean depth, such as 300×, to mitigate depth variation; otherwise, a depth of 100× is typically adequate. For genomes characterized by high levels of repetition, mate-pair preparations may enhance the performance of short-read polishing (see Pitfalls). Following the generation of Illumina reads, we recommend employing a quality control tool, such as fastp, to eliminate low-quality bases and adapter sequences.
