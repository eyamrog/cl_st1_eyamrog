The mobility paradigm has evolved within sociolinguistics and the broader social sciences, yet there is an increasing divergence of perspectives on the subject. One notable strand of research (e.g., Cresswell, 2002; Brenner, 2004; Hannam et al., 2006; Urry, 2007) critiques studies that focus exclusively on mobility, as well as those employing "deterritorialized approaches that posit a new ‘grand narrative’ of mobility, fluidity, or liquidity as a pervasive condition of postmodernity or globalization" (Hannam et al., 2006, p. 5). These scholars contend that any comprehensive account of mobilities must also consider the concepts of moorings and reterritorializations. They assert that "forms of detachment or ‘deterritorialization’…are always accompanied by rhizomic attachments and reterritorializations of various kinds" (Hannam et al., 2006, p. 3).
