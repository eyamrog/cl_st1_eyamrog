Given the interpretivist nature of this analysis and the specific context of the study—focusing on primary science, scientific discourse, and the concept of evaporation—a supplementary framework was necessary for data interrogation. This framework aimed to clarify what constitutes an explanation in classroom discourse within the realm of primary science. Through an iterative examination of the data and relevant theoretical perspectives, two structural dimensions were identified: forms of explanations and causation (Braaten & Windschitl, 2011). Consequently, the analysis sought to identify sequences of utterances that exemplify instances of explanation, including definitions, descriptions, and reasoning, as well as causation, which encompasses cause-effect relationships pertaining to observable events. By locating examples of these phenomena, it may be possible to develop typologies, provide commentary and descriptions, and explore potential implications.
