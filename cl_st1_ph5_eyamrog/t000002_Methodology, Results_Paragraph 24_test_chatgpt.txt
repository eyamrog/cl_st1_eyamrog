Sociocultural discourse analysis serves as a prime example of a qualitative method, applied here to explore the intricate relationships between classroom interaction and conceptual learning. This analytical approach involves a meticulous examination of specific episodes, aimed at generating categories that are further illustrated with selected extracts. Such a focus allows researchers to move beyond merely identifying discrete discursive functions; instead, it facilitates an investigation into the broader forms of interaction that can be utilized to develop typologies and assess their impact on specific educational objectives. Furthermore, this method addresses language in terms of its content, function, and the processes through which shared understanding is cultivated within social contexts over time (Mercer, 2010, p. 9).
