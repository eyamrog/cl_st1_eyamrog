The utterances related to the task content were classified according to their discursive functions, drawing on the IRF pattern and the dialogic features that characterize productive talk (Howe et al., 2019). Consequently, six codes were developed, with two assigned to each component of the triadic discourse: invitation (INV), dialogic invitation (D_INV), contribution (CON), dialogic contribution (D_CON), follow-up (FOL), and dialogic evaluation (D_EVA). This classification was exclusively applied to content-related utterances, as they serve as the primary medium for knowledge construction and conceptual learning.
