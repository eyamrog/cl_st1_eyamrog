All Lindsaea species from Vi√ßosa exhibit similarities, characterized by their 2-pinnate laminae and dimidiate pinnules; however, distinct differences can be observed among them. Lindsaea lancea var. lancea is distinguished from the other two species by the presence of continuous sori, while L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis is identifiable by its reddish-brown, winged rachises. In contrast, L. stricta var. stricta can be recognized by its terete petioles on the abaxial side. Furthermore, the lengths of the pinnules vary among the three taxa, measuring 1.5-2 cm in L. lancea var. lancea, 1.2-1.5 cm in L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, and up to 1 cm in L. stricta var. stricta.
