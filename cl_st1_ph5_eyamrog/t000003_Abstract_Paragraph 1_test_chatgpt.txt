This paper presents research of a sociolinguistic and ethnographic nature conducted with young migrants from Timor-Leste residing in a small town in Northern Ireland (CABRAL; MARTIN-JONES, 2017). The study traces their migration trajectories, which occurred via Portugal or England, and documents the agentive strategies they employed to navigate local conditions of settlement and employment while simultaneously fostering new spaces of solidarity and conviviality within their local life worlds. Our focus is on a specific life world—namely, that of sport—particularly examining the nine football clubs established for Timorese men and boys in this Irish context. We describe and analyze three distinct aspects of the communicative practices that emerged around football: (1) the linguistic, cultural, and semiotic practices involved in the naming and branding of the clubs, which reflect various Timorese identities from different regions of Timor-Leste as well as diverse globalized cultural realms of football; (2) the language resources utilized by the Timorese club managers, including Tetum, Portuguese, and English, alongside their organizational practices, ethos, and funds of knowledge; and (3) the significance of scheduling football tournaments around key dates in the establishment of the nation of Timor-Leste, a regular practice that signifies an orientation towards a shared national origin.
