The photograph on the left depicts the cup adorned with ribbons that are elegantly draped around it and attached to the medals. These ribbons feature three colors from the national flag of Timor-Leste: red, yellow, and black. Conversely, the photograph on the right illustrates the date of the tournament, which is engraved on the base of the cup in both Portuguese and English.
