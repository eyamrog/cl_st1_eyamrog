All the names of the football clubs examined in this study were compound names that incorporated terms from regional languages, specifically Tetum or Portuguese, as well as English. Furthermore, the use of the acronyms FC and AS reflected broader conventions within international football leagues. The acronym FC, which stands for "Football Club" in English, was positioned before the club name, aligning with the word order typically found in the names of football clubs in the Portuguese league, thereby indexing the Anglophone world. In contrast, AS, an acronym frequently associated with the Italian football league (as exemplified by AS Milan), was interpreted by one of our interviewees as representing the Portuguese word "Associação" (Association). Consequently, for the members of AS Bidau, this acronym signified a connection to the realm of Portuguese football, which enjoys significant popularity in Timor-Leste.
