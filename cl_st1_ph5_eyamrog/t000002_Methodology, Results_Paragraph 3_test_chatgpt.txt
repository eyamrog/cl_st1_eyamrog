While numerous approaches exist for analyzing discursive data and interaction, it can be argued that they all presuppose the necessity for researchers to engage in extensive and repeated reflection on the data in order to fragment and manipulate it in pursuit of underlying patterns and meanings (Evans, 2013, p. 158). The degree to which the data is fragmented often determines the choice between quantitative and qualitative methods. In the context of analyzing discursive interaction, it is generally acknowledged that researchers will eventually categorize or 'code' specific utterances, turns of speech, or episodes (Hennessy et al., 2020).
