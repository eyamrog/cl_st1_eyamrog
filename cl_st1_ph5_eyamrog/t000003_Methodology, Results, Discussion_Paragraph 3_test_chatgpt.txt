Many individuals who have exercised their entitlement to apply for Portuguese citizenship have sought employment in countries outside of Portugal, particularly in the United Kingdom. This trend has become increasingly pronounced in the wake of the recent economic downturn in Portugal. Although there are no official statistics regarding the number of Timorese individuals currently residing and working in the UK, informal estimates suggest that this figure is approximately 15,000. The remittances sent back to family members in Timor-Leste are substantial; in 2008, it was estimated that remittances from the UK to Timor-Leste totaled $5 million annually (SHUAIB, 2008). Given the significant increase in the number of individuals migrating to the UK, it is likely that this amount has risen considerably since then (see, for example, McWILLIAM, 2022).
