Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum is characterized by its pinnae and pinnules, which exhibit free lobes between the segments distally, as well as by the presence of arachnoid hairs on the abaxial surface of the veins and glabrous laminar tissue situated between the veins. Notably, the outer indusia is consistently present, even in sterile leaves.
