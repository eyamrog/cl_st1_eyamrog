Crotty (1998) posits that a comprehensive research conceptualization should encompass four key elements: epistemology, theoretical perspective, methodology, and methods. Similarly, Taber (2013) identifies related components in the context of ontological and epistemological assumptions in research, which include theoretical perspective, methodology, research design, and the systematic application of techniques for data acquisition and analysis.
