Color was employed symbolically in various aspects, including the design of football shirts, jackets, and even the ribbons for medals and trophies, all of which featured the red, yellow, black, and white of the national flag. FC Lao Rai United also commissioned the weaving of a traditional Timorese tais in yellow, black, and white, which incorporated the club's name. At the conclusion of our interview with club members, we were presented with two tais, a formal Timorese gesture of gratitude. One of these tais is depicted in Figure 2 below.
