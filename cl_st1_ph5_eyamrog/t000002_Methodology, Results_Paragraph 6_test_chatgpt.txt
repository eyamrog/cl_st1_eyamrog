Counting the occurrences of codes offers a comprehensive overview of the data sample and facilitates the identification of patterns both within and across events (Snell & Lefstein, 2011). However, this method is not without its challenges, as it often leads to the fragmentation of data, resulting in a loss of context and the omission of alternative meanings that may not be captured by the codes (Cohen et al., 2007). Consequently, systematic coding can be perceived as reductionist in nature (Mercer et al., 2004; Snell & Lefstein, 2011). The following subsection presents an example of the types of research questions and findings that can emerge from systematic coding.
