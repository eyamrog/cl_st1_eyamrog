In his work on the sociolinguistics of globalization, Blommaert (2010) advocates for a "sociolinguistics of mobile resources" that considers the various material and symbolic connections formed within global networks. He contends that sociolinguistic analysis should depict linguistic and semiotic phenomena as situated and distributed across multiple scales, ranging from the global to the local, and emphasizes the importance of examining the relationships between these scales.
