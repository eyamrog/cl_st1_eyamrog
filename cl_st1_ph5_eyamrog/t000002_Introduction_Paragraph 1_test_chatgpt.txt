A substantial body of research has concentrated on the role of language and discursive interaction in the knowledge-building process within classroom settings (Howe & Mercer, 2007; Mercer et al., 2020; Resnick et al., 2015; Schwarz & Baker, 2016). Over the past four decades, this area of study has thrived under overarching concepts such as "classroom dialogue" and "dialogic teaching" (Kim & Wilkinson, 2019; Mercer & Dawes, 2014), which encompass investigations aimed at effectively leveraging discursive interactions in educational contexts (Alexander, 2008). This perspective in education has been referred to as the "dialogic turn," highlighting the importance of students' voices, agency, and active participation in the co-construction of knowledge (Wilkinson & Son, 2011).
