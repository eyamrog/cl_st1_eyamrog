Many downstream analyses do not necessitate high-quality assemblies; for instance, one can determine the species of a genome or assess the presence or absence of a gene using a rudimentary assembly. However, certain tasks demand exceptional accuracy, such as estimating mutation rates and inferring transmission chains, where even a minimal number of errors can have significant repercussions. Perfect assemblies impose no limitations on their downstream applications, rendering the question of "Is my assembly good enough?" irrelevant. In the absence of assembly errors, numerous analyses that involve directly interrogating reads—often employing computationally intensive methods such as variant calling—could be supplanted by simpler assembly-based alternatives.
