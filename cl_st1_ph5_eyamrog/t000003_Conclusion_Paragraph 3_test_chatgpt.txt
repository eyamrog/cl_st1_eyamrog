Third, the case of Timorese migrants in Northern Ireland illustrates the significance of employing the concept of trajectory as a guiding framework. This approach allows us to highlight two key processes: first, the influence of educational backgrounds and migration trajectories on the communicative repertoires, language resources, and funds of knowledge accessible to migrants; and second, the capacity of individual migrants, who possess specific linguistic repertoires and resources that hold greater value in the local linguistic market, to assume leadership roles within local communities of practice and to organize activities in their everyday lives, particularly in sports such as football.
