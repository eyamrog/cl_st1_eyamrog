Following basecalling, quality control (QC) filtering can enhance the quality of Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) reads. We recommend utilizing Filtlong15 to eliminate the lowest-quality reads, specifically those that are short in length and exhibit low accuracy, by applying the --keep_percent 90 parameter. In cases where the read set demonstrates a low N50 but possesses a high depth, the removal of short reads (e.g., those less than 5 kbp) may facilitate improved assembly; however, it is important to note that this approach could potentially hinder the recovery of small plasmids (refer to the Pitfalls section for further details).
