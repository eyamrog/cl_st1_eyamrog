These elements collectively form what is commonly referred to as the research paradigm, which encompasses a worldview or foundational belief system that not only establishes the value of research but also directs the investigator in selecting appropriate methods and in formulating essential assumptions (Guba & Lincoln, 1994; Treagust et al., 2014). In essence, the research paradigm serves as a 'reference point,' 'vision,' or 'philosophy' that integrates beliefs, values, and methodologies within the research process (Taber, 2013; Treagust et al., 2014). In practical terms, paradigms shape how researchers conceptualize and interpret their studies.
