Three of the young Timorese individuals (RS, HA, and MFB), who had previously spent time in Portugal or England before relocating to Northern Ireland, demonstrated a commendable proficiency in both Portuguese and English. In contrast, those who arrived in the second decade of the twenty-first century came directly from Timor-Leste to reunite with friends and family already residing in Northern Ireland. This latter group exhibited limited English language skills and virtually no proficiency in Portuguese; instead, they primarily communicated in a regional Timorese language, with all members speaking Tetum and some also conversing in Bahasa Indonesia. Similar to the linguistic landscape in Timor-Leste, Tetum emerged as the predominant language of broader communication within this Irish context.
