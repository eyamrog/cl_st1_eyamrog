The preceding steps have produced a long-read assembly characterized by maximal accuracy, estimated to be approximately Q50 (one error per 100 kbp) when utilizing R10.4.1 ONT reads. The final phase involves rectifying any residual errors through the application of short reads. For instance, long homopolymers often pose challenges for ONT sequencing, as noted in previous studies; however, Illumina sequencing is not affected by this limitation. Consequently, errors related to homopolymer length that remain after the long-read polishing process can be effectively corrected through short-read polishing.
