The families Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and Saccolomataceae collectively encompass four genera and six species identified in the Viçosa region. Among these species, four possess infra-specific classifications, which are acknowledged in this study. The identified taxa include Dennstaedtia cicutaria (Sw.) T. Moore and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Kaulf.) J.A. Thomson (Dennstaedtiaceae); Lindsaea lancea (L.) Bedd. var. lancea, L. quadrangularis Raddi subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta (Sw.) Dryand. var. stricta (Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma elegans Kaulf. Notably, only L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, while the other taxa are more widely distributed across the Neotropics. In contrast to the other families examined in this research—Salviniaceae (Miranda & Schwartsburd, 2016), Anemiaceae (Rabelo & Schwartsburd, 2016), and Polypodiaceae (Gonçalves da Silva & Schwartsburd, 2017)—we have been unable to recollect half of the taxa discussed in this paper, which were originally collected in the 1930s and have not been observed since. This absence may be attributed to local extinction resulting from forest fragmentation and disturbance. Specifically, we have not been able to recollect D. cicutaria, L. lancea var. lancea, or L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis.
