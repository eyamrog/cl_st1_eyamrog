Pteridium is distributed globally, with the exception of Antarctica, and is considered one of the most significant plants affecting human populations due to its various detrimental impacts. It acts as a pioneer weed that invades agricultural lands, proliferating through its underground rhizomes, which complicates removal efforts. Additionally, Pteridium poses health risks to livestock, such as cattle and horses, as well as to humans when ingested. Notably, some studies have indicated that its toxins, specifically psilatoquinins, can be transmitted through cow's milk (e.g., Tryon 1941, Evans 1976, Page 1976, Marrs et al. 2000, Martini-Santos et al. 2010, Oliveira et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2018).
