In the State of Minas Gerais, the family Dennstaedtiaceae is represented by 14 species, Lindsaeaceae by 11 species, and Saccolomataceae by three species (Pena et al. 2020; Schwartsburd 2020; Schwartsburd & Pena 2020; Schwartsburd 2022). This study presents the taxonomic treatment of these families within the region of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, as part of an ongoing project focused on the fern flora of this area, which includes both forthcoming fascicles and previously published works: Miranda & Schwartsburd (2016 - Salviniales), Rabelo & Schwartsburd (2016 - Schizaeales), and Gonçalves da Silva & Schwartsburd (2017 - Polypodiaceae).
