DNA extraction should be performed from a single bacterial colony to minimize the risk of genomic heterogeneity (see Pitfalls). Although the optimal method for DNA extraction may differ depending on the organism, the primary objective should be to maximize both purity and molecular weight. High purity is essential for achieving better yields in Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing, as chemical and biological contaminants can damage or obstruct nanopores, thereby reducing the lifespan of flow cells. Additionally, high molecular weight is crucial for generating longer ONT reads; therefore, it is advisable to avoid vortexing, minimize handling and pipetting, and limit freeze-thaw cycles to prevent the shearing of DNA molecules. For most bacterial species, extraction methods should include cell lysis through enzymatic digestion, utilizing lysozyme (Sigma Aldrich, L6876) followed by proteinase K digestion, as typically provided in DNA extraction kits. This approach is generally effective for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, although optimization with supplementary enzymes may be necessary for particularly resilient strains. To further reduce DNA shearing and enhance throughput, magnetic bead-based DNA extraction is recommended, with preferred kits including GenFind V3 (Beckman Coulter, C34881) and MagAttract HMW DNA (Qiagen, 67563) listed in order of preference. In cases where bacterial isolates are resistant to enzymatic lysis, bead-beating may be employed; however, it is important to note that this technique may compromise ONT read length.
