Based on our participant observations and interviews, as well as previous research conducted in Dungannon by Da Costa Cabral (2010), it is evident that there exists significant diversity among the young Timorese currently residing and working in Dungannon and Cookstown. These individuals originate from various districts of Timor-Leste and communicate in a range of regional languages, such as Fataluku, Makasai, and Mambai, in addition to Tetum, which serves as the primary lingua franca. Table 1 below illustrates the linguistic resources and migration trajectories of the core group of research participants. Notably, all interviewees within this core group, aged between 20 and 45, have received their education, either entirely or partially, in Bahasa Indonesia.
