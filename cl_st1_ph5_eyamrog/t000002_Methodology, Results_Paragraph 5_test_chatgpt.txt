In this section, we concentrate on the systematic coding method, which is widely regarded as the most prevalent approach among researchers for analyzing interaction as a turn-taking system and categorizing each instance accordingly. This method entails an analytical process of discursive data that involves reducing the data by identifying and marking relevant points related to the research focus. This procedure, commonly referred to as 'coding,' allows researchers to organize and structure the data while simultaneously translating raw information into specific conceptual references and identifying connections among different categories (Evans, 2013, pp. 158â€“159). A critical aspect of systematic coding is its emphasis on objectivity, which necessitates the development of a clear and unambiguous coding scheme; thus, the criteria for coding must be sufficiently explicit to ensure that different observers assign the same code or category to a given discursive unit (Galton et al., 1980). Often, codes are derived from a theoretical framework or prior research, leading to the classification of this research as 'template' analysis, wherein the analytical framework is guided by a theoretical perspective, enabling the analyst to have a clear understanding of what to seek in the data from the outset (Robson, 2002; Taber, 2013, p. 293).
