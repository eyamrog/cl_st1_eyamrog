If automation is necessary, modifications to the workflow are essential. Flye19 is less prone to generating large-scale errors compared to other long-read assemblers, which may not be rectified by downstream polishing tools23, thereby making it a suitable alternative to Trycycler. Prior to polishing with Medaka, circular Flye contigs should be 'rotated' to establish a consistent starting sequence (e.g., dnaA36) or a random starting sequence. This adjustment will reposition any duplicated or missing bases at the beginning or end of the circular contigs to the center of the sequence, where polishing tools can effectively correct these errors. For short-read polishing, we recommend utilizing Polypolish followed by POLCA, as these tools are the least likely to introduce additional errors30.
