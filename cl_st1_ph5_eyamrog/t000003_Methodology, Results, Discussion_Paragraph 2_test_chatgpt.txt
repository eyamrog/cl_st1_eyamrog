Since gaining independence in 2002, Timor-Leste has experienced a notable transnational movement, with a significant number of young Timorese men and women seeking employment opportunities in Indonesia, South Korea, Australia, and Western Europe. Following independence, Portugal facilitated the application process for Portuguese citizenship for all individuals born in Timor-Leste prior to May 20, 2002, thereby granting them the right to reside and work in Portugal and other European Union (EU) member states. This provision was rooted in international law, which recognized the eastern region of the island of Timor as a Portuguese colony until its independence in 2002, and neither Portugal nor the United Nations acknowledged the Indonesian occupation and administration of the territory from 1975 to 2002. This political and legal framework significantly contributed to alleviating the high levels of unemployment among young people in urban areas of Timor-Leste in the years immediately following independence.
