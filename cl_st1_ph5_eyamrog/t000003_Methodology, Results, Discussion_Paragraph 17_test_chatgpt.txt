The Timorese individuals who arrive in Dungannon and other nearby towns typically secure employment in one of the region's factories, with the largest being Moy Park, located in Dungannon, which specializes in chicken processing and packaging for retail distribution, including supermarkets. Originally an Irish company, Moy Park was acquired by a Brazilian corporation in 2010, as we discovered during our fieldwork in 2015, underscoring the increasingly globalized nature of food production. Additionally, two smaller factories in Cookstown focus on packaging pork and cheese for the retail sector (Interview with DA, in Tetum, June 2015), while a rendering plant in the vicinity is dedicated to the preparation of animal feed (Joint interview with RS and HA, June 2015).
