Small plasmids (less than 20 kbp) may be underrepresented in Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) read sets due to factors such as ligation preparation methods, which can result in circular sequences failing to acquire adapters, or overly stringent quality control (QC) measures that discard all reads shorter than 10 kbp. To mitigate this issue, researchers can employ rapid preparation techniques and adopt less stringent QC criteria, such as only discarding reads shorter than 1 kbp. Alternatively, small plasmids can be successfully recovered from an assembly graph generated using only Illumina data or a short-read-first hybrid assembly approach, such as that provided by Unicycler, where they typically manifest as circular contigs that are distinct from the remainder of the genome (see Figure 2A).
