From a theoretical perspective, Filho (2013) presents a compelling discussion on the concepts of incommensurability, complementarity, and unity among paradigms. Proponents of the first thesis contend that realism and interpretivism are fundamentally opposed and, as such, are inherently incompatible. Conversely, advocates of complementarity argue that both paradigms are valid and do not necessarily conflict with one another. Furthermore, within the empirical realm, each paradigm is aligned with specific objectives that cannot be effectively addressed by the other. Ultimately, the notion of unity among these paradigms is primarily supported by post-positivist and critical philosophers, who assert that there is no logical or coherent basis for dividing knowledge into strictly dichotomous categories.
