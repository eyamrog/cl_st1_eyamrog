Researchers have examined the competing tensions between 'deductive' and 'inductive' approaches to data analysis (Evans, 2013; Taber, 2013). The deductive approach seeks evidence in relation to pre-established themes, which inevitably guides the analysis, whereas the inductive approach is characterized by open-minded inquiry that generates themes directly from the data, subsequently employing these themes as analytical tools (Evans, 2013). In essence, analysis may be informed by a conceptual framework or be rooted in the data itself (Taber, 2013); however, both approaches necessitate the creation of categories, the organization of these categories under higher-order headings, and the formulation of a comprehensive description of the research topic (Elo & Kyng√§s, 2008).
