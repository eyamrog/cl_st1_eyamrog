The rapid spread of Sars-Cov-19 and the resulting pandemic have had both direct and indirect impacts on education in the short and long term. A significant limitation experienced by teachers and students is the cessation of direct contact between peers, affecting access, continuity, and training in public or private higher education due to economic constraints and labor market commitments. This article aims to examine the effects of COVID-19 on the access and continuity of low-income Brazilian individuals in higher education. Drawing on data from educational censuses in Brazil, as well as journalistic and documentary sources that shed light on the country's geographical and social realities, we identify public policies implemented by the Brazilian government to facilitate access to and retention in higher education. Despite these efforts, public institutions are unable to accommodate everyone, leading to a reliance on Distance Education provided by private higher education institutions, which tends to cater to different social classes. The repercussions of the pandemic disproportionately affect the poor and marginalized populations, as those in public universities may lack access to necessary technology, while students in private institutions face challenges in meeting tuition fees and contend with job losses across various sectors.
In this article, we offer a concise historical review of public policies in Brazil aimed at guaranteeing access to higher education. Additionally, we analyze the obstacles encountered by socially disadvantaged students who aspire to persist in higher education amidst the socioeconomic and institutional repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Approaching this subject from the perspective of a teacher in both public and private higher education institutions, I am keenly aware of the challenges students face in persisting with their studies and navigating the uncertainties surrounding access due to the ongoing pandemic. The central inquiry driving this research is focused on understanding the repercussions of COVID-19 on the accessibility and retention rates in higher education, particularly among individuals in socially vulnerable situations in Brazil. It is my underlying assumption that the pandemic and its associated consequences will lead to a surge in dropout rates, a decline in access opportunities, and ultimately, a heightened level of exclusion of students from higher education in the immediate, near, and distant future.
The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has precipitated one of the most severe global health crises in recent memory, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to officially declare a pandemic in March 2020 (Pan American Health Organization, 2020; Vibha et al., 2020). Shortly following this declaration, Brazil, the largest nation in Latin America, reported its initial case of infection and first fatality attributed to COVID-19 (Federative Republic of Brazil, 2020a). As of September 30, 2020, Brazil stood as the third most impacted country globally, with a staggering 4,780,317 confirmed cases and 143,010 fatalities (worldometers.info, 2020). Concurrently, the worldwide tally of infections on the same date reached 33,249,563 cases, resulting in 1,000,004 deaths (World Health Organization, 2020). Despite several nations successfully curbing the virus's spread, implementing economic reopenings, and upholding stringent preventive measures, Brazil appeared distant from reaching its epidemiological apex.
In accordance with WHO guidelines, Brazil's Ministry of Health implemented social isolation measures, while the Ministry of Education, through Decree No. 343/2020 (Federative Republic of Brazil 2020c), mandated the suspension of classes within the education system. This decree also authorized the utilization of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to facilitate the continuation of classes throughout the academic year, a strategy in alignment with approaches adopted by other major nations such as China (Zhu and Liu 2020; Daniel 2020). A total of 182,600 educational institutions ceased on-site classes, impacting approximately 47 million Brazilian students across primary, secondary, and tertiary education levels. This move mirrored the global trend, with 850 million students in 191 countries facing similar challenges of transitioning to remote or no classes (Mustafa 2020).
Pressure from business groups, combined with a speech by Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro advocating vertical isolation over horizontal isolation, where only high-risk groups were required to self-isolate while others could continue their daily activities, conflicted with the preventive strategies implemented by certain governors and mayors. The lack of effective control over population movement, coupled with the reopening of non-essential businesses, led to a significant increase in COVID-19 infections. To prevent overwhelming Intensive Care Units (ICUs), many cities and municipalities enforced strict social isolation measures. The duration of the pandemic remains uncertain, prolonging its impact on both the economy and the lives of citizens. This study examines the effects of COVID-19 on student access and retention in higher education, particularly among low-income individuals.
Adopting a critical-reflexive and qualitative methodology (Sampieri et al., 2013), our study aims to investigate the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the most marginalized demographic in Brazil concerning their ability to access and remain in higher education.
The research draws upon data sourced from state institutional records, legislative documents, and literature from civil institutions like Oxfam, Fundação Getulio Vargas (Getulio Vargas Foundation), and Associação Brasileira de Mantenedoras do Ensino Superior (Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators), in addition to census data, legislator files, and journalistic articles from prominent national newspapers, news magazines, and websites such as UOL, Estadão, Agência Brasil, and Veja. Structured around the research question, the paper is divided into two sections: the first, "A Short History of Higher Education," provides a historical overview of Brazilian higher education, while the second section, titled "The Impact of COVID-19 on Higher Education in Brazil," delves into the pandemic's effects on student retention in higher education. This section explores factors like social isolation, job and income instability, the utilization of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), internet accessibility, and technological resources. Ultimately, the paper concludes with policy recommendations aimed at enhancing access to higher education.
The history of higher education in Brazil dates back to the arrival of the Portuguese royal family during the Peninsular War in 1808, which led to the growth of a bourgeois class. Throughout the nineteenth century, eleven universities were established, with the School of Surgery and Anatomy in Bahia being the first (DeHumerez and Jankevicius, 2015). During this period, higher education was primarily seen as a means of preparing individuals for professional careers and was predominantly accessible to the white bourgeois elite.
This approach became deeply ingrained in Brazil, resulting in the denial of access to higher education and, consequently, social mobility for the majority of Brazilians over many generations. Despite the absence of census data on higher education until 1950, there are numerous indicators suggesting that access was limited to the upper socio-economic classes. According to the census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, in 1950, the number of enrollments in higher education was 210,270. This figure saw a modest increase to 593,009 in 1970 (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 1950; 1970), continued to grow to 1,377,286 in 1980, and reached 2,125,958 students in 1998 (National Institute of Studies and Educational Research Anísio Teixeira 2000a). Despite this upward trend, in 1997, only 12% of the population aged 19-24 years attended university (Saviani 2010). This disparity led to the emergence of several social and intellectual movements in the first half of the twentieth century, advocating for more egalitarian access to quality education.
Due to pressure from civil society, a series of laws known as the National Education Pillars and Guidelines Laws (NEPGL) were enacted. The initial legislation, Law No. 9394/1996, mandated the federal education system to ensure universal primary and secondary education, signaling a need for higher education to align with this trajectory due to an anticipated surge in high school graduates (Federative Republic of Brazil, 2017a). Consequently, Law 9394/1996 can be viewed as the foundational point for all subsequent public policies aimed at broadening access to Higher Education in Brazil. This law restructured and organized the system, permitting the establishment of private higher education institutions (HEIs) and facilitating distance learning for professionals. Following the enactment of Law 9394/1996, there was a modest rise in enrollment figures, increasing from 1,868,529 in that year to 2,694,245 by 2000, nearly meeting the projected target for 2004. These statistics reflect a 20.6% rise from 1980 to 1994, a 28% increase from 1994 to 1998, and a 42.6% surge from 1994 to 1999. By 2010, the law began to yield positive outcomes, with higher education enrollment reaching 6,379,299, escalating to 8,450,755 by 2018 (National Institute of Studies and Educational Research Anísio Teixeira, 2000a; 2000b; 2001; 2012; 2019). However, this legislative framework fell short in addressing critical factors such as social vulnerability, geographic accessibility, systemic racial or ethnic exclusion, socioeconomic status, and the inadequate quality of public primary and secondary education.
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso initiated various public policies to enhance access to higher education for socially vulnerable populations through the establishment of the National High School Examination (ENEM) in 1998 and the Higher Education Finance Fund (FIES) in 1999. The latter significantly expanded the Educational Credit Program (CREDUC) introduced during the military dictatorship of Ernesto Geisel in 1975 (National Education Development Fund 2017). Starting in 2003, President Luís Inácio Lula da Silva's administration implemented a series of educational strategies aimed at democratizing higher education access. Notably, these policies aligned the standard secondary education curriculum with the ENEM and replaced the traditional and exclusive "vestibular entrance examinations." Despite these changes, the new higher education entrance system did not immediately lead to increased admissions in either public or private institutions. In the case of private institutions, access remained restricted due to high monthly tuition fees. Consequently, although public universities lacked the capacity to accommodate the growing number of high school graduates, the private sector remained underutilized.
The discrepancy in teaching quality between public and private secondary schools rendered the ENEM insufficient for ensuring access to and retention in higher education. In response, the University for All Program (ProUni) was established in 2004, providing scholarships of up to 100% for private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) (Ministry of Education of Brazil, 2018b). Additionally, the expansion of FIES facilitated increased access for economically disadvantaged youth, covering tuition costs up to 100%. However, eligibility for funding through ProUni or FIES was contingent upon successful completion of the ENEM.
By 2010, the widespread adoption of the ENEM by most public Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) as their admission criterion had significantly increased the pool of eligible applicants for higher education (Ministry of Education of Brazil, 2018a). In order to enhance accessibility and standardize the university admission process, the Ministry of Education introduced the Unified Selection System (SISU) (Ministry of Education of Brazil, 2020a). This system implemented a standardized set of criteria for all public HEIs, thereby extending the principle of equal opportunity to a national scale. Through SISU, candidates have the ability to apply to both public and private HEIs, while also being able to seek financial assistance through programs like ProUni and FIES for the latter. Between 2009 and 2017, the combined efforts of SISU, FIES, and ProUni resulted in a substantial increase in enrollments at both public and private HEIs, with numbers rising by approximately two million.
Enrolment growth in Brazil has faced a setback during the tenures of the last three presidents - Dilma Roussef, Michel Temer, and Jair Bolsonaro - primarily due to budget reductions in ProUni and FIES. The period from 2010 to 2014 witnessed a significant surge in approved student loans, escalating from 70,000 to 739,000. However, this figure plummeted by 62% to 281,000 in 2015 and further declined to 170,095 by 2017. Although there was a slight uptick in approved loans in 2018, totaling 300,000, only 24% adhered to the new financing criteria, which were contingent on family income and alternative funding sources. Despite the increased availability of loans, the stringent new criteria posed challenges for accessibility. Projections indicate a stark decrease in disbursed student loans, with estimates suggesting a drop to 100,000 in 2020 and just over 50,000 in 2021. This downward trajectory has disproportionately impacted the most vulnerable segments of Brazilian society, particularly those unable to meet the monthly tuition fees at private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) (Saldaña 2019; Brasil247 2020). In response to the cuts implemented by the Temer administration, young individuals expressed their discontent and resistance by mobilizing protests in 2016 (Students National Union 2016).
While the National Educational Plan (PNE) forecasts a 1.8% annual growth in Higher Education Institution (HEI) enrollments (Ministry of Education of Brazil, 2020b), various factors contribute to the challenges in accessing higher education. Particularly in less developed regions of Brazil, the limited presence of public HEIs restricts entry for high school graduates who are unable to relocate to major urban areas. It is only in recent times that public HEIs have initiated the establishment of decentralized campuses in remote regions. Conversely, the enactment of Decree 9057/2017 (Federative Republic of Brazil, 2017b) has facilitated the recognition of degrees earned through distance education, leading to a rapid expansion in this sector. Nevertheless, there exists significant resistance and a lack of acceptance towards distance learning within the Brazilian educational system.
Distance education has provided a substantial portion of the Brazilian population residing in precarious socioeconomic circumstances with enhanced access to higher education. In Brazil, distance education is notably more cost-effective than traditional on-site classes, enabling institutions offering this mode of learning to extend their reach beyond urban centers and into the most remote regions of the country. This approach is particularly beneficial for socially vulnerable groups, as it permits them to balance work commitments with their academic pursuits.
Since Brazil's independence from colonial rule in the nineteenth century, its education system has been marked by pronounced social stratification and elitism. The perpetuation of exclusion and unequal access is underpinned by discourses that serve to segregate and uphold prevailing power dynamics. For instance, in a 2019 interview, former Brazilian Minister of Education Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez dismissed the notion of universal university education, asserting that access to higher education should remain a 'privilege' reserved for a select elite (Gazeta do Povo 2019). Furthermore, recent legislation such as Ordinance No. 1122/2020 from the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) dictates that public research funding for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the period of 2020–2023 should prioritize technology and scientific innovation over disciplines like the humanities and social sciences (Federative Republic of Brazil 2020b). This policy document reflects the government's stance that non-STEM research is of lesser importance.
The historical context reveals that public policies alone do not ensure equitable access to higher education, better employment opportunities, or an improved quality of life. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of higher education in Brazil was insufficient to meet the demand, posing significant challenges for individuals residing in slums or remote areas. The situation was further complicated by the pandemic, which exposed the structural obstacles hindering the universalization of higher education in Brazil. These barriers encompass unequal access to information and communication technologies (ICT), limited internet connectivity, rising unemployment rates, income reductions, and conflicting responsibilities. The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated numerous issues in Brazil, including social inequality, unequal income distribution, and the substandard quality of public schools.
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the lives and economic stability of individuals in Brazil. Social relations, daily routines, and familial obligations have been disrupted, resulting in a decrease in working hours, job losses, and a decline in family income. Furthermore, the pandemic has highlighted deficiencies within the Brazilian education system, exacerbated social vulnerabilities, and impeded human development by disrupting students' educational advancement. These critical issues will be further explored in the subsequent sections of this study.
Instabilities in the labor market have a direct impact on students' inclination towards pursuing higher education. According to a survey conducted by the Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators (2020a) among 1,607 students enrolled in private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) across Brazil, findings revealed that 52% of respondents expressed their desire to continue their studies post-pandemic, while 42% remained uncertain about their educational trajectory. Additionally, 4% indicated their intention to drop out, with a further 2% confirming their definitive decision to discontinue their studies due to the pandemic. Notably, during the period between April and May 2020, there was a significant 75% increase in the default rate for higher education fees, underscoring the financial strain faced by individuals juggling educational expenses with familial obligations (Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators, 2020a).
Law 11,206/2005, a law project in 2004 that established ProUni along with the call for the opening of a semiannual selection process, does not explicitly mention distance education. Despite some indications on certain websites suggesting that ProUni student funding grants are available for distance education, candidates often do not find this option during registration. Segenreich (2009) confirms that in 2006, the consideration of offering ProUni for distance education was on the table. However, by 2009, in the state of Pará, only 6 institutions from other states were offering ProUni through distance education. The available information from various sources remains confusing and unclear. The Brazilian Ministry of Education website still lacks data distributed by teaching modalities. Among those who self-finance their studies, 22% expressed contemplating dropping out due to the financial burden, while 60% cited changing labor market conditions resulting from the pandemic as a factor influencing their decision on whether to continue their studies (Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators, 2020b).
Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil was already grappling with a significant unemployment rate, estimated at approximately 12.9 million individuals. By May 2020, this figure had risen to 10.5%, reaching a peak of 14.3% in August before experiencing a slight decline to 13.7% in September, as reported by the Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography in 2020. The economic crisis resulting from the pandemic has had a profound impact on the livelihoods of a substantial portion of the population, with 57.2% of families experiencing disruptions in employment, 45.5% facing obstacles to work due to the necessity of social isolation, and 14.3% losing their jobs entirely, according to data from the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in 2020.
The current landscape of income and job instability has prompted a reevaluation among researchers regarding the accumulation and management of student loan debt. In response to the risks of default, certain private institutions have implemented measures to lessen monthly payments during the ongoing pandemic. Discussions have been initiated by parents, students, and guardians regarding the justification of full tuition fees for remote classes, with one notable instance being a legislative mandate in a federal state requiring a 30% reduction in tuition fees (Law 17208/2020; State of Ceará 2020). While similar initiatives have been proposed in other regions, they have been thwarted by federal court rulings. Notably, medical students from a private Higher Education Institution (HEI) in São Paulo pursued legal action to lower tuition fees, only to have the court decision overturned. As per the Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators (2020b), additional requests for tuition fee deductions have been made, yet they have either been denied by HEIs or have not progressed to negotiation stages thus far.
In the Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators (2020b) survey, 8% of participants expressed their intention to discontinue their studies due to their Higher Education Institution (HEI) not offering courses through distance mode. This highlights the challenge faced by many public HEIs in lacking the necessary infrastructure to support ICT, digital platforms, and virtual learning environments for continued education during the current crisis. Both public and private Brazilian HEIs are generally found to have inadequate ICT infrastructure. The Brazilian Association of Distance Education has compiled a dossier addressing various aspects of distance education and COVID-19. Fernanda Furuno (2020) discusses the feasibility of HEIs operating without online teaching platforms, while Tomazinho (2020) highlights the challenges faced by HEIs due to the limited broadband services in Brazil. Despite Resolution 343/2020 (Federative Republic of Brazil 2020) permitting the use of ICT for remote curriculum delivery, the crisis has underscored the unpreparedness of Brazil's public education system, similar to many others globally, for the transition to distance learning modalities (Kerrers 2020; Adnam and Anwar 2020).
The challenge faced by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in resuming their courses extends beyond the efficiency and accessibility of technology; they must also address resistance among teachers who perceive this shift as a threat to their autonomy and job security. Many educators in higher education express feeling ill-equipped to navigate digital tools and platforms, a sentiment exacerbated by the limited inclusion of ICT subjects in teacher education programs (Lopes and Fürkotter, 2016). Concerns regarding the lack of physical interaction in distance education (Carmo and Franco, 2019), the detrimental effects of work overload on teachers (Chaquime and Mill, 2016), and the fear of inadequately handling technology and failing to meet student expectations (Rosa, 2013) have been critically examined in various studies.
Due to Ordinance 2117/2019 (Federative Republic of Brazil, 2019), which permits the utilization of digital platforms for up to 40% of the theoretical course load, many private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have embraced the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for distance learning, thereby ensuring the seamless continuation of courses. However, the implementation of this ordinance in public HEIs has been inconsistent, revealing a notable resistance towards distance education. Barone (2020) highlighted the underutilization of platforms provided by the Ministry of Education in higher education, emphasizing the reluctance towards integrating technology in teacher training and the challenges associated with transitioning to a new teaching paradigm. The academic year in public universities in 2020 faced significant disruptions, particularly affecting students due to prevalent social inequalities, geographical barriers, and limited access to ICT resources.
The geographic remoteness of numerous municipalities, coupled with the limited availability of broadband internet in urban and rural households, has significantly hindered the widespread adoption of distance learning modalities during the pandemic. According to the 2018 Survey on the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Brazilian Households conducted by the official Brazilian Internet Steering Committee in 2019, which surveyed slightly over 33,000 households, it was found that internet connectivity is far from being universalized, with rural areas being particularly underserved, where only 44% of the surveyed households have access to the internet.
The concentration of the Brazilian population in urban areas is a significant factor to consider. With over 5,000 municipalities in Brazil, many of these are small cities or towns where the internet transmission signal is inadequate for various reasons, such as being far from large urban centers where optic fiber transmission is more readily available. Even in urban centers, access to broadband internet may not be guaranteed, as peripheral regions may experience more unstable service. Recent studies by Lis (2020) and Yuge (2020) highlight the increasing number of complaints received by the National Telecommunications Agency regarding the lack of broadband internet provision in Brazil. Cardoso (2020) specifically notes the challenges faced in accessing broadband internet on the outskirts of São Paulo, the largest urban center in the country's most economically developed region, where over 7,500,000 individuals, as reported by the SEADE Foundation (2020), have never had internet access. Soprana (2020) further emphasizes that more than 70 million Brazilians lack internet access in the country.
The issue of internet access is particularly dire in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, where only 28.7% and 30% of the population, respectively, have access. Nationally, only 23.9% of black and mixed-race individuals have internet access (Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography, 2019). Considering that a significant portion of the black population resides in poverty, black students are especially at risk of lacking access to reliable internet services.
Despite the uneven availability of internet access, the usage of mobile phones has increased among socially disadvantaged Brazilians, possibly attributed to the ease of purchase. According to the NHSS, as of 2018, 96% of Brazilian households owned at least one mobile phone. The ICT Report further validates this trend, indicating that the majority of Brazilians utilize mobile phones for basic daily tasks, yet it highlights persistent limitations for activities requiring higher connectivity and data usage (Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography, 2019, p. 101).
In general, commonly used mobile phones lack the necessary hardware and software capabilities to effectively engage with digital platforms or accommodate the extensive downloads essential for academic studies. Consequently, teaching classes through popular social media applications like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp could enhance usability but also introduce significant limitations on available resources. This reliance on social media for educational purposes may hinder access to essential tools and materials, potentially rendering internet access via mobile phones inadequate for full participation in online educational formats.
Student retention in higher education during the pandemic is not solely jeopardized by job insecurity, financial constraints, and digital barriers. Factors such as student autonomy, unsuitable home environments for synchronous and asynchronous classes, and the struggle to concentrate due to disruptions necessitate cognitive adjustments in the teaching-learning dynamic. Moreover, alterations in work schedules, heightened physical and emotional exhaustion among employed individuals, and the surge in mental health concerns triggered or worsened by social isolation demand physical and psycho-emotional adaptations to alleviate the obstacles encountered in studying amidst the pandemic (Sahu, 2020).
The disruptions in class schedules, semester extensions or cancellations in public Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), the inability to engage in internship activities in both public and private HEIs, and the multitude of uncertainties stemming from the pandemic have significantly impacted students. The challenges of coping with illness, loss, and social isolation have led to profound psycho-emotional effects on students, who have had to adapt to altered routines and take on additional family responsibilities amidst periods of mourning (Sahu, 2020; Vieira, 2020).
The impact of COVID-19 on secondary education in Brazil is expected to have significant repercussions on access to higher education. The Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators (2020c) has highlighted that the delay in conducting the National High School Examination (ENEM) could potentially lead to a shortage of skilled labor in the future. The pandemic has already disrupted the transition from school to the workforce. The ENEM, a crucial public policy governing higher education access, has become a subject of intense political debate during this pandemic year. Despite WHO guidelines recommending otherwise, the Ministry of Education initially maintained the schedule for the tests in November 2020. This decision faced opposition from various sectors of society, leading to legal challenges to evaluate the appropriateness of the timing. Eventually, the Ministry of Education agreed to postpone the ENEM by 30–60 days (National Institute of Studies and Educational Research Anísio Teixeira 2020).
Resistance to participating in the examination has brought to light the disparities in social vulnerability among candidates, a situation exacerbated by the suspension of classes and digital exclusion during the pandemic. Saboia (2020) shed light on the challenges faced by residents of Rio de Janeiro's favelas, whose aspirations for higher education are hindered by their inability to engage in synchronous or asynchronous online preparatory courses for the ENEM test.
Highlighting the insensitivity of the current Brazilian government to social vulnerabilities and inequalities, former Minister of Education Abraham Weintraub, in an interview with CCN Brasil, asserted that ENEM does not aim to alleviate social injustices but merely to select the best candidates. Disparaging the idea that some candidates lacked sufficient internet access, he argued that those without access could not have registered for the exam (Mendonça, 2020). Despite Weintraub's claims that calls to postpone ENEM were politically driven, other major global powers such as China opted to cancel their entrance exams even after successfully controlling the pandemic. In contrast, the Brazilian Education Minister seems content to witness ENEM, originally designed to combat exclusion, transform into a tool that reinforces social inequality.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities and challenges that jeopardize access and retention in Brazilian higher education. The volatility of the job market, job losses, and pervasive uncertainties regarding future employment prospects undermine students' determination and capacity to persist in higher education. Public higher education institutions, in particular, face a deficiency in technological infrastructure essential for facilitating online course delivery. Faculty members frequently express inadequacy in navigating technological tools, digital platforms, and virtual learning environments.
Access to higher education in Brazil has traditionally been restricted to a privileged elite, and despite policy reforms, equitable access remains a distant goal. Public higher education institutions face limitations due to insufficient capacity, while private institutions restrict access with high tuition fees. The accessibility and continuity of education are further hindered by threats to state funding, which impacts various forms of student financial support. Additionally, challenges related to purchasing power for technological resources and internet access further complicate academic engagement, whether through synchronous, asynchronous, or hybrid modes of learning.
The COVID-19 crisis has underscored the pressing need to enhance access to higher education for socially disadvantaged students, particularly in anticipation of the post-pandemic era. We believe that the paramount objective lies in the universalization of higher education through legislative measures, akin to the successful implementation witnessed in primary and lower secondary education back in 1996. It is imperative that governmental policies extend to the financing of private higher education, enabling reduced tuition fees and heightened accessibility for students facing social disadvantages.
In light of the predominantly pessimistic projections regarding the trajectory of the pandemic in Brazil, it becomes imperative that the State assumes the responsibility of ensuring internet access as a fundamental civil right, alongside promoting the utilization of the internet and ICT tools to ensure the continuity and sustainability of higher education. The onus lies on the State to devise sustainable strategies that enhance the purchasing power of individuals to acquire essential technological devices such as laptops, desktops, or tablets. Furthermore, it is incumbent upon the state to provide technological resources to students facing vulnerable circumstances, thereby guaranteeing internet connectivity for synchronous and/or hybrid classes in public Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). In both private and public HEIs, the regulatory framework must not only secure the availability of educational programs but also ensure equitable access for all students, potentially including the distribution of SIM cards for internet connectivity where necessary.
Further investigation is imperative to understand the repercussions of COVID-19 on Brazilian education across various educational levels, encompassing processes, perspectives, and potential scenarios. The accessibility of higher education, whether through traditional classroom settings or online platforms, must be elevated in societal awareness to influence political decision-making. This necessitates a reevaluation of governmental functions and structures, recognizing education as a catalyst for empowering marginalized communities. Crucially, policy frameworks should address the demand for increased capacity in public Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and enhanced financial support for students in private HEIs.
