The diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is a 
cosmopolitan pest that causes leaf-area reduction in Brassicaceae plants. DBM populations 
have significant genetic variability that manifests in different feeding preferences and 
reproductive behaviors across generations. We evaluated the influence of Brassicaceae 
cultivars on biological and behavioral parameters across 18 generations of DBM populations 
that were separated and held on three varieties of Brassicaceae: Brassica oleracea var. 
acephala (kale), Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli), and Brassica oleracea var. capitata 
(cabbage). P, F6, F12, and F18 generations were evaluated, and biological aspects of young 
adulthood and fertility parameters of adults held on each host plant were examined over 
multiple generations. Additionally, larvae and adults were subjected to dual-choice and 
multiple-choice (feeding and oviposition) between cultivars, over generations. The results 
indicated that larvae of P. xylostella consumed greater quantities of kale and broccoli 
cultivars, on average (4.05 cm2), than cabbage (2.7 cm2). The number of eggs per female in 
F18 generation was 1.95 and 2.17 times higher than those in the parental (P) generation, when 
reared on kale and cabbage. The population reared exclusively on kale had higher net 
population growth rate (R0), intrinsic rate (rm), finite rate (λ) and generation time (T) than that 
reared on broccoli and cabbage. Last generations evaluated, the larval stage reared on cabbage 
showed feeding preference (F18) and oviposition preference (F12 and F18) for cabbage. 
Thus, we note the existence of learning, characterized as pre-imaginal conditioning to 
cabbage cultivars, over various DBM generations. 

The diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) is the 
most detrimental pest of Brassicaceae worldwide, and is one of the main factors limiting the 
cultivation of these plants. The DBM is widely distributed. Caterpillars that attack 
Brassicaceae plants reduce leaf area, which interferes with plant growth, causes depreciation 
of the product, and can lead to total loss of the crop (Castelo Branco & France 2001; Cheng et 
al 2008). Plant losses can reach up to 80% defoliation and annual monetary losses are 
approximately $4 to $5 billion USD (Zalucki et al 2012). 

The significant genetic diversity of P. xylostella facilitates the development of 
resistance to insecticides, which is a major pest control method (Ahmad et al 2012; Zago et al 
2014). Thus, alternatives are being researched to optimize management of the pest. Studies 
examining the life-history and behavior of DBM reared on different Brassicaceae cultivars are 
important to determine cultivars that are more resistant and less conducive to the development 
and reproduction of the pest (Badenes-Perez et al 2010). 

Species of Brassicaceae have different types of defenses against herbivory, including 
chemical and mechanical defenses (Travers-Martin et al 2008; Karowe & Grubb 2011). 
However, selecting varieties appropriate for specific conditions can directly influence the 
herbivory of insects (Louda & Collinge 1992). Pest insects prefer to feed on plants that offer 
survivability for themselves and their descendants (Thompson 1988). Chemical defense 
compounds formed in the Brassicaceae, such as sinigrin, undergo improved quantitative 
variation between cultivars (Thuler et al 2007). However, this substance has great importance 
in plant-insect interactions, and may positively affect the DBM by stimulating their feeding 
and oviposition (Sarfraz et al 2006; Hopkins et al 2009). 

Physical aspects also present in Brassicaceae plants provide mechanical protection 
against insects, such as trichomes and leaf surface wax layers that may interfere with the 
feeding and oviposition on P. xylostella. The DBM has been shown to have lower growth 
rates in cultivars with more trichomes than in plants containing fewer mechanical defenses 
(Mathur et al 2011). 

However, in studies using plants rich in trichomes, such as black mustard (Brassica 
nigra), was preferred over broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. lieutenant) and cabbage (Brassica 
oleracea var. acephala) for oviposition (Newman 2014). These results suggest that the 
presence of trichomes was not the main criterion influencing females’ choice of oviposition 
sites. 

The ability of insect pests to satisfactorily feed and succeed in their life cycle covers a 
sequence of behaviors (Karban & Agrawal 2002). Learning in holometabolous insects, such 
as P. xylostella, occurs in both the larval and adult stages, and learning is retained after 
metamorphosis of larvae up to pupae and to adult stages (Bernays & Chapman 1994). Host 
location and host selection learned behavior has been extensively studied in the imaginal 
stage, but no concrete evidence has shown that preimaginal conditioning influences 
preferences in adults (Bernays 1995). The conditioning may influence the life-history (life 
cycle or fecundity) and substrate preference for feeding and oviposition of Lepidoptera 
(Bernays & Weiss 1996). Studies on multiple DBM generations reared on kale showed that 
when DBM established in another Brassicaceae cultivar, such as cabbage, causes reduction in 
biological parameters (De Bortoli et al 2011, 2013). Our hypothesis suggests that biological 
and behavioral aspects of P. xylostella can be changed over generations when it is reared on 
different cultivars of Brassicaceae. Therefore, to further examine our hypothesis, we 
evaluated biological parameters of P. xylostella in three cultivars Brassicaceae, their 
reproductive behavior, and the preference for feeding and oviposition over 18 generations.  

The studies were conducted at Laboratory of Biology and Insects Rearing (LBIR), 
Department of Plant Protection, UNESP, Jaboticabal, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The insects used in 
the rearing experiments (~ 185 generations) were kept following a methodology adapted from 
Thuler (2009) on studies with Brassica oleracea var. acephala-kale HS20 (Horticeres®, 
Indaiatuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil) at LBIR. DBM populations were reared in a room at 25 ± 1°C, 
relative humidity of 70 ± 10% and photoperiod of 12 h light and 12 h dark.  

We evaluated the biological characteristics of DBM across various generations: P 
(parental), F6, F12 and F18, reared on three varieties of Brassicaceae. The cultivars used 
were: Brassica oleracea var. acephala - kale (HS20 cultivar; Horticeres), Brassica oleracea 
var. italica - broccoli (Piracicaba cultivar; Feltrin®, Farroupilha, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) e 
Brassica oleracea var. capitata - cabbage (Bob Cat cultivar; Sakata®, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, 
Brazil). The host plants selected in this study are widely used by brassica producers in the São 
Paulo state of Brazil. The seeds of each cultivar were planted in 10L pots containing a 3: 1: 1 
substrate mixture of ravine of land, cattle manure, and rice husk. The potted plants were 
maintained in a greenhouse designed for growing plants. After 60 days, only the formed 
leaves (fully developed) were selected as substrate to avoid interference age. 

To start the populations of P. xylostella on kale, broccoli and cabbage host plants, ~ 
3,000 pupae were removed from stock reared and divided into three cages until adult 
emergence. Approximately 1,000 newly emerged adults were kept per cage with leaves of 
each cultivar disc. Cages contained a circular plastic container (12-cm diameter × 15-cm 
height) sealed with cling film (PVC). A foliar disc (8-cm diameter) of the substrate (kale, 
broccoli or cabbage) and a filter paper disc (9-cm diameter) moistened with distilled water 
were placed inside the cage. The leaf discs containing eggs were removed 24 hours after 
introduction and transferred to Petri dishes (9-cm diameter) where they remained until larvae 
hatched. Approximately 50 newly hatched larvae from each substrate were selected for the 
study of the first generation (parental), and the surplus of the three populations were 
maintained following the methodology designed by Thuler (2009) to repeat the study using 
the F6, F12, and F18 generations.  

Caterpillars in the first instar of the parental population were collected using a brush and 
placed in Petri dishes (9-cm diameter) forming the following treatments: i) population on 
kale, ii) population on broccoli, and iii) population on cabbage. In each dish, 10 larvae were 
placed on each leaf disk substrate, totaling five Petri dishes for each population (5 replicates). 
After transferring the caterpillars, the dishes were capped and sealed with plastic wrap (PVC) 
in order to maintain moisture and prevent the escape of larvae.  
The first evaluation was performed four days after the caterpillars were introduced to 
the dishes that due to feeding habit of first instar are leaf mining. After the first evaluation, the 
treatments were evaluated every three days, and leaf discs were replaced until the formation 
of pupae. The assessed parameters were as follows: leaf consumption (using leaf area meter 
Laser CID® CI-202 model, Washington, USA), survival (viability), and larval stage. Pupae 
originating from each treatment were collected and individualized using the cell type ELISA® 
96 well plates and sealed with plastic film (PVC). At this stage, we evaluated the viability 
parameters and the pupal period, subject to the emergence of adults.  

The newly emerged adults were removed from the cells of ELISA® plates with suction, 
separated by gender, and transferred to the laying cages. Two couples from each of the 
respective treatments were placed in cages, creating five replicates per treatment in total. 
Inside each cage, leaf discs (8-cm diameter) were placed on paper moistened with distilled 
water for oviposition. Adults were fed daily with 10% sucrose solution made with honey 
dampened sponge, fixed to the top of the cage. Every day, the total egg count on the disk and 
the survival of adults was recorded. At this stage, the following parameters were evaluated: 
longevity of males, longevity of females, and number of eggs per female. All studied 
parameters, including larval, pupal, and adult periods, were repeated in the F6, F12, and F18 
generations of the three DBM populations.  

The study was conducted with three populations of P. xylostella, reared with kale 
leaves, broccoli, and cabbage to determine the population growth characteristics of insects 
over the P, F6, F12, and F18 generations. In this study, we used the previously obtained 
information about survival and duration (both with respect to egg, larval, pupal, and adult 
stages), sex ratio, and eggs per female per day. 

The biological data obtained permited estimates of the parameters needed for the 
construction of fertility life tables (Price, 1984), which are as follows: x = mean age of the 
female parental (seen as the emergence of the egg stage); lx = life expectancy to age x, 
expressed as a female; mx = specific fertility or number of offspring produced per female at 
age x that result in females; lx.mx = total number of females at age x. Growth parameters 
resulting from the life table were evaluated as follows: R0 = net reproductive rate (considering 
the number of females produced by females in generation), rm = intrinsic rate of increase in 
number, λ = finite rate of increase (the number of times the population multiplies in unit 
time), and T = average generation time in days. The growth parameters (R0, rm, λ and T) were 
calculated using the following equations:  
R0 = ∑ (mx.lx)  
rm = ln . R0 / T  
v = erm  
188 
T = (∑ mx.lx.x) / (∑ mx.lx)  

The dual-choice feeding test was performed with P. xylostella caterpillars of the P, F6, 
F12, and F18 generations derived from populations reared on kale, broccoli, and cabbage. The 
arenas used in the feeding preference study consisted of Petri dishes (15-cm diameter) with 
bottoms covered by filter paper, and were lightly moistened with distilled water to retain the 
moisture of the leaf discs. In each arena, four leaf disks (2-cm diameter) were arranged 
equidistantly and alternately, two cultivars per dish. Ten first instar caterpillars were then in 
the center of each arena. In total, five replicates per treatment (three populations and four 
generations) were assembled; each area was considered a replicate. The evaluations were 
performed 24 hours after the release of caterpillars. Evaluations consisted of recording the 
number of tracks present on the surface of each leaf disc. 
In the multiple-choice test, three leaf discs (2-cm diameter) were placed in each arena 
equidistant from each cultivar. In the center of the arena, 10 first instar caterpillars were 
released. The experiment consisted of five replicates per treatment (three populations and four 
generations); each area was considered a replicate. Evaluations were conducted 24 hours after 
the release of the caterpillars and consisted of recording the number of tracks present on the 
surface of each leaf disc.  

The test dual-choice oviposition was performed with DBM adults in the P, F6, F12, and 
F18 generations. Individuals from each of these generations were derived from caterpillars 
reared on kale, broccoli, or cabbage. The cages used were made of transparent plastic 
containers (13-cm diameter × 9-cm height). In each cage, two discs (8-cm diameter) from a 
cultivar and two discs from other cultivar were arranged in an alternating fashion so that 
DBM adults would encounter the two cultivars at the same time. The leaf disc containing two 
host plants was placed on a Petri dish covered with filter paper. The filter paper was lightly 
moistened with distilled water to maintain moisture. The two newly emerged couples were 
then released inside the cage to copulate and oviposit. The experiment consisted of five 
replicates per treatment (three populations and four generations); each cage was considered a 
replicate. Evaluations were conducted 24 hours after the release of adults, and the number of 
eggs present on the surface of each cultivar was recorded. 

In the multiple-choice test, an 8-cm diameter leaf disc composed of one-third of each 
cultivar (kale, broccoli, and cabbage) was placed in each cage. The two newly emerged 
couples were then released inside the cage to copulate and oviposit. In total, five replicates 
were assembled, and each cage was considered a replicate. Evaluations were conducted 24 
hours after the release of adults, and the number of eggs present in each cultivar was recorded.  

The effects of the different cultivars of Brassicaceae on the P. xylostella were analyzed 
using the repeated measures procedure for an analysis of variance using the PROC MIXED of 
SAS Institute software. Each biological characteristic was analyzed separately (independent 
fixed variables: treatment and time, random variables, and replicates within treatment), and an 
appropriate covariance structure for each characteristic was used (Littell et al 2006). As there 
was a significant interaction between the main effects (cultivars and generations), an 
additional analysis of variance was performed for each treatment. Assumptions of normality 
and homogeneity of variance were checked using the Cramer-von Mises criterion and 
Bartlett’s test. If significant differences were found between the treatments, means were 
compared using Tukey’s test. All of the statistical analyses were conducted in SAS 9.1 (SAS 
Software version 9.0, 2002; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).  

The data on the fertility life table were analyzed according to the procedure described by 
Maia et al. (2000) using the SAS GLM (SAS Institute, 2002) software. The proportion of 
surviving adults between treatments was compared with the Kaplan-Meier method PROC 
LIFETEST. The means and confidence intervals were compared using the Student t test for 
paired groups generated by PROC LIFETEST (SAS Institute, 2002). 

Collected data pertaining to the number of fed larvae and the number of eggs laid in 
dual-choice and multiple choice tests were analyzed using Proc FREQ in SAS statistical 
software (SAS Institute, 2002). The resulting analysis of the frequency of dual-choice and 
multiple-choice were interpreted using the chi-square test (χ2) using the ratio 50:50 as the 
expected preference (i.e. no preference was displayed by test subjects) and was performed the 
chi-square test using SAS software (SAS Institute, 2002). 

In the analysis of leaf consumption by DBM, significant differences were observed 
between the kale, broccoli, and cabbage cultivars (F2, 57 = 8.44, P = 0.0006). On average, less 
consumption of cabbage leaves was observed (2.7 cm2) than kale leaves (4.0 cm2) and 
broccoli (4.1 cm2). However, when we evaluated the leaf consumption between generations 
(P, F6, F12, and F18), no significant differences were observed (kale, F3, 16 = 0.31, P = 
0.8203, broccoli, F3, 16 = 2.06, P = 0.1458, and cabbage, F3, 16 = 0.59, P = 0.6282). When the 
caterpillars were reared on kale, consumption between generations ranged from 3.8 cm2 to 4.8 
cm2. In broccoli, consumption was between 3.3 cm2 and 5.1 cm2, and in cabbage, 
consumption was 2.2 cm2 3.8 cm2 (Table 1). 

With regard to the duration of larval period, there was no significant difference between 
cultivars (F2,57 = 0.89, P = 0.4169) with an average change from 6.7 to 7.1 days. In relation to 
the generations, the larval period in kale was lower in P generation (6.0 days) (F3,16 = 13.26, P 
<0.0001). In broccoli, there was a significant difference in the larval period of the P 
generation (5.6 days), which displayed a shorter period than that displayed by the F18 
generation (8.0 days) (F3,16 = 5.40, P = 0.0093). In cabbage, the shortest generation was 
observed in the P generation (6.0 days), which differed from other generations (F3,16 = 39.87, 
P <0.0001), with the largest period observed in the F18 generation (8.4 days) (Table 1). 

In the larval stage, no significant differences were observed in the survival parameter 
among cultivars (F2, 57 = 0.17, P = 0.8459) or between generations studied in: kale (F3, 16 = 
1.73, P = 0.2006), broccoli (F3, 16 = 0.78, P = 0.5230), and cabbage (F3, 16 = 1.65, P = 0.2185). 
The percentage of larval survival ranged from 56.0 to 90.0 among the three cultivars (Table 
1).  

When examining the pupal period, significant differences were observed among the 
three cultivars (F2, 57 = 7.28, P = 0.0015). When the caterpillars were reared on cabbage, the 
pupal period was shorter (3.2 days) than that on broccoli (3.9 days) and kale (3.6 days). 
Significant differences were also observed between the generations reared on kale, with a 
shorter pupal period observed in the P generation (2.4 days), and the longest observed in the 
F18 generation (3.8 days) (F3, 16 = 4, 44, P < 0.0188). DBM reared on broccoli showed a 
shorter pupal period in the F6 generation (3.0 days) than in the P generation (5.6 days) (F3, 16 
= 55 87, P < 0.0001; Table 1). 

When examining the longevity of males, no differences were observed between the 
three cultivars (F2, 57 = 0.51, P = 0.6061) with ranging from 15.4 to 17.0 days. However, there 
was a significant difference between generations when the caterpillars were reared on kale 
(F3,16 = 5.23, P = 0.0010) with a longer longevity of males observed in the P generation (24.7 
days) (Table 2). There was no difference observed between the generations when the 
caterpillars were reared on broccoli (F3,16 = 0.67, P = 0.5837) and cabbage (F3,16 = 2.01, P = 
0.1525). 

The longevity of females showed no differences among cultivars (F2, 57 = 2.51, P = 
0.5274) and the average ranged from 13.8 to 15.4 days. However, there was a significant 
difference between generations, when the caterpillars were reared on broccoli and cabbage 
(F3,16 = 6.98, P = 0.0032) and (F3,16 = 5.47, P = 0.0088 ), respectively. In broccoli, there were 
differences in the longevity of females; longevity was shorter in the F12 generation (10.5 
days) than in the P generation (20.8 days). In cabbage, there was no difference between the 
F12 generation (10.5 days) and P generation (20.8 days) (F3,16 = 5.74, P = 0.0012) (Table 2).  

Regarding the average number of eggs per female, no difference was observed between 
cultivars: kale, broccoli, and cabbage (F2, 57 = 0.63, P = 0.5338) with the average of 74.9 and 
84.8 eggs. In the generations, a significant difference was observed between females reared 
on kale, which had the lowest fertility in the P generation (60.8 eggs) and higher fertility in 
the F18 generation (117.2 eggs) (F3, 16 = 9.51; P = 0.0008), and reared on cabbage, with lower 
fecundity noted in the P generation (46.0 eggs) and higher in the F18 generation (100.2 eggs) 
(F3,16 = 4.84, P = 0.0140) (Table 2).  

The net reproductive rate (R0) was higher for the caterpillars reared on kale because 
they produced more offspring per female than females reared on broccoli or cabbage in the 
F6, F12, and F18 generations. Among the cultivars, the R0 in kale was higher (64.8 
females/female) than that in broccoli (57.1 females/female) and cabbage (53.0 
females/female). Comparison of the R0 females among generations showed that there was a 
significant difference between F12 generation (83.3 females, which showed higher R0 than P 
generation (50.7 females) and F18 generation (53.9 females) (Table 3). This difference 
between generations was also observed in broccoli, where the highest R0 occurred in the P 
generation (90.1) and the lowest in the F18 generation (30.1) (Table 3). 

The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and finite rate of increase (λ) were higher for 
caterpillars reared on kale compared with those reared on cabbage and broccoli, over two 
generations. The developing kale sprouts generated an average of more descendants (0.37 
females/female/day) than developed on broccoli (0.33 females/female/day) and cabbage (0.34 
females/female/day). The λ was 1.43 female/female*day for kale, 1.40 females/female*day 
for broccoli, and 1.39 females/female*day for cabbage. In comparisons between generations, 
a significant difference was observed between the P and F18 generations for the two 
parameters (rm and λ) in broccoli. The rm for the P generation was 0.39 females/female/day 
compared to 0.27 females/female/day in the F18 generation. Since the λ in the P generation 
was 1.48 female/female*day compared to 1.31 females/female*day in the F18 generation 
(Table 3). A significant difference in parameters rm and λ was also observed for larvae reared 
on cabbage between P generations (1.32 females/female*day) and the other F6, F12, and F18 
generations reared on cabbage (Table 3). 

The generation time (T) was smaller for DBM reared on kale when compared to reared 
on cabbage and broccoli. Thus, the T of cultivars was 11.6 days on kale, 11.9 days on 
broccoli, and 12.0 days on cabbage. Comparing across generations, a significant difference 
was observed between the F6 generation (13.1 days) and F12 generation (10.6 days) for the 
larvae reared on broccoli. DBM showed longer T than P generation (13.4 days) than the other 
generations reared on cabbage (Table 3). 

In dual-choice tests, the DBM larvae of the P generation that were reared on kale 
preferred to feed on broccoli (68.7%) than cabbage (χ22, 3 = 4.08, P = 0, 0432). DBM reared 
on broccoli, in the same generation, preferred cabbage (68.6%) over kale (χ22, 3 = 4.87, P = 
0.0273) (Fig 1A). In the F6 generation caterpillars reared on cabbage leaves preferred to feed 
on cabbage (67.6%) when presented broccoli (χ22, 3 = 4.12, P = 0.0422) (Fig 1B). The insects 
of the F12 generation held on broccoli leaves preferred to feed on cabbage (72.0%) when 
presented broccoli (χ22, 3 = 5.08, P = 0.0241) (Fig 1C). The larvae maintained on cabbage 
leaves in the F18 generation showed the same food substrate preference when presented with 
broccoli (69.8%) (χ22, 3 = 4.16, P = 0.0412) and kale (74.0%) (χ22, 3 = 6.11, P = 0.0134) (Fig 
1D). 

In the multiple-choice tests of the P generation DBM reared on kale, the highest 
percentage of caterpillars feeding was found on kale (46.0%) and broccoli (40.8%) compared 
to feeding on cabbage leaves (13.2%). In the same generation, in caterpillars reared on 
broccoli, a higher percentage of feeding was observed on broccoli (53.8%) and kale (41.8%) 
compared to feeding on cabbage (4.4%). DBM reared on cabbage were found on broccoli 
(52.7%) than on cabbage (34.5%). In the F6 generation, caterpillars grown on cabbage 
preferred to feed again on cabbage (39.0%) and broccoli (44.0%), instead of kale (17%). 

DBM in the F12 and F18 generations held on each cultivar (kale, broccoli or cabbage) 
showed no preference for feeding among other cultivars.  

In the dual-choice test, the DBM adult P generation originating from caterpillars reared 
on broccoli preferred to lay eggs on broccoli (68.7%) when presented with cabbage (χ22, 3 = 
11.29, P = 0, 0008), but they preferred to oviposit on kale (59.8%) compared to broccoli (χ22, 3 
= 5.35, P = 0.0206) (Fig 2A). Adults originated the F6 generation reared on kale preferred to 
lay eggs on cabbage (60.9%) when presented broccoli (χ22, 3 = 15.53, P <0.0001). However, 
when bred on broccoli, they displayed a preference for oviposition on kale (60.2%) (χ22, 3 = 
8.65, P = 0.0033) or cabbage (59.5%) (χ22, 3 = 8.05, P = 0.0045) (Fig 2B).  

In the F12 generation, the adults that originated from cabbage preferred to lay eggs on 
cabbage (70.3%) (χ22, 3 = 11.81, P = 0.0006) and kale (69.0%) (χ22, 3 = 12.12, P = 0.0005) than 
broccoli. Adults that originated from kale preferred to oviposit on cabbage (62.1%) (χ22, 3 = 
14.21, P = 0.0002) (Fig 2C). In the F18 generation, the adults reared on cabbage preferred to 
the oviposit on cabbage (71.5%) (χ22, 3 = 11.04, P = 0.0009) rather than on broccoli and also 
preferred cabbage (65.5%) than in kale (χ22, 3 = 5.69, P = 0.0170). DBM reared in kale leaves 
chose broccoli (54.0%) than cabbage (χ22, 3 = 6.37, P = 0.0116) (Fig 2D).  

In multiple-choice tests, the P generation reared on cabbage oviposited the highest 
percentage of eggs on broccoli (40.8%) and kale (33.6%), as compared to cabbage leaves 
(25.6% ). In the F6 generation, adults originating from caterpillars fed on cabbage preferred to 
lay eggs in broccoli (42.3%). However, when grown in kale, in the same generation, adults 
preferred lay eggs on the same substrate, kale (52.6% of the eggs). In the F18 generation, 
insects reared on cabbage prefer to lay eggs on cabbage (43.2%) and those originally reared 
on broccoli sprouts preferred kale (41.7%) and cabbage (34.9%). 

Although several studies on the life-history and behavior of the DBM in cultivars have 
already been conducted in different parts of the world, this is the first time this type of 
research compared different generations of the population of DBM in cruciferous plants. The 
results showed that the larval survival of the pest was similar in all Brassicaceae cultivars 
tested along generations. Therefore, there was no increased mortality among the cultivars 
examined. However, other biological aspects have changed in this study. During the larval 
period, cultivars of kale and broccoli were more readily consumed than cabbage. This average 
lower consumption of cabbage leaves was observed in all generations. Similar observations of 
lower consumption of DBM were reported in Midori cabbage cultivars and hybrid TPC 681 
when compared to cultivated kale (Volpe et al 2008). The lower consumption may be 
explained by the plants’ physical characteristics, such as a waxy leaf surface. It has been 
reported that occurs less leaf consumption of DBM larvae in plants with the alkane content 
where there are most waxy (Eigenbrode et al 1991; Ulmer et al 2002). 

Besides the aforementioned physical characteristics, the existence of deterrent 
chemicals, such as ethanol extracts, that are present in Brassicaceae cultivars can increase the 
consumption of P. xylostella. The amount of sinigrin present in the leaves of each plant 
species changes the feeding behavior of the DBM larvae. This was evidenced in studies by 
Thuler et al (2007) reported the absence of sinigrin in six commercial varieties of 
Brassicaceae (including cabbage) created through genetic processes aimed at improving the 
cultivars. In another study, the improvement of crop plants caused a reduction in 
glucosinolate levels in cruciferous crops (Bodnaryk 1997). 

The plants of the family Brassicaceae are characterized as containing glucosinolates in 
different quantities. These compounds undergo hydrolysis via an endogenous myrosinase 
enzyme when a tissue is damaged, resulting in the formation of substances toxic to insects, 
such as thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, and nitriles epithionitriles (Halkier & Gershenzon 2006; 
Hopkins et al 2009). When induced, glucosinolates are known to have a negative influence on 
herbivores and play an important role in prevention of further damage to the plants (van Dam 
& Raaijmakers 2006; Van Dam & Oomen 2008). However, populations of insects that 
specialize in plants containing glucosinolates, such as DBM, can possess mechanisms to 
overcome the toxicity of hosts (Halkier & Gershenzon 2006). 

The larval development period was different across generations. When the larvae were 
reared on kale, broccoli, and cabbage, the first generation (P) was completed in fewer days 
than the other generations, especially the last generation (F18). This suggests that the 
caterpillars anticipated the development stages for not being adapted cultivars (particularly 
broccoli and cabbage), over the generations the larval period was longer lasting. Boiça Junior 
et al (2011), working with kale genotypes, observed prolongation of the larval period in P. 
xylostella for some genotypes for one generation of the pest. Other results were reported by 
Veiga et al (2010) in kale, when compared to first generation DBM, which had lower larval 
period (6.8 days) against population reared by 60 generations in the laboratory, which 
presented longer larval period (9.1 days).  

Our study also observed a lower pupal period for caterpillars reared on cabbage. The 
average cabbage was higher due to compensation of the larval period in F18 generation of 
cultivar, which was longer. Variations and compensation in the DBM development period 
may exist between the larval and pupal when offered different cultivars. Sarfraz et al (2007) 
observed a faster development of P. xylostella in cultivars of Brassica juncea var. Czern when 
compared with B. oleracea var. Red Acre, B. napus var. Conquest and B. napus var. Liberty. 

During adulthood, the average longevity of DBM males between cultivars and along 18 
generations has not changed. Only occasional variation was found between generations for 
insects reared on kale. On the kale cultivar, males survived 24 days, on average, to P 
generation, surviving about 10 days longer than in broccoli and cabbage (Table 2).  

In relation to female longevity, there was a change between the generations originating 
from broccoli and cabbage. Females reared on both substrates survived for a longer period in 
the P generation. However, the longer longevity did not correlate with the fertility parameter 
presented in the study. For example, in the P generation, females survived for a longer period 
in this generation, but the number of eggs deposited by females reared on cabbage was lower 
in self-generation P (46.0 eggs) (Table 2). This difference observed in P generation 
progressively disappeared in subsequent generations, showing that successive generations 
have come to be beneficial for DBM.  

The number of eggs deposited by females increased over generations in moths reared on 
kale and cabbage (Table 2). Females deposited 1.95 and 2.17 times the eggs, respectively, in 
the F18 generation compared to P generation. This increase in fertility not was observed when 
studied up to the third successive generation of DBM. In other study, the number of eggs for 
females reared on kale showed low variation, and was minimally affected along three 
generations (Veiga et al 2010). The fecundity in insects of the Lepidoptera order is not altered 
in adulthood (Leather 1988) because when the adult emerges, their eggs are already contained 
in ovarioles. Then, changes in oviposit could be due to changes during the larval stage, as the 
food substrate. Thus, the quality of the cultivar (host) during larval development would be the 
most important step in reaching the maximum potential in fecundity of females (Awmack & 
Leather 2002). 

The life table parameters are the most important in estimating the success of a species 
subjected to a particular environment, which in this case is the establishment of pest on 
different host plants (Birch 1948). The population of P. xylostella reared on kale, in general, 
showed the highest net reproduction rate (R0) compared to those reared on broccoli and 
cabbage. Therefore, populations reared on kale produced more offspring per female. The 
evaluation of the chemical composition in cultivars is important for this parameter because, 
according to Luengo (2011), kale, broccoli, and cabbage differ significantly in the amount of 
nutrients and vitamin complexes they provide to feeding insects (Panizzi & Parra 2009).  

Differences in net reproductive rate between the initial and final generations in kale and 
broccoli were observed, but these variations were inconsistent in successive generations 
(Table 3). It has been shown that variable and inadequate protein intake, as well as differences 
in the quality of the different proteins and other nutrient levels, can generate a decrease or 
increase in the growth rate of insects, occurring along the generations in each population 
(Woods 1999; Sarfraz et al 2009). 

The R0, rm, and  are important factors in the generation of descendants in a given 
period, as indicated kale and cabbage best hosts. What about the comparisons between 
generations, the P generation in broccoli was higher to rm and  parameters, indicating 
increased production of offspring per female. However, in the F18 generation to increased 
production of descendants it was obtained when insects were reared on kale and cabbage. 

The results of the preference DBM between cultivars were different. In the double and 
multiple-choice tests, caterpillars developed on kale and broccoli did not seek that substrate of 
origin between generations. However, this occurrence was rarely observed with caterpillars 
grown on cabbage, which demonstrated a feeding preference for discs containing the same 
substrate (cabbage) in two of the four generations evaluated. This occurred in the F6, F12 and 
F18 generations to feeding and oviposit, which may suggest a period of familiarization or 
adjustment to the new substrate.  

Although there are many studies of insect food preference tests, the analyses are based 
on only one generation. In this study, differences between generations were analyzed, and 
variations were found that do not indicate imaginal conditioning of P. xylostella. Insects 
reared for several generations on a single substrate are influenced by a strong selection 
pressure, causing a tendency to develop of insects, but this behavioral manifestation may take 
many generations to occurred (Barros 1998).  

Analyzing all generations until the last (F18), verified the existence of a pre-imaginal 
conditioning for DBM on cabbage, which would support the argument for learning across 
generations. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that in recent generations (F12 and F18), 
females preferred the same substrate on which the insect was reared. Studies have shown that 
in plants, sinigrin was related to the oviposition stimulation process in P. xylostella (Spencer 
et al 1999). Structures such as trichomes and waxy present in small amounts in the leaves can 
also encourage a choice for oviposition, as these leaves possess lower mechanical protection 
(Hariprasad & Van Emden 2010). However, preference for oviposition of P. xylostella in 
cabbage was probably triggered by a set of stimuli, both chemical and physical factors, and 
sites with the most attractive stimuli were preferred for oviposition (Justus et al 2000).  

This study evaluated the possible occurrence of conditioning over DBM generations and 
contributes to the understanding of P. xylostella behavior in Brassicaceae cultivars. We 
emphasize that our study was the first to consider the behavior of the pest over several 
generations, thereby demonstrating that this insect behavior is complex and highly variable 
over time. However, more research is needed on the approach conditioning so these 
interactions can be better understood.
