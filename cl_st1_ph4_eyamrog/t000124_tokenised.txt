ABSTRACT – (Porotrichum squarrosum (Arzeni) H.A. Crum & Steere a new record to Brazil). Porotrichum squarrosum has never been reported from Brazil and it is a new record. While revising herbarium specimens we found a specimen named Pireella squarrosa (currently Porotrichum), identified by Massimo Mastracci. We have compared this specimen with records from literature and several hundreds of specimens and found that among specimens previously determined as P. substriatum several belong to P. squarrosum. These taxa are a quite common in Brazil ranging from Amazon, Atlantic Forest to Cerrado phytogeographical domains at elevations from near sea level to about 600 m. These taxa are fast differentiated by the squarrose leaves, spur costa at back and absence of stem central strand in P. squarrosum against to complanate leaves, without spurowed costa at back and presence of central strand in P. substriatum. Keywords: bryophytes, Hypnales, moss, Neckeraceae, stipitate-frondose
RESUMO – (Porotrichum squarrosum (Arzeni) H.A. Crum & Steere um novo registro para o Brasil). Porotrichum squarrosum nunca foi reportado para o Brasil e trata-se de um novo registro. Durante a revisão de espécimes de herbário, o nome Pireella squarrosa (atualmente Porotrichum), identificado por Massimo Mastracci foi encontrado em algumas plantas. Após a comparação com literatura e centenas de espécimens de herbário, verificamos que P. squarrosum é uma espécie comum no Brasil, ocorrendo desde o domínio fitogeográfico da Amazônia até a Mata Atlântica e Cerrado em elevações desde o nível do mar até próximo 600 m. Esses táxons são rapidamente diferenciados pelos filídios esquarrosos, costa com esporão dorsal e ausência de banda central de estereides no caulídio em P. squarrosum em contraposição a filídios complanados, sem costa esporada dorsalmente e presença de banda central de estereides no caulídio em P. substriatum. Palavras-chave: briófittas, Hypnales, musgos, Neckeraceae, estipitado-frondoso

While revising specimens for the Brazilian Flora online from online databases (Peralta 2019), we found a specimen named Pireella squarrosa Arzeni (nowadays, Porotrichum squarrosum), identified by Massimo Mastracci.

Porotrichum squarrosum has never been reported from Brazil in literature and is presented here as a new record. We checked several hundreds of unidentified specimens of Neckeraceae and found that P. squarrosum is quite common in Brazil ranging from Amazon, Atlantic Forest to Cerrado phytogeographical domains at elevations from near sea level to about 600 m.
Plants of this species were found in herbaria determined as Porotrichum substriatum (Hampe) Mitt., probably because of the synonymization proposed by Buck (1998). These species are distinguished by the concave and widely spreading to squarrose leaves of P. squarrosum (even on dry plants), spur costa at back and absence of stem central strand whereas P. substriatum has clearly plane and complanate leaves which are usually obliquely spreading (see the type at https://plants.jstor.org/stable/viewer/10.5555/al.ap.specimen.bm000961357), absence of spur costa at back and presence of stem central strand; plates of both species will be soon available at FBO (2020).
The revision of Neckeraceae family of Sastre de Jesús (1987) does not include the name Porotrichum squarrosum (a combination of Crum & Steere 1958 on Pireella squarrosa by Arzeni 1954). The original publication does not include the description of the pseudoparaphyllia. The genus Pireella belongs to Pterobryaceae and the pseudoparaphyllia in this family are always filamentose (Allen 1987), but Porotrichum and all family Neckeraceae has the characteristic foliose pseudoparaphyllia (Sastre de Jesús 1987).
Porotrichum squarrosum has been described from Haiti and the Dominican Republic by Arzeni (1954, with pl. 20, as Pireella) with only one further specimen from Haiti was reported by Crum & Steere (1958, with figures 62-83). But after the synonymization proposed by Buck (1998) these names are never re-evaluated, even with the absence of specimens or types SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/2236-8906-107/2020 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Scientific note https://doi.org/10.1590/2236-8906-107/2020

examined by this author. Our new records are the first ones from Brazil and we encourage the revision of specimens determined as P. substriatum to reveal the real range of this taxon.
In light of misinterpretation of the specimens examined we provide a description and pictures for this taxon and stimulating the reanalysis of preexisting herbaria specimens.

Plants gregarious, pale-green or partly brownish, dull, stipitate-frondose, mostly 2–4 cm tall. Stolons creeping, with small ovate-acuminate leaves and tufts of smooth, brownish-orange, densely branched rhizoids in the contact with the substratum; stolons transforming heteroblastically into stems consisting of a proximal, unbranched stipe and a distal, branched frond. Fronds irregular-pinnately branched, complanate. Stipe distinct, green, in cross section with a cortex consisting of 5–8 layers of very thick-walled cells grading into larger medullary cells with thinner walls; central strand present.

The specimens were identified using the illustrations and descriptions of the original publication by Arzeni (1954) and Crum & Steere (1958).
There are three other records of Porotrichum squarrosum on the repositories of GBIF (2019) and this one includes the indication to be a synonym of Porotrichum substriatum, but as we indicate above we consider these taxa to be different. The specimens examined are from the States of Amazonas, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Pará, São Paulo (figure 2) ranging from Amazon, Atlantic Forest to Cerrado phytogeographical domains at elevations from near sea level to about 600 m in Brazil.
