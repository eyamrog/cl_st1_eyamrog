Luria's theory provides a framework for examining psychological development following brain injury in both adults and children. The objective of this study is to analyze a selection of articles that evaluate preschool children through the lens of Luria's theory, aiming to establish connections with the principles of early childhood education. The methodology involved searching for relevant articles published between 2015 and 2022 across eight databases: SCOPUS, WOS, SCIELO, PUBMED, DIALNET, LATINDEX, SCIENCEGATE, and EBSCO. The results indicate that Luria and his followers have utilized neuropsychological factors as markers for assessing neurological impairments in individuals. However, a review of the articles suggests that Luria's insights align with the goals of early childhood education, emphasizing a comprehensive assessment approach. The authors of the study propose five strategies for evaluating the holistic development of preschoolers. In conclusion, Luria's theory can be effectively applied in early childhood education to conduct comprehensive assessments of preschool children.
Over the past decade, research in early childhood education has identified numerous theoretical and methodological deficiencies that hinder the effective management of the educational process with a focus on quality and dedication to the development and education of both the child and the family. This recognition stems not solely from the escalating demands for enhancement but also from the imperative to adequately equip educators, families, and other stakeholders in the educational sphere.
In terms of assessment, it is crucial to note that this is a continuously evolving topic in Cuba and other Latin American regions. Various authors from the region stress the necessity of revisiting assessment practices in preschool children, underscoring its significance in guiding a child's educational journey and readiness for subsequent academic stages. They also assert that assessment in the educational context of preschoolers is a reflective, systematic, and rigorous inquiry process aimed at informing decision-making.
In Cuba, the cultural-historical approach serves as the theoretical and methodological foundation for assessing comprehensive development in early childhood educational practices. Within the realm of educational sciences, this approach has led to the identification of specific evaluation forms, methods, and procedures tailored for early childhood, as outlined in the documents pertaining to educational enhancement.
Nevertheless, there exist constraints in understanding how to implement this in educational settings. Educators tend to compartmentalize the assessment of holistic development into specific domains, thereby restricting their focus to particular content areas and disregarding its comprehensive nature. For instance, during a motor skills or physical education task, the evaluation typically centers on motor skills alone, overlooking other crucial aspects of a child's abilities and knowledge, such as object identification based on attributes like name, size, and color, communication methods with educators and peers, and the overall assessment of the activity culminating in an appraisal of the child's values.
Theoretical systematization of the cultural-historical approach facilitated the compilation of key Russian authors who have approached assessment from a comprehensive standpoint. Consequently, the research opted for Luria's proposition for four primary reasons. Firstly, Luria effectively implemented the three fundamental principles of the approach:
In his exploration of the social genesis of higher mental functions, he developed tasks and tests that incorporated objects, data, concepts, values, norms, and attitudes reflective of the historical reality and cultural context of Russia.
Higher mental functions are structured as a system, with the researcher delving into neuropsychological factors to dissect these functions. For instance, he posited that the performance of a motor action encompasses a blend of skills, knowledge, and habits from various other functions. Consequently, within that single action, multiple components can be assessed and analyzed.
The higher mental functions are dynamically organized and localized within the nervous system as a system, comprising three functional units. This framework is essential for studying the cerebral localization of higher mental functions in humans.
Secondly, Luria's findings served as foundational pillars for the theoretical frameworks of numerous early childhood researchers in Russia, including F.I Yudovich, L. Venguer, A.V. Zaporozhetsz, Z. Neverovich, A.N. Leontiev, and D.B. Elkonin. Additionally, he introduced three functional units as interpretive constructs for approaching assessments from a comprehensive viewpoint. Furthermore, he proposed a structured set of methodologies and protocols for holistic assessments, emphasizing the significance of observation and neuropsychological markers as key indicators in the process.
Luria's model's accomplishments hold significance in the assessment and rehabilitation of patients with neurological injuries. Nevertheless, it is crucial to note that his research was confined to the adult brain-injured population and specifically focused on the clinical setting.
The current review commences by posing a scientific inquiry: can the methodologies and protocols employed by Luria be effectively utilized for assessing the holistic development of preschool children within the educational context?
To address this inquiry, the study suggests examining a selection of articles that assess preschool children through the lens of Luria's theory, aiming to establish connections with the fundamentals of early childhood education. The analytical approach employed is rooted in Gowin's V methodology, comprising four essential components: the research topic, the inquiries to be addressed, the concepts, principles, and theories to be applied, and the methodologies to be implemented.
A literature review was conducted to fulfill the study's objective, with article selection based on three criteria: the topic of child assessment in preschool infancy, search equations used across various databases ("assessment AND preschool AND neuropsychology", "assessment AND preschool AND Luria", "preschool AND neuropsychology", "preschool AND Luria"), publication years ranging from 2015 to 2022 in Spanish and English, and the utilization of eight databases including SCOPUS, WOS, SCIELO, PUBMED, DIALNET, LATINDEX, SCIENCEGATE, and EBSCO. To enhance the search, two additional actions were taken: direct checking in the Luria Journal, a Russian publication not listed in the aforementioned databases, and an advanced search on academic Google to include journals indexed in SCOPUS and WOS due to limited funding preventing direct access. Ultimately, 36 articles were chosen for review (refer to Table 1).
The articles underwent content analysis utilizing Gowin's V technique. This methodology involved posing specific questions to discern the key aspects of each article: What is the purpose of evaluating preschool children based on Luria's theory? What should be assessed according to Luria's theory, and how should it be done?
According to Luria, the evaluative methods within his theoretical model are essential for identifying, diagnosing, and rehabilitating defects following a brain injury. However, in the infant population, this information holds significant value in guiding a child's education, development, and learning processes.
The articles analyzed in Table 1 utilize gathered information to construct a comprehensive profile outlining the strengths and weaknesses in a child's development. Subsequently, this profile is used to diagnose any potential issues and recommend appropriate stimulation strategies. However, it is evident that the authors primarily focus on individual child analysis, neglecting the assessment of the group dynamics and the broader context in which the child interacts and receives developmental influences. Furthermore, the evaluation process heavily relies on task outcomes, lacking a systematic analysis that incorporates input from family members, as well as other educational stakeholders and institutions.
Research utilizing Luria's theory has focused on personalized defect analysis, diagnosis, and rehabilitation in both adults and children. Educators in the field of educational sciences apply this theory to facilitate the holistic development of children and to effectively organize educational activities within a group setting. By leveraging evaluation data, educators not only diagnose issues but also aim to shape and enhance the learning process for individual children, groups, and families.
Another significant aspect is Luria's emphasis on information feedback, where multiple criteria from various sources validate either a weakness or a strength in the subject. For instance, an educator might observe a child in an institutional setting to assess their focus during activities, pencil grip, adherence to instructions, and enjoyment levels. Simultaneously, the educator must engage with the child's parents to inquire about behaviors like toy cleanup, eating habits, self-care routines, social interactions, and adherence to rules. This triangulation of information between the educator and the family serves as a crucial tool in the educational process. It allows the educator to identify and address the child's and family's needs, thereby shaping their educational approach accordingly and aligning it with the established objectives.
From an educational sciences standpoint, the data derived from evaluative techniques serves a diagnostic, evaluative, and formative purpose. The diagnostic aspect is crucial for pinpointing the child's needs and capabilities, as highlighted in studies utilizing Luria's theory. Additionally, it aids in identifying the requirements of the group, family, and educational institutions associated with the child's learning. This underscores the evaluative role of assessments, as the standards set by the family and educational bodies play a significant role in determining the child's educational needs and overall growth.
The evaluation serves a formative purpose as it guides decision-making within the educational process, focusing on enhancing the education and development of the learner. Additionally, it extends to educating families on their roles and behaviors at home, as well as preparing educational institutions for effective engagement.
The examination of numerous neurological patients by Luria led to the identification of a scientific field that has seen significant advancements since the late 1990s. Previously, these patients were primarily studied through the lens of organic psychophysiology, focusing on brain reflexes to elucidate their behavior, yet neglecting to contextualize these reflexes within human activity. Luria, however, emphasized the significance of psychophysiology of activity, shifting the focus from viewing breathing as an unconditioned reflex to understanding how individuals employ breathing in their various activities such as sports, singing, or swimming.
From this standpoint, the field of psychophysiology or neuropsychology emerges as a discipline aimed at examining and elucidating the complex cognitive functions of individuals following a brain injury.
This indicates that the analysis of psychophysiology in humans can be approached from two distinct perspectives: organic psychophysiology, which seeks to elucidate the functioning of the brain, and activity psychophysiology, which aims to delineate and elucidate the mental processes that drive human actions. These two approaches fall under the umbrella of cognitive neuroscience, a field dedicated to the scientific examination of the biological mechanisms that underlie cognition, with a particular emphasis on the neural foundations of mental processes and their resulting behavioral outcomes.
Luria addresses the question of what to evaluate by asserting that the defect or symptom resulting from a brain injury restricts the functioning of mental processes as a whole and manifests in a syndrome. He identified neuropsychological factors associated with different syndromes to elucidate the impact on mental processes post-brain injury, defining these factors as connectors that unify psychological systems, human activity, and brain function. These factors serve as the foundation for a specific action or activity and play a crucial role in the manifestation of deficits following a brain injury.
For instance, the factor known as "simultaneous spatial synthesis," or visuospatial processing, plays a crucial role in determining the spatial location of motor actions, whether they involve moving up or down, right or left, or deep or superficial. Consequently, damage to the brain regions responsible for this function can impair or restrict the performance of various tasks or activities, such as writing, shifting lines while reading, accurately throwing a ball, or replicating a drawing.
Several authors (17-27) have utilized this theoretical model to examine the development, learning, and maturation of the nervous system in infants. They have identified a set of scientific advancements that endorse the application of Luria's model in assessing infants.
Neuropsychological factors serve as indicators of the child's brain functioning and provide a solid methodological basis for evaluating mental and neurological development in children.
Luria's behavioral tests, originally formulated to evaluate neuropsychological aspects in adults, have the potential to be modified and tailored for use with children.
Luria's model provides theoretical and methodological frameworks for conducting comprehensive evaluations and implementing interventions aimed at rehabilitating or correcting developmental deficits in children.
Luria's model stands as a crucial theoretical and methodological framework within the medical and psychological sciences for assessing child development, providing valuable tools for evaluation and rehabilitation during these formative years. Despite its significant impact in these fields, its application within educational sciences remains constrained, with its contributions primarily utilized in special education settings focused on analyzing and rehabilitating developmental deficits.
Luria's theory holds substantial relevance in the fields of medicine, psychology, and special education; however, the authors of this article underscore its particular applicability in preschool education, specifically in evaluating the holistic development of young children. The potential significance of Luria's theory in preschool education lies in its ability to:
A neuropsychology specialist, drawing from Luria's theory, focuses on understanding human actions to delve into the psychophysiology of activities. Conversely, an educator's perspective extends to observing a child's actions not just for analysis but also to evaluate their holistic development. To elaborate, a neuropsychologist scrutinizes a child's drawing to dissect neuropsychological elements and provide insights into the maturation of implicated brain regions. On the other hand, an educator examines the same drawing to assess motor skills, object relationships, the child's emotional investment in the artwork, values and habits mirrored in the creation, concentration levels, and adherence to educational objectives.
The tests proposed by Luria in the 20th century can be adapted for use in preschool-aged children to evaluate various aspects such as motor skills, language proficiency, memory capacity, lateralization of functions, and cognitive abilities. For instance, Luria employed a task involving the learning of 10 words across 5 trials to gauge the psychophysiological functioning of the temporal lobe and its interaction with subcortical structures. However, in an educational context, this task can be repurposed to assess a child's memory development and their capacity to learn a song, recall object names, understand verbal instructions, and execute a sequence of actions directed by an educator to achieve a specific objective.
Stage activities, including storytelling, drawing, and didactic games at the table, can serve as valuable objects of evaluation within the framework of the cultural-historical approach and Leontiev's activity theory. This foundational concept underscores the significance of these activities in assessing various aspects of development and learning processes.
From this perspective, the analysis of activity (neuropsychological factors) and the utilization of evaluative methods proposed by Luria can be applied in preschool education. Psychological sciences rely on Luria's theory as a framework for assessing children with neurodevelopmental disorders. In this context, the incorporation of neuropsychological factors is crucial for elucidating the maturation of brain regions implicated in a child's cognitive development. Conversely, the field of education leverages the principles of neuropsychological factors to scrutinize conceptual, attitudinal, and procedural aspects in early childhood education. These serve as pedagogical cornerstones, guiding the educational process with a holistic approach.
Clarifying the distinction between psychological and educational approaches in practical educational settings remains a crucial task. This differentiation is essential for effectively implementing strategies that cater to the diverse needs of learners. By elucidating how these approaches manifest in real-world educational scenarios, educators can better tailor their teaching methods to optimize student learning outcomes. Understanding the nuances between psychological and educational perspectives is paramount for fostering a conducive learning environment that promotes academic growth and development. By delineating the practical applications of each approach, educators can enhance their pedagogical strategies and create more effective teaching interventions.
In order to conduct the evaluation, Luria devised a methodology that relied on three key methods: observation, interviews, and specific tasks designed to assess problem-solving abilities. This methodology is structured into two distinct parts: the structural analysis of the defect and the examination of the psychological processes that underlie the identified defect.
According to Luria, the neuropsychologist is advised to pinpoint the primary defect by conducting a thorough interview regarding the subject's life, encompassing habits, skills, knowledge, and lifestyle. Simultaneously, Luria recommends incorporating simple tasks to validate the subject's statements. For instance, the examiner may issue verbal commands like "touch your left ear with your right hand," assessing the subject's ability to comprehend and execute the instruction. This evaluation hinges on neuropsychological elements such as verbal retention and the control of conscious actions. Nevertheless, additional factors necessitate scrutiny, including the selection of the correct hand, spatial orientation accuracy, visuospatial organization of the motor act, sequential motor organization, and the programming and control of the motor act.
Undoubtedly, this interview poses greater sensitivity for individuals with severe or moderate neurological impairments compared to those with minor alterations. Luria, therefore, developed tasks tailored to each cognitive process to delve deeper into and pinpoint the specific deficits. It is important to note that Luria's method encompasses two crucial assessment components: the observation and analysis of daily activities, and the utilization of specific tasks to confirm and specify the impairment. However, it is essential to acknowledge that Luria originally designed this assessment for adults with brain damage, not for children. Consequently, adaptations of Luria's approach have been made by Mangas and Ramos, as well as Solovieva and colleagues, to cater to the assessment needs of preschool-aged children.
Luria and his followers are driven by the intention to address the question of how evaluations should be conducted. Their method involves a combination of observation, interviews, specific tests, and the analysis of neuropsychological factors to interpret human actions and neurological damage. However, applying this approach to the field of education would overlook syndromic analysis and instead direct educators towards assessing a child's holistic development using methods such as observation and pedagogical situations.
In the field of educational sciences, it is imperative to utilize indicators to scrutinize the learner's actions on both a material and symbolic plane, enabling the evaluation, diagnosis, and decision-making concerning the child's holistic development. Drawing inspiration from Luria, the authors of this study extract neuropsychological factors to construct interpretation indicators, opting for the term "executions" over neuropsychological factors. This choice is deliberate, aiming to evaluate the actions underpinning the child's activities rather than their psychophysiological functioning. Whether engaged in free play with peers or under the guidance of an educator, the preschool child's activities are observed, with observation serving as the primary method for assessing the learner's progress. Nonetheless, the educator's role must be clearly defined to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. The observation process should focus on five specific executions.
Motor performance refers to the preferred hand used for executing actions or identifying objects through touch, such as holding a pencil or grasping a colored grip. It encompasses the positioning and grip of fingers while handling objects or engaging in activities. Factors like speed, coordination, and the proficiency in tasks like dressing, eating, bathing independently, and participating in physical education exercises are also crucial components. Additionally, facial expressions play a significant role in analyzing language-related organs, including mimics, cheek puffing, laughter, and the utilization of the tongue for speech, producing animal sounds, or mimicking trumpeting sounds.
Intellectual performance encompasses the capacity to engage in synthesis and analysis within a specific context or orientation. This includes tasks such as grouping objects based on color, shape, or size, as well as constructing with objects, images, or drawn figures. It also involves observing how individuals organize their ideas when crafting a narrative or story, and the manner and intensity with which they compare objects based on characteristics (similarities and differences) or quantities (larger and smaller). Additionally, intellectual performance is reflected in the speed and accuracy with which individuals enumerate and compare quantities ranging from 1 to 10 objects.
Communicative executions refer to the capacity to perform actions following verbal instructions. This involves guiding motor activities through language, where linguistic cues dictate the course of action before it is carried out. Language plays a crucial role in directing and shaping the execution of tasks.
Motivated executions involve sustaining motivation throughout actions driven by a specific goal. This entails maintaining a high level of concentration during the activities for an extended period, depending on the nature of the task at hand.
Spatial execution refers to the placement and dimensions of drawings and figures, whether on paper or a blackboard. This encompasses the orientation of movements and perceptions in terms of right-left, up-down, and deep-shallow directions. It also involves the arrangement of items such as toys, clothes, or other objects within a defined spatial area.
Undoubtedly, the executions are driven by the accomplishments on stage, which in turn are influenced by the underlying actions of the child. Therefore, the evaluation process in educational sciences focuses on two key aspects: the methods employed for assessment within the educational framework and the utilization of executions to delineate observation and provide targeted stimulation.
The literature reviewed indicates that Luria's theory holds potential for application in early childhood education, specifically in assessing the holistic development of preschool children. Neuropsychological factors can be integrated into early childhood education curricula to enable a comprehensive evaluation of the child, develop relevant indicators, and specify observation methods during educational activities.
The educators utilize executions to focus observations on aspects such as pencil grip, finger position and strength during drawing, hand preference for activities, concentration, and enjoyment. These executions are informed by a thorough examination of Luria's neuropsychological factors, aiming to comprehensively analyze a child's development within the educational context. This approach integrates skills, knowledge, and values from educational sciences to ensure quality in the educational process, ultimately preparing both the child and their family for future educational endeavors.
