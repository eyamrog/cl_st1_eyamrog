Athletes' mood states can fluctuate based on the context of their matches. This research delves into the variations in present mood states over time among 18 male youth soccer players (average age: 15.4 ± 0.266 years) throughout a competitive season. The Present Mood States List (PMSL) was utilized to evaluate their mood states 40 minutes before each event, encompassing training sessions and matches. The presence values of each PMSL Factor were computed for each player during every event, revealing distinct patterns of mood state changes. Moreover, the study identified that mood states exhibited different patterns of change depending on whether the event was associated with a training session or a match. The significance of incorporating the dynamic element of time as a crucial variable in understanding changes in athletes' mood states is emphasized.
The essence of an emotion lies in subjective emotional experiences, also known as feelings or sensations, while its objective manifestations are evident in its impact on behavior or through physiological signals from the body or brain, serving as indirect indicators of these internal experiences. Consequently, the most effective means of accessing these feelings is through verbal reports (LeDoux & Hofmann, 2018). By obtaining verbal reports from athletes, measures of subjective states can be assessed to describe their psychological conditions (Bueno & Souza, 2019).
Engelmann (1986, p. 121) defines mood states as "fundamental patterns of general functioning and orientation," reflecting "the impact on an individual of their own activity configuration," aligning closely with the colloquial understanding of feelings (Bueno & Souza, 2019; Engelmann, 1986). While it is crucial to explore a broad spectrum of states in understanding athletes' subjective experiences, there is a predominant focus on investigating negative aspects such as depression, anxiety, and stress, primarily due to their potential adverse effects on sports performance (Frame & Reichin, 2019; Rocha & Osório, 2018).
Research on athletes' mood states has traditionally relied on the Profile of Mood States (POMS), as evidenced by studies such as those by Chennaoui et al. (2016) and Morgan (1980). The POMS comprises one positive factor (Vigor) and five negative factors (Tension, Depression, Confusion, Anger, and Fatigue), a structure that has been criticized for its limitations in advancing theoretical models and intervention methods within this domain (Hagtvet & Hanin, 2007; Hanin, 2012; Hernández, 2016; Prapavessis, 2000). Despite these critiques, the POMS remains a widely utilized tool for investigating mood states in sports globally.
In order to effectively explore the diverse range of mood states within sports contexts, it is essential to utilize appropriate instruments. The Present Mood States List (PMSL), developed by Engelmann (1986, 2001), is a Brazilian tool designed to capture both positive and negative mood states. This instrument has been refined through extensive empirical research in Brazil, offering a probabilistic means to access individuals' subjective states. The PMSL assesses an individual's mood states at the time of response and has been employed in studies investigating Present Mood States in sports within Brazil (Bueno & Di Bonifácio, 2007, 2009; Bueno & Souza, 2019).
The understanding of how, when, and why these emotions impact athletes remains ambiguous and conflicting, with a lack of empirical evidence to substantiate the timing and content of psychological skill application before competition (Hagan et al., 2017a). For example, Vega Marcos et al. (2008) outlined the mood states profile of professional soccer players evaluated with the POMS in four precompetition events during the play-offs of a national championship and found no significant differences in this profile between the commencement and conclusion of the championship phase. This study implies the constancy of mood states over time within the same championship phase. Torres-Luque et al. (2013) scrutinized the correlation between the progression of training load, competition days, and mood states using the POMS in elite judo athletes during a competitive period and observed the impacts of training load and competitive cycles on mood states, particularly Fatigue. In their research, Torres-Luque et al. (2013) broadened the assessment of mood states to training sessions, not confining it solely to competition days. Box et al. (2018) investigated mood states during a consecutive 5-week fitness competition (CrossFit® Open) comprising five distinct CrossFit® workouts. Their data indicates that baseline mood (in a controlled environment) and pre-workout mood did not vary throughout the 5-week competition. Furthermore, they noted certain increases in negative moods immediately post-workout (e.g., Fatigue), which then decreased to pre-workout levels during recovery, while feelings of Vigor remained elevated throughout the entire session.
Hagan et al. (2017b) investigated the competitive anxiety responses of elite and semi-elite table tennis athletes as temporal events, utilizing the multidimensional anxiety theory framework (Martens et al., 1990) through the time-to-event paradigm. This paradigm considers the proximity of a relevant event, such as a championship match, as a crucial aspect in influencing athletes' pre-competition emotions. Current Mood States were found to be closely associated with various contextual factors including training load (Torres-Luque et al., 2013), championship phase (Di Bonifácio, 2013; Vega Marcos et al., 2008), self-perceived performance (Lewis et al., 2017), match location (R. C. da Silva, 2013), injury occurrence (Olmedilla, Ortega & Gómez, 2014), sports performance (Borges-Hernández, 2016), and match outcome (Hassmén & Blomstrand, 1995; Nogueira, 2009).
Research on the mood states of soccer players has also been conducted using the Profile of Mood States in Soccer (PMSL) as outlined by Bueno and Souza (2019). Nogueira (2009) delved into the profile of Present Mood States concerning the positions of youth soccer players and their correlation with the competition phase. The findings indicated a shared mood state profile among all athletes just before the match, with variations observed between pre and post-game states. Additionally, distinct mood states were identified for different player positions, with the match outcome influencing post-match mood states. Dias-Silva (2013) further highlighted a common Present Mood States profile across soccer players, alongside position-specific mood state profiles that were linked to player behavior during the match.
The investigation of Present Mood States and their changes over time is crucial for constructing the periodization of training and competition and facilitating psychological interventions to enhance athlete preparation for competition. While mood states may appear stable during a competitive period, as indicated by Vega Marcos et al. (2008) and Box et al. (2018), various stimuli and contexts, such as the phase of competition, field position, location, environment, social interactions, and match outcomes, can alter the intensity and valence of these states, as demonstrated by Bueno and Di Bonifácio (2009), Nogueira (2009), Torres-Luque et al. (2013), and Hagan et al. (2017b). This study aimed to investigate whether the Present Mood States of youth soccer players change during a competitive period (sequence of matches and training sessions) based on the proximity of the match.
Eighteen Brazilian soccer players, with an average age of 15.4 years (SD = 0.266), voluntarily participated in this study. These players were members of a U-15 male soccer team competing in the second phase of a state championship and agreed to take part in the research with the consent of their parents. The study received approval from the Ethics Committee of the institution overseeing the research.
To assess the athletes' present mood states, the researchers utilized the Profile of Mood States in Sport (PMSL). This instrument involves 40 statements presented in the first person singular that reflect various mood states. Participants are required to rate the intensity of these mood states on a 5-point Likert-type scale located beside each statement. The 40 statements are categorized into 12 factors, considering both the hedonic value and activation level of each item. To aid in the interpretation and analysis of the data, previous researchers employing the PMSL in sports settings (Picoli, 2016; Silva, 2017) have assigned names to these factors based on the representative statements: I—Humiliation/Anger, II—Fatigue, III—Hope, IV—Limerence/Empathy, V—Physiological Response, VI—Repulsion, VII—Interest, VIII—Surprise, IX—Hunger, X—Disregard/Envy, XI—Receptivity, and XII—Serenity.
All athletes participated in the study by responding to the Profile of Mood States Questionnaire (PMSL) (Engelmann, 1986) in three distinct conditions: approximately 40 minutes prior to the final training session before the match (Training-Previous condition), approximately 40 minutes before the match itself (Match condition), and approximately 40 minutes before the initial training session following the match (Training-Post condition). Data were gathered over the course of three consecutive championship rounds, resulting in a total of three assessments for each condition: Training-Previous (TR-PRE), Match (MATCH), and Training-Post (TR-POST).
Players were categorized into four groups based on their field positions: Goalkeepers (n=2), Defenders (n=7), Midfielders (n=7), and Forwards (n=2). The presence values of each PMSL factor, as outlined by Engelmann (1986), were determined by multiplying the participant's assigned value on the scale next to each statement by its correlation value with each factor. To enable comparisons across factors with varying numbers of correlated statements, a standardization process was implemented to scale each PMSL factor's presence value to a 0-1 range. This standardization involved calculating the maximum potential value for each PMSL factor by multiplying all positive correlations by 5 (the maximum value on the PMSL scale) and negative correlations by 1 (the minimum value on the scale), then averaging these values. Conversely, the minimum potential value was calculated by multiplying positive correlations by 1 and negative correlations by 5, and averaging these results. The minimum value was then adjusted to 0, and the maximum value was adjusted proportionally to maintain the scale integrity. For instance, if the minimum value was adjusted from 2 to 0, the maximum value was reduced by 2 accordingly. The maximum value was then adjusted to 1 by dividing it by itself. Subsequently, the original presence value (ranging from 1 to 5) was divided by the adjusted maximum value to obtain the final presence value for each PMSL factor. This standardization process was applied to all participants' presence values across all events, with the mean presence values for each PMSL factor used for subsequent statistical analysis.
The statistical analysis utilized the Event Series value, which was determined by calculating the mean presence of PMSL factors in the TR-PRE, MATCH, and TR-POST for the same round of the championship. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was conducted, revealing a normal distribution (p=0.068). Data were then subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) with multivariate repeated measures of a mixed-model design. In cases where significant differences were observed, the post hoc Bonferroni test was employed. The significance level was established at p ≤ .05, and all calculations were performed using SPSS 20.0 software for Windows.
The data presented in this study pertain to the comparison of mean values across all participants as a unified group, as no statistically significant differences were observed in the values of PMSL factors based on the players' field positions. Factors I (Humiliation/Anger), VI (Repulsion), VIII (Surprise), IX (Hunger), and X (Disregard/Envy) consistently exhibited very low presence values (> 0.30) throughout the duration of the study.
Comparison of the presence values of each factor within the same series across events unveiled shifts in mood states over time (see Figure 1). Distinct temporal patterns in mood state alterations were identified, notably in Factors II (Fatigue), VII (Interest), and XII (Serenity). Factor II (Fatigue) exhibited higher presence values in TR-PRE compared to MATCH (p=0.001), with MATCH values also lower than TR-POST values (p=0.002). For Factor VII (Interest), TR-PRE values surpassed TR-POST values (p=0.008), while MATCH values were also higher than TR-POST values (p=0.000). In the case of Factor XII (Serenity), TR-PRE values were higher than TR-POST values in Series 1 (p=0.023) and 3 (p=0.023), but lower than TR-POST values in Series 2 (p=0.034). Consequently, TR-PRE values were elevated for Factor II (Fatigue) compared to MATCH, whereas MATCH values were higher for Factors VII (Interest) and XII (Serenity) compared to TR-POST values. Additionally, TR-POST values for Factor II (Fatigue) exceeded MATCH values.
A comparison of the values for each Factor between Series indicated a shift in mood states over time, as illustrated in Figure 2. Temporal patterns of mood state changes were observed specifically in Factors IV (Limerence/Empathy) and VII (Interest). Significantly higher presence values for Factor IV were noted in Series 1 compared to Series 2 (p=0.012). Similarly, Factor VII presence values were higher in Series 1 compared to both Series 2 (p=0.003) and Series 3 (marginally significant with p = 0.055). Consequently, Factor IV presence values were elevated in Series 1 compared to Series 2, while Factor VII presence values were higher in Series 1 than in both Series 2 and 3.
Statistical analysis comparing presence values between Events and different Series revealed temporal patterns of change based on both Event and Series of Factors III (Hope) and XI (Receptivity). An interaction was observed between Event and Series, indicating that the presence values of the PMSL Factors were influenced by the specific Event and Series they were associated with (see Figure 3). Specifically, the presence values of Factor III (Hope) in TR-PRE of Series 1 were significantly higher than those of Series 2 (p=0.001) and 3 (p=0.000), with Series 2 also showing higher values than Series 3 (p=0.001), suggesting a progressive decline of Factor III (Hope) across the Series. Similarly, Factor III (Hope) exhibited higher presence values in Series 1 MATCH compared to Series 2 (p=0.001) and 3 MATCHES (p=0.039), indicating a consistent decline in hope along the Series of competition. Factor XI (Receptivity) displayed a similar reduction in TR-PRE presence values in Series 1 compared to Series 2 (p=0.001) and 3 (p=0.000), with higher values in Series 1 MATCHES compared to Series 2 (p=0.005) and in Series 2 MATCHES compared to Series 3 (p=0.028). Additionally, Factor VII (Interest) exhibited statistically significant differences based on Event and Series, although no interaction was observed between these variables.
Factor V (Physiologic) exhibited the most significant variation throughout the study, with discernible patterns in its presence across the sequential events in the series. The TR-POST presence values consistently surpassed both MATCH and TR-PRE values across all three series. Notably, Series 3 displayed distinct alterations in the presence values of Factor V compared to Series 1 and 2. While TR-PRE presence values were notably higher in Series 1 (p=0.007) and 2 (p=0.000) compared to the corresponding MATCH values in both series, Series 3 exhibited a lower TR-PRE value than MATCH 3 (p=0.000). Furthermore, the MATCH presence values varied among the three series, with the MATCH value in Series 2 being lower than those in Series 1 and 3. Consequently, an examination of the interplay between series and events unveiled a consistent trend in the presence of mood state factors across the temporal sequence in all three series, despite significant and specific alterations observed in Series 3 in contrast to Series 1 and 2.
The findings of this study align with the time-to-event paradigm (Hagan et al., 2017b) when considering the interval between training sessions and matches, highlighting the significant impact of these events on variations in Present Mood States and the potential influence of match outcomes. While the primary focus of the study was not on match outcomes, it is important to note that the team under investigation experienced defeat in all matches, a factor that is taken into account in the discussion of the results.
Patterns of change in Present Mood States represented by PMSL Factors II (Fatigue), VII (Interest), and XII (Serenity) were observed across Events (TR-PRE, MATCH, and TR-POST), indicating that these mood states exhibit consistent temporal patterns of change over time. The presence of Factor VII (Interest) increased as the match approached, while the presence of Factor II (Fatigue) decreased correspondingly. Previous research by Torres-Luque et al. (2013) demonstrated a decrease in the Fatigue Factor of the POMS before competitions, followed by an increase post-competition, reflecting the physical and mental exertion experienced during training and matches. Nogueira (2009) found that youth soccer players frequently reported feeling tired immediately after matches, regardless of the match outcome, aligning with the high presence of Factor II (Fatigue) observed in the current study 48 hours post-match in the TR-POST phase. Despite the time lapse, the elevated presence of Factor II (Fatigue) persisted after competition. Russell et al. (2019) emphasized the inconsistent findings on mental fatigue in sports and its impact on performance, underscoring the necessity to enhance the ecological validity of research in this domain. They proposed investigating the effects of mental fatigue on performance throughout a season as a means to advance understanding in this area.
Factor VII (Interest) has been consistently identified as a significant factor approximately 40 minutes before a match, as evidenced by Bueno and Di Bonifácio (2007), Dias-Silva (2013), Di Bonifácio (2013), and Silva (2013). This factor is closely associated with organic activation and motivation. Pujals and Vieira (2002) highlighted a specific interest in enhancing performance among young soccer athletes, which is intricately linked to the motivation for achievement (Brunstein & Heckhausen, 2018) as well as intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (Brunstein, 2018). Gea Garcia et al. (2016) demonstrated that the temporal proximity of competitive matches leads to heightened levels of Vigor and Tension (POMS Factors) in college athletes. Interestingly, in the present study, the peak presence of Factor XII (Serenity) was observed further away from the matches temporally. It is crucial to acknowledge the variations in competition levels and age ranges across these studies, emphasizing the importance of exploring how these factors may influence the presence of Factor XII.
The presence values of Factors IV (Limerence/Empathy) and VII (Interest) exhibited distinct patterns of change in response to a Series of Events, as evidenced by the mean presence values of PMSL Factors associated with the same match. Notably, the mean presence values of Factors IV (Limerence/Empathy) and VII (Interest) declined significantly when the likelihood of progressing to the next championship phase diminished (between Series 1 and 2 Matches), with the team already out of contention after the second match and merely fulfilling subsequent fixtures for formality. The dynamics between these Factors in this scenario can be elucidated through the interplay of group cohesion (Lafferty et al., 2017) and achievement goals (Mascret et al., 2015). The team's elimination likely impacted group cohesion, contributing to the diminished value of Factor IV (Limerence/Empathy). Consequently, these findings suggest that, despite adverse circumstances, the emotional states linked to these PMSL Factors are commonly observed in the context of competitive team sports.
Depending on the type of event and the series to which it belonged, Factors III (Hope) and XI (Receptivity) exhibited distinct patterns of change. The mean presence value of Factor III (Hope) decreased as the likelihood of the team being disqualified increased or became definitive. Nevertheless, this factor was consistently present across all events during the study period. Notably, this psychological factor was evident in the initial phases of international competitions among elite volleyball players, although the values did not remain consistently high throughout the competition (Di Bonifácio, 2013). Pujals and Vieira (2002) similarly noted that Hope served as a positive psychological factor among youth soccer players, exerting an influence on their performance on the field.
Nogueira (2009) and Silva (2013) demonstrated high presence values in speech with a stronger correlation to Factor XI (Receptivity) following losses for midfielders. In the current investigation, no significant distinction was observed between groups concerning this PMSL Factor. This lack of differentiation could be attributed to the limited specialization of players in the present U-15 category, unlike the adult categories scrutinized in prior research. Nonetheless, this factor persisted post-defeats, albeit with a diminished presence value compared to match values.
Factor V (Physiologic) exhibited the most significant variations throughout the competition, suggesting a potential correlation with the expressions associated with this factor such as "I feel cold," "I feel warm," and "I am thirsty," which appear to be highly responsive to situational and contextual influences. The study aimed to pinpoint contextual factors, particularly those linked to the likelihood of success in the championship, while also noting situational variables like training sessions conducted on both synthetic and natural grass fields, as well as the prevailing meteorological conditions during the events. It is important to acknowledge that these conditions were not systematically controlled for in the current study.
The mood states examined in this study exhibited differences that could be linked to the match serving as a crucial temporal reference for these fluctuations. Time perspective emerges as a significant aspect to consider when predicting how these mood states evolve over time (Stolarski et al., 2019). The evaluation conducted two days post-match unveiled a variety of mood states. Previous research has indicated a correlation between athletes' mood states and the temporal progression during a competitive phase. For instance, Keikha et al. (2015) utilized the POMS at various intervals to assess the mood states of university athletes across different sports, revealing distinct profiles only one day before competitions, which remained consistent when evaluated one hour and one week prior to the event (cf. Vega Marcos et al., 2008). Hassmén and Blomstrand (1995) examined the mood states of soccer players using the POMS approximately one hour before, immediately after, and two hours post-match, identifying variations in athletes' mood profiles across these time points, which were associated with the team's performance outcomes in the matches analyzed.
During the study period, elements such as the likelihood of classification and match outcomes, particularly defeat, significantly impacted the fluctuations in Present Mood States. These changes were evident through the heightened intensity of negative hedonic expressions like "I am angry," "I am sad," "I feel humiliated," and "I feel ashamed" following matches, as well as the diminished values of Factors III (Hope) and VII (Interest) towards the study period's conclusion, reflecting the team's elimination from contention. Research indicates that defeat triggers negative emotions and diminishes positive feelings among athletes post-competition (Ahmadi et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2017; Rubio, 2006), with the intensity of negative mood states evolving as the competition unfolds (Bueno & Di Bonifácio, 2007). Future investigations could explore how other outcomes, such as ties or victories, impact the presence of specific Present Mood States and their evolution over a competitive timeframe.
In the current study, the analysis of Present Mood States indicated significant differences in their presence values throughout the competition timeline, suggesting that utilizing an instrument such as the PMSL, developed in Brazil with a Brazilian population, may be more suitable for investigating these aspects. The PMSL encompasses a broader range of positive and negative mood states compared to other instruments like POMS, thereby expanding the spectrum of potential relationships with various variables within the sports context that are linked to changes in Present Mood States among athletes. The efficiency of the PMSL in assessing Present Mood States was swiftly demonstrated and was further validated through comparison with other instruments such as PANAS (Pires et al., 2013). These findings align with previous research conducted by Bueno and Di Bonifácio (2007), Dias-Silva (2013), Di Bonifácio (2013), Nogueira (2009), and Silva (2013). The presence of Factors III (Hope) and VII (Interest), along with the expression "I am happy" (which is negatively correlated with Factor I - Humiliation/Anger, thereby reducing the presence value of this Factor), indicates a shared mood state among Soccer, Football, Volleyball, and Futsal athletes prior to their matches.
The current study extends the examination of athletes' Present Mood States by evaluating them not only immediately before a match but also during training sessions, enabling the analysis of changes in these mood states over the course of a competitive period. Martini (2000, pp. 103) emphasized that "The psychological preparation of sportsmen should be based on systematic interventions carried out according to a program that will accompany and consider the succession of sport events." The data gathered in this study offer a deeper insight into how, when, and which mood states undergo changes, thereby enhancing the support for planning and implementing interventions in athletes' competition preparation. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate the dynamic element of temporality as a variable influencing the models of variation in neuropsychological processes, particularly in studies of subjective aspects like Present Mood States within the sports context (Staddon & Bueno, 1991).
