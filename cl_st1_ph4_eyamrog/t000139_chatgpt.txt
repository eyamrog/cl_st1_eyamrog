Conclusion: The detection of macro-hormones frequently prompts intervention in laboratory experiments, potentially leading to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate treatment. It is imperative for laboratories to adhere to a diagnostic algorithm that enables the meticulous identification and evaluation of potential immunoassay interferences.
Complexes formed by monomeric hormone molecules, whether immunoglobulin-associated or non-immunoglobulin bound, result in the creation of macro-complexes that are biologically inactive, known as macro-hormones. These macro-hormones, also termed "incidentalormones," are seldom encountered as pitfalls in laboratory examinations and are typically unexpected occurrences.
Macro-hormones, as defined by their decreased bioactivity in relation to homologous receptors, are characterized by their high molecular weight, which hinders effective elimination through the renal pathway. Despite their biological inactivity, these hormones circulate normally in the body and can be measured using immunoassays.
Despite the high sensitivity and specificity of immunoassays, potential interferences such as autoantibodies, heterophilic antibodies, and antianimal antibodies can result in unforeseen false-positive and false-negative outcomes. Consequently, despite advancements in immunoassay technology, the occurrence of analytical errors stemming from non-specific or cross reactions remains a challenge that cannot be completely eradicated.
Incongruent hormone levels with the clinical presentation are rare; nevertheless, such discrepancies can prompt unnecessary diagnostic procedures, misperceptions of illness, and inappropriate therapeutic interventions.
The initial documentation of macro-hormone occurred in 1981 by Whittaker et al., who detailed a case involving hyperprolactinemia with a notable presence of macroprolactin. Subsequently, in 1985, Jackson et al. introduced the term "macro-hormone" specifically in the context of "macroprolactinemia," referring to a scenario where exceptionally elevated prolactin levels were observed in a patient without any discernible pituitary tumor during imaging examinations.
The initial step in addressing analytical measuring issues or preanalytic considerations typically involves problem-solving within the laboratory. To effectively tackle these challenges, laboratories are advised to adhere to a diagnostic algorithm that enables the thorough identification and evaluation of potential immunoassay interferences. Despite ongoing efforts to create assays that are less prone to interference from antibodies and other immunoglobulins, progress has been hindered by various complicating factors.
In this article, we present an examination of the various forms of "incidentalormones", delving into their biochemical significance and providing a comprehensive review of laboratory tests and macro-hormones within the realm of contemporary laboratory medicine. Our discussion encompasses the diagnostic challenges encountered in patients with "incidentalormones", exploring aspects such as prevalence, the specific immunoglobulins implicated, clinical relevance, and potential associations with other diseases.

Various methods exist for macro-hormone detection, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, gel filtration chromatography (GFC), electrophoresis, and ultrafiltration (UF). While each method has its own limitations and specificities, their primary purpose is to separate the immunoglobulin-bound hormone from its unbound, or monomeric, form.
PEG precipitation is a widely utilized technique for identifying macro-hormones. This method involves mixing equal volumes of PEG reagent and plasma, followed by centrifugation to separate the residual macro-hormones. The quantification of the supernatant is then carried out, with PEG playing a crucial role in reducing the solubility of proteins, leading to their precipitation. Specifically, PEG is vital for precipitating immunoglobulin complexes and immunoglobulin, preferentially targeting macro-hormones containing IgG while partially affecting IgA. However, the potential for incorrectly precipitating Ig-complexed analytes alongside monomeric analytes aggregates poses a limitation on the specificity of the PEG reaction, particularly when plasma contains high levels of gamma globulin.
Gel filtration chromatography (GFC) is a separation technique commonly employed to isolate molecules based on their varying molecular sizes. This method involves two phases, a mobile phase, and a stationary phase, and can be carried out using any buffer system that preserves the structure and function of the protein complex. Three primary methods are typically utilized in the key applications of GFC: desalting or group fractionation, which is effective when the protein of interest significantly differs in size from contaminating solutes; another method involves determining the molecular size of proteins; and finally, an additional procedure is used to calibrate gel filtration columns for estimating molecular sizes accurately.
Electrophoresis, a method utilized for the separation of immunoglobulin-complexes based on size and electric charge, necessitates meticulous optimization and specialized instrumentation due to challenges posed by sample preparation and laboratory conditions, potentially hindering the identification of macro-hormones (12). This analytical technique has garnered significant interest for macro-protein analysis, experiencing a surge in utilization in recent years. The primary electrophoresis methods employed for the separation of immunoglobulin complexes from proteins include gel capillary electrophoresis, micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography, and free solution capillary electrophoresis (13).
Recent studies have shown the potential utility of the ultrafiltration (UF) technique, specifically when employing an exclusive filtration membrane, for the detection of macro-hormones. UF operates by physically removing immunoglobulin-complexes based on their size. This process involves centrifugation using a filter typically with a 100 kDa porosity, allowing for the extraction of macro-molecules while enabling the passage of monomeric hormones. Research indicates that UF could serve as a viable alternative, especially in laboratories equipped with immunoassay instruments that encounter issues related to PEG precipitation interference.
Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) consists of 49 amino acid residues, comprising two regions associated with corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide and Î±-MSH. The hypothalamus produces corticotropin-releasing hormone, which triggers the secretion of ACTH, a tropic hormone released by the anterior pituitary gland. ACTH, in turn, regulates cortisol and androgen production in the adrenal cortex through feedback mechanisms.
The ACTH test is frequently employed in diagnosing disorders of the pituitary and/or adrenal glands, notably Cushing's disease, Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease, and hypopituitarism. Therefore, the assessment of plasma ACTH levels plays a crucial role in the differential diagnosis of dysfunctions within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
Electrochemical immunoassays for ACTH measurement are fully automated, boasting exceptional accuracy and a functional sensitivity of 4.8pg/mL. This enables precise results within a broad assay range of up to 1000pg/mL, while also demonstrating minimal cross-reactivity with a wide array of potentially interfering substances. The ACTH immunoassay specifically targets the biologically active 39 amino acid chain of ACTH. One antibody, biotinylated, selectively binds to the C-terminal ACTH 34-39, while the other antibody, labeled with Horseradish Peroxidase, targets the mid-region and N-terminal ACTH 1-24. Reference values stand at 7.2-63 pg/mL for a.m. draws, with no established reference value for p.m. draws, and these values remain consistent for both adults and children (17).
Unexpectedly high levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are referred to as macro-ACTH, a phenomenon attributed to its intricate binding with immunoglobulin. The presence of immunoreactive but biologically inactive ACTH molecules is a consequence of incomplete cleavage of proopiomelanocortin.
Macro-ACTH refers to falsely elevated ACTH levels caused by interference from anti-analyte antibodies or immunoglobulin-associated factors. Plasma pretreatment with PEG precipitation or the use of a heterophilic blocking tube significantly decreases these erroneous ACTH values. The literature currently documents only 23 cases of macro-ACTH.
To enhance the accuracy of analysis, it is imperative to employ PEG precipitation of immunoglobulin prior to examination to eliminate potentially interfering antibodies. With the advent of state-of-the-art automated analyzers, the process of analysis has been streamlined, rendering it more efficient and rapid. During PEG precipitation, plasma is combined with an equal volume of 25% PEG and subsequently centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3,000 gravity. The resulting supernatant is then assessed for ACTH levels using a specific ACTH assay. The percentage of the expected value is determined through the formula: [(ACTH concentration after treatment) Ã 2/(ACTH concentration before treatment)] (18). Therefore, it is recommended that a PEG precipitation study be conducted to rule out macro-ACTH in cases where discrepancies between the laboratory findings and clinical presentation exist.
Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, playing a crucial role in regulating reproduction in mammals. FSH consists of two distinct subunits, Î± and Î², with the Î± subunit shared among glycoprotein hormones and the Î² subunit unique to FSH. The heterodimer formed by these subunits is responsible for FSH's biological activity (19).
Accurate laboratory evaluation of FSH levels is crucial for precise diagnosis and effective treatment. It is imperative that any FSH measurement in the laboratory includes details of the standard used for comparison and the specific method employed for this assessment.
Macro-FSH should be considered when FSH levels do not align with the patient's clinical presentation. Therefore, the hypothesis of macro-FSH should be considered when there are unexplained elevations in plasma FSH levels (20).
Macro-FSH could potentially arise from an autoimmune response characterized by the existence of anti-FSH antibodies, leading to the creation of an IgG-FSH immunoreactive complex. Alternatively, it may be attributed to the interference of a heterophile antibody or human anti-animal antibody in the FSH assay (21).
The serum reference levels of FSH are known to vary with age. Presently, the accepted normal limit value of FSH for women is 20 IU/L; levels below this threshold are often linked to poor ovarian reserve and decreased fertility, although some residual ovarian reserve may still be present. Conversely, significantly elevated FSH levels beyond the established maximum reference range values could indicate the presence of macro-FSH.
Macro-FSH poses a risk of misdiagnosis, unwarranted evaluations, and improper treatments if not differentiated through appropriate laboratory assays. Therefore, it is crucial for laboratories to incorporate a screening process into their routines to assess samples exhibiting elevated levels of total immunoreactive FSH for the identification of macro-FSH.
The luteinizing hormone (LH) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted in the adenohypophysis. It aids in the maturation of primordial germ cells, the production of testosterone by the Leydig cells of the testicles, and the production of estrogens by the ovaries. Furthermore, LH plays a crucial role in regulating the menstrual cycle, particularly in ovulation and the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus (23, 24).
The LH assay relies on microparticle enzyme immunoassay technology. Levels of LH fluctuate based on factors such as age, sex, clinical history, and other variables.
The presence of macro-LH should be considered when there is a discrepancy between the clinical presentation and the serum LH levels. Macro-LH, like other macromolecules, interacts with immunoglobulin-G complexes and serum autoantibodies (25). The interference of endogenous antibodies in immunoassays of pituitary glycoprotein hormones like LH is uncommon (26). Therefore, notably elevated LH levels, accompanied by normal FSH and estradiol values within reference ranges, warrant further investigation through macro-hormone analysis. Limited cases have been reported regarding macro-LH and its implications for LH levels.
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) serves as a crucial marker for thyroid function, guiding the management of thyroid dysfunctions. This 28- to 30-kDa glycoprotein is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, prompting the thyroid to synthesize its hormones (T3 and T4). Functionally, TSH promotes thyroid growth, shields thyrocytes from apoptosis, and plays a pivotal role in ontogeny. Additionally, it aids in iodine uptake and organification. The synthesis of TSH in the pituitary gland hinges on the TSH releasing hormone and is inhibited by thyroid-produced hormones through a feedback loop mechanism.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) exhibits diurnal variation in its serum levels, peaking between midnight and 4 a.m. and decreasing in the late afternoon. Consequently, a fluctuation of up to 50% in serum TSH levels within the normal range may not necessarily reflect a shift in the gland's functional status. Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of TSH measurement assays, transitioning from radioimmunoassay methods with limited functional sensitivity to immunometric assays with superior precision (29). Age-related variations are observed in normal TSH reference values, with the elderly showing higher concentrations, which are typically attributed to the natural aging process rather than indicative of thyroid dysfunction (30). Various factors can influence serum TSH levels, including biotin, heterophilic antibodies, anti-thyrotropin autoantibodies, anti-ruthenium antibodies, anti-streptavidin, and macro-TSH, among others.
Macro-TSH, a macromolecule formed from the complex of immunoglobulin G and TSH, presents with elevated serum TSH levels and normal thyroxin levels, mimicking the laboratory profile of subclinical hypothyroidism. A recent study indicated that 0.79% of individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism exhibited macro-TSH, underscoring the importance of distinguishing between macro-TSH and monomeric TSH in this population. Notably, macro-TSH can also be detected in individuals with TSH levels within the reference range. Gel filtration chromatography reveals that monomeric TSH has a molecular mass of 28 kDa, while macro-TSH exceeds 150 kDa. Despite its presence, macro-TSH exhibits low bioactivity, and its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood.
Elevated levels of TSH detected during routine neonatal screening in an asymptomatic newborn could potentially be attributed to maternal interference. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct further investigations in such cases. The presence of interfering macro-TSH should be taken into account when dealing with a euthyroid neonate exhibiting elevated serum TSH levels alongside normal thyroid hormone levels. This consideration is crucial in order to prevent unnecessary therapeutic interventions. (Reference: 33)
Therefore, it is imperative to investigate macro-TSH when individual serum TSH levels do not align with the patient's clinical presentation, particularly in cases of notable elevations.
Prolactin, a 23 kD peptide hormone, is secreted in the anterior pituitary gland and regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, while being physiologically inhibited by dopamine. Additionally, prolactin can be secreted by various other tissues such as immune cells, the brain, mammary gland, fat tissue, prostate, and ovary, each exhibiting different bioactivity and molecular weight. Notably, prolactin plays a crucial role during pregnancy and lactation, primarily involved in the synthesis and maintenance of milk secretion.
There are three biologically distinct isoforms of prolactin: the free monomeric form, also known as free little prolactin, which has a molecular weight of 23 kDa and consists of 199 amino acids. This isoform is physiologically the most potent, accounting for up to 95% of adult serum prolactin. The big prolactin, a dimer of the monomeric form with a molecular weight ranging from 40-60 kDa, exhibits minimal biological activity. Lastly, the big big prolactin, or macroprolactin, is a complex of prolactin and antibodies with a molecular weight exceeding 100-150 kDa. This isoform represents less than 1% of circulating serum prolactin and also demonstrates minimal biological activity (7, 35).
Prolactin serum levels are typically measured using the automated immunoassay method. Modern immunoassays employ a two-site immunometric or sandwich-based approach, wherein prolactin interacts with a capture antibody immobilized on a solid phase and a detection antibody. Following the formation of the analyte-antibody sandwich and the removal of unreacted reagents through a washing step, the resulting signal is directly proportional to the quantity of prolactin present (36).
The initial documentation of hyperprolactinemia characterized by an abundance of macro-molecule prolactin was presented in 1981 by Whittaker et al. (4). The concept of a macro-hormone was subsequently introduced by Jackson et al. in 1985, specifically in the context of "macroprolactinemia," denoting exceptionally elevated prolactin levels in a patient devoid of any discernible pituitary tumor upon imaging examination (5).
Macroprolactin ranks as the third most common cause of non-physiological hyperprolactinemia, following prolactinomas and drug-induced hyperprolactinemia. It is advised that screening for prolactin and macroprolactin not be conducted in asymptomatic individuals to prevent the occurrence of "incidentalormones," misdiagnosis, and unnecessary treatment. Hence, a thorough clinical and laboratory assessment is crucial for determining the most appropriate course of therapy.
Macro-hormones are predominantly found in the form of immunoglobulin IgG complexed hormones. It is crucial for healthcare providers to be vigilant in distinguishing between hormone elevations and discrepancies in the clinical manifestations exhibited by the patient. The presence of macro-hormones frequently directs us towards intervention in laboratory investigations, potentially leading to false-positive diagnoses and inappropriate treatment. Laboratories are advised to adhere to a diagnostic algorithm to meticulously identify and evaluate potential immunoassay interferences.
