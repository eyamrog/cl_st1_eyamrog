Covid-19 Mortality Rates Adjusted by Differences in Age Structure of 
Populations 
Marcelo PINHO* 
Enéas Gonçalves de CARVALHO** 
Abstract 
One of the tools to monitor the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic has been, from its earliest 
days, the international comparison of mortality rates. The indisputable evidence that lethality is 
exponentially related to the age of the affected people implies that, for many purposes, a more 
appropriate indicator should compensate for differences in the age profile between populations. 
This article sets out a method for calculating such standardized mortality rates, which take into 
account both the discrepancies in the age pyramids and the mortality rates by age groups. 
Advancing relatively to the few other similar initiatives found in the literature, the method is 
applied to a group of 28 countries that on 1/28/2021 accounted for 82% of deaths caused by the 
pandemic. The age-adjusted mortality rates describe a picture quite different from that 
portrayed by the crude rates, with three different patterns of mortality. Six Latin American 
countries and South Africa assume leading positions in the ranking calculated based on these 
rates. Moreover, a partial but sufficiently accurate update of the calculation based on the number 
of deaths until 3/26/2021 indicates that in this ranking Brazil only stands behind Mexico and 
Peru. 
Keywords: Covid-19; pandemic demography; standardized mortality rates; age-adjusted 
mortality rates. 
1. Introduction 
Unfortunately far from its ending, the pandemic has lasted already long enough to allow at least 
preliminary assessments of the measures to combat the disease and the health systems 
performance. This issue, of course, can be addressed on multiple geographical scales through 
comparative indicators of efforts and results. One of the possibilities is to compare the global 
mortality rates from the disease, a procedure that, in the case of an illness whose morbidity is 
so strongly correlated with the age of the victims, should not dispense with adjustment to the 
different age structures of the populations.

Since the pandemic first days, international cooperative efforts have been made to gather 
indicators to monitor its spread1. The numbers of cases, deaths, and people recovered are 
tracked, both on the most recent day and the accumulated tolls to that day. The problems with 
the accuracy of the information and, further more, its internationally discrepant levels make the 
number of cases an unsuitable variable for comparison between countries. Even if the suffering 
caused by Covid-19 cannot in any way be narrowed to the situations that culminate in death, 
the differences in the availability of tests – especially, but not only, in the early stages of the 
pandemic – imply that case-based indicators are, strictly speaking, incomparable. Although 
death records are not problem-free, they provide a safer basis for comparative analyses. 
Comparisons between countries with different demographic sizes require considering rates 
related to their populations. In the case of Covid-19, demographers [GOLDSTEIN & LEE, 2020; 
HEUVELINE & TZEN, 2021; QUEIROZ et al. 2020] insist, however, that the calculation of per 
capita rates is absolutely insufficient for several purposes, such as comparing the performance 
of the countries in coping with the disease. The enormous disparity in Covid-19 case-fatality 
rates according to age was recently summed up in a study based on data from 45 countries, 
which estimated that they range from 0.001% in the age group of 5 to 9 years to 8.29% for those 
aged 80 years or older [O'DRISCOLL et al., 2021: 142]. On the other hand, there are also huge 
differences between the age pyramids of the countries. The comparison between the populations 
of Pakistan and Portugal provides an extreme but enlightening example of the magnitude of 
these discrepancies. Although the Pakistani population is 22 times larger than the Portuguese 
population, there are more inhabitants in Portugal aged 90 years or older than in Pakistan. 
It is not because we fail to recognize that other variables, such as gender and prevalence of 
comorbidities, also affect crude mortality rates, that this article prioritizes the age profile of 
populations and Covid-19 deaths. As will be seen later, data that discriminate deaths according 
to those other criteria are even more difficult to obtain. Moreover, none of them has as crucial 
and decisive an impact as age on the risk of death. 
Therefore, the primary objective of this article is to calculate Covid-19 mortality rates adjusted 
by differences in age pyramids based on data on mortality by age group. Both the difficulty of 
obtaining this information and its relevance to other studies suggest that gathering data on 
mortality from the disease by age groups into a single source for the countries most affected by 
the pandemic is in itself a relevant secondary objective. 
Following the introduction, the article unfolds successively in a very brief review of the 
pertinent literature, a section that details the methodological procedures, a topic that presents 
the results and, finally, the conclusion.

2. Literature review 
More than a year after its inception, the Covid-19 statistical monitoring remains a challenge. 
Although the tests that prove contagion are much more widely available today than in the early 
stages of the pandemic, not only is there still a disparity in the access to them among localities 
and social groups [O’DRISCOLL et al., 2021: 140], but also the effects of the previous bottleneck 
persist on any cumulative indicator of cases. The use of other variables in principle relevant to 
epidemiological follow-up, such as the numbers of hospitalizations, ICU admissions and 
intubations, is restricted by the different criteria used to define these events and, mainly, by the 
fact that they are not reported by most official systems that disclose information on the subject. 
For all these reasons, it is widely recognized that the number of deaths is a more reliable 
indicator of the size of the epidemic [O’DRISCOLL et al., 2021: 140] and for the understanding 
of its dynamics [HALLAL, 2020: 2403]. HEUVELINE and TZEN (2021: 6) also maintain that data 
on deaths are more comparable – and more reliable, although not totally immune to 
underestimates [ORELLANA et al., 2020] -, which makes them particularly relevant to evaluate 
public policy measures to address the pandemic. None of this, of course, implies ignoring the 
enormous human cost of cases of the disease that do not culminate in death. 
When comparisons between locations are an important instrument of analysis, as in this article, 
the discrepancy of scales impels researchers to use indicators related to the population. The 
indicators of deaths per capita – most frequently calculated in relation to groups of 100 thousand 
or 1 million inhabitants – will, however, present important biases if the populations of the 
different localities are subject to distinct risks of developing severe forms of Covid-19 due to 
pre-pandemic conditions. The diffusion of comorbidities and the composition of the population 
by sex and age are the most important of such conditions. 
The association between various chronic diseases and the risk for severe forms of Covid-19 is 
well established in the medical literature [ZHOU et al., 2020 and CHOW et al., 2020 apud BORGES 
& CRESPO, 2020]. Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases, obesity, and 
immunodepression are the most notorious. It has also been shown that the risk of death from 
Covid-19 is substantially higher among male individuals. A meta-analysis based on information 
from 46 countries and 44 US states concluded that this risk is 39% higher among men 
[PECKHAM et al., 2020: 2], a result that is in line with studies conducted in the first months of 
the pandemic [GOUJON et al., 2020: 5; GUILMOTO, 2020: 8]. Although the relative importance 
of each of them is not uncontroversial, the factors that explain this disparity are fixed in the 
literature. PECKHAM et al. (2020) do not rule out the relevance of sociocultural factors and 
differences in the prevalence of comorbidities, but, based on a detailed review of the biological 
differences between the two sexes, especially regarding the immune system response to 
infection, they decisively stress the latter factors.

Anyway, there is no doubt that the aggressiveness and lethality of the disease increase with the 
age of the person affected [GOLDSTEIN & LEE, 2020: 4; VILLANI et al., 2020: 4; O’DRISCOLL et 
al., 2021: 140]. More than that, age is the variable most directly related to the probability of 
death from Covid-19, which “increases exponentially with age (…) in all countries where this 
has been examined” [CRIMMINS, 2020: 142]. The reduction of immunity and the higher 
prevalence of comorbidities are the primary explanations for this situation [VERITY et al., 2020 
apud GOUJON et al., 2020]. The degradation of the immune system with aging, expressed in the 
lower availability of specific categories of naïve T cells, would be particularly severe in the 
case of a completely new virus. Besides, other aspects of immune function also worsen in the 
elderly. As deregulation levels in five cytokines double between the ages of 50 and 80, the risk 
of uncontrolled immune reactions, hyperinflammatory processes associated with 'cytokine 
storms’ that can overload vital systems and lead to death, is higher [CRIMMINS, 2020: 142]. On 
the other hand, the presence of comorbidities increases continuously with age [BORGES & 
CRESPO, 2020: 6]. 
A complete treatment of the issue addressed in this article should preferably deal with all three 
factors, adjusting mortality rates to the previous prevalence of comorbidities and differences in 
demographic structures regarding sex and age. The data available at the time this article is being 
written make this impossible. Albeit from the earliest moments of the pandemic, researchers 
have called governments to systematize and disseminate data on cases and deaths disaggregated 
by age and sex [DOWD et al., 2020: 9,696], the crossing of this information in most cases 
remains unavailable. The record of comorbidities among those killed by Covid-19 is even more 
flawed and less available [HEUVELINE & TZEN, 2020: 8]. Considering that not only age is the 
factor that most markedly conditions the risk of severe Covid-19 and death, but also that 
heterogeneity between populations is much higher in age composition than in gender 
distribution [GUILMOTO, 2020: 9], it is justifiable in an initial research effort to focus on the 
age-related adjustment. 
The literature review allowed us to identify two studies whose central objectives were to 
promote adjustments in Covid-19 mortality rates that are close to those proposed in this article. 
VILLANI et al. (2020) calculated analogous age-standardized mortality rates, but for only five 
European countries and based on data available up to 8/30/2020. More recently, HEUVELINE 
and TZEN (2021) have undertaken a much more geographically comprehensive effort, covering 
186 countries and some subnational units particularly affected by the pandemic. In contrast to 
the wider geographical scope, this study allowed for a less complete procedure of mortality 
rates adjustment. Indeed, the “indirect” standardization they calculated neutralizes the effects 
of different age pyramids on rates but assumes for all countries and localities the same pattern 
of mortality by age group – in this case, that observed in the USA. Even defending the procedure 
adopted when the availability of data hinders the “direct” standardization, the authors do not 
fail to recognize problems arising from it, especially in the case of differences in mortality rates

between countries in the older age groups. It is precisely the most complete adjustment 
procedure for a wide range of countries that this article proposes to do. 
3. Methods 
Adjusting Covid-19 mortality rates to compensate for differences in the age structure of 
populations requires data on the population of countries (P) and the cumulative number of 
deaths (M) broken down by age group. Those data allow us to calculate both the crude mortality 
rate (m) and an adjusted mortality rate (a) based on a uniform pattern of age structure. 
Given: 
Pij, the population of country i in the age group j; 
Mij, the cumulative number of Covid-19 deaths in country i in the age group j; and 
𝑚𝑖𝑗= 
𝑀𝑖𝑗
𝑃𝑖𝑗, the cumulative Covid-19 mortality rate in country i in the age group j. 
Then ai, the Covid-19 mortality rate in country i adjusted by differences in the age composition 
of the countries, should be defined as follows: 
𝑎𝑖=
∑
𝐴𝑖𝑗
𝑘
𝑗=1
𝑃𝑖
 
In which: 
𝐴𝑖𝑗= 𝑚𝑖𝑗∙𝑒𝑗∙𝑃𝑖  corresponds to the cumulative number of deaths that country i would have 
in each age group j with the mortality rate observed in the country in this age group and the 
population it would have in this age group if the age composition of the population were the 
same in all countries – in this article, we assumed the distribution by age groups given by the 
world population age pyramid; 
𝑒𝑗=
∑
𝑃𝑖𝑗
𝑛
𝑖=1
∑
∑
𝑃𝑖𝑗
𝑛
𝑖=1
𝑘
𝑗=1
  is the portion of each age group j in the total population of the set of countries; 
and 
𝑃𝑖= ∑
𝑃𝑖𝑗
𝑘
𝑗=1
  is, of course, the population of each country i. 
Replacing the previous definitions, ai can be rewritten more analytically as: 
𝑎𝑖=
∑
𝑚𝑖𝑗∙𝑒𝑗∙𝑃𝑖
𝑘
𝑗=1
∑
𝑃𝑖𝑗
𝑘
𝑗=1
 
Calculating adjusted mortality rates2, therefore, requires basic data on the population and deaths 
broken down by age group and by countries. In the case of demographic information, data 
 
2 An alternative exercise would be to calculate the number of deaths that each country would have if the mortality 
rate by age group were given by an international standard and not by the rate actually observed in the country. 
This exercise, which corresponds to the so-called indirect standardization and is beyond the scope of this article, 
would allow estimating the number of surplus deaths (or lives saved, if the signal were reversed) in the country in

availability is broad, and access is trivial. The Population Division of the Department of 
Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations displays estimates for the population of all 
countries in the world disaggregated by age measured as whole numbers up to 99 years of age 
and with an additional range for people aged 100 years or older. In this article, we employ 
estimates for 2020 published by the UN in August 2019 [UNITED NATIONS, 2019]. The only 
exception concerns population data from England and Wales. As information on deaths 
appropriately disaggregated by age is available only for these two units together and not for the 
entire United Kingdom3, which is the unit represented in the UN statistics, it was necessary to 
collect population data for England and Wales. In this case, the source is the UK Office for 
National Statistics. 
Data on Covid-19 deaths broken down by age group are not easy to find. Hence, we believe 
that the presentation in a single publication of mortality rates by age is, in itself, an important 
result of this article. The next paragraphs describe the effort of collecting and systematizing 
these data. The sources are detailed in Chart 1. 
Recognizing beforehand the impossibility of obtaining this information from a single source 
and, therefore, the size of the data collection work, our initial goal was to cover countries that, 
together, accounted for 90% of Covid-19 deaths. Of the 34 countries required to achieve this 
goal, minimally updated age-disaggregated data for six countries could not be found: Russia, 
Iran, Belgium, Romania, Iraq, and Bolivia. The other 28 countries for which the searches were 
successful accounted for 82% of deaths by 1/28/2021. 
For 20 of those countries, we obtained the number of deaths for nine homogeneous age ranges 
(0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80 years or more) directly, through 
aggregating more disaggregated ranges or through small adjustments4. Data for 11 of these 
countries – Germany, Canada, Spain, France, England (including Wales), Italy, the 
Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland (including Liechtenstein), and Ukraine – were 
obtained from just one source: the website of the French National Institute of Demographic 
 
relation to an international pattern of pandemic mortality by age group and would provide another indicator of the 
quality of the response of the health system and measures to combat the epidemic adopted by each country. It 
would filter the effects of differences in age structures of populations, but not in mortality rates by age group. 
3 Covid-19 deaths data from Scotland and Northern Ireland are presented in a different and much less open 
disaggregation (0, 1-14, 15-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85 years or more). 
4 Minor adjustments were necessary in the cases of Brazil and Mexico. In Brazil, the data published do not 
accumulate information from the two calendar years of the pandemic and discriminate the initial age groups into 
less than 1 year, 1 to 5 years, and 6 to 19 years (SVS/MS, 2020; SVS/MS, 2021). Besides aggregating data from 
2020 and 2021, in order to allocate deaths in similar ranges to those adopted in most countries, it was necessary to 
resort to individualized records in the Epidemiological Influenza Information System (SIVEP Influenza) on people 
affected by Covid-19 who received hospital treatment for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
(https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/bd-srag-2020). For Mexico, it was not possible to read the values of the 
graph that presents the information of the age groups from 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, and over 100 years. This 
implies identifying as unknown the age of 175 of the 165,731 deaths in Mexico until 2/8/2021, and underestimating 
mortality rates in this country in the age groups from 0 to 9 years and 10 to 19 years.

Studies (INED). Information from the nine other countries in this group – South Africa, 
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, the Philippines, Hungary, Mexico, Peru, and Poland – comes from 
the health authorities' websites in each of these countries. Finding them often required the use 
of search expressions in the native languages of each country and the translation into English 
of the headings of tables and graphs. As in other studies that adopted similar procedures in the 
collection of information [PECKHAM et al. 2020: 5], Google Translator was used for this 
purpose.

especially concerning the age groups of the deceased. Each adopts a different criterion to define 
age groups. Although this jeopardizes a little the comparability of results, it does not prevent 
the calculation of the adjusted mortality rate, since population data are available with a 
disaggregation compatible with any age brackets that can be defined. Also, except for the USA, 
whose data were compiled by the INED, the information was obtained by the same case-by-
case procedure reported in the previous paragraph. Again, sources were almost always the 
websites of the national health authorities. India and Pakistan are exceptions. For Pakistan, the 
source is the website of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE). For India, 
one of the main Indian newspapers, Hindustan Times, cites the Ministry of Health and the 
Family Welfare5. 
A last relevant general methodological information is that the numbers of deaths that served to 
calculate mortality rates by age group (mij) were not those directly obtained from the reported 
sources. When disaggregated by age groups, the reference dates for this information vary 
greatly and are not homogeneous even in the case of the most developed countries surveyed. 
As can be seen in Chart 1, despite the great effort made, in some countries, the most recent data 
obtained refers to dates as far as 9/11/2020 (Ecuador), 10/25/2020 (Turkey) or 11/6/2020 
(Poland). Whatever the time lag, international benchmarking requires that the numbers of 
deaths by age group correspond to a single date. The procedure for this temporal standardization 
was very simple and involved solely the distribution of the accumulated contingent of deaths 
in each country until 1/28/2021, according to the pattern identified up to the most recent date 
the disaggregation by age group was available. In other words, this age pattern of mortality was 
extrapolated to that date6. 
4. Results 
Tables 1 and 2 present Covid-19 mortality rates by age groups estimated based on the procedure 
described above. The first one reports the rates of those 20 countries for which it was possible 
to obtain information by homogeneous age groups, while the second does so for the other eight 
countries. 
 
 
 
 
5 Data for India are also the least accurate among those employed in this article. The original information refers to 
the percentage distribution of deaths by age group and does not have decimal places in the percentages. Similar 
percentages are the original data for Indonesia and Pakistan, but presented with an accuracy of two decimal places.  
6 Two other similar extrapolations in terms of procedure, but of distinct origin, were made in the case of South 
Africa and France. As the original information on the distribution by age of deaths is available only for deaths 
occurring in hospitals, for these two countries the age partition of these deaths was extrapolated to the set of deaths 
by Covid-19. It is worth noting that deaths in hospitals are widely prevalent in both South Africa (94%) and France 
(70%).

The tables confirm that the mortality rates caused by Covid-19 are very different according to 
the age of the individuals affected by the disease. Table 1, which gathers information on a group 
of countries in which 49% of deaths were recorded in the world until 1/28/2021, indicates that, 
excluding the passage from 0 to 9 years to 10 to 19 years, the mortality rate grows in all these 
populations continuously and significantly from one range to the next7. The trend is so strong 
and accentuated that, taking values for all these countries, the mortality rate is more than 30 
times higher among individuals aged 80 years or more than among those aged 40 to 49 years 
and, again, more than 30 times higher among those in this age group and those aged 0 to 19 
 
7 The only and yet partial exception is Canada. In the official statistics of this country, Covid-19 deaths of people 
under the age of 40 are not recorded.

60 is only slightly smaller (29 times).

Although the exponential growth of mortality rates with age is observed in all countries, the 
relationship is less pronounced in developing countries than in developed countries in Europe 
and North America. In fact, in these countries, Covid-19 mortality is 5,000 or even 10,000 times 
higher among the elderly aged 80 years or more than among those under 20 years. This result 
is in line with the conclusions of COHEN et al. (2021), who, as early as April 2020, examined 
data on the distribution of deaths in Western Europe. However, among Latin American 
 
8 Those gradients are similar to those estimated by GUILMOTO (2020:7) from initial pandemic data for the US and 
eight European countries. Based on the data available until 5/15/2020, he estimated that Covid-19 mortality rates 
double every six years of age increase. According to the author, the usual relationship between general mortality 
and age, even after 35, is much less pronounced: the rate doubles at periods of just over 8 years.

countries the difference is smaller, reaching 500 times in the cases of Peru and Brazil9. The 
main determinant of this divergence is the higher mortality rates among the youngest observed 
in the poorest countries, but in extreme cases, there is also a particularly high mortality rate 
among the elderly in some rich countries10. The highest mortality rate depicted in Table 1 refers 
to the elderly aged 80 years or older from England and Wales. In this population, no less than 
one in 51 people died from Covid-19 from the onset of the pandemic until 1/28/202111. In a 
country as severely affected by the pandemic as Mexico, this relationship is somewhat less 
dramatic: one death in every 108 people in this age group. In any case, the last column of Table 
1 shows that the dispersion of mortality rates among countries is lower in the older age groups12, 
different, in fact, from what O’DRISCOLL et al. (2021: 141) suggest, based on another 
methodology13. 
An effort to generalize from the information gathered in these two tables allows us to infer three 
distinct patterns of Covid-19 mortality with a good degree of geographical coherence. In 
European countries and the US, overall mortality rates are high and the disparity in rates 
between age groups is extreme. In Latin American countries – and also in South Africa – overall 
rates are almost equally high, but the disparity in mortality conditions by age is smaller. In poor 
Asian countries, whereas the overall mortality rate is much lower, the relationship between age 
and mortality is less pronounced. Of course, there are intermediate situations, such as Turkey, 
 
9 A difference of the same order of magnitude is observed in Pakistan and Turkey (Table 2). In the Philippines, 
the disparity is rather smaller, below 300 times. Comparable information is not available for other poor Asian 
countries, but Table 2 suggests that the picture should be similar to that of the Philippines. In this country, therefore, 
that relationship between Covid-19 mortality rates among those over and under 60 is 18 times, higher than in India 
(12 times) and Indonesia (8 times). Alongside the specificities of each country, the data presented here confirm 
the hypothesis, at that time merely speculative, presented by GUILMOTO (2020: 7) that Covid-19 mortality rates 
could have a less pronounced relationship with age in Asian, African, and Latin American countries. 
 10 This phenomenon is probably related to the higher proportion of elderly living in long-term care institutions, a 
situation that due to the gregarious nature of housing leads to greater vulnerability to contagion [CRIMMINS, 2020; 
EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL, 2020; O’DRISCOLL et al. 2021]. Indeed, COMAS-
HERRERA et al. (2021: 21) showed that in a set of 22 developed countries the residents of those institutions 
corresponded, on average, to 0.73% of the population, but to no less than 41% of Covid-19 deaths. The proportion 
of elderly sheltered in those institutions who died of Covid-19 by mid-January 2021 reached percentages as high 
as 9.4% in Belgium, 7.9% in Spain, or 7.2% in the USA. Similar data are not available for developing countries, 
but at least in the Brazilian case, scarce estimates indicate that the portion of the population living in elderly shelters 
is in an order of magnitude below the value indicated above [CAMARANO & BARBOSA, 2016: 495; CAMARANO et 
al., 2011]. 
11 The first death from Covid-19 recorded in the United Kingdom occurred on 3/5/2020. 
12 By the way, this helps explain why the overall mortality rate presents a lower dispersion than that observed in 
mortality rates by age group. In developed countries, overall mortality rates are completely dominated by the 
behaviour of deaths among the elderly. Not quite different general rates are generated in Latin American countries 
by a somewhat different process, in which simultaneously the significance of the elderly population is lower and 
higher mortality rates are recorded among the youngest. 
13“[While] we find a very consistent pattern in the relative risk of death by age for individuals younger than 65 
years of age across countries and continents, (...) the observed relative risk of death in older individuals appears 
to be substantially more heterogeneous across locations.”

as well as more or less important effects of national peculiarities, as in the case of Canada and 
Germany. 
In a disease whose lethality is closely associated with age, the overall mortality rate in any 
population will depend not only on the mortality rates by age observed in it, but also on its age 
composition. Especially emblematic of this is the fact that the four countries in Table 1 with the 
highest overall mortality rates – England and Wales, Italy, Hungary, and Spain – are not among 
the four with the highest mortality rates in any of the age groups below 70 years, a list composed 
in all cases by Latin American countries or South Africa. On the other hand, in the age group 
of 80 years or more, three of the four highest rates are from developed countries, except for 
Colombia, which has the second highest mortality rate in this age group. 
Figure 1 illustrates the differences in age profiles of populations by selecting three 
representatives from each of the groups of countries indicated above: England and Wales, 
Brazil, and the Philippines. In addition to a larger portion in the older age groups, the English 
population is divided among similar groups, at least for the population groups up to the age of 
50. Age distribution is very different in the Philippines: participation in the total population 
drops continuously with age. Brazil, which has begun the demographic transition a few decades 
ago, is an intermediate case. It should be noted that given the population preponderance of 
countries with a similar profile to that of the Philippines, the age composition of the world 
population resembles this one more, albeit in an attenuated version. 
Calculating adjusted mortality rates to compensate for the effect of differences in the age 
composition of populations is the main objective of this article. The results of those calculations, 
performed according to the methodology described in the previous section, are reported in Table 
3, which gathers information on all 28 countries for which it was possible to obtain age-
disaggregated mortality data. Immediately, we must emphasize that the success of the 
adjustment can be inferred from the correlation coefficients between, on the one hand, an 
indicator of population aging and, on the other hand, the crude and adjusted mortality rates. The 
correlation between the percentage of the population aged 60 and over and the crude rate is not 
only positive but also quite significant: 0.573. With the adjusted rate, the same indicator 
presents a very low correlation (-0.252).

Due to the size of the differences in populations age profiles, it is not surprising that the values 
of these adjusted rates and, even more, the ranking that results from them differ greatly from 
the values of crude mortality rates and their respective ordering. Ranked by the adjusted rate, 
the seven countries with the highest mortality all belong to the group of Western developing 
countries, comprised of six Latin American countries and South Africa. Developed countries, 
such as England, the USA and Italy, which are at the top of the ranking of crude mortality rates, 
all rank below those seven countries. However, the internal organization of the group of 
countries at this stage of development does not undergo significant changes, which is explained 
by the similarity of the age profiles of their populations. Finally, it should be noted that the final 
positions of both rankings are occupied by those poorer Asian countries that, as already 
highlighted, have a much lower Covid-19 mortality rate than the Western countries covered in 
this study. 
Based on Table 3, we can also calculate that the dispersion, measured by the coefficient of 
variation of the adjusted mortality rates, is greater than that of crude rates. This indicates that 
the crude rates converge because different phenomena are equalized: the higher mortality within 
each age group of some countries is compensated by a population which is younger and less 
susceptible to more severe cases. Alongside the disparity between the three groups of countries, 
the internal disparity counts on those groups. Indeed, the adjusted mortality rate in Mexico is 
89% higher than in Chile, while in England and Wales it surpasses Germany by no less than 
223%. 
A detailed interpretation of the discrepancy of adjusted mortalities observed among countries 
is beyond the scope of this article. Strictly speaking, except for the age profile of the 
populations, duly compensated for in the adjusted mortality rate, all factors that affect the 
incidence of the disease and its lethality influence those rates. A relevant finding of the research, 
however, is that at least in the case of the group of Western developing countries there is a clear 
inverse relationship between the level of health spending and the adjusted mortality rate. Such 
evidence is represented in Figure 2, which, in the horizontal axis, describes the current 
expenditure per capita on health – converted into dollars by the purchasing power parity 
exchange rate – and in the vertical axis, the adjusted mortality rate. The size of the spheres, in 
turn, reflects the absolute number of deaths in each country.

5. Conclusion 
This article presents two main contributions to the analysis of the planetary spread of Covid-
19. The first is the systematisation of data on mortality rates by age group for a set of 28 
countries that, on 1/28/2021, concentrated 82% of deaths because of the disease. This is a 
valuable result in itself, since no source is known to have already published age-disaggregated 
information with the same geographical coverage. Based on them, we can infer whether the 
notorious growth of lethality with age is the same everywhere, an interrogation launched, for 
example, by VILLANI et al. (2020). As we have seen, there are important differences between 
countries and at least three patterns are discernible. 
The second and most important contribution is the calculation of adjusted mortality rates based 
on mortality rates by age group and the age profile of populations. This adjustment was 
previously indicated by demographers who focused on the subject [QUEIROZ et al. 2020: 3689]. 
It is essential to filter the effect of disparities in age pyramids and to enable the appropriate use 
of mortality rates in assessing the success or failure of measures to address the pandemic 
[GOLDSTEIN & LEE, 2020: 5]. In fact, at least two previous studies have attempted to move in 
this direction. Notwithstanding, whether due to the broader spatial and temporal scope in 
relation to one of them [VILLANI et al., 2020] or to the methodologically more complete 
procedure in relation to the other [HEUVELINE & TZEN, 2021], we can argue that our results in

this article offer important developments. From them, one can infer an international ranking of 
Covid-19 mortality very different from that based on crude rates. More than that, adjusted rates 
reveal that the “protective” effect of younger demographic profiles on populations in poorer 
countries [GUILMOTO, 2020: 8; DOWD et al, 2020: 9,697], at least in the case of several Latin 
American countries and South Africa, was not enough to prevent these countries from staging 
some of the more dramatic impacts of the pandemic. The primary explanation for this is the 
existence, identified in this article, of rather different mortality patterns by age in developing 
countries and, more specifically, the higher mortality in lower age groups. 
We can see that the research method developed in this article is applicable in at least two 
different and relevant directions. The use on a subnational scale – states and municipalities, for 
example – would, in principle, illuminate comparisons between mortality rates in the same way 
that it did on an international scale. In addition, this endeavour can be updated over time and 
eventually expanded to other countries upon data availability. As the dynamics of the pandemic 
are still unfolding, the results may change substantially. Thus, the mere updating14 of the 
calculations based on the total number of deaths recorded on May 21, 2021, would make Brazil 
climb four positions in the gloomy ranking of adjusted mortality rates, falling second only to 
Peru.

14 Updates of this type run into an important methodological obstacle. One of the premises of the method used in 
this article is the stability of the distribution of deaths by age group from the day when disaggregated deaths by 
age are known in each country until a common base date for all countries. The beginning of the vaccination process 
and the prioritization to the older population make this hypothesis unsustainable, especially in the countries that 
have made the most progress in vaccination. However, as at the indicated date countries with adjusted mortality 
rates close to Brazil are all in relative early stages of vaccination, this caveat does not affect the validity of the 
comparison between them based on updated data.
