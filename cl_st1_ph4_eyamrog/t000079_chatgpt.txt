Sarcopenia and low quality of life (QOL) are prevalent issues among hemodialysis (HD) patients. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the risk of sarcopenia could serve as a predictor of the quality of life in patients undergoing HD.
Methods: The study sample comprised 147 chronic kidney disease patients receiving hemodialysis at a solitary dialysis facility in October 2020. Demographic and clinical information was gathered, with the risk of sarcopenia being assessed through the SARC-F questionnaire. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the Brazilian adaptation of the SF-36 questionnaire. Comparative analyses were conducted on QOL scores between patients at risk of sarcopenia and those without. Additionally, multivariate linear regression was employed to ascertain whether the risk of sarcopenia independently predicted QOL scores.
Results: Among the cohort studied, 62 patients (42.2%) were identified as having a risk of sarcopenia. When comparing the quality of life (QOL) scores between patients with and without the risk of sarcopenia, it was observed that scores in seven dimensions were notably lower among those with the risk of sarcopenia, with the sole exception being the role-emotional dimension. Furthermore, the risk of sarcopenia emerged as an independent predictor for six dimensions of QOL, with the exceptions being role-emotional and mental health.
In conclusion, our study identified the risk of sarcopenia as an independent predictor of Quality of Life (QOL) in Hemodialysis (HD) patients. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at reducing the risk of sarcopenia could potentially enhance the QOL of HD patients.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a significant burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, making it a pressing public health concern. In Brazil, the number of individuals requiring renal replacement therapy exceeds 133,000, with over 90% of them relying on hemodialysis (HD) for treatment. The prevalence and incidence rates of CKD patients per million inhabitants (PMP) stand at 665 and 218, respectively, and are on the rise primarily due to the growing numbers of hypertensive and diabetic individuals, alongside the aging demographic trends within the population.
Sarcopenia is widely recognized as a significant public health concern due to its association with adverse clinical outcomes, including reduced quality of life, increased risk of falls, functional impairment, depression, limited mobility, hospitalization, and higher mortality rates. This condition is characterized by diminished muscle strength, quantity, and quality, leading to compromised physical performance. Sarcopenia can manifest as either an acute or chronic condition and is further categorized as primary, solely linked to aging, or secondary, when other contributing factors are present. Inflammatory processes, sedentary lifestyle, and insufficient energy or protein intake are among the key factors implicated in the development of sarcopenia, all of which may be prevalent in individuals undergoing hemodialysis.
The risk of sarcopenia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is multifactorial and particularly pronounced in advanced stages, especially among those undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Various factors contribute to the development of sarcopenia in CKD patients, including aging, inflammation, uremia, hormonal imbalances, malnutrition, anemia, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disorders, lifestyle changes, and muscle fiber atrophy. Among these factors, inflammation emerges as a primary risk factor for the onset and progression of sarcopenia in this patient population.
Complications associated with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) such as anemia, cardiovascular disease, osteodystrophy, depression, and sarcopenia have been linked to a reduced Quality of Life (QOL) in patients undergoing Hemodialysis (HD). Research indicates that compared to individuals with other chronic conditions such as heart failure, chronic lung disease, arthritis, and cancer, CKD patients on HD exhibit the lowest levels of QOL. In addition to the impact of common symptoms like fatigue, itching, anorexia, pain, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and nausea, CKD patients on HD face significant stressors including strict dietary limitations, sexual dysfunction, time constraints affecting employment, reliance on medical machinery, and heightened mortality rates. Regrettably, many of these factors that contribute to the decline in QOL are beyond modification.
The relationship between sarcopenia and quality of life (QOL) remains inadequately explored within the context of Brazilian patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Given the considerable challenges and absence of consensus regarding strategies to enhance QOL in this patient population, it becomes imperative to identify modifiable factors linked to diminished QOL. Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of muscle mass and function, poses a significant risk to QOL but can be mitigated through established interventions. Consequently, addressing the risk of sarcopenia emerges as a promising avenue for medical interventions aimed at enhancing the QOL of HD patients.
Our objective was to investigate whether the risk of sarcopenia could serve as a predictor of the quality of life (QOL) among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD).
The research was an analytical, cross-sectional, and observational study conducted at a solitary dialysis center situated in Sobral, a city in the northern region of Ceará state. This particular dialysis center serves as a primary facility for individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) from various municipalities, encompassing a vast area of 35,560 km2 with a population density of 37.3 inhabitants per square kilometer.
The research involved a study population of 200 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients receiving Hemodialysis (HD) in October 2020, with a final sample size of 147 patients. Exclusion criteria encompassed individuals under 18 years (n=3), hospitalized patients (n=4), those with advanced neurologic conditions or cognitive deficits hindering questionnaire completion (n=7), individuals with active infections (n=17), and patients on HD for less than 3 months (n=22). All participants were receiving conventional HD treatment (three sessions lasting 4 hours per week) utilizing polysulfone dialyzers with a maximum of 12 reuses. The study protocol and informed consent procedures were ethically approved by the Federal University of Ceará's ethics committee (CAAE 31240420.5.0000.5053).
The demographic data, length of time on dialysis, type of vascular access, and underlying etiology of CKD were extracted from the medical records of the dialysis center. The classification of underlying renal disease was based on clinical criteria rather than histopathology. Economic class categorization followed the guidelines outlined by the Brazilian Association of Research Institutes, which divides economic status into five subgroups ranging from A (best status) to E (worst status), considering factors such as income level, educational attainment of the head of household, and ownership of household appliances. Each patient was assessed for a low, medium, or high risk index based on comorbidity using Khan's comorbidity index, which accounts for age across three classes and nine comorbidities including diabetes, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, obstructive pulmonary disease, systemic collagen disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and visceral malignancy.
The quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the validated Brazilian version of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Questionnaire (SF-36). This questionnaire provides scores ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) across 8 dimensions of QOL pertaining to physical, psychological, and social functioning. These dimensions include physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). PF evaluates the patient's ability to perform daily activities, RP examines the impact of physical health on life, BP assesses pain levels and their effect on normal activities, GH gauges subjective perceptions of present and future health status and resistance to illness, VT measures feelings about energy levels, vitality, and fatigue, SF evaluates the impact of health on social activities, RE assesses the influence of emotional status on daily activities, and MH examines humor, well-being, depression, and anxiety.
In our study, we employed the validated SARC-F questionnaire as a diagnostic tool to assess the risk of sarcopenia. This questionnaire comprises five components, namely strength, assistance with walking, rising from a chair, climbing stairs, and falls, each rated on a scale from 0 to 10, allowing for a maximum of 2 points per component. A score equal to or exceeding 4 indicates the presence of a risk of sarcopenia.
Shapiro's test was utilized to assess the normal distribution of continuous variables, which were presented as mean ± SD or median (min-max) for normal or abnormal distribution, respectively. Categorical variables were represented by absolute numbers and percentages. Statistical comparisons were conducted using Student-t and Mann-Whitney tests for continuous variables with or without normal distribution. Multivariate linear regression was employed to identify independent predictors of QOL scores (dependent variables), with male gender, age, comorbidity index, and risk of sarcopenia considered as independent variables. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value < 0.05. All statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS version 22.0 software package.
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are detailed in Table 1, with 62 patients (42.2%) identified as having a risk of sarcopenia. A comparison of quality of life (QOL) scores between patients with and without the risk of sarcopenia is presented in Table 2, revealing that only the dimension RE showed no significant difference in the comparisons. Through multivariate analysis, it was determined that the presence of a risk of sarcopenia independently predicted scores for six out of eight dimensions of QOL, with the exceptions being RE and MH as outlined in Table 3.
The characteristics of our sample closely resembled those associated with residing in underdeveloped regions: a low average age, belonging to a lower economic class, with only 26.5% falling into the category of having a high comorbidity index, and a prevalence of glomerulonephritis as the primary cause of CKD rather than diabetes. Despite the relatively young age and low comorbidity rates, a significant proportion (42.2%) of patients exhibited a risk of sarcopenia.
Sarcopenia, a condition linked to aging and chronic diseases, is exacerbated by increased catabolism in these circumstances. Patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) experience even higher catabolism, heightening the risk of sarcopenia. Our study revealed that the sarcopenic state correlates with poorer quality of life (QOL) dimensions, particularly in physical aspects, due to heightened physical frailty, fall risks, and increased dependency on others for daily activities. A multicenter study on elderly HD patients demonstrated that sarcopenic individuals exhibited inferior QOL compared to non-sarcopenic counterparts, with sarcopenic patients scoring below 50 on the SF-36 scale. In our cohort of patients with an average age of 55.4 years, we observed a similar trend: sarcopenia was linked to diminished QOL across most dimensions, with the exception of mental dimensions (RE and MH). As anticipated, physical QOL aspects were more impacted in patients at risk of sarcopenia.
A literature review examined six studies on sarcopenia and quality of life (QOL), with five of them utilizing the SF-36 instrument, similar to our study. This review highlights the correlation between sarcopenia and a substantial decrease in QOL. However, it is crucial to analyze specific subgroups, such as women and younger patients, to understand potential variations. One study focused on elderly women and found no significant link between sarcopenia and QOL. Contrary to expectations, our study did not identify male gender as a predictor of lower QOL levels. Similarly, Kull et al. also observed lower RP and VT scores, indicative of physical aspects, in individuals with sarcopenia in a sample of healthy young individuals.
Among the various forms of renal replacement therapy, hemodialysis (HD) stands out as having a significant impact on the quality of life (QOL) of patients. Research indicates that individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing HD experience a lower QOL compared to those on peritoneal dialysis or who have received kidney transplants. While there is a growing interest in addressing the QOL of HD patients, there remains a lack of consensus on effective strategies for improvement, largely due to the presence of non-modifiable factors that negatively influence QOL. Sarcopenia, however, presents itself as a modifiable factor of interest. Various approaches exist to mitigate the risk of sarcopenia in HD patients, including tailored exercise regimens, nutritional interventions, and pharmacological treatments. Prescribed resistance exercises, for instance, can enhance muscle strength and can be incorporated into dialysis sessions. Nutritional supplementation with Polycose and oral branched-chain amino acids shows promise in increasing lean body mass. Additionally, anabolic strategies such as the use of anabolic steroids, growth hormones, and testosterone have proven effective in combating sarcopenia in this patient population.
In our multivariate linear regression analysis, the risk of sarcopenia emerged as a statistically significant predictor for nearly all dimensions of quality of life (QOL), with the exception of the RE and MH dimensions. Among the other variables included in the analysis, age was found to be a predictor solely for the GH dimension, while a higher comorbidity index was associated with lower scores in the PF and VT dimensions.
The notable prevalence of individuals at risk of sarcopenia among a sample of relatively young patients is a significant finding. We firmly believe that the swift administration of a straightforward questionnaire like SARC-F could prove to be a valuable tool in identifying individuals at risk of sarcopenia within dialysis centers. This initial classification of patients with a predisposition to sarcopenia could serve as a crucial first step in suggesting interventions aimed at reducing the impact of sarcopenia and addressing the challenging yet essential goal of enhancing patients' quality of life.
In our study, we identified the risk of sarcopenia as a robust and autonomous predictor of Quality of Life (QOL) in Hemodialysis (HD) patients. Given that interventions exist to mitigate the risk of sarcopenia, we advocate for the implementation of regular screening for sarcopenia risk as a strategy to enhance the QOL of patients undergoing HD treatment.
