Since the onset of the first quarter of 2020, the global community has grappled with the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, stemming from the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Despite the implementation of various measures aimed at curtailing the transmission and management of the disease among the general populace, certain demographics remain particularly vulnerable to contagion and necessitate tailored interventions, including individuals who have undergone total laryngectomy.
The population primarily consists of immunosuppressed elderly individuals with multiple comorbidities, many of whom have a permanent tracheostomy that facilitates the unfiltered and humidified airflow directly into the lower airways. This setup significantly raises the risk of tracheobronchial infections and, consequently, exposes them to the contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and aerosolization.
A Heat and Moisture Exchange (HME) device presents a viable solution to address the susceptibility of total laryngectomized patients to COVID-19. This apparatus comprises a foam sponge infused with calcium chloride, which is positioned over a hermetic seal encircling the tracheal stoma. By enhancing airflow resistance and filtering, heating, and humidifying the air, these filters diminish the necessity for external humidifiers and vaporizers while optimizing lung function. Furthermore, the HME device diminishes coughing, sputum production, and expectoration, thereby reducing the risk of viral transmission through the aerosolization of tracheal secretions.
There are HME devices equipped with specialized bacterial and/or viral filters that feature pores smaller than 0.6 microns, effectively capturing pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. These filters serve as a biological barrier, helping to prevent pulmonary infections. This functionality is particularly crucial in the current landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, given that SARS-CoV-2 particles are estimated to be around 0.12 microns in size.
While the efficacy of heat and moisture exchangers (HME) in preventing COVID-19 remains untested, it is hypothesized that an HME device constructed from electrostatic filtering material, boasting a higher viral filtration rate, would be the most appropriate choice during the ongoing pandemic. It is crucial to acknowledge that the utilization of HME necessitates additional fixation accessories, such as disposable hypoallergenic adhesives or specific silicone tracheostomy cannula. However, the collective cost of these components poses a significant financial burden for the majority of total laryngectomized patients within the Brazilian context of socioeconomic disparity. Furthermore, the absence of a comprehensive national healthcare policy tailored to total laryngectomized patients exacerbates the challenge of accessing pulmonary protection equipment during this critical period of the pandemic.
Several legal provisions provide support for this population, including the SAS/MS Ordinance No. 400 of 11/16/2019, which establishes national guidelines for the care of people with ostomy; Law No. 13,146 of 6/11/2015, which institutes the Statute for Persons with Disabilities; and more recently, Resolution 202/CIB/2019 established by the Secretary of State for Health of Santa Catarina and published on 09/26/2019. This resolution, supported by the Associação de Câncer de Boca e Garganta (Mouth and Throat Cancer Association – ACBG, Brazil), sets the Guidelines for Health Care of Laryngectomized and/or Tracheostomized People and standardizes the distribution of necessary supplies for pulmonary and speech rehabilitation in the state, including HME devices. This pioneering initiative with a legal basis should serve as an example for other states in the federation. Due to challenges in obtaining supplies administratively, some users resort to legal action to ensure their provision. For instance, in 2019, a user in Rio de Janeiro filed a demand against the state government and successfully had their request granted, as per the magistrate's favorable ruling.
The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of tailored management for individuals who have undergone total laryngectomy, while also exposing the shortcomings of public authorities in providing essential support to these individuals. The current recommended approach for this population to mitigate the risk of aerosolization and inhalation of SARS-Cov-2 in community settings involves three key steps: 1) wearing a surgical or cloth mask to cover the nose and mouth; 2) using high collar clothing or a scarf to cover the stoma; and 3) utilizing Heat and Moisture Exchange (HME) devices equipped with specific bacterial and/or viral filters. In cases where access to HME is not feasible, strict adherence to the other preventive measures is advised for total laryngectomy patients. Furthermore, this critical juncture should be leveraged to raise awareness about the unique needs and vulnerabilities of this particular patient group.
