Abstract 
 
The social distance critical to alleviate the spread of COVID-19 is quite insufficient. In order to 
contribute to the literature, "(1) When a rare virus such as COVID-19 appears, when the total 
level of social distance has natural inertia; (2) Open national public statements are essential to 
reduce this inertia and adjust the public's behavior to a new, optimal social distance level. (3) 
When individuals are not adequately informed about optimal social distance levels over time, 
national communication is more effective than local communication. 
Keywords:  COVID-19, Social Distancing, Coordination 
 
INTRODUCTION 
We focused on a model of social removal, motivated by the COVID-19 outbreak, where people value 
both joining the right social distance and complying with other people's social norms. When citizens 
consider these two issues and are unsure of each other's beliefs about the right social distance, 
collective social distancing shows significant inertia. In particular, by following the positive shock 
towards the correct social distance, the total social distances will be well below the social optimum, 
even if the information of the individuals reflects this shock correctly. (Proposition 3). 
Citizens care to comply with social norms. For example, many make a strange shopping in a mask, 
risking disturbing a neighbor by waiting for the next elevator, rejecting an outstretched hand, or 
banning gaming games if other citizens are not doing the same. These concerns create inertia. actions 
of citizens ensure that their common knowledge of past social distance behaviors follows the social 
norms by coordinating the social distance. This inertia is problematic because society will be better off 
coordinating a new, higher social distance. 
 
How can the state improve this situation? Our recommendation 4 shows that public statements about 
the new optimal level of social departure from leading leaders reduce inertia by generating new 
common information that allows people to coordinate their actions around new, more appropriate 
norms. 
 
Should such statements be made public or more specifically? Proposition 5 shows that when optimal 
1 
 
social distance levels have a high correlation over time and individuals are poorly informed, national 
communication is better than local communication, so that previous social distance norms are 
overweight. 
 
This result reflects that the information transmitted publicly creates new common information. 
 
Allcott et al. (2020) examines the perception of risk in the United States and the interaction between 
such externalities. The importance of citizens who sacrificed the interests of Dube and Baicker (2020) 
for greater well-being and Christensen et al. (2020) Examining the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leon 
highlights the importance of trust in local leaders and institutions. 
 
In contrast, our analysis highlights the role of social norms and strategic uncertainty as a source of 
counter-productive inertia in collective social distance. 
  Government results are also very different. While information alone cannot solve the problem of 
standard externalities, clear and consistent public information can significantly increase social distance 
by reducing strategic uncertainty and enabling citizens to coordinate on new norms. 
National networks produce more widespread information, enabling citizens to better coordinate on the 
new social withdrawal norms. 
 
What sorts of decisions might our norms-based model represent in the context of the COVID-19 
crisis? The key features of the model are that: (1) people are uncertain about the right level of social 
distancing and are uncertain about what others believe, (2) the right level of social distancing exhibits 
serial correlation, and (3) there is a desire for conformity with social norms. 
 
An important application of our model concerns social gatherings. The advent of COVID-19 
made it undesirable, from a social welfare perspective, for people to partici- pate in events such 
as St. Patrick’s Day celebrations, spring break trips and parties, or sporting events. However, 
people were uncertain about the threat that COVID-19 posed. Crucially, to the extent that they 
believed others might think that the threat was modest and therefore continue to gather, they too had 
incentives to behave this way. The result was undesirable inertia—people continued past practices in 
ways that harmed social welfare. 
 
Similar arguments hold for social practices such as hand shaking, kissing, and other forms of 
physical social greetings. It is awkward to refuse to shake an offered hand—as a recent presidential 
press briefing illustrated—creating a force for social conformity of the sort we model. The 
uncertainty about others’ views on COVID-19 created unfortunate inertia in physical social 
greetings. 
 
Our model also applies to some professional settings. If employees believe that continu- ing to come to 
the office signals commitment or ambition, then this creates social pressure for employees to continue 
coming to work if their managers or supervisors are. In the face of such pressure, the model suggests, 
there will be inertia that keeps people coming into the office at inefficiently high levels, especially 
during the early days of a viral outbreak1 
 
Finally, the model also helps understand inertia in social distancing and its policy implications, 
not only at the initial outset of a contagious virus, but at any point where 
1In this setting, there could also be congestion externalities that we leave unmodeled—as fewer people start 
going into the office, the risk of being infected in the office goes down 
2 
 
                                                 
there is a sharp change in the appropriate level of social distancing. 
 
We utilize a standard “beauty contest” model in which individuals aim to take actions that match 
an uncertain state of the world (the right action) while remaining close to the average action in 
the population. Subsequent literature explored the welfare consequences of this insight and its 
implications for optimal communication (Morris and Shin 2007; Angeletos and Pavan 2007). This 
framework has been applied to study a wide range of topics from monetary policy (Lorenzoni 2010) to 
leadership in party conferences (Dewan and Myatt 2007), organizations (Bolton et al. 2013), and 
judiciaries (Shadmehr et al. 2019). Our paper provides an application in disease control and public 
health policy. 
 
Our paper is also related to the game theoretic literature on social norms. We adopt Acemoglu and 
Jackson’s (2017) definition of social norms as “the distribution of anticipated payoff-relevant 
behavior” (p. 246). Our model has a unique equilibrium, and social norms in our setting refer to the 
average (social distancing) behavior of the population. When agents are heterogeneously informed, 
the anticipated average behavior depends on the individual’s information. We model people’s 
desire to conform to social norms as a desire to do what is expected of them, as reflected in other 
people’s behavior. The challenge of a global pandemic is that it creates uncertainty about what 
people expect of one another and how people will behave, leading people to lean on past, 
inappropriate, norms of behavior. 
 
In contrast to these papers, agents in our setting are uncertain about the right action and about one 
anothers’ information in a changing world. While Acemoglu and Jackson (2015, 2017) focus on 
patterns of cooperation and compliance, our focus is on inertia and over- reactions to public 
information in a  world  where optimal aggregate  behavior evolves  over time  and  on  the  resulting  
policy  implications.

Model 
 
 
We apply the canonical framework and results discussed in Angeletos and Lian’s (2016) 
comprehensive review of the literature.2   There is a continuum of citizens indexed by i ∈ 
 
[0, 1], interacting over time, indexed by t = 0, 1, . . .. In each period t, each citizen must take an 
action ait ∈ R, which captures the degree of social distancing. A higher action 
corresponds to a higher level of social distancing. Absent concerns for conformity, the right action for 
each citizen is θt. But, in each period, each citizen cares about targeting this right action and 
about conforming to the average action that others take in that period, 
At = [ ait di. This generates a complementarity: if a citizen believes that others will do 
little social distancing, this raises that citizen’s incentive also to do less social distancing. 
This captures, among other things, social pressure and the cost of deviating from the norms of behavior 
in the society. In particular, a citizen’s payoff in period t is: 
−(1 − α)(ait − θt)2 − α(ait − At)2, 
(1) 
where α ∈ (0, 1) is the citizens’ relative weight on conformity. 
The right action, θt, follows a random walk:  θt  = θt−1 + ut, where ut  ∼ iidN (0, σu). Citizens 
do not observe θt, but each citizen observes a signal of the right action: xit = θt +Eit, 
where Eit  ∼ iidN (0, σE).   Throughout, we assume that the noise and fundamentals are 
independent from each other in the standard manner. 
 
Citizen i observes xit in period t, and θt−1 becomes public in period t. 
 
Citizens discount 
future payoffs by δ, and each citizen maximizes the expected sum of discounted period 
payoffs.

Analysis 
 
 
We will think of the normative goal as each individual choosing the right level of aggregate social 
distancing, ait  = θt, so that the aggregate level of social distancing is also right, 
At = [ aitdi = θt. This would be the objective of a policy maker who aggregates individual 
payoffs, but puts no weight on social conformity (i.e., sets α = 0).4  In light of this, we say 
 
that any reduction in the expected quadratic distance between individual actions and the right 
action, E[[ (ait − θt)2di], is a normative improvement. 
 
Our first result concerns the optimal level of social distancing under this normative crite- rion. 
Because the right action is uncertain, the normatively optimal individual actions—i.e., 
 
2This literature builds on the seminal work of Morris and Shin (2002). 
3Even if θt 
1 is not observed in the current period, citizens will infer it in equilibrium if 
they observe

the last period’s aggregate behavior At−1. 
4For our normative standard to coincide with the utilitarian social welfare, one can add a term α [ 
(ajt − 
At)2dj to citizen payoffs in equation (1), so that citizens want the divergence of their own 
behavior from 
the average behavior to be close to the average divergence in the population. 
the actions that minimize E[[ (ait − θt)2di]—involve citizens choosing their best estimate 
of the right action, a  = E[θ x , θ 
] = βx  + (1 
β)θ 
, where β = 
σ2 . 
u 
 
Proposition 1 (Normative Benchmark) If citizens did not care about conformity (α = 
2 
0), the aggregate action would be: At = θt + βut, where β = 
σu      . 
u+σ  
 
We now analyze how citizens actually behave, given their concern for taking the right action and for 
social conformity. Because there is a continuum of citizens, a citizen’s action does not affect the 
aggregate outcome, either in the current or in future periods. Thus, the only link between periods is 
information. From equation (1), citizen i chooses the following degree of social distancing: 
 
ait = (1 − α)Eit[θt] + α Eit[At], 
(2) 
where Eit[·] is the expectation of i in period t given his information. 
Define E¯  h recursively as follows. 
 
E¯  0[X] = X, E¯  1[X] = E¯  [E¯  0[X]] = [ Ei[X]di, E¯  h[X] = 
E¯  [E¯  h−1[X]] = [ Ei[E¯  h−1[X]]di. That 
is, 
E¯  1[X] is the average expectation of the random 
variable X in the population; 
E¯  2[X] is the average expectation in the population about 
the average expectation in the population, and so on. Proposition 2 shows that the ag- gregate 
social distancing in the population depends on all such higher order expectations in the population. 
The proof comes from iterating on equation (2). (All proofs are in the appendix.) 
 
 
Proposition 2 (Higher Order Beliefs in Aggregate Action) The aggregate action in each 
period depends on all average higher order beliefs in the population about the right action, with 
lower weights on higher orders:

φ is decreasing in α, with limα→0 φ(α) = β and limα→1 φ(α) = 0. 
 
Citizens have common knowledge that, on average, the right 
action today is the right action yesterday (i.e., θt  ∼ N (θt−1, σu)) and hence over-weight this 
fact.  As a result, today’s aggregate action is biased in the direction of yesterday’s right 
action. As a consequence, following a large positive shock, like COVID-19, to the right amount 
of social distancing, the aggregate action will be lower than the right action.5 
 
Now, suppose in each period t, in addition to the their private signals xit, citizens also receive a 
public signal pt = θt + ηt, with ηt ∼ iidN (0, ση ). Such a public signal might be 
the result of information conveyed by the government. Proposition 2 and equation (4) still hold 
because they do not depend on the details of available information. However, the presence of 
public signals changes the degree of inertia in aggregate social distancing. 
 
 
Proposition 4 (Public Announcements) 
 
 
1. 
Public signals reduce inertia. Averaging over the public signal noise, the expected 
aggregate social distancing is: E[At|θt−1, ut] = θt−1 + φput, where φp > φ. 
 
2. 
The amount of inertia is decreasing in the clarity of the public signal. That is, φp is 
monotone decreasing in ση , limση →∞ φp(ση ) = φ, and limση →0 φp(ση ) = 1. 
 
3. 
Improving  the  clarity  of  the  public  signal  causes  a  normative  improvement  (i.e., 
E[[ (ait − θt)2di] is increasing in ση ) if: (i) α ≤ 1/2 or (ii) ση is sufficiently small. 
 
Proposition 4 shows that, following a shock, an informed leader can send a public signal that helps set 
public expectations about the aggregate right action, thereby reducing inertia in social distancing 
driven by the desire to conform. The clearer that message (i.e., the lower ση ), the more this will 
reduce inertia. 
 
Such public messages are a normative improvement if people don’t put too much weight on conformity 
(α ≤ 1/2) or the public signal is sufficiently informative (ση   small).  Why 
these conditions? Because citizens value conformity, they put excessive weight on all pub- lic signals 
relative to a Bayesian individual who only cares about choosing an action that reflects the best 
estimate of θt (this was the same logic that drove inertia in the first place). Because this distortion is 
smaller when α is smaller, new public information about the optimal social distancing is always 
beneficial when citizens put relatively less weight on 
conformity (α ≤ 1/2). In the other extreme, when citizens almost only care about confor- mity (α ≈ 
1), they put almost no weight on their private signals. Now, although citizens 
over-weight new public information (pt), this over-reaction to the new public information helps 
 
it 
counter-act their over-reaction to past experience (that θt ∼ (θt−1, σu)), and the over- all effect is 
again beneficial. In between, when α ∈ (1/2, 1), these effects compete and the 
 
5The over-weighting of public information is a key insight of Morris and Shin (2002) who 
showed that public announcements can be damaging to welfare, particularly, in financial settings. 
 
overall effect of raising the precision of new public information may be negative unless it is 
sufficiently informative (ση small) to offset the over-reaction.6 
 
For social distancing in the presence of a dangerous infectious disease, we believe the relevant 
parameter space is α ≤ 1/2. It is unlikely that people care so much about confor- 
mity that over-reaction to new public information trumps its value. Hence, for cases like COVID-
19, Proposition 4 suggests that clear and consistent public messages from a leader are socially 
beneficial. 
 
Given the overreaction by citizens to public messages described above, one may wonder whether there is 
a better way for the government to deliver information. Would it be better for citizens to receive the 
same level of information, but privately rather than publicly? For instance, perhaps employers or 
local governments could provide private information to citizens, rather than them all observing the 
same public information in a presidential speech or press conference. 
 
To consider this possibility, contrast the public signal case with a setting where, instead 
of receiving private and public signals xit ∼ N (θt, σ2) and pt ∼ N (θt, σ2), citizens receive

Proposition 5  The setting with the combination of private and public signals (xit, pt) is 
a normative improvement over the setting with more precise private signals xi 
when σu  is 
 
sufficiently small or σE  is sufficiently large. 
 
 
When citizens believe the past is highly informative about the present (σu small) or that they are 
privately poorly-informed (σE large), citizens put too much weight on their past experience. In 
such circumstances, it is better for the government to communicate publicly rather than privately. 
Citizens over-react to the government’s public messages. But that will help to counter-act their 
over-reaction to their past experience. By contrast, when citizens believe the past is relatively 
uninformative (σu large) or that they are privately well-informed (σE small), the government 
should communicate privately. 
 
In the context of social distancing in the wake of a new and rare infectious disease, individuals’ 
information is typically very noisy (σE is large) and the appropriate level of social distancing is 
very sticky (σu is low, the disease is a very unusual shock). As such, for social distancing in the 
wake of COVID-19, clear and consistent public statements by a national leader are more effective 
than statements by local governments or employers, not because the national government is more 
informed, but because clear national statements generate over-reaction that is beneficial to correct the 
inertia created by the over-weighting of past habits and social norms. 
 
6Equation (16) in the proof of Proposition 4 shows the necessary and sufficient conditions for 
when reducing ση is a normative improvement.

Thus, reducing the noise in the public signal (less σ2) raises φp.

Thus, if σ2 + (1 − α)(1 − 2α)σ2

Proof of Proposition 5: To obtain E[[ (ait −θt)2di] with only xi  , first let ση  → ∞ in (15),

Now, subtracting (15) from (17) yields:

As expected, limα→0 ∆ = 0, because only the amount information matter; and limα→1 ∆ > 0, because then 
citizens put a lot of weight of the pre-existing public information from the previous period, which need to be 
countered by new public information about θt. Moreover, for any α > 0, the setting with both public and 
private signals (xit, pt) is a normative improvement over the setting with only private signals (xi ) if and 
only if ∆ > 0, i.e., if 
and only if
