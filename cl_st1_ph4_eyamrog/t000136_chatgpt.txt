This research article examines governance as a set of dimensions measured by governance factors that impact donations with donor restrictions received by environmental Nonprofit Organizations (NPO) in Brazil, from the perspective of agency theory. Data was gathered through a survey with a random sample of 108 observations. Governance dimensions were identified using Multiple Correspondence Analysis, and through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, it was determined whether governance influenced donations. The analysis revealed a positive impact of governance on donations, with no moderation effect from public certifications provided to NPOs in Brazil. These results suggest that governance plays a crucial role in facilitating NPOs' access to the donations market, while public certifications do not significantly enhance donation levels. These findings hold significance for practitioners and contribute to the ongoing discourse on public policies for the third sector in less regulated environments.
Governance is a recurring theme in research on Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs). Broadly speaking, governance within the third sector encompasses a range of internal and external mechanisms aimed at curbing the misuse of resources and guaranteeing that NPOs fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities. Additionally, these mechanisms are intended to enhance the alignment of executives' objectives with those of the NPO and its stakeholders (Harris et al., 2015).
The discussion typically commences with the hypothesis that, under equal circumstances, non-profit organizations (NPOs) with better governance structures tend to attract more donations. Previous studies have delved into the potential impact of specific governance factors, like board size, or governance dimensions, such as disclosure, which are often gauged through sets of observable variables like annual reports. For instance, Harris et al. (2015) utilized factor analysis to pinpoint seven governance dimensions (board, management, policies, access, audit, executive compensation, and minutes) and demonstrated a positive correlation between donations, government grants, and six of these dimensions (with minutes showing no discernible effect).
Previous research has employed diverse measures to operationalize governance. For instance, Kitching (2009) utilized a singular indicator, while Yetman and Yetman (2012) incorporated multiple indicators concurrently, and Harris et al. (2015) formulated measures for governance dimensions. Although these measurement strategies align with the respective research questions and designs, a standard approach for assessing governance as a latent variable (comprising governance dimensions gauged by governance factors) remains lacking. Essentially, past studies have constructed unidimensional factors and multidimensional constructs for governance dimensions, examining their influence on donations.
Governance is a multifaceted concept, prompting the consideration of treating it as a construct due to its complexity. By viewing governance as a latent variable, it can more accurately capture the theoretical foundations that underlie its conceptualization, as suggested by Larcker et al. (2007) and Harris et al. (2015). Consequently, in the context of this study, governance is regarded as a second-order construct comprising a series of governance dimensions (first-order constructs) that are assessed through governance factors (manifest variables).
Previous studies have made significant contributions to understanding the influence of governance on donations by examining various factors or dimensions of governance. However, these studies have not fully explored the potential impact of governance as a latent variable, encompassing a set of dimensions, on donations received by Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs). While some dimensions of governance have been found to affect donations, others do not, as evidenced by Harris et al. (2015) who identified a positive association between six out of seven governance dimensions and donations. These findings have helped clarify the relationship between governance dimensions and donations, but the impact of governance as a latent variable remains unexplored. Therefore, our central research question aims to investigate whether governance, conceptualized as a second-order construct, influences donor-constrained donations.
In this study, we analyzed environmental non-profit organizations (NPOs) in Brazil through the lens of agency theory, focusing on those that had received grants from sponsors for designated projects. It is worth noting that empirical investigations involving NPOs in environments characterized by limited regulation and challenges in obtaining governance-related information, such as the context in Brazil, are scarce. For instance, Hasnan et al. (2016) highlighted this scarcity in their research.
The ambiance within which Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs) operate can significantly influence their governance practices, primarily due to the regulatory role played by the State. This external control environment is established through the formulation and implementation of laws, as highlighted by Desai and Yetman (2015). Beyond the mere existence of these laws, the rigor with which they are enforced also plays a crucial role. Hence, the level of law enforcement, whether stringent or lenient, can have a direct impact on the governance mechanisms within NPOs, as noted by Yetman and Yetman (2012). Our research makes a unique contribution by conceptualizing governance as a second-order construct, recognizing the intricate layers of governance dimensions. This approach allows us to assess the influence of governance practices on donation patterns within an environment characterized by low regulatory oversight and limited information accessibility.
In this study, we have embraced the agency theory perspective as our primary theoretical framework. The foundation of our explanation draws from the classical approach put forth by Jensen and Meckling (1976), which has served as a cornerstone for various empirical studies and the development of new theoretical models, as evidenced by works such as those by Eisenhardt (1989) and Glaeser (2003).
In this study, we have applied the assumptions and concepts of agency theory to the nonprofit sector, specifically examining the conflicts that arise between principals and agents. Our focus is on the agency relationship that emerges when a donor (the principal) hires a nonprofit organization (the agent) to manage and transfer donations with specific restrictions. This analysis sheds light on the dynamics of accountability and decision-making within the context of nonprofit management, highlighting the complexities inherent in these relationships.
In brief, it is posited that governance practices facilitate Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs) in gaining better access to the donations market, with governance having a positive impact on NPO donations as indicated by Harris et al. (2015). This assertion is underpinned by the notion that governance helps alleviate the agency problem arising from the contractual dynamics between donors (principals) and NPOs (agents) during the donation process, a concept originally proposed by Jensen and Meckling (1976).
Pauly and Redisch (1973) were among the pioneering authors who empirically investigated governance within non-profit organizations, focusing specifically on the context of non-profit hospitals. In a similar vein, Glaeser (2003) emerged as a trailblazer by proposing unique utility functions, which are essentially mathematical models, tailored to various actors considered as principals within the agency relationship.
Agency theory posits that governance encompasses a series of internal and external mechanisms designed to address the agency problem within organizations. This issue arises from the division between ownership and management, as well as control and management (Fama and Jensen, 1983; Jensen, 1993).
Agency theory is a framework that delves into the conflicts between principal and agent, a concept we explore in our study within the context of the third sector. This approach has been similarly adopted by other researchers such as Ho & Huang (2017), Blevins, Ragozzino & Eckardt (2020), and Balsam, Harris & Saxton (2020). Specifically, we focus on the agency relationship that emerges when a donor organization (principal) hires an NPO (agent) for the purpose of transferring donations with specific restrictions. Governance mechanisms play a crucial role in mitigating the potential misuse of NPO resources and in aligning the interests of executives with those of the organization and its stakeholders. Consequently, insights into governance practices can aid donors in making informed decisions by enabling them to evaluate how effectively their contributions will be utilized. Therefore, our central hypothesis revolves around:
Improved: The study demonstrates a positive correlation between enhanced governance practices and donations with donor restrictions to nonprofit organizations.
This hypothesis is based on the premise that governance serves to alleviate agency problems within the contractual relationship between the principal (donor) and agent (NPO) by implementing mechanisms that reduce various adverse effects. These effects include information asymmetry, differing utility functions (motivation and goals), varying levels of risk aversion, rational behavior by the agent, differing planning horizons, and the absence of a perfect contract (Lacruz, 2020). Consequently, governance provides assurance to donors that their interests will be prioritized in the allocation of resources to the NPO.
To support this hypothesis, evidence suggests that institutional donors hold a favorable perception of well-managed NPOs (Harris et al., 2015). However, there are also reasons to expect that governance may not significantly influence donors' decisions. Donors, in general, can directly monitor an organization's performance through the projects they support (Lacruz et al., 2019) or may prioritize social status (Bekkers and Wiepking, 2011), making them less likely to consider information about NPO governance in their donation decisions. In the Brazilian context, unlike North American and European contexts, donors may lack available information on NPO governance, leading them to consider other factors in their decision-making processes (Lee, 2016).
In settings lacking a mandatory disclosure framework for Nonprofit Organization (NPO) governance information, donors can potentially gain access to such details by incorporating governance-related criteria in their project funding solicitations (Lacruz et al., 2019) or by relying on voluntary disclosures made by the NPOs themselves.
It was observed that Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) in Brazil have the opportunity to obtain public certifications such as OSCIP (Civil Society Organization of Public Interest), which not only provide benefits to the organizations and their donors but also impose additional obligations, such as the mandatory audit of financial statements outlined in the NPO's statute. Furthermore, a considerable portion of NPOs that have established partnerships with the Brazilian Government have been granted certifications, as evidenced by the collaboration between FGV Projetos and the Secretaria-Geral da Presidência da República in 2014. Based on these observations, we formulated the second hypothesis:
The certification of H2 NPOs serves as a moderating factor in the relationship between Governance and Donations, particularly in cases involving donor restrictions, resulting in a positive influence.
This hypothesis posits that the political, legal, and regulatory system (Jensen, 1993) operated by the State plays a crucial role in enabling Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs) to fulfill their social function and maintain a favorable reputation. Consequently, donors are more inclined to allocate resources to NPOs with such certifications due to the additional requirements involved in obtaining them. NPO funding is inherently unstable, relying heavily on external donors (Verbruggen et al., 2011), which underscores the importance of seeking certification as a marker of effective management to present to donors, thereby enhancing their image and garnering recognition. Research by Feng et al. (2016) and Desai and Yetman (2015) has demonstrated that certifications and legal requirements are linked to increased donations. Conversely, Lee (2016) suggests that state regulations do not significantly influence NPOs' adoption of good governance policies, indicating that reporting and registration requirements generally have minimal impact on NPOs' governance practices. The subsequent section will outline the methodological procedures employed in this study.
This section outlines the methodological procedures employed to examine the correlation between governance and donations.
We selected environmental non-profit organizations (NPOs) operating in Brazil as the units of analysis for this study. By focusing on a specific sector and geographic region, we aimed to ensure consistency among the selected NPOs. This operational approach contributes to the homogeneity of the units under analysis. Additionally, the emphasis on the social impact promoted by environmental NPOs further justifies this choice.
With a significance level of 0.05, a statistical power of 0.8, an effect size of 0.35, and six predictors, the minimum required sample size was determined to be 46 observations. To account for the moderation evaluation conducted through multigroup analysis involving two groups, we adjusted the minimum sample size to 92 observations, or two groups of 46. Subsequently, a sampling plan was developed and detailed in Table 1.
The sample was constructed using a simple random sampling method, drawing from the list of Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) registered in the National Register of Environmental Entities in Brazil (CNEA).
Data was gathered through a documentary survey of Financial Statements, Annual Reports of Activities, and Statutes, which were sourced from the websites of Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) or retrieved from the repository "Map of Civil Society Organizations." In cases where direct access to the documents was not feasible, we reached out to the NPOs via telephone and email. For those instances, we relied on the records available at the Brazilian National Environment Council (CONAMA).
Data were gathered in the initial two months of 2017, pertaining to the fiscal year of 2015, to mitigate potential biases stemming from unavailable information. Given that the governing entity releases all pertinent documents for a particular year in the following year, we opted to steer clear of the possibility of incomplete data by focusing on the 2015 fiscal year rather than the years 2016 or 2017.
This study sought to examine the correlation between the governance structure of Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs) and donations. Specifically, donations with donor restrictions were considered as the endogenous variable in this analysis.
Non-profit organizations (NPOs) typically advance their initiatives through projects, as highlighted by Diallo and Thuillier (2004). In order to execute these projects aligned with their institutional mission, NPOs secure funding by submitting proposals to both national and international entities. The most recent edition of the yearbook "Environmental Management Analysis 2013/2014" (Análise Gestão Editorial, 2015) reveals that a significant 97% of the financial resources for environmental NPOs in Brazil stem from donations provided by partners, national entities, and international organizations. Consequently, the contribution from other revenue streams, such as income generated from services rendered and the sale of goods, remains minimal.
In this study, we operationalized governance as an explanatory factor by utilizing a set of governance factors as proxies, drawing on the work of previous authors such as Bromley and Orchard (2016) and Feng et al. (2016).
To assess the potential moderating effect of NPO certification on the correlation between governance and donations, we incorporated the moderator variable of public certifications granted to NPOs by the Federal Government of Brazil.
Additionally, our study delved into the necessity of incorporating the control variable 'NPO age' within the model, under the assumption that non-profit organizations require time to function effectively and establish governance practices (Saxton, Neely & Guo, 2014).
Unfortunately, we were unable to incorporate the size of non-profit organizations (NPOs) as a co-variable due to the assertion that larger NPOs typically possess greater resources for the implementation of governance practices (Feng et al., 2016; Haski-Leventhal and Foot, 2016). The operationalization of the variables is presented in Table 2.
In order to explore the connections between latent variables, we opted to utilize Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Given that the variables associated with manifest variables are qualitative and assume dichotomous values, PLS-SEM is deemed unsuitable for measuring constructs in such circumstances (Hair et al., 2016). Therefore, we first performed Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to uncover the underlying governance structure within the Non-Profit Organization (NPO) being studied.
In our research, we employed the dimensions identified through MCA as constructs to delineate the structural model. Similar to the approach taken with Donations, which is a single-item construct, we utilized the standardized score of the cumulative observations of variables within each dimension as the value for the observations.
In examining the potential moderator effect (H2), given the dichotomous nature of the data (zero and one), we conducted a multigroup analysis, following the recommendations of Hair et al. (2016) and Sanchez (2013).
In our data processing procedures, we employed various software packages for different analyses. Specifically, we utilized R (R Core Team, 2017) and psych for correlation analysis, FactoMineR and nFactors for Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and plspm for Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM).
Prior to commencing the extraction procedures for the measures, we provide an overview of the sample's characteristics concerning donations and the age of the non-profit organization (see Table 3).
A notable disparity exists between the donations with restrictions and the age of non-profit organizations (NPOs) in the sample, a phenomenon that was anticipated due to the diverse nature of NPOs in Brazil (Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas Aplicadas, 2018).
To ascertain the inherent governance structure within Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs), a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was carried out. Through the application of scree plot criteria and parallel analysis, five dimensions were selected, collectively explaining 74% of the variance in the variables.
In further analysis of the discrimination measures of the variables, it was determined that an additional sixth dimension needed to be included due to the lack of discrimination measures for three dimensions exceeding their inertia. With the incorporation of this sixth dimension, the total variance explained by the model increased to 78%, ensuring that at least one discrimination measure surpassed the inertia of its respective dimension. This adjustment significantly enhanced the overall fit of the model.
In light of the theoretical framework established for each dimension, we opted to consolidate certain variables with the dimensions where they exhibited stronger discrimination measures. While two variables were linked to dimensions where their discrimination measures were not the most pronounced, they still outperformed the inertia of the respective dimension they were affiliated with.
In this study, we organized the foundational governance framework based on specific dimensions, as illustrated in Table 4.
It is understood that Governance encompasses various dimensions, consisting of incentive and control mechanisms, aimed at alleviating the agency problem that emerges from the contractual bond between principal and agent, ultimately reducing agency costs (Jensen and Meckling, 1976).
Therefore, within this theoretical framework, we posited that governance functions as a higher-level abstraction that functions across various dimensions. Harris et al. (2015) and other scholars have identified theoretical attributes that could potentially influence governance, treating them as latent variables with reflective characteristics. Consequently, in this study, we viewed the observable variables (proxies) as indicators that mirror the underlying theoretical constructs.
Operationally, governance can be understood as a second-order construct, as evidenced by the dimensions identified through MCA: Board, Management, Fiscal Council, Transparency, Accountability, and Independent Audit. These dimensions, in turn, consist of governance mechanisms that are rooted in the theoretical framework underpinning the study.
The Board serves as the governing body responsible for determining the strategic direction of the NPO. Essentially, it is tasked with setting guidelines that underpin the organization's operations and business, with its primary role being to bridge the gap between the mission of the NPO and its management practices, as outlined by Fama and Jensen (1983), Jensen (1993), and Jensen and Meckling (1995). Functionally, the concept of the Board encompasses components that pertain to its structural elements (such as election, mandate, independence, and committees) and responsibilities (including the approval of the CEO's compensation and the Annual Report).
One plausible rationale for linking the Board with governance lies in donors' perception of its significance as a crucial entity in delineating control from management (Fama and Jensen, 1983). The Board is tasked with supervising management activities, thereby mitigating the risk of the agent acting in a manner contrary to the interests of the principal.
In this study, the Board does not encompass deliverables resulting from its agents' monitoring actions or agents' behaviors that are not detrimental to the principal, as outlined by Jensen and Meckling (1976) and Harris et al. (2015). These aspects fall under the Management dimension, which pertains to the elements directing the activities of the executive team, the Board, the Fiscal Council, and the General Assembly or the Board of Trustees, including Corporate Identity, Annual Activity Plan, Codes, and Policies.
The existence of formal policies, in a broad context, has the potential to motivate employees to confidentially report unethical behavior, steer clear of conflicts of interest (such as a code of conduct or anti-corruption policy), and act as a framework for management practices. By enhancing an NPO's governance through the mitigation of information asymmetry, these policies can bolster donors' trust that their contributions are furthering the NPO's overarching mission.
The Fiscal Council serves as the supervisory body overseeing the accounting and financial management of non-profit organizations, encompassing elements such as its election, mandate, and responsibilities, including the evaluation of financial statements. This distinguishes it from the Board, which primarily focuses on upholding the objectives of the NPO. The Fiscal Council's role involves monitoring administrative actions and offering assessments on the organization's financial reports (Lamb, 2002). A properly established Fiscal Council can serve as an extra safeguard for the interests of the principal.
Transparency, as defined in this study, aligns closely with the OECD disclosure principle (2004) and pertains to the public dissemination of pertinent information. Within the scope of our research, transparency entailed the disclosure of information via online platforms such as websites and fan pages, encompassing details on financial statements (whether audited or non-audited), the Annual Report, and the professional credentials of the non-profit organization's team, including both executive and board members.
Accountability, akin to the principle outlined by the OECD (2004), entails an administrative entity that answers to a superior body. In this context, it pertains to the evaluation, conducted by the General Assembly or Board of Trustees, of the Annual Report submitted by the NPO's chief executive. Additionally, it encompasses the obligation to report to donors by providing them with the Annual Report.
Higher authorities and donors exert control by consistently receiving follow-up information from NPO executives, who inform them about the proper utilization of resources.
In terms of first-order constructs pertaining to Governance, Audit stands out as a singular item construct, involving the examination of an organization's financial statements by an independent audit firm. This external entity provides an assessment on the financial statements of a Non-Profit Organization (NPO), determining if they are free from significant errors and comply with prevailing regulations and norms (Verbruggen et al., 2015).
The audit report serves as a gauge of an NPO's reputation (Watts and Zimmerman, 1978) while also offering an external perspective, ultimately lowering agency costs (Harris et al., 2015; Watts and Zimmerman, 1978). Consequently, donors are more assured of the dependability of the NPO's financial and accounting data, feeling secure in the safeguarding of their contributed resources.
In our subsequent analysis, we explored the necessity of incorporating the variable 'NPO age' into the model, under the assumption that non-profit organizations require time to establish operations and implement governance practices (e.g., Haski-Leventhal and Foot, 2016). However, as we found no statistically significant correlation between age and governance, as measured by the cumulative scores of the identified dimensions in MCA (r = 0.093; p-value = 0.339), we opted not to include this variable in the model.
The variable Donations, the primary focus of this study, was operationalized based on the amount of donations with donor restrictions as reported in the Financial Statements. Furthermore, the construct 'NPO Certification' was represented by public certifications such as OS (Social Organizations), OSCIP, or a CEBAS certificate provided to NPOs in Brazil. It was hypothesized that these certifications, some of which are linked to governance mechanisms like the statutory provision of independent audits or the requirement of a superior deliberation body, would positively moderate the relationship between Governance and Donations by increasing the list of obligations. It was assumed that these public certifications for NPOs would be akin to quality standards such as ISO. Just as companies traditionally seek certification to gain a competitive edge (Rao, 1994), many NPOs are also embracing certification practices to enhance their competitive standing in the donations market (Slatten, 2011).
The development of the governance construct has been a significant contribution to the agency theory approach concerning relationships within the third sector. Yetman and Yetman (2012) introduced measures for governance, with subsequent studies focusing on specific dimensions such as the Board (e.g., Harrison and Murray, 2015), Disclosure (e.g., Blouin et al., 2018), and Accountability (e.g., Tacon et al., 2017). These studies typically analyzed the impact of these indicators on donation measures rather than the construct itself (e.g., Hasnan et al., 2016). Fewer studies have explored a broader range of indicators for the governance construct (e.g., Blouin et al., 2018), and even fewer have delved into the effects of these constructs on donation measures (e.g., Harris et al., 2015). The fundamental premise of agency theory lies in the presence of an agency problem stemming from the contractual relationship between principal and agent (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Governance, from this perspective, encompasses a series of internal and external mechanisms designed to alleviate the agency problem (Jensen, 1993).
In this study, the governance construct was limited to internal mechanisms, while external mechanisms such as the Market of Products and Factors and the Political, Legal and Regulatory System were utilized to define the scope of empirical investigation, akin to a control variable. The primary focus of this research lies on the Donations Market, specifically examining the influence of Governance on donations with donor restrictions. Additionally, a specific aspect related to the political, legal, and regulatory system (NPO Certification) was employed to assess a potential moderating effect on the correlation between Governance and Donations. Consequently, we delved into a range of governance dimensions in our analysis.
The validation of the structural model was carried out using the plspm package, where we assessed the statistical significance (α = 0.05) and relevance of path coefficients through the bootstrapping procedure. Additionally, the coefficient of determination (R2) was evaluated as a measure of the model's accuracy.
In alignment with Sarstedt, Ringle, Cheah, Ting, Moisescu & Radomir (2020) and Schamberger, Schuberth, Henseler & Dijkstra (2020), a further analysis was conducted to ensure the integrity of the data in this study. The purpose was to confirm the absence of outliers that could potentially skew the results of structural equation models (Cook’s distance), verify the linearity of the model relationships (Linktest), and ascertain the absence of bias due to omitted constructs (RESET for omitted variables). Initially, the model was estimated to facilitate these tests, utilizing the resulting construct scores as input. The analysis revealed no outliers (D < 1), indicating the robustness of the linear effects (p-value = 0.09) and the absence of bias from omitted variables (p-value = 0.31).
Secondly, as outlined by Sarstedt, Hair, Cheah, Becker & Ringle (2019), the evaluation of the measurement model involves an examination of the higher-order construct's structure, focusing on the interplay between the higher-order component and its lower-order components. This assessment encompasses key criteria such as unidimensionality, where indicators include Cronbach’s alpha falling within the range of 0.7 to 0.9, Dillon-Goldstein’s rho within 0.7 to 0.9, and the predominance of the first eigenvalue. Additionally, considerations for convergent validity involve ensuring that outer loadings exceed 0.7 and the average variance extracted surpasses 0.5. Discriminant validity, on the other hand, necessitates that outer loadings on a construct are higher than all cross loadings with other constructs, and that the square root of the average variance extracted for each construct exceeds its highest correlation with any other construct, as per the Fornell-Larcker criterion.
Figure 2 illustrates the significant direct relationships within the structural model, resulting in a positive impact as indicated by the positive path coefficients. In the second-order hierarchical model, it is evident that the Fiscal Council addresses Governance with less emphasis, reflected in a path coefficient of 0.425. Governance is consistently represented in other dimensions with coefficients ranging from 0.631 to 0.727. This discrepancy could be attributed to the non-mandatory nature of the Fiscal Council within the legal framework of the sampled NPO (Brazilian NPO) for both NPOs and companies.
In Figure 2, it is evident that Governance has a statistically significant impact on Donations, as indicated by a path coefficient of 0.713.
This finding bolsters the foundation of agency theory, which served as the basis and motivation for this study, by demonstrating that Governance (the presence of governance mechanisms) has a positive impact on Donations. This aligns with the findings of Singh and Indgdal (2007), who outlined optimal practices for NPO donors in Nepal and highlighted the significance of NPO governance practices in donor decision-making processes. Consequently, effective governance practices enable NPOs to access the donations market more easily, leading to enhanced operational efficiency and effectiveness (Greiling and Stötzer, 2015). This, in turn, enhances the organization's reputation within the product and factor markets, reduces information asymmetry, and minimizes agency costs, thereby ensuring that agents allocate resources in alignment with the principal's interests, ultimately mitigating agency problems.
The lack of effective governance practices within non-profit organizations can potentially deter donors from contributing. Fisman and Hubbard (2005) argue that inadequate governance can result in subpar management oversight, consequently leading to increased agency costs. In Figure 2, the R2 values of each endogenous latent variable are depicted, serving as a metric for the model's precision. Notably, the R2 value of the first-order reflective construct's latent variable signifies its correlation with the second-order construct's latent variable, thus warranting analysis as it influences paths within the structural model.
The study revealed significant R2 values, particularly when considering the variables not included in the model. An R2 of 0.508 suggests that the established relationships account for 51% of the variance in Donations, indicating a reasonable adjustment for the model's economic nature. Following the classification by Sanchez (2013), R2 values below 0.2, between 0.2 and 0.5, and above 0.5 signify low, moderate, and high explanatory power, respectively. As per Wetzels et al. (2009), in reflective-reflective models, first-order constructs mirror the second-order constructs, implying that R2 values of the latent variables in the first-order reflective constructs reflect their alignment with the second-order constructs. The R2 of the latent variable in the first-order reflective construct indicates its susceptibility to the variance of the second-order construct's latent variables. In line with Wetzels et al. (2009), it is noteworthy that within the Governance construct, the sub-dimension most reflective is Management, with an R2 of 0.528, while the Fiscal Council sub-dimension achieved an R2 of 0.181.
To assess the potential moderating influence of NPO Certification on the correlation between Governance and Donations, a multigroup analysis was carried out, comprising 54 observations for each group.
Contrary to initial expectations, our findings indicate that NPO Certification did not act as a moderator in the relationship between Governance and Donations. Specifically, we did not find support for the hypothesis suggesting that NPO Certification, particularly with at least one Brazilian Federal Government certification, would enhance the association between Governance and Donations (p-value = 0.1461).
This finding contradicts Feng, Neely, and Slatten's (2016) research, which indicated that the certification Standards for Excellence® led to an increase in donations compared to a control group of NPOs without the certification. However, it is important to note that this certification is issued by the Maryland Association of Nonprofit Organizations and has more stringent requirements for obtaining and maintaining it compared to other certifications examined in this study (OS, OSCIP, and CEBAS). These results do not align with Desai and Yetman's (2015) findings, which suggested that the legal and reporting obligations imposed on NPOs influenced the relationship between changes in charitable spending and program revenues. The study supports the idea that state regulations, particularly those involving certification requirements, can assist NPOs in fulfilling their social responsibilities. Conversely, Lee's (2016) research, utilizing data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics, indicates that state regulations do not impact the adoption of good governance practices by NPOs. NPOs operating in states with reporting and registration mandates were not more inclined to implement accountability policies compared to organizations in states without such requirements.
On the contrary, our research findings suggest that public certifications such as OS, OSCIP, or CEBAS provided to Brazilian organizations categorized as NPOs do not lead to an increase in donations with donor restrictions. It appears that Brazilian donors did not exhibit a positive response towards NPO certification in terms of donation volume. This lack of response could be attributed to donors not perceiving the tangible or intangible benefits associated with these certifications. Several reasons could explain this phenomenon: firstly, there might be a lack of credibility attributed to the issuer (the Brazilian State), as certifications are expected to confer legitimacy and enhance reputation by leveraging the issuer's credibility onto the recipient, resulting in what could be termed as a 'discredited accreditation'. Secondly, NPOs without certification may have voluntarily adopted non-mandatory mechanisms in response to donor pressures, making it challenging for donors to differentiate between NPOs with and without the seal of distinction solely based on their governance practices. Lastly, it is possible that the presence of effective governance mechanisms alone is deemed sufficient by donors, rendering certification redundant from their perspective.
In assessing the model's overall fit, we obtained a Goodness-of-Fit index (GoF) of 0.4177. According to Wetzels et al. (2009), a low GoF is considered to be 0.1, average at 0.25, and high at 0.36. Based on this standard, the model in this study can be deemed to have a high level of fit.
We assessed the precision of the PLS parameter estimates for path coefficients and R2 by analyzing confidence intervals, with a predetermined level of statistical significance set at 0.05 for all calculations.
The analysis enabled us to discern the inherent governance structure within the environmental segment of non-profit organizations operating in Brazil. It also allowed us to infer a positive correlation between donations with donor restrictions and the absence of moderation by the NPO's certification in this relationship, specifically in the context of Governance leading to Donations.
The identified relationships can be linked to the process of marketization as outlined by Salamon (1997), based on the research findings of Lacruz et al. (2019). Non-profit organizations (NPOs) have been compelled to embrace private-for-profit market strategies to navigate the constraints of the donations market, resulting in what Salamon (1997) referred to as 'the non-profit private sector marketization'. Consequently, NPOs have expanded their external responsibilities and are now required to demonstrate efficiency and effectiveness in their operations (Arvidson and Lyon, 2014), while also implementing management models tailored to this objective (Smith, 2010).
In the context of governance within the third sector, a crucial aspect to consider is the temporality of operations. Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) typically pursue their institutional goals through project-based initiatives (Diallo and Thuillier, 2004). A project, defined as a temporary endeavor aimed at achieving a specific outcome (Project Management Institute, 2017), serves as the focal point of the contractual agreement between an NPO and the funding organization. It represents a business undertaking with a predetermined timeframe, scope, quality standards, and budget, carried out in return for financial support, and is governed by a formal contract or agreement between the involved parties. Consequently, the project itself becomes the subject of the contract, which serves as the foundation of the agency relationship between the NPO (acting as the agent) and the donor organization (serving as the principal). In our study, we specifically focused on donations with donor-imposed restrictions, based on this conceptual framework.
The temporal aspect of the project underscores the significant influence it has on governance within Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs). Each project, characterized by its unique features, contributes to shaping governance practices at the organizational level (Lacruz et al., 2019). This temporal dimension prompts a consideration of how NPOs, influenced by the process of marketization (Salamon, 1997), may integrate essential governance elements and those mandated by donors throughout the project's duration. However, once a project concludes, these mechanisms are disrupted, and subsequent projects may either adopt or adapt them in response to the requirements of new donors (Lacruz et al., 2019). While the study's findings do not definitively support this assertion, the overall discourse suggests the feasibility of such a proposition.
This reflection is closely tied to the concept of varying planning horizons within agency theory, suggesting the temporary nature of the principal in relation to the Non-Profit Organization (NPO), whose activities are confined to the duration of the contractual agreement, typically a project. Drawing on Jensen's framework (1993) for the third sector landscape, the donation market serves as a supplementary element to the legal and regulatory political system, functioning as an external governance mechanism for NPOs in establishing legal certainty, particularly within the broader legal framework characterized by minimal regulation in Brazil.
The examination of external influences, such as the donation market as highlighted by Desai and Yetman (2015), in shaping governance within the third sector, lacks substantial operational and empirical substantiation. The governance framework unearthed in this study mirrors a blend of internal and external dynamics, with the donation market playing a pivotal role in Nonprofit Organization (NPO) governance. Renz (2007) advocates for project governance as a means to bridge the gap between governance (strategic) and project management (operational) within the third sector, adapting conventional practices from the for-profit realm. Building upon this notion, we posit that projects serve as a conduit for governance reflections through temporary governance mechanisms, thereby suggesting a continuous (re)configuration of governance facilitated by projects.
This paper examines the impact of governance, including its various dimensions, on donations with donor restrictions received by environmental non-profit organizations (NPOs) in Brazil. The findings indicate that NPOs with stronger governance structures tend to attract more donations. Additionally, certifications granted by the Brazilian government to NPOs do not appear to influence the relationship between governance quality and the amount of donations received.
These findings hold significance not only for practitioners but also for enhancing discussions surrounding public policies concerning the third sector within minimally regulated settings. It is imperative for managers to contemplate the dissemination of information pertaining to the governance of Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs) to enable donors to access such details, potentially leading to a favorable impact on their decision-making process regarding donations.
Another significant contribution lies in the identification of a set of governance dimensions for Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) operating in a minimally regulated environment, as well as the barriers to information access. This parallels the work conducted by Harris et al. (2015) in the context of non-profit organizations functioning within highly regulated environments.
The development of the governance construct represented a significant advancement within the framework of agency theory, particularly in its application to relationships within the third sector. Additionally, this study introduced a novel utilization of Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) in validating reflective measurement models that solely comprise dichotomous data, thereby overcoming a constraint commonly associated with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM).
This study acknowledges certain limitations. Due to the unavailability of explanatory notes for all Financial Statements, the differentiation between types of donors such as government donors, private foundations, and corporate foundations was not feasible. Various types of donors are known to have distinct motivations for their contributions (Kuti, 2008), suggesting that the nature of the donor could potentially impact the correlation between governance practices and donation patterns.
Moreover, our study operates under the assumption that increased governance is advantageous, a perspective supported by Harris et al. (2015) and Hansan et al. (2016), among other scholars. While we acknowledge the significance of governance within Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) as a fundamental responsibility, we advocate for a thorough opportunity cost analysis when making decisions regarding governance. It is imperative to consider that without tangible benefits, resources allocated to governance-related activities, such as audit procedures, may detract from the core institutional mission of the NPO.
Further research is required to comprehensively capture all costs and benefits associated with Nonprofit Organization (NPO) governance. While our study demonstrated a positive correlation between improved governance and increased donations, we did not delve into whether enhanced governance directly enhances the effectiveness of an NPO. Despite the challenges involved, it is imperative to evaluate the extent to which an NPO fulfills its institutional mission of serving its designated community and to identify additional factors, beyond governance, that may contribute to achieving its objectives.
Given the temporal nature of projects and the transient quality of the contractual relationship, non-profit organizations (NPOs) should mitigate their reliance on donors by broadening their funding sources and augmenting unrestricted donations to sustain their efforts towards enduring causes. This necessitates a shift towards incorporating management practices based on their intrinsic value rather than succumbing to external donor pressures. By diversifying funding streams and bolstering unrestricted donations, NPOs can ensure continuity in their operations and focus on long-term objectives.
Therefore, we propose that future studies should concentrate on examining the potential impact of the project on governance. One potential area of investigation could be its mediating role in the relationship between governance and donations.
