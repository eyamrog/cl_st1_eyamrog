Individuals with chronic diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, various types of myocardiopathy, and certain forms of arrhythmia, face an elevated risk of fatal outcomes upon contracting SARS-COV-2 and developing COVID-19. Similarly, individuals who have undergone mechanical or surgical revascularization, those with prosthetic valves (whether biological or metallic), pacemakers, implanted defibrillators, or other devices, and individuals with certain forms of congenital heart disease also belong to a higher-risk category.
The patients mentioned earlier are unequivocally at an elevated risk and belong to a high-risk group irrespective of their age.
Individuals who are elderly, immunosuppressed, or have certain chronic conditions like diabetes and pulmonary disease are at a heightened risk of contracting infections, similar to those with heart disease.
The question arises concerning exercise in individuals with heart disease and the general population: how should we proceed? It is widely agreed upon by cardiologists, exercise physicians, and other specialists that regular physical exercise should be maintained, even when isolated at home. While this may appear challenging, the surplus of available time eliminates the excuse of not having enough time. With a week comprising 168 hours, is it not feasible to allocate at least five half-hour sessions to home-based exercise?
The second point highlights the benefits of exercising at home for two primary reasons. Firstly, it aligns with the key preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus responsible for COVID-19. Secondly, engaging in home workouts promotes overall health and well-being.
This raises another question: If I feel well, why am I unable to exercise in public spaces like streets, squares, gyms, or condominiums? On an individual level, going out for a run or using the treadmill in a condominium might not seem like an issue. However, from a social and epidemiological perspective, the likelihood of encountering a crowd increases, contradicting the advice of specialists. Just envision if everyone opted to jog on the beachside sidewalk or in the park simultaneously... It might seem fantastic... for the virus!!!
Thirdly, specialists advise against leaving home to exercise during the current pandemic, emphasizing the importance of considering the risk-benefit ratio.
Another crucial question arises: Should one engage in exercise if experiencing signs and/or symptoms? Absolutely not! Exercise should be avoided when signs and/or symptoms are present, whether related to an infection or any other condition. The optimal course of action is to rest until complete recovery is achieved.
Fourthly, it is crucial to refrain from exercising if you are experiencing symptoms, even within the confines of your home. It is imperative to prioritize rest and recovery during this period. Once you have fully recuperated, you can gradually resume your exercise routine as recommended by your healthcare provider.
Another pertinent consideration pertains to individuals' prior exercise history. Ideally, universal physical activity would prevail, rendering inactivity a negligible concern. There exists a misconception among certain individuals who believe that their active or athletic lifestyle grants them immunity against SARS-CoV-2. This assumption is unfounded. Even high-performance athletes have succumbed to COVID-19, with some having recovered or currently undergoing recovery, while others have required hospitalization.
Fifthly, it is imperative for active or athletic individuals to adhere to the same preventive measures as the general population, as they face an equal susceptibility to contracting the disease compared to any other individual.
Many of us reminisce about our childhoods filled with physical activities such as playing hula hoop, jump rope, hopscotch, and hide and seek, games that evoke a sense of nostalgia for a time untouched by pandemics, a time that is now irretrievable. Given the current circumstances, why not seize this opportunity to spend quality time with your children? Emphasizing the importance of cherishing these moments with your children, a prospect that seemed unimaginable just a few weeks ago! Motivate them to step away from their screens, whether it be WhatsApp, games, or Netflix, and engage in outdoor play. Encourage them to embrace the joy of physical activity once again!
Sixthly, it is advisable to revisit past habits and encourage children to engage in less sedentary activities. The World Health Organization recommends that adults aim for 150 minutes of exercise per week, while younger individuals should strive for at least 300 minutes. Ultimately, fostering a culture of physical activity within the family unit not only benefits individual health but also contributes to the overall well-being of the family as a whole.
Not all physical activity qualifies as exercise; however, all forms of exercise involve physical activity. Examples include sweeping, ironing, cleaning, vacuuming, gardening, yard work, stair climbing (with caution in shared apartment buildings), and various other activities.
Seventhly, it is recommended to increase physical activity within the home environment on a daily basis. By doing so, both you and your family can enjoy a more active, healthier, and ultimately more productive lifestyle.
Sexual activity is considered a form of physical exercise or activity, often regarded as one of the most pleasurable experiences for many individuals. Amidst the current era of isolation due to the coronavirus pandemic, this topic has garnered significant attention. While empirical data may be lacking, it is reasonable to assert that prioritizing social distancing over personal desires is crucial during these times. Emphasizing common sense and rational decision-making should take precedence over simply following the pleasure principle.
Eighth point: It is advisable to refrain from engaging in sexual activities that involve hugging, touching, kissing, and penetration, particularly in the context of occasional sexual encounters. However, masturbation, as well as the use of vibrators and erotic toys, is not discouraged. In the event that objects are shared, it is recommended that they be thoroughly cleaned with water and soap or a 70% alcohol gel. This suggestion is based on logical reasoning, as there is a lack of empirical studies that have tested hypotheses related to this specific subject matter.
Regarding this theme, there could be numerous additional points to consider, yet it appears paramount to underscore that physical inactivity stands as a treacherous adversary. Unlike the acute manifestations of SARS-COV-2, which necessitate urgent health interventions grounded in robust scientific data, the detrimental impacts of physical inactivity unfold gradually. This sedentary lifestyle detrimentally affects the cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, muscular, and immune systems. In essence, the preceding points aim to stimulate contemplation on the necessity of adapting to the constraints imposed by the current global circumstancesâ€”a reality that is restrictive but not insurmountable.
