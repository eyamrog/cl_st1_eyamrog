Hydrogen, the lightest element in the periodic table, boasts a high calorific value surpassing that of methane, gasoline, diesel, and methanol. Upon combustion, it liberates a substantial amount of energy alongside water as a byproduct. The global hydrogen production predominantly stems from natural gas, facilitated through Synthesis Gas production, which can alternatively derive from renewable sources or water. Synthesis gas holds pivotal significance as an intermediate product, enabling the production of hydrogen and other essential compounds like ammonia, crucial for fertilizer manufacturing. This paper underscores the significance of syngas and hydrogen, delving into their production methods, classifications, global scientific research in this domain, and their relevance to pressing economic issues such as food scarcity and energy crises, particularly in the context of Brazil.
Hydrogen (H) stands as the lightest chemical element in the periodic table, boasting a molar mass of 1 gram per mol (g.mol-1). In its natural state, it exists as an odorless, colorless gas under ambient conditions, being less dense than air. Notably, hydrogen possesses a high calorific value, reaching 141.4 kJ.g-1, a figure significantly surpassing that of methane (55.5 kJ.g-1), gasoline (47.5 kJ.g-1), diesel (44.8 kJ.g-1), and methanol (20 kJ.g-1) [Dincer, 2012]. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that hydrogen is potentially explosive, necessitating specific precautions for its handling and storage. A key distinction from the aforementioned fossil fuels lies in the fact that while they generate carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) upon combustion, hydrogen's combustion results in a substantial energy release alongside water as a byproduct (Reaction 1) [Asencios et al. 2022a,b].
Hydrogen, the most abundant chemical element in the universe, is also prevalent on Earth's surface, being a component of water molecules (H2O) and found in hydrocarbon molecules such as petroleum and various organic substances. However, due to its absence in isolated form on our planet, chemical processes are essential for its extraction. Presently, scientific advancements have enabled the extraction of hydrogen from diverse sources like water, oil, natural gas, ethanol, methanol, biomass, biogas, algae, glycerol, and more, each requiring a specific process for production. Additionally, Syngas can be generated from pre-treated biogas, biomethane, bioethanol, and other sources, although many of these methods remain primarily at a laboratory scale or in pilot-level studies.
Hydrogen derived from fossil fuels is commonly referred to as gray hydrogen, a nomenclature based on its source rather than its actual color. Presently, global hydrogen production predominantly stems from synthesis gas, a gas blend comprising carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2), commonly known as Syngas or Synthesis-Gas. This Syngas is typically generated from fossil fuels, primarily natural gas, utilizing a method known as Methane Steam Reform (RVM, Reaction 2).
Synthesis gas can be derived from alternative sources beyond fossil fuels, including biogas, bioethanol, glycerol, and bio-oil. This raw material holds significant importance for the chemical and petrochemical industry, enabling the production of hydrogen through a purification process known as the Water-Gas Shift Reaction (WGSR). Additionally, synthesis gas serves as a precursor for various high-value industrial compounds like methanol (utilized as a solvent and fuel), dimethyl ether (DME, a diesel-like fuel), Fischer-Tropsch liquid fuels, and ammonia (NH3), primarily employed in fertilizer production. Furthermore, synthesis gas finds application in direct combustion as well. [Asencios et al. 2022, Morales Udaeta et al. 2022]
The majority of hydrogen and synthesis gas globally is primarily utilized in the manufacturing of fertilizers, petroleum refining, and within the petrochemical industry. In recent times, hydrogen has emerged as a promising and environmentally friendly energy source. Its application as a fuel in vehicles is facilitated through fuel cells, a technology readily available in regions like Europe, North America, Japan, South Korea, and other countries. Additionally, there is a growing interest in exploring the direct combustion of hydrogen, as evidenced by recent studies, such as those conducted by Vieira da Rosa and Ordóñez in 2022, which have examined its potential use in turbines.
Hydrogen can be generated through the electrolysis of water (Reaction 3), a process that does not rely on fossil fuels and is well-established. This method necessitates water, electricity, and electrodes for its execution. The electric power required can be sourced from renewable energy outlets like wind, solar, and hydroelectric plants, enabling the production of hydrogen. When hydrogen is derived from water electrolysis using electricity from renewable sources, it is termed as green hydrogen.
The utilization of seawater in this process holds promise, given the abundant availability of seawater on Earth. However, its application poses challenges due to the high salt content, complicating the process and resulting in the generation of by-products like brine. Proper treatment of this brine is essential before disposal into the sea to prevent adverse environmental impacts on marine ecosystems. The disposal of brine necessitates careful consideration [Gao et al. 2022]. The industrial applications of brine remain limited, primarily confined to its use in the food industry and the production of chlorine gas and sodium, both of significant industrial importance. Nevertheless, the potential for sodium production in conjunction with a green hydrogen production system requires a comprehensive evaluation to address economic, logistical, and environmental obstacles.
In Brazil, electrolysis-based technology holds significant appeal, primarily owing to the abundance of natural resources and the widespread presence of hydroelectric plants across the country. Notably, 87% of Brazil's energy matrix is derived from renewable sources in 2021, a stark contrast to the global average of 27% in 2019. Of this renewable energy, 65.2% is attributed to hydroelectric plants, as reported by the Energy Research Company of Brazil [2021]. Electrolytic processes are widely recognized for their efficiency and scalability, making them the most viable option in the immediate future.
In the realm of hydrogen production, it is noteworthy to highlight that this chemical element can be acquired through photocatalytic processes, which involve the utilization of solar energy and water. This method entails the separation of water using a semiconductor catalyst, as discussed by Asencios and Machado (2022).
The utilization of hydrogen as an energy source necessitates the employment of electrochemical devices known as fuel cells, which facilitate the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy by means of oxidation and reduction reactions involving hydrogen and oxygen, resulting in the production of water and electrical energy. Additionally, specialized cylinders are required for the storage of hydrogen, along with the establishment of an efficient supply chain extending to the end consumer, all of which must comply with local legislation. These factors collectively pose significant challenges in transitioning towards an economy centered around hydrogen rather than oil, a transition that remains distant from the current reality in developing nations. In contrast, alternative energy sources such as bioenergy and renewable energies are more feasible options that are closer to being fully developed.
Alternative definitions of hydrogen include blue hydrogen, derived from the combustion of fossil fuels with subsequent capture and storage of emitted carbon dioxide, and turquoise hydrogen, generated by methane molecule breakdown via pyrolysis. The pyrolysis of natural gas necessitates thermal energy for the conversion of methane into hydrogen and solid carbon (Energy Research Company of Brazil, 2022).
The utilization of renewable energies is imperative in contemporary times to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, combat the repercussions of rising global temperatures, and secure a sustainable future for forthcoming generations. Nonetheless, the reliance of these energy sources on climatic conditions renders them intermittent, posing a threat to consistent energy production during unfavorable periods such as nighttime when sunlight is absent. Consequently, alongside renewable energy systems, the imperative need for electrical energy storage arises, a task currently fulfilled by batteries including lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, or Li-Ion variants. Despite this, energy storage through batteries remains costly and inefficient, with the quest for high-performance batteries proving to be a persistent challenge. These high-performance batteries must exhibit optimal energy storage capacity, lightweight construction, minimal spatial requirements, and cost-effectiveness. An alternative approach involves storing energy in the form of hydrogen, leveraging excess renewable energy for its production, capitalizing on the advantageous properties of this chemical element.
In a collaborative effort between the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Paris Agreement was established with the primary goal of mitigating climate change and limiting global temperature increases to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels (UNFCC, 2020). Brazil has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 37% below 2005 levels by 2025 and further by 43% below 2005 levels by 2030, as per data released by the Ministry of the Environment in 2020. To adhere to the timelines set by the Paris Agreement, participating nations are devising new sustainable strategies to counteract the adverse effects of fossil fuel consumption on the environment. The push for hydrogen technology development in Brazil is substantiated by compelling reasons, including:
To mitigate climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Combatting the high dependence on fossil fuels remains a critical challenge for Brazil. The country's reliance on fossil fuels, particularly in the transportation sector, is significant. Despite this, Brazil boasts one of the cleanest electrical matrices globally, with renewable energies accounting for 70% of the national electrical grid. However, these renewable sources are weather-dependent, as previously noted, posing inherent disadvantages. Furthermore, 60% of this renewable energy share is derived from hydroelectric plants, which are heavily reliant on rainfall and are susceptible to the impacts of climate change, particularly in the Amazon rainforest region. To address these vulnerabilities, a more diversified electrical matrix is imperative, especially considering that 30% of the country's energy still originates from fossil fuels.
Oil price fluctuations are determined by a multifaceted formula that extends beyond the scope of this article, influenced by factors including global supply and demand dynamics, international market prices, currency exchange rates, domestic policies, and geopolitical tensions. Notably, the onset of the pandemic witnessed a historic plunge in oil prices, with some instances of negative values, followed by a rapid escalation in recent months attributed to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The pursuit of energy independence and security from oil remains a common objective for nations worldwide.
Controlling uncertain oil reserves presents a myriad of challenges. The volatility of oil prices, geopolitical tensions, and fluctuating demand all contribute to the complexity of managing these reserves. Additionally, the inherent uncertainty surrounding the actual quantity and quality of oil in reserves further complicates decision-making processes for oil-producing countries and companies. Strategies for effectively controlling uncertain oil reserves must take into account these various factors and develop robust risk management plans to mitigate potential losses. Furthermore, the need for transparency and accurate data in assessing reserves is crucial for making informed decisions and ensuring sustainable management practices in the oil industry.
The escalating global energy demand poses a significant challenge.
Developing countries, particularly those in South America, exhibit significant potential for harnessing solar, wind, hydroelectric, and bioenergy resources, all of which hold great promise. In contrast, developed nations like those within the European Union and the US are increasingly turning to hydrogen as a fuel source to meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement. Brazil, in particular, stands out as a potential key player in the global hydrogen market, with the capacity to emerge as a major exporter of this resource. Such a transition could not only create numerous employment opportunities but also necessitate a skilled workforce to support and sustain this burgeoning industry.
Plants require NPK macronutrients (representing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium chemical elements) along with sunlight and water to thrive and develop. These essential macronutrients are typically found in fertilizers. Nitrogen-based fertilizers, for instance, are derived from NH3. Despite nitrogen's abundance on Earth, constituting 79% of the atmosphere by volume, plants must absorb it through their roots in the form of NO3- or NH4+ when it is not readily available in the soil. The fixation of atmospheric nitrogen was pioneered over a century ago, just prior to World War I, by German chemist Fritz Haber, who successfully synthesized ammonia using atmospheric nitrogen and hydrogen over an iron catalyst. The industrialization of this process was later accomplished by Carl Bosch. Their groundbreaking work earned them the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 and 1931, respectively. Known as the Haber-Bosch process, it remains in use today, involving the use of hydrogen from natural gas, nitrogen, and iron catalysts.
Brazil serves as a crucial exporter of food, catering to the needs of nearly one billion individuals globally, constituting approximately one-sixth of the world's population [Senra, 2020]. Paradoxically, recent reports have highlighted a stark reality: approximately 33 million individuals within Brazil are grappling with food insecurity, lacking access to an adequate food supply [Silveira, 2022; Andrade, 2022]. Various factors contribute to this food scarcity issue, with one significant aspect being the exorbitant costs of fertilizers, consequently driving up food prices.
Brazil ranks as the fourth largest consumer of fertilizers globally, following China, India, and the United States, and stands as the largest importer of these essential agricultural inputs. To provide context, in 2021, Brazil's consumption exceeded 40 million tons of fertilizers, with a staggering 85% being sourced through imports. Notably, Russia emerges as the leading exporter of NPK globally. The synthesis of ammonia, crucial for fertilizer production, relies on hydrogen derived from natural gas, a process illustrated in Reaction 2. Russia, being the second-largest producer and top exporter of natural gas, plays a pivotal role in this supply chain. Ammonia serves as the foundational material for various fertilizers, including urea and ammonium nitrate. Noteworthy exporters in this domain include Russia and the Middle East countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Iran, known for their significant oil and natural gas production capacities. [Frost 2022]
The intensification of hydrogen production in Brazil would consequently enhance local ammonia production and, in turn, nitrogen fertilizer production. This would not only benefit the country's economy but also contribute to alleviating food insecurity.
According to the prominent scientific article database, Scopus, research on Hydrogen and Synthesis Gas (Syngas) has garnered increasing interest since 2004, with a significant surge in publications, totaling 62,292 articles from 1964 to 2022. Leading the research efforts are countries like China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, India, and Germany, with Brazil emerging as a notable player in Latin America. Brazil's research predominantly focuses on generating hydrogen/synthesis gas from bioproducts such as sugarcane ethanol, glycerol, bio-oil, and biogas, underscoring its global standing in biofuels. These insights are visually represented in Figure 1.
While these processes are currently limited to laboratory scale, the outcomes exhibit significant promise, particularly when viewed in the context of the prevailing global circumstances.
The integration of technology for hydrogen production and increased support for scientific research and universities in Brazil could significantly advance the country's energy future. Such initiatives would not only foster energy and nitrogen fertilizer independence but also stimulate the demand for skilled labor and bolster economic growth.
Greater investment is imperative for advancing the production of hydrogen technologies derived from renewable sources, particularly water.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the production of Syngas and hydrogen; nevertheless, the current juncture presents an opportune moment to advance the scaling up of hydrogen production derived from renewable sources.
The production of syngas for ammonia synthesis demands increased attention, particularly in light of the ongoing global food crisis.
Hydrogen holds promise as a fuel source and for various applications like ammonia. Presently, its utilization as a fuel is more prevalent in developed nations. Brazil and Latin America collectively possess significant potential to emerge as hydrogen suppliers on a global scale, particularly if the production is sourced from renewable resources. The adoption of this technology could significantly benefit the economy of Latin America, creating a surge in demand for skilled labor in the region.
