The study examined the outcomes of 268 ICU patients in a single-center setting, focusing on the influence of viral infections on individuals with preexisting medical conditions, and the subsequent impact on survival rates and length of hospital stay.
Methodology: The study retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to the ICU at Hospital Alemão Oswaldo Cruz in São Paulo, Brazil, between March and August 2020, following a standardized protocol. Various factors were taken into account, and the findings were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance was determined using a threshold of p < 0.05.
Results revealed that the median age of patients was 72 years, with discharged patients averaging 64.2 years and deceased patients averaging 79.9 years (p<0.001). The most prevalent comorbidities included systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, cardiovascular issues, and kidney disease. Univariate analysis identified several predictors of survival, such as myalgia (p=0.001), cerebrovascular disease (p=0.002), COPD (p=0.003), dementia (p=0.000), mechanical ventilation (p=0.000), dialysis (p=0.000), vasopressor use (p=0.000), SAPS3 (p=0.000), lymphopenia (p=0.004), elevated D-dimer (p=0.011), time spent in the ICU before tracheostomy (p=0.002), and undergoing a tracheostomy (p=0.000). Independent predictors of mortality included advanced age (p=0.003) and the performance of a tracheostomy in the ICU (p=0.002).
Discussion: COVID-19 predominantly impacts older adults, who exhibit a higher fatality rate compared to younger age groups. The primary cause of death in these cases is acute respiratory distress syndrome. Additionally, studies have shown that less than 5% of patients presented with co-infections upon admission.
In conclusion, this study identified age, vasopressor use in patients with tracheostomy, and the presence of systemic coronary disease, heart failure, neoplasia, and COPD as significantly associated factors with the severity of COVID-19.
In late December 2019, several cases of a severe illness causing pneumonia and fatalities were initially documented in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, the incidence of cases surged significantly, rapidly disseminating throughout China and subsequently globally.
The main group of patients was identified as being linked to the Huanan South China Seafood Market in Wuhan. The coronavirus is classified within the family Coronaviridae (subfamily Coronavirinae), with the ability to infect a wide variety of hosts, leading to symptoms and diseases that range from mild common colds to severe and potentially fatal illnesses like SARS and MERS. Examination of the viral genome has indicated that the novel coronavirus is closely related phylogenetically to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was responsible for a viral epidemic in 2002.
The World Health Organization (WHO) officially designated the disease as "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)" and now commonly refers to the virus as "the COVID-19 virus" (previously identified as "2019-nCoV"). The impacts on human health, the global economy, and societal operations have been unparalleled.
The virus infects individuals across all age groups, with the severe manifestation of the illness being more prevalent among older adults. Patients afflicted with COVID-19 may exhibit symptoms or remain asymptomatic. As per prevailing accounts, approximately 81% of patients experienced mild symptoms, such as cough, sore throat, fever, myalgia, and moderate pneumonia.
As of August 8, 2021, the global total of confirmed COVID-19 cases stood at 201,941,078. Among 192 countries with recorded cases and outcomes, 4,282,732 resulted in fatalities. Brazil reported 31,895,385 COVID-19 cases and 561,762 deaths, reflecting a 2.8% lethality rate. In São Paulo, considered the epicenter of the disease in Brazil, there were 4,113,741 confirmed cases and 140,677 deaths, with a 3.9% lethality rate.
The disease can result in organ dysfunction, including shock, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury (AKI), ultimately leading to death. While the majority of COVID-19 patients may not necessitate supportive care, approximately 10-15% of individuals experience acute respiratory distress necessitating invasive ventilatory support. Those with the severe manifestation of the illness exhibit symptoms such as severe pneumonia, dyspnea, and markedly low blood oxygen saturation levels (≤ 93%), a presentation observed in around 14% of cases.
Critical symptoms were present in approximately 5% of cases, manifesting as respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and septic shock. Mild infections typically showed signs of improvement within a week, while severe cases often progressed to acute respiratory failure, potentially culminating in sepsis and death. The majority of fatalities were documented in middle-aged to elderly populations with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart and kidney diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and immune disorders.
The mortality rates range from 2% to 3%, with older age and the presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, elevated d-dimer and C-reactive protein levels, and decreased lymphocyte counts being linked to higher mortality rates. Consequently, there is a pressing need for effective and targeted antiviral treatments. At present, supportive care measures including ventilation, oxygenation, and fluid management are the established standard of care. Numerous clinical trials are currently underway to determine the most effective drug or combination therapy for the disease, underscoring the importance of enrolling patients in these ongoing trials.
Mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is linked to extended airway intubation and a high global mortality rate ranging from 50-67%.
The rapid development cycle of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has been notable, propelled by the urgent global pandemic. Major international vaccine funding agencies are actively supporting numerous innovative initiatives in this area. Presently, vaccination campaigns are being implemented worldwide, yielding promising outcomes by effectively lowering infection rates, hospitalizations, and fatalities.
In this study, we present original research detailing the outcomes of 268 ICU patients from a single center. Additionally, we analyze the impact of viral infections on preexisting medical conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease, and cancer. We investigate how these factors influence both survival rates and the length of hospital stays for these patients.
In this retrospective analysis, we examined a cohort of 268 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Hospital Alemão Oswaldo Cruz in São Paulo, Brazil, between March 18th, 2020, and August 30th, 2020. All patients were subjected to the same standardized protocol during their stay at the hospital.
The patients included in this study were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection through nasal pharyngeal swab testing for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) assay and subsequently experienced severe respiratory failure necessitating admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Data for the study were obtained through a comprehensive review of each patient's medical records. Approval for conducting this research was granted by the institutional review board under protocol number #4.849.542.
Patients meeting the following criteria were deemed eligible for inclusion in the analysis: 1) confirmation of Covid-19 through testing, and 2) admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
Various COVID-19 related factors were taken into account, such as age, gender, pre-hospitalization symptoms, comorbidities, vasopressor usage, radiological findings, high flow nasal catheter utilization, prone positioning, ECMO, tracheostomy, and blood test results.
Furthermore, we gathered data on variables including the type and duration of symptoms upon admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the relationship between Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) and the ratio of Partial Pressure of Oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2, as well as the overall duration of hospital stay.
Prior to receiving intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, most patients underwent chest CT scans to assess the severity of lung lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2. These lesions were categorized into four degrees based on the extent of lung involvement: less than 25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and greater than 75%.
For the database preparation and descriptive analysis, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), version 17.0 for Windows, was utilized. The outcomes were presented through tables and graphs. Categorical variables were depicted in frequencies and percentages - n (%). Continuous variables exhibiting a normal distribution were represented as means and standard deviations, while those with a non-normal distribution were shown as median and interquartile ranges. The normality of numerical variables was confirmed through descriptive statistics, graphical analysis, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
In comparing groups based on numerical variables (hospital discharge vs. death), the independent t-test was employed for normally distributed variables, while the Mann-Whitney test was utilized for those with asymmetric distributions. For comparisons involving categorical variables, the chi-square (X2) test was applied. In cases where the distribution had an N in each category with fewer than five individuals, Fischer's exact test was used.
The study utilized the COX regression model to assess predictive variables for mortality among COVID-19 patients. Following univariate analysis, independent variables were incorporated into the COX model, with those retaining significance (p < 0.05) remaining in the model. The manual procedure for variable inclusion and exclusion was employed. Results were reported in terms of hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to illustrate patients' survival rates. A significance level of p < 0.05 was set for all statistical analyses.
Out of the total of 268 patients in the study, 200 individuals (74.6%) were discharged from the hospital, comprising 139 males and 34 females. Conversely, 68 patients (44 males and 24 females) were either not discharged or deceased, accounting for 25.4% of the total. It is notable that there is a higher prevalence of males in both the discharged and non-discharged/deceased groups. Additionally, a correlation is observed between the duration of hospitalization and the likelihood of mortality, as depicted in Figure 1.
The average duration of symptoms prior to hospital admission was 5.5 days, with discharged patients experiencing symptoms for seven days (4-9) and non-discharged patients for four days (2-6.75) (p<0.001). Patients who were not discharged had a prolonged hospital stay, indicating a quicker progression to an unfavorable outcome. It was observed that a shorter duration of symptoms often led to a more rapid development of severe disease manifestations.
The most prevalent comorbidities identified in the study included systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) with 144 cases, diabetes with 80 cases, thyroid disease with 53 cases, cardiovascular disease with 52 cases, kidney disease with 33 cases, cerebrovascular disease or previous stroke with 12 cases, obesity with 60 cases, neoplasia with 35 cases, COPD with 15 cases, and dementia with 22 cases, as detailed in Table 1.
One hundred and two patients had used various types of drugs prior to their admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), as outlined in Table 1. Specifically, the breakdown of drug usage among these patients was as follows: ACE inhibitors were used by 87 individuals, systemic corticosteroids by 54 patients, chemotherapy by 14 patients, and immunosuppressive drugs by 9 patients.
The median age of the patients who were discharged was 72 years, with a range of 53 to 74 years, while those who were not discharged had a median age of 79.9 years, ranging from 71.4 to 88.4 years (p<0.001). It is notable that the group of patients who were not discharged from the hospital consisted of the oldest individuals, as indicated in Table 1.
Prior to hospital admission, the prevailing symptoms included dyspnea (n=206/78%), fever (n=179/65%), cough (n=166/60%), diarrhea (n=51/18.5%), and myalgia (n=83/25.6%). Notably, dyspnea emerged as the most common symptom, particularly among individuals who were not discharged (n=55/80.9%).
In terms of lung involvement prior to ICU admission, 21 patients exhibited no specific CT findings, while 52 patients had less than 25% (20.7%), 107 had 25-50% (38.4%), 58 had 50-75% (20.3%), and nine patients (3.2%) had over 75% of lobes affected by SARS-CoV-2. Upon ICU admission, the median SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) 3 was 45 (41-51.7) for discharged patients and 51 (44.3-57) for those not discharged; 174 patients (60.9%) received additional oxygen via a nasal catheter, 14 patients (5.4%) required high-flow nasal cannula, 28 (12.3%) needed mechanical ventilation, and 23 (8.6%) necessitated vasopressors. The median PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 236 (135-328) for discharged individuals and 192 (125-275) for those not discharged from the hospital.
During their hospitalization, 32 patients (12.9%) were placed in the prone position, 33 patients (20.9%) underwent tracheostomy, and seven patients (2.2%) required ECMO support.
The laboratory tests revealed the following median findings upon hospital admission: leukocytes at 7.410 and 8.015, lymphocytes at 910 and 700, C-reactive protein at 11 and 11.38, D-dimer at 850 and 1.193, LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase) at 615 and 657, and creatinine at 0.94 and 1.09 in the patients who were discharged and those who were not discharged, respectively.
The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 12 days (interquartile range: 7.5-16), total hospitalization time was 17 days (interquartile range: 10-31) and 18.5 days (interquartile range: 10-37), and ICU stay prior to tracheostomy was 11.5 days (interquartile range: 7-18) and 19 days (interquartile range: 14.5-25.5) for patients who were discharged and those who were not discharged, respectively.
From Table 1, the collected data indicates that...
In the group that was not discharged from the hospital, older age was associated with a worse prognosis.
The deceased group exhibited a shorter duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization.
A higher prevalence of myalgia was observed in the cohort that had been discharged from the hospital.
In relation to comorbidities, conditions such as cardiovascular disease, neoplasia, COPD, and dementia were notably prevalent among the subgroup of deceased patients.
During the ICU stay, a higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, dialysis, and tracheostomy was observed in the group that experienced a higher rate of mortality.
The SAPS3 scores were found to be significantly higher in patients who did not survive upon admission to the ICU.
In the cohort under study, it was observed that lymphopenia, elevated D-dimer levels, and a longer duration of stay in the intensive care unit prior to treatment with the study drug were significantly more prevalent in the subgroup that experienced higher mortality rates.
The univariate analysis presented in Table 2 identifies several factors that serve as predictors of survival. These factors include myalgia (p=0.001), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (p=0.002), COPD (p=0.003), dementia (p=0.000), the requirement for mechanical ventilation (p=0.000), dialysis (p=0.000), vasopressor usage (p=0.000), SAPS3 (p=0.000), lymphopenia (p=0.004), elevated D-dimer levels (p=0.011), duration spent in the ICU before tracheostomy (p=0.002), and the performance of a tracheostomy (p=0.000).
In the multivariate analysis (Table 3), several independent predictors of mortality were identified. These included advanced age (p=0.003), with older individuals being at a higher risk of mortality. Surprisingly, the non-use of vasopressors in the ICU emerged as a protective factor (p=0.001), potentially indicating a different approach to patient management. Conversely, the performance of a tracheostomy in the ICU was found to be a predictor of mortality (p=0.002), highlighting the potential risks associated with this procedure as shown in Tables 2 and 3.
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an immense strain on healthcare systems worldwide, presenting an unprecedented challenge in managing a surge of critically ill patients. This global crisis has impacted various communities, leading to reports of overwhelmed hospitals, particularly in critical care units, becoming increasingly common. The cornerstone of ensuring the survival of critically ill COVID-19 patients lies in the provision of high-quality supportive care. Traditionally, such care relied on adequate expert staffing, specialized equipment, and suitable care environments to effectively execute a range of processes linked to improved outcomes. Patients with COVID-19 receiving treatment in the ICU during periods of heightened demand or high ICU load exhibited poorer outcomes compared to those treated during low-demand periods. Advanced age and the need for mechanical ventilation were strongly associated with increased mortality risk, while ICU capacity showed a clear correlation with mortality rates.
The range of diseases outlined in our study aligns closely with those documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, as well as findings from the New York City area and China.
The analysis of the data indicates a significant relationship between the shorter duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization and poorer survival outcomes (p<0.001), as demonstrated by the univariate analysis. A shorter duration of symptoms is associated with a more unfavorable prognosis and a quicker progression to a severe clinical presentation.
The global pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has brought about a range of clinical and pathological manifestations during acute infection, extensively documented in existing literature. This spectrum encompasses asymptomatic cases, mild self-limiting symptoms, and severe conditions necessitating invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Predominant clinical presentations include fever, cough, and fatigue, often accompanied by elevated serum ferritin, D-dimers, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Studies have identified various risk factors linked to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, such as advanced age, neutrophilia, organ dysfunction, coagulopathy, and heightened D-dimer levels.
Previous studies conducted in ICU settings reported mortality rates of 62% in China and 67% in the USA; however, these figures did not consider individuals who were still receiving care in the ICU. It is important to note that these statistics may have been influenced by the early stages of the pandemic when limited information was available about the virus and its impact on patient outcomes. Upon further analysis, a lower mortality rate of 25.4% was observed, which could be attributed to advancements in healthcare practices stemming from a better understanding of disease management and treatment strategies.
Elderly individuals exhibit a higher susceptibility to COVID-19, with a greater fatality rate observed within this demographic. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) stands as the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 cases. A recent comprehensive review highlighted that upon admission, less than 5% of COVID-19 patients presented with bacterial or fungal co-infections. However, the occurrence of secondary infections during intensive care unit (ICU) stays is frequently reported.
Age demonstrated a significant correlation with increased mortality rates in both univariate (p<0.001) and multivariate (p=0.003) analyses. The mortality rate observed in this study was 34% (n=68), although some researchers have reported even higher rates, reaching up to 49% in patients with critical illness. Notably, a higher proportion of males (66.3%) were admitted to the ICU compared to females (33.7%) in this sample. Conversely, a systematic review encompassing 18,246 patients found no substantial disparity in gender distribution, with males accounting for 50.5% and females for 49.5% of the cases across all age groups. In contrast, a separate study involving 4,203 patients revealed a higher percentage of males (66.5%) compared to females (33.5%).
Early reports have indicated an incubation period spanning from two to 14 days, with clinical manifestations varying from mild infection to severe illness, potentially leading to fatality. The predominant symptoms frequently documented include cough, fever, and dyspnea. Additionally, myalgia and gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting are prevalent among affected individuals. Notably, myalgia was identified in a quarter of patients and emerged as a significant predictor of survival based on univariate analysis (p<0.001).
The requirement for mechanical ventilation (p=0.000) and an extended stay in the ICU (p=0.002) were both found to be correlated with a poorer prognosis in the univariate analysis. In a multi-center study conducted during the early stages of the Wuhan outbreak, it was noted by other authors that 97% of patients on invasive mechanical ventilation succumbed to the illness, although it is important to consider that mortality rates can be influenced by local medical practices, and larger-scale studies are eagerly anticipated. Additionally, the study highlighted that 53% of the reported deaths were attributed to respiratory failure.
Recent reports suggest that approximately 14% to 29% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia require intensive care, primarily for respiratory support in the setting of hypoxic respiratory failure, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing in 33% of hospitalized patients at a median time from symptom onset of eight days. Critically ill patients in these reports were older, more likely to be male, and to have underlying comorbidities. The mortality rate ranged from 8.7% to 21% among those patients admitted with pneumonia. These findings align with earlier studies, which also noted a high percentage of hospitalized patients of advanced age with preexisting conditions, with hypertension being the most common.
The rapid spread of COVID-19 in São Paulo has had a disproportionate impact on the population, particularly those with high rates of co-morbid conditions and a mean BMI of 30. Previous reports by other authors have highlighted the high incidence of unfavorable outcomes among obese patients. In this study, obesity was found in 27.9% of the deceased group. Despite the significant number of patients affected, it did not show statistical significance in the univariate analysis (p=0.748).
In the initial reports emerging from Wuhan, China, at the onset of the pandemic, it was noted that shortness of breath afflicted 54% of patients and was linked to a composite endpoint involving admission to an ICU, utilization of mechanical ventilation, and mortality. A comparable incidence of dyspnea was observed in a cohort of 21 critically ill individuals in Washington State and within the COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network database. Within our own series, the presence of dyspnea upon presentation correlated with hospitalization and the necessity for ICU care, emerging as the most prevalent symptom, particularly among those who did not achieve discharge (n=55/80.9%).
Some authors have reported that the prevalence of dyspnea in the ICU group was 67.2%, significantly higher than the 10.2% observed in the non-ICU group. While dyspnea typically signifies lung involvement and potentially more severe disease, there have been documented cases of 'silent hypoxia', where oxygen saturation levels can drop, leading to acute respiratory failure without the presence of dyspnea or other respiratory distress symptoms.
Symptoms such as fever (65%), cough (60%), and myalgia (25.6%) were found to be more prevalent among patients in the ICU based on uni-variable analysis, with myalgia emerging as a significant predictor of survival (p=0.001). Jail et al. highlighted dyspnea as the sole symptom significantly linked to severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83–7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28–10.0), with a stronger association observed with the latter.
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that COPD, CVD, and hypertension were significantly predictive comorbidities for both severe disease and ICU admission. The prevalence odds ratios (pORs) for severe disease were as follows: COPD (6.42, 95% CI 2.44–16.9), CVD (2.70, 95% CI 1.52–4.80), and hypertension (1.97, 95% CI 1.40–2.77). In comparison, COPD, CVD, and hypertension exhibited stronger associations with ICU admission, with pORs of 17.8 (95% CI 6.56–48.2), 4.44 (95% CI 2.64–7.47), and 3.65 (95% CI 2.22–5.99), respectively. These results align with the data indicating that COPD (p=0.003) and cardiovascular disease (p=0.002) patients had higher ICU admission rates and poorer prognoses. Yan et al. also emphasized COPD as a robust predictor for severe disease and ICU admission. Specifically, COPD was identified as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 patients with an odds ratio of 5.97 (P<0.001). Patients with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 and 3.7 times more likely to require ICU admission, respectively, compared to those without these comorbidities.
The cardiovascular complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 encompass acute myocardial damage, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, rhythm disorders, and thromboembolism. Additionally, when treating COVID-19, it is crucial to take into account the potential interactions with cardiovascular medications. A study involving over 44,000 COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions revealed a significant five-fold rise in mortality rates compared to patients without prior cardiovascular issues (10.5% and 2.3%, respectively).
A significant number of patients examined with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea (18.5%), necessitated hospitalization, mirroring findings from the COVID-19 Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network. A systematic review of GI symptoms in COVID-19 indicated an average diarrhea prevalence ranging from 5% to 10%, with considerable variations across studies. Larger cohort studies have documented prevalence rates between 20% and 30%.
In a recent systematic review involving 18,246 patients, it was determined that there was no significant disparity between the number of male (50.5%) and female (49.5%) participants, encompassing individuals across all age brackets. The prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms exhibited a similar distribution among men and women, with rates of 52.1% and 49.5%, respectively. Notably, diarrhea emerged as the most prevalent GI symptom, affecting 11.5% of the patient cohort, followed by nausea and vomiting at 6.3%, and abdominal pain at 2.3%. In terms of clinical severity, 17.5% of the patients were categorized as severely ill, while 9.8% were identified as having a non-severe form of the disease.
Reports indicate that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) were utilized in a significant proportion, ranging from one-third to two-thirds, of critically ill COVID-19 patients in China. However, there is a scarcity of data to definitively confirm or refute safety concerns regarding the potential aerosol-generating risk posed by these devices. While epidemiological evidence suggests a link between NIV and nosocomial transmission of SARS, human laboratory studies indicate that NIV may not actually generate aerosols. The safety of HFNC remains uncertain, as studies supporting its safety were not specifically designed to assess its potential aerosol-generating nature or its role in viral transmission. Initial concerns regarding these devices were prevalent at the onset of the pandemic. Data collected from 174 patients who used nasal catheters (NC), 14 HFNC, and 71 non-rebreathing masks (NRM) upon ICU admission did not reveal any significant association with survival outcomes based on these factors.
Liang et al. developed and validated a clinical risk score and a web-based risk calculator to predict the development of critical illness among hospitalized COVID-19 infected patients. The ten variables necessary for calculating the risk of developing a critical illness are typically easily accessible upon hospital admission. These variables include chest radiography abnormality, age, hemoptysis, dyspnea, unconsciousness, number of comorbidities, cancer history, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct bilirubin, all of which were incorporated into the COVID risk score. Previous research has identified several of these variables as risk factors for severe illness associated with COVID-19. However, potential limitations of this study include a modest sample size for constructing the risk score and a relatively small sample for validation. Additionally, the data used for score development and validation are exclusively from China. Laboratory findings indicated that lymphopenia (p=0.004), elevated D-dimer (p=0.011), and SAPS3 level were significant variables in univariate analysis. In a study involving 710 patients by Liang et al., it was demonstrated that radiological abnormalities, number of comorbidities, and DHL level were associated with survival in multivariate analysis.
The requirement for vasopressor medications may arise from a variety of factors, including muscle blockers, septic shock, myocarditis, or other myocardial dysfunctions, either individually or in combination. These findings typically indicate patients who are critically ill. The necessity for vasopressors was found to have a significant impact on survival according to multivariate analysis (p=0.000).
Tracheostomy is a common procedure in critically ill patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV), aimed at facilitating weaning from MV and potentially freeing up intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Data analysis revealed that 11% of discharged patients had undergone tracheostomy in the ICU, while 30.9% of deceased patients had undergone the procedure, indicating a higher incidence among the more severe patient group. Despite tracheostomy not altering the natural history of these patients based on collected data and existing literature, those who underwent the procedure had a poorer prognosis (p=0.000). Multivariate analysis further demonstrated that tracheostomy had a significant impact on survival (p=0.002), possibly due to the procedure being performed on patients in suboptimal conditions, advanced age, those less suitable for weaning from MV, or those with more comorbidities. Notably, there are currently no guidelines in the literature regarding tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients on MV.
In conclusion, age, the requirement for vasopressor medications in tracheostomy patients, and underlying comorbidities including systemic coronary disease, heart failure, neoplasia, and COPD were significantly linked to the severity of COVID-19. These pre-existing conditions may heighten the vulnerability of individuals to COVID-19. Awareness of these risk factors could aid clinicians in reducing mortality rates by identifying patients with poor prognoses early on. Lymphopenia and elevated D-dimer levels were also associated with a negative prognosis and a more severe disease progression. Prolonged ICU stays in this particular cohort were indicative of a poor prognosis as well.
The spectrum of diseases described in this study is comparable to those reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, as well as findings from the New York City area and China. Furthermore, data analysis has substantiated that a shorter duration of symptoms is linked to a poorer prognosis for the disease.
