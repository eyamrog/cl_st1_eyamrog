The push for integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into Basic Education in Brazil has gained momentum through successive curricular reforms, citing its crucial role in preparing individuals for active engagement in the 21st Century. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 further accelerated the adoption of these technologies to facilitate various forms of education, notably emergency remote education. Against this backdrop, this article seeks to delve into the conceptualization of technology within the basic education curriculum and the actual accessibility to ICT. To achieve this, a thorough literature review and documentary research were conducted. Analysis was carried out on the document outlining the National Common Curricular Base (BNCC) of Brazilian education, alongside data from the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee census pertaining to ICT access in schools and households. Previous research conducted in public schools over the past 8 years had already highlighted the lack of investment in technology and teacher training for ICT utilization in these educational institutions. Essentially, the exposure brought about by the pandemic merely shed light on the longstanding precarious state of Brazilian public schools. The prevailing theoretical stance in the BNCC leans towards an instrumental rather than comprehensive approach. Despite the increasing emphasis on ICT integration in educational settings as per national curriculum guidelines, the reality underscores a stark mismatch between the recommended approach and the insufficient investments in both human and technological resources, even for basic instrumental teaching, despite the social relevance of the subject matter.
The proliferation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) across various professional domains, recreational activities, and public services underscores the necessity for computer literacy among professionals and the general populace. This demand for technical proficiency is not confined solely to individuals within the specialized field of Informatics. The absence of an email account and the inability to navigate its usage, for instance, could result in the exclusion from numerous public services. While this instance may seem trivial, the reality is that citizens' requirement for IT proficiency extends far beyond mere social engagement.
In contemporary society, there is a pervasive digitization evident in the realms of services, production, and products. Castells (2000) characterizes this era as a "Society of Networks," emphasizing the challenge of active participation and utilization of its offerings for individuals who lack familiarity with or proficiency in digital culture.
Given the pivotal role that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays in modern society, it is crucial to acknowledge its significance in achieving both economic and social goals. This underscores the necessity of integrating ICT into the education and development of individuals, thereby contributing to their personal growth and facilitating broader societal change.
This rationale supports the integration of ICT instruction within the existing basic education curriculum. However, it also necessitates a thoughtful consideration of how to effectively utilize ICT in an educational context that aligns with the comprehensive development of students. This entails strategic planning to address both the physical infrastructure and human resources required for successful implementation.
This article delves into the recommendations regarding the utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as outlined in the National Common Curricular Base (BNCC) document in Brazil, alongside presenting data concerning the current state of access to and proficiency in ICT among the Brazilian populace.
Technologies are often only partially understood based on existing knowledge. The predominant focus in technological development lies in highlighting the positive aspects of the products and the beneficial solutions they offer, neglecting their dialectical nature. This lack of consideration for the socio-historical relations between humanity and nature impedes more profound and concrete analyses.
Feenberg (2003) elucidates that in contemporary society, technology progresses as a neutral entity detached from pre-existing values, functioning merely as a tool to fulfill human objectives. This conceptualization, according to the author, characterizes technology as instrumental, relegating it to a subordinate position as a mere instrument subject to human manipulation. From this standpoint, for instance, explosives would not inherently possess a destructive purpose, as such a designation would be contingent upon human agency.
Another prevalent conception of technology, often linked with postmodernism, is the deterministic-technological perspective. In this view, technology is not merely seen as neutral but is also perceived as a force that exerts control over humans, molding society to prioritize efficiency and progress (Feenberg, 2003, p. 7). This perspective suggests that technologies are portrayed as solutions to various issues without acknowledging their underlying socio-historical contexts.
Feenberg (2003) argues that a substantive conception of technology persists, viewing it as a determinant of social directions while attributing intrinsic values to it, suggesting that humans are not in a position to alter its purposes.
In his exploration of the intricate relationship between technology and humanity, Feenberg (2003) argues for a more comprehensive analysis that involves democratic and participatory processes. He suggests that technologies should be viewed as cultural artifacts, considering their socio-historical dimensions, to ensure that their utilization is overseen collectively. This approach, he contends, allows for a balanced control over technology, informed by an understanding of both its advantages and potential risks.
Both the instrumental and deterministic perspectives, by positioning technology as neutral, overlook its inherent cultural and social values, attributing isolated human actions as the root cause. The instrumental stance solely considers technology as a tool, while the deterministic viewpoint presents it as a remedy for various social issues originating from sources beyond technological advancement.
In Brazil, the prevailing pedagogical discourse concerning technology is largely instrumental and deterministic (Peixoto & Araújo, 2012). The instrumental perspective views ICT in education solely as a didactic tool, subject to human control. Conversely, the deterministic philosophy asserts technological dominance, positioning it as the solution to educational challenges. According to these viewpoints, educational shortcomings stem from either teachers' inadequate technology utilization or schools' failure to integrate technology structurally, thereby revolutionizing education. These outlooks, focusing solely on human factors, neglect the social contexts of students and their families, absolve public authorities of their responsibilities, and fail to delve into the rationales behind schools' decisions.
In the context of Brazilian education objectives, the school's primary function is to facilitate the holistic development of students, rather than solely focusing on equipping them with skills for the labor market. This narrow focus on vocational skills can undermine the school's core mission of imparting knowledge and fostering the intellectual growth of students, as highlighted by Libâneo (2016b, p. 48). The school should aim to prepare students not just to function in the workforce but also to thrive in their broader societal context.
For intellectual development, it is imperative to engage in the technical teaching of sciences, which have been historically constructed by humanity. Through the cultivation of logical thinking within this domain, individuals can effectively reason through various life situations.
Formal instruction in educational settings should be geared towards fostering intellectual growth, a process that is facilitated by the cultivation of scientific thinking.
Formal instruction plays a crucial role in transforming cognitive activity, effectively aiding the shift from practical to theoretical operations. Schooling not only involves the acquisition of fresh knowledge but also fosters the development of novel rationales and formal frameworks for verbal, discursive, and logical thinking, detached from immediate practical encounters (Luria, 2008, p. 133; 178).
The instrumental and deterministic perspectives of technology shape a practice that diverges from the educational goals of intellectual and holistic emancipation within schools. These perspectives prioritize viewing technology solely as a tool serving humanity, neglecting its broader implications. While teaching operational skills is valuable in education, it falls short of achieving educational objectives as it fails to progress towards conceptual understanding and socio-historical relationships. Instruction limited to the operational level tends to perpetuate static everyday knowledge, hindering deeper learning and critical thinking.
Foundational knowledge is crucial for sparking and cultivating scientific understanding; however, it should not confine the scope of education. Schools play a vital role in imparting knowledge beyond the realm of everyday experiences. Relying solely on common knowledge does not enhance critical thinking skills, as a deeper comprehension of concepts is essential for fostering dialectical thinking from an early age. For instance, while many individuals may know how to bake bread, not everyone can articulate the intricate physical-chemical processes that transform dough into a loaf. Only those capable of elucidating these mechanisms truly grasp the subject matter, enabling them to analyze and innovate upon their knowledge.
The imperative to cultivate dialectical thinking throughout all levels of education is essential. Theoretical thinking does not naturally emerge or progress in individuals' everyday experiences; rather, it flourishes in response to structured guidance, with curricula grounded in a dialectical comprehension of cognition. It is this form of pedagogy that exhibits a transformative nature (Davydov, 1999, p. 5; 7).
Operational and everyday uses, devoid of explanatory and relational depth, offer limited support for critical and creative thinking. These applications primarily focus on task execution rather than providing comprehensive explanations, thus hindering the advancement of broad intellectual development.
In terms of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), a significant portion of the population utilizes cell phones on a daily basis. However, when prompted to access their email on a computer, many individuals struggle due to a lack of understanding regarding basic terms such as browser, website, or email, and uncertainty about their login credentials. These tools are typically accessed as user-friendly applications on cell phones, requiring minimal expertise for routine use. Proficiency in everyday tasks does not necessarily translate to a comprehensive understanding that enables individuals to leverage these technologies in more complex scenarios, such as professional settings or academic endeavors (Souza et al., 2020; Peixoto, 2010). In such contexts, a deeper level of knowledge may be necessary to effectively navigate and utilize ICT tools.
The notion that mere possession of digital tools guarantees complete knowledge is debunked by research (Peixoto & Araújo, 2012; Luria, 2008; Davydov, 1999), which highlights that knowledge acquisition hinges on various factors such as formal instruction, conducive teaching environments, psycho-emotional states, and more, in addition to equipment accessibility. For educators, simply having access to technology and the internet does not suffice for effective pedagogical integration of ICT within their specialized fields; they must also acquire the requisite knowledge and skills.
The contemporary shift in productive processes has led to the digitalization of numerous professional activities and services for citizens, necessitating a basic understanding of Information Technology (IT). At the federal level in Brazil, the Digital Government Secretariat within the Ministry of the Economy reports that 54% of public services had been digitized prior to the pandemic. By the conclusion of 2020, over 60% of federal services were accessible digitally, with a target of achieving full digitalization by the close of 2022 (Brasil, 2020).
The trend towards increased digitalization has been particularly pronounced in Brazil since the late 1990s. It is important to recognize that this shift is not a spontaneous occurrence but rather a consequence of deliberate political and economic decisions that align with Brazil's desire to participate in a globalized society (Enders, 2004; Akkari, 2011). The momentum towards digital transformation was further intensified by the implementation of social distancing measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to a convergence of the crisis with pre-existing government initiatives in this area.
Incentives for the implementation of the Digital Government project and other ICT integrations in public services are advocated by international multilateral organizations such as the World Bank, World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These recommendations, primarily driven by economic interests, stand in contrast to the financing options available to Brazil as highlighted in studies by Libâneo (2016a), Freitas (2011), and Evangelista (2013).
Despite the touted benefits of flexible ICT services for the general population, the driving force behind this push is primarily rooted in economic and control dynamics between developed and developing nations. The commercialization of ICT and its services often lurks beneath the surface of citizenship narratives. As noted by Brenda et al. (2018, p. 5), "citizenship has been subject to deep forms of marketization," where the entitlement to rights is contingent upon market forces and delineated by organized capacities, resources, and interests. These factors underscore the necessity for a critical evaluation of the fervor surrounding the recommendations and implementations of ICT in various services. While such advancements may lead to reduced government investments, they could also exacerbate exclusion and diminish the quality of services that rely on human resources, such as education.
In the realm of Education, the process of digitalization has mirrored economic trends, with a shift towards investing less in teacher training and societal development, and more in technologies that streamline public department management and replicate didactic content without the need for extensive human resources (Libâneo, 2016a; Freitas, 2011; Evangelista, 2013). This substitution of teachers with digital resources not only perpetuates the existing system but also caters to the interests of the dominant elites, as the compromised pedagogical quality significantly undermines the quality of learning, falling short of even the basic technical training objectives (Costa & Libâneo, 2018; Nascimento et al., 2020).
Despite these motivations, in light of the increasingly digitalized landscape that is on the rise, rather than resisting it, it is imperative that we prioritize providing quality access and training to the populace. This includes ensuring that individuals have the necessary skills to utilize Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) effectively, empowering them to be self-reliant and proficient in accessing these services. This approach not only enhances their employability but also fosters active participation in the broader societal framework.
According to IBGE surveys from 2018, approximately 33% of the Brazilian population faces some form of digital exclusion. While this may appear to be an improvement compared to 2009 when only 39% had Internet access, a closer examination reveals that 50% of individuals in the D and E socioeconomic classes still lack Internet connectivity, contrasting sharply with over 90% of those in the A and B classes who are connected (CGI.br, 2019a). These statistics underscore that the digital divide is not solely determined by age groups that have or have not been exposed to ICT from an early age. Despite the advantages enjoyed by digital natives, the issue of digital exclusion is more intricately linked to disparities in access to digital devices and educational opportunities (Conceição, 2019; Krug et al., 2018).
Digital exclusion can be understood through two interconnected aspects: lack of access to necessary equipment and the Internet, and a deficit in digital literacy. These two facets often compound each other, creating barriers to full participation in the digital realm. It is crucial to note that digital exclusion indexes are closely tied to the socioeconomic disparities present in society. In Brazil, these inequalities have deep historical roots that predate the rapid expansion of the digital landscape we see today.
According to the ICT Education 2018 research conducted by CGI.br (2019b), the ability of young individuals to utilize the Internet is significantly influenced by self-taught experiences. The study reveals that 80% of students in both public and private schools within the country acquired Internet usage skills independently, suggesting a learning approach primarily centered on fundamental common knowledge. Furthermore, the research highlights a persistent disparity between schools concerning technology utilization and the overall access to education among the population, as indicated by the statement, "the available evidence points to the continuity of inequalities between schools, both in terms of the use of technologies and in the conditions of access of the population to education in general" (CGI.br, 2019b, p. 116).
Every Brazilian citizen undergoing training is entitled to access the technical and scientific knowledge that has been developed by humanity over the course of history. Therefore, when it comes to acquiring knowledge about digital technologies, the principle remains the same:
Educators' oversight of the social implications brought about by the evolving productive process could prove detrimental to marginalized social groups. The reluctance to embrace new information and communication technologies in public schools, citing their alignment with market logic and cultural globalization, may exacerbate exclusion and social stratification. This resistance hampers the integration of these technologies into teaching practices, hindering students' access to and sharing of information, thereby leaving them vulnerable to cultural and political manipulation. It is unjust that a significant portion of the population should face exclusion amidst the rapid production and dissemination of information. (Libâneo, 2011, p. 61).
With over 81% of Brazilian students in basic education enrolled in public schools, whether municipal, state, or federal institutions (INEP, 2019), the integration of ICT education into the curriculum at this educational level in Brazil is crucial. Given that public schools serve as the primary educational platform for the majority of Brazilians, it is imperative that ICT instruction be included in their academic programs.
In our pursuit of the established goals, we have adhered to the historical-dialectical materialist method (HDM) to conduct bibliographic and documentary research.
According to Cury (1986, p. 27), contradiction stands as a fundamental category within MHD dialectics. It serves as the internal driving force behind development, embodying the most primal movement of reality. The pursuit of contradictions, whether within documents or empirical evidence, is geared towards illuminating the historical context and intricate nature of social relationships. This process aids in dispelling deterministic viewpoints, thereby unveiling the nuanced layers of societal dynamics.
in examining the documents, it is important to highlight that
Documents disseminate representations of reality and proposed solutions to identified issues, aiming to provide unique perspectives. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that any discourse, in highlighting specific objects and concepts, inevitably excludes others. This selective emphasis can serve the interests of dominant groups, raising questions about the equitable distribution of benefits among those outside these privileged circles (Ball, 1994 apud Shiroma et al., 2005, p. 439).
The Internet Steering Committee in Brazil (CGI.br, 2018a, 2018b, 2019a, 2019b) conducted a study to identify discrepancies between idealized solutions and actual outcomes by gathering BNCC data on Brazilians' ICT access in 2018 and 2019. The findings of these document analyses will be elaborated upon in the subsequent sections, categorized under A and B.
The analysis was structured around three key categories: a) The conceptual frameworks underpinning Brazilian ICT recommendations in primary education; b) The current state of access to computer and internet resources in Brazil; c) The level of public awareness and understanding of Digital and Information Communication Technologies (DICT) within the population.
In the initial curricular guidelines at the national level in Brazil (Brasil, 1997; 1998), there were evident instrumental and deterministic perspectives regarding technology, as noted by Costa (2020). These guidelines shaped the direction of Brazilian basic education until 2017, when the definitive edition of the National Common Curricular Base (BNCC) was released (Brasil, 2017), which remains the prevailing document today.
In the BNCC, there is a strong emphasis on digital information and communication technologies (DICT), with goal 5 being identified as a key structuring objective (Brasil, 2017, p. 9) for all levels of basic education and subsequently across all specific subject areas. Consequently, the integration of DICT throughout the document opens up avenues for its widespread incorporation across various levels and fields of knowledge, establishing it as a fundamental component of the Brazilian school curriculum.
In a separate section, it is asserted that digital culture has led to substantial social transformations, overlooking the influence of political-economic decisions and portraying it as an inherent rather than a socially constructed phenomenon. Consequently, the integration of Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICT) is predominantly viewed as a utilitarian instrument, closely associated with consumption patterns and the conditioning of human labor for productivity, rather than fostering the cultivation of critical and innovative thinking skills.
It is imperative to acknowledge that digital culture has instigated substantial social transformations in modern societies. The proliferation and progression of information and communication technologies, coupled with the increased accessibility of devices such as computers, cell phones, and tablets, have led to students actively engaging with this culture, not merely as consumers. This dynamic integration into the digital realm signifies a shift in how individuals interact with technology and underscores the evolving nature of contemporary societal norms (BNCC, 2017, p. 61).
The absence of critique in the document is conspicuous, as it asserts digital culture as a determining factor and presupposes the population's digital inclusion. This uncritical acceptance of technologies can be attributed to the influence of deterministic and instrumental philosophies, which, on one hand, view technologies as definitive problem-solving tools and, on the other hand, shift the burden of responsibility onto individuals who may or may not utilize them (Feenberg, 2003), without probing into their aptitude for doing so.
The integration of Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICT) in schools is often assumed and encouraged without substantial supporting data or evidence of its contextual viability, neglecting the development of critical thinking skills. DICT is typically viewed as just another teaching resource to be utilized at the discretion of the teacher. However, the Brazilian National Common Core Curriculum (BNCC) emphasizes the importance of prioritizing digital culture practices, asserting that the quality of learning is contingent upon their incorporation.
Therefore, it is imperative to prioritize work proposals that improve students' access to knowledge regarding the digital world and digital culture practices, as these have a direct or indirect influence on their daily lives across different social spheres, sparking their interest and fostering identification with Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICT). The integration of DICT in educational settings not only facilitates a more profound technical and critical understanding of these tools but also plays a crucial role in promoting meaningful and self-directed learning among students (BNCC, 2017, p. 487 - emphasis added).
The document in question demonstrates a deterministic orientation by emphasizing the implicit understanding that learning and autonomy development rely on DICT. However, it is widely acknowledged that the mere use of DICT does not suffice for fostering critical and reflective capacities or ensuring meaningful learning. Intellectual development researchers such as Davydov (1999), Luria (2008), and Libâneo (2011) argue that meaningful learning hinges on teaching methods that incorporate logical-investigative procedures tailored to each scientific discipline. This implies that the pedagogical approach, guided by the teacher, plays a crucial role in motivating students to learn and subsequently develop. It is important to note that well before the advent of DICT, educators had already been employing such teaching strategies.
Recognizing DICT as integral components of developed human culture is distinct from advocating them as exclusive remedies for social issues stemming from socio-historical decisions. The notion that technological artifacts possess the capability to resolve such problems, and furthermore, that interactions with them invariably yield positive outcomes, is a fallacy that warrants scrutiny.
The primary focus of the BNCC is to cater to the needs of the labor market.
Ensuring adequate learning for young individuals is imperative to equip them for a rapidly evolving society, enabling them to thrive in professions that are yet to emerge, utilize technologies that are yet to be developed, and tackle challenges that are yet to surface. It is widely acknowledged that the majority of forthcoming occupations will revolve around, either directly or indirectly, computing and digital technologies (BNCC, 2017, p. 473).
The correlation between an instrumental curriculum, deterministic-technological orientations, and the focus on the labor market highlights the prevalence of economic interests in the document under scrutiny, thereby negating the necessity for emancipatory suggestions. Boom (2004, p. 220 apud Libâneo, 2016b, p. 46) articulates that "despite the ostensibly humanitarian objectives and the purported safeguarding of freedom, this new approach ultimately aims at exerting a novel mode of dominion over nations and their assets."
In various other instances within the text, the argument advocating for solely instructing on tool usage over fostering critical and creative thinking becomes apparent. Consequently, the document's primary focus leans towards promoting a functional approach to Digital and Information Communication Technologies (DICT), neglecting the deeper aspects of intellectual growth and development.
To ensure the seamless integration of Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICT) into educational processes, particularly in the context of distance learning, it is imperative to address key factors such as access to equipment and internet connectivity, both within educational institutions and at students' homes. Proficiency in utilizing digital tools for academic tasks, including creating and sharing content, is equally crucial for effective engagement with course materials. This proficiency enables students to continue their learning remotely and complete assignments regardless of their location. Beyond technical considerations, factors like emotional well-being, family dynamics, and financial constraints significantly impact a student's academic performance, highlighting that the mere availability of DICT tools does not guarantee success in education (Costa & Santos, 2017; Costa et al., 2020). This discussion will focus on the importance of addressing the physical infrastructure and technological literacy in both public and private spaces to create conducive environments for effective learning through DICT.
Research data from the Internet Steering Committee in Brazil in 2019 revealed that 64% of Brazilian public schools are equipped with computer labs, while 57% have access to the Internet (CGI.br, 2019b). However, this access is predominantly restricted to the administrative areas of the schools, with many labs falling into disuse due to inadequate investments in technical maintenance and human resources. Consequently, the devices and internet connectivity available in schools are inaccessible to students in over 70% of these institutions. Merely 34% of public schools managed to upgrade their equipment between 2015 and 2018 (CGI.br, 2018a, 2018b, 2019b), as they lack consistent funding to sustain the functionality of computer labs, mobile devices, and Internet services.
It was observed that 26% of urban schools lack access to computers for student use, and only 14% of these schools utilize virtual teaching-learning platforms, albeit sporadically. In rural schools, the situation is even more challenging, with 40% having only a single computer available. Additionally, 52% of teachers resort to using cell phones for educational activities, while 65% of school administrators rely on personal cell phones for administrative tasks.
This data indicates that both urban and rural schools, particularly the latter, face significant physical and technological limitations that hinder the effective integration of Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICT) into pedagogy. Despite statistics revealing that 64% of urban public schools possess computer labs, it is important to note that these spaces are often insufficient to accommodate a full class of 30 students. The majority of these computer labs (78%) are equipped with fewer than six computers, with only a mere 9% having slightly more than 21 computers (CGI.br, 2018b, 2019b). Considering that most classes in the second phase of elementary school in Brazil consist of over 35 students, the disparity between classroom size and available technology becomes glaringly apparent.
Significant investments were made in other public spaces catering to the population's computer and internet access needs, particularly between 2002 and 2012 (Bueno, 2017). However, recent data indicates that only 45% of these spaces are currently operational, with conditions mirroring the inadequate state found in schools (CGI.br, 2018b, 2019b). These public spaces encompass libraries and technology centers, such as the Educational Technology Center (NTE), which were once accessible to the public for research purposes at no cost. Services provided included generating copies of personal public accounts (utilities) for payment, enrollment in public services and tenders, and general digital services. Additionally, basic computer courses were offered to both the community and teachers (Bueno, 2017). While not the primary location for students, these spaces served as valuable support and supplementary resources for students and the wider population alike.
In terms of home access, despite compelling quantitative data indicating that 67% of the Brazilian population over 10 years old have internet access and over 95% possess cell phones (CGI.br, 2018a, 2019a), a thorough analysis of this information is imperative to pinpoint bottlenecks and determine the extent of necessary investments in this domain, particularly for lower-income groups who rely on digital platforms for remote engagement. Among households with internet access, 56% rely on cell phones, with only 28% of these households having access to streaming services (Ibid). This underscores the constrained and shared nature of access within families, both in terms of capacity and equipment, as cell phones alone are inadequate for educational purposes.
When conducting an analysis based on social class, it becomes evident that merely 37% of Brazilian households possess both a computer and Internet connectivity. Consequently, individuals belonging to classes D and E rely predominantly on Wi-Fi and cell phones, leading to a reduced average daily usage of these technological resources.
Ownership of computers in Brazilian households peaked at 56% in the years leading up to 2016 but has since dropped to below 40% among public school students (CGI.br, 2018, 2019a). A noticeable trend from 2011 to 2019 indicates that the increasing accessibility of cell phones has led to a decline in computer ownership. This shift may be attributed to the necessity of choosing between the two devices, with cell phones being favored due to their affordability, communication features, and portability. Consequently, Internet usage has predominantly shifted to cell phones, resulting in a decrease in the number of computers per household, public telecenters, and active computer labs in schools.
On average, 70% of the population has Internet access, with over 90% accessing it through cell phones (CGI.br, 2019a). While cell phone access enhances Internet accessibility, it may also signify reduced purchasing power, limited computer literacy, or challenges in acquiring computers and higher-quality internet services. Cell phones are primarily linked to swift, day-to-day tasks, which may not necessarily reflect proficiency in utilizing these tools for academic or professional purposes. For more extensive studies, such as reading and tasks involving digital production, computers are deemed more appropriate devices.
Regarding knowledge about DICT, it is essential to highlight that the absence of this knowledge significantly impacts the broader population, encompassing both educators and students. Upon scrutinizing groups A and B, it becomes evident that a minimum of 90% of individuals possess a functional understanding of IT (CGI.br, 2019a). Conversely, within the lower socioeconomic strata, this statistic does not hold true, primarily because such educational opportunities are not yet available in public schools, where the majority of individuals from these groups are enrolled or have been enrolled. Moreover, financial constraints and work commitments prevent them from enrolling in private courses. When probed about their lack of basic informatics knowledge, respondents from classes D and E attributed it to the financial burden associated with such education (CGI.br, 2019a, 2018a).
On the whole, 56% of internet users frequently seek out various services. These services encompass a range of requests, including transportation (32%), movie-streaming services (28%), meal deliveries (12%), and paid courses (6%), among others.
In terms of teachers' digital literacy, findings indicate that 56% are proficient in manipulating files and folders, while only 29% are capable of creating files for a slide show (CGI.br, 2019b). Despite these being basic tasks, the percentage of teachers who possess these skills remains relatively low. Furthermore, the data reveals that only 34% of teachers aged over 30 have engaged in continuing education, with 54% of those under 30 having received some form of ICT training during their college years. Additionally, a significant 70% of teachers utilize Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICT) solely for their pedagogical and academic planning purposes.
In addition to the data from CGI.br, our bibliographic survey on teacher training in DICT revealed that minimal curricular changes have occurred in initial teacher training, despite ICT being a recommended component of the official Brazilian curriculum since the mid-1990s (Gatti & Barreto, 2009; Lopes & Furkotter, 2016; Dorneles, 2012; Santos, 2009; Marinho, 2008).
According to Lopes and Furkotter (2016), the prevalent situation in college degree programs often involves a significant lack of subjects that explore the integration of ICT in the teaching and learning processes. When these topics do appear in undergraduate curricula, they tend to be narrowly focused on technical aspects and are often disconnected from other disciplines.
In terms of teachers' continuing education, Marinho (2008) illustrated that while certain government programs were accessible, their reach was limited. Primarily, these programs focused on initial training rather than the necessary updates and more comprehensive ongoing education required for teachers.
An essential consideration for the effective implementation of DICT in educational settings is the presence of a diverse team of professionals, typically including a computer technician and a pedagogical facilitator. The computer technician's role, which was established in the State of Goiás from 2006 to 2013 and varied throughout Brazil, primarily involved supporting teachers in computer labs with the integration of ICT into pedagogy and subject-specific knowledge (Bueno, 2017; Brito, 2008). In many schools, the facilitator was a teacher from any discipline, tasked with a range of responsibilities. However, in certain regions, the facilitator might have been a computer technician. The broad scope of duties assigned to this individual often led to a lack of focus on pedagogical aspects, particularly when the professional lacked a background in teaching.
The presence of a motivating individual in the laboratories provided a sense of security for teachers in navigating the technical environment and potential complications, while also aiding in content development and tool selection. Ideally, this professional's focus should lean towards pedagogy, complementing rather than replacing the technical support provided by a technician in the school. This specialized support in the pedagogical use of DICT is crucial, yet unfortunately, the presence of such motivators is scarce in public schools according to Brito (2008). Moreover, the absence of a dedicated computer technician per school further complicates the technical support landscape.
Based on the data analysis, it is evident that ICT access in Brazil has seen a quantitative evolution through cell phones; however, there has been a qualitative decline. This decline is primarily observed in the reduced access to computer devices essential for advanced studies and professional tasks, along with diminished access through educational institutions and public facilities. The research indicates a minimal advancement in academic and professional ICT knowledge among teachers, as highlighted in the aforementioned literature review.
Access to digital and information communication technology (DICT) for the general population has not progressed significantly, as it continues to be excluded from formal education in public schools due to insufficient technological and human resources. Consequently, these institutions are unable to effectively incorporate DICT into their curriculum. The social classes that would benefit most from this education, specifically classes D and E, are the most economically disadvantaged. To acquire even basic computer skills, individuals from these classes must seek out private training facilities, as public telecenters also face similar resource challenges. Consequently, individuals from these classes often possess only rudimentary knowledge of digital tools, if any at all.
Over 90% of Brazilians' utilization of DICT pertains to daily activities, primarily encompassing communication through instant messaging and social media posting (CGI.br, 2019a). This reliance is closely tied to cell phone usage, which, in turn, does not ensure a comprehensive technical grasp necessary for individuals' intellectual and holistic advancement. It is crucial not to equate cell phone access with progress or proficiency in IT, especially given the limited depth of understanding regarding their functionalities.
According to Davydov (1999), possessing basic IT knowledge is insufficient for the optimal development of individuals. Merely owning a cell phone, regardless of its sophistication, without the corresponding understanding of its functionalities or technical capabilities, signifies a misguided progression in terms of digital inclusion metrics and technical proficiency in IT access.
In light of the scenario outlined, it is evident that the lack of adequate technological infrastructure in public schools and households supports the notion that neither entity is adequately equipped for a curriculum that necessitates the use of digital tools and technical expertise. Compounding this issue is the inadequate training of teachers, which hinders their ability to effectively integrate DICT into curriculum development and enhance their specialized areas of expertise.
The challenges faced by school teams, parents, and students during the pandemic period were exacerbated by pre-existing conditions, highlighting the urgent need for adaptations to emergency remote education within a limited timeframe. To ensure the successful continuation of various distance education models, it is imperative for public authorities to acknowledge their responsibility in consistently updating and maintaining adequate technological infrastructure in schools, as well as providing focused teacher training. As noted by Brenda et al. (2018, p. 5), the withdrawal of the state from social responsibilities has facilitated the rise of privatization and speculation. In addition to this, initiatives should be launched to encourage increased IT utilization in households with students, going beyond mere inclusion in the national curriculum to ensuring that the necessary resources are accessible to the population.
The BNCC is founded on the premise that technological advancements are pivotal in addressing and resolving educational challenges in Brazil. However, the incorporation of knowledge, which is historically accumulated by humanity, is often driven by its own agenda, heavily influenced by market forces, thereby disconnecting from the socio-economic realities of Brazil. The recommendations primarily emphasize the provision of teaching tools, which should only be a component of the broader spectrum of ICT knowledge to be disseminated to students. There is a notable absence of details regarding the allocation of resources for enhancing the technological infrastructure of schools, the training of educators to effectively utilize digital tools, and the assurance of internet accessibility in households.
While the BNCC's guidance on DICT may not be deemed critical or emancipatory, its absence in schools effectively negates its relevance in today's tangible society, thereby perpetuating the status quo favoring dominant classes. Refusing the incorporation of ICT into educational processes under the pretext of unequal access capabilities fails to shield those without access and hinders efforts to rectify conditions that sustain exclusion. Moreover, the failure to integrate ICT in educational processes forfeits the chance to approach it critically, allowing space for instrumental and deterministic views to solidify further.
The essential conditions are lacking, both in public schools and in households in classes D and E, which encompass students attending such schools. The majority of Brazilian public schools lack the necessary human and technological resources to facilitate teaching that integrates ICT, whether in-person or remotely. In reality, the extent of what can be achieved, even during the pandemic, is limited to the distribution of materials through various messaging applications. Subsequently, students complete the assigned tasks and submit them using the same devices. True distance education is unattainable under these circumstances. Consequently, the rhetoric surrounding the flexibility and benefits of remote learning, as well as the use of devices in general, has been employed to persuade individuals. However, in practice, there has been a lack of online education characterized by interactive engagement and comprehensive training, as highlighted by authors such as Costa and Libâneo (2018), even prior to the onset of the pandemic.
Investments in technological infrastructure in schools, incentives for students to acquire equipment and internet access, and training teachers to effectively utilize ICT are not commensurate with the persistent push for ICT integration and hybrid teaching methods in Brazil. While the government allocates resources towards digitalizing its services, there is a noticeable lack of investment in infrastructure development and the dissemination of knowledge among individuals to enable their active participation in these services. The government's focus primarily revolves around digitalization efforts aimed at cost-saving measures within public spending, neglecting crucial investments that directly benefit the population.
The BNCC addresses the utilization of ICT in the context of Brazilian schools and households. It also formalizes public interest and establishes a legal framework that can stimulate investments and necessary alterations to accomplish its defined goals. Therefore, it is crucial to request from governmental bodies the necessary resources for investing in schools, providing teacher training, and offering tailored access packages for students' homes in public schools.
In addition to school environments, it is imperative for the government to guarantee quality access to computers and the internet. This is crucial as school activities increasingly extend into the home setting, necessitating online research and collaborative work. Failure to provide adequate access risks perpetuating outdated modes of education, transforming traditional correspondence education into a digital equivalent.
The imperative integration of ICT in education is undeniable given its cultural significance in contemporary society. It is crucial to incorporate them through critical pedagogical approaches that take into account their socio-historical and cultural dimensions for comprehensive human development. Failure to do so not only perpetuates the cycle of digital exclusion, particularly for marginalized populations, but also reinforces the dominance of instrumental and deterministic pedagogical methods. Rather than rejecting the incorporation of ICT in educational settings, which exacerbates exclusion and perpetuates inequities, efforts should be directed towards enhancing the quality of public schools and ensuring the availability of skilled educators to elevate teaching standards.
