Perceived vulnerability to Coronavirus 
infection: impact on dental practice
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus responsible for the outbreak of the 
respiratory disease COVID-19, which has spread to several countries 
around the world, causing considerable consternation and a fear of 
contagions in global healthcare settings. The objective of this study is 
to identify, among Madrid’s adult population, the impact of COVID-19 
on self-perceived vulnerability, infectiousness, aversion to germs, and 
other behaviors in the current situation regarding dental practice. This 
cross-sectional observational study involves 1,008 persons randomly 
surveyed on the streets of Madrid, Spain between March 1 and March 8, 
2020. Their perceived vulnerability to disease was measured using the 
perceived vulnerability to disease scale. An additional questionnaire 
evaluated basic sociodemographic aspects, medical history, personal 
hygiene behavior, willingness to go to certain places and the perception 
of the risk of contagion when going to a dental practice. There are 
significant differences by sex on the germ aversion subscale (p < 0.05) 
and in the risk of waiting in the waiting room (p < 0.01), tooth extraction 
((p < 0.05), endodontics (p < 0.05) and fillings ((p < 0.05). Women 
consider the risk to be higher than men do. The risk group (over 60 and 
with systemic disease) has significant differences on the subscales of 
infectivity (p < 0.01) and germ aversion (p < 0.01). Our study shows high 
levels of vulnerability regarding contracting COVID-19 and avoiding 
dental care as perceived by the population over 60 years old and with a 
systemic disease.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus responsible for the outbreak of the respiratory 
disease COVID-19, which has spread to several countries around the world, 
causing considerable consternation in global health care. On January 30, 
following the second meeting of the IHR (International Health Regulations) 
Emergency Committee, the WHO Director-General declared this outbreak 
a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern) because 
it is a public health risk due its worldwide spread, which requires an 
internationally coordinated response. 
SARS-CoV-2 is a virus in the Coronaviridae family, which is 
composed of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that have a 
Declaration of Interests: The authors 
certify that they have no commercial or 
associative interest that represents a conflict 
of interest in connection with the manuscript.

Perceived vulnerability to Coronavirus infection: impact on dental practice
characteristic appearance in negative stain electron 
microscopy.1 COVID-19 produces clinical pictures 
ranging from the common cold to more serious 
symptoms, such as those caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle 
East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV).
This new type of coronavirus appeared in late 
December of 2019 in Wuhan, China. It is highly 
infectious in human populations and mainly 
transmitted via respiratory droplets and physical 
contact.2 Several factors allowed for the rapid spread 
of this virus: Wuhan is the capital of China’s Hubei 
Province, and it is a major transport hub, increasing 
person-to-person contact and the possibility of 
exporting cases to other locations.1 In addition, the 
asymptomatic incubation period for infected persons 
has been reported as approximately 1–14 days. 
Patients with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection 
have had an average age of 55 years (cases in children 
appear to be rare).3 Symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, 
dry cough, dyspnea, and, in the most severe cases, 
pneumonia.1,4,5 The severity of the disease appears 
to be associated with age, with elderly populations 
most at risk; those over 80 years old had a 14.8 percent 
fatality rate (CFR).6,7 The CFR was also higher for those 
with comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, 
and cancer.6 SARS-CoV-2 will cause many more deaths 
than its predecessors despite having a mortality rate 
lower than MERS-CoV infections because there have 
been many more cases.1
Learning how to approach COVID-19 patients for 
diagnosis and treatment is urgent, as is learning to 
stop or reduce the number of infections because no 
specific treatment for the new coronavirus currently 
exists. However, some antivirals that are being used 
have shown some effectiveness in recent studies.6,8,9 
Common transmission routes of the new coronavirus 
include direct transmission (coughing, sneezing, and 
transmission by inhaling large or small droplets) and 
contact transmission (contact with oral, nasal, and 
ocular mucous membranes).10,11,12,13
Mortality is clearly associated with the virus, 
but the most worrying problem will be a health care 
system so overwhelmed by the rapid transmission 
of the virus that affected patients cannot receive 
necessary care. Patients with other urgent medical 
conditions are also at risk of not getting necessary 
care. Countries with vulnerable health care systems 
are of particular concern.
Through social networks and the media, many 
people have received alarming news about those 
infected. This news can negatively affect the 
population and generate stress, fear of infection, 
frustration, and inadequate supplies of masks, safety 
glasses, hand sanitizer, food, and more. Although 
the new coronavirus mortality rate is between 2% 
and 3%, the prevention of a disease can turn into a 
fear of contagion. This fear of contagion is mainly 
promoted in places with a large influx of people, 
such as shopping centers, transportation centers, 
and gyms, and in spaces where contact with body 
fluids occurs, such as hospitals, health centers, and 
dental clinics.
Patients and dental professionals can be exposed 
to pathogenic microorganisms, including viruses 
and bacteria, that infect oral cavities and respiratory 
tracts.12 Dental care settings clearly carry the risk 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection because of their specific 
procedures, which involve face-to-face communication 
with patients and frequent exposure to saliva, blood, 
and other body fluids, as well as handling sharp 
instruments.12 Pathogenic microorganisms can be 
transmitted in dental environments by inhaling 
airborne microorganisms that may remain suspended 
in the air for long periods;14 by direct contact with 
patients’ blood or oral fluids;15 by contact of the 
conjunctival, nasal or oral mucosa with droplets and 
aerosols containing microorganisms generated by 
an infected individual and propelled at close range 
by coughing and speaking without the use of a 
mask;16,17 and by indirect contact with contaminated 
instruments and/or environmental surfaces.18
The recent emergence of COVID-19 means that the 
understanding of its transmission patterns, severity, 
clinical features, and risk factors for infection remains 
low, whether among the general population, medical 
personnel, or families. Therefore, studies to evaluate 
the general population’s vulnerability to the spread of 
germs and to the current disease are greatly important 
due to its impact on their daily activity and, more 
specifically, on dental check-ups or treatment.

This study aims to identify, among Madrid’s 
adult population, the impact of the current 
COVID-19 pandemic on self-perceived vulnerability, 
infectiousness, aversion to germs, and other behaviors 
that impact dental practice.
Methodology
Study design and setting
To address the purpose of this research, the 
researchers designed and conducted a cross-sectional 
observational study.
This cross-sectional study involved 1,008 
Caucasian participants aged 18 years and older who 
were randomly surveyed on the streets of Madrid, 
Spain between March 1 and March 8 of 2020. 
The study’s participants were between 18 and 83 
years old. The participants were 41.50% male and 
58.50% female. Participants who reported symptoms 
that could be attributed to an infectious disease at 
the time of data collection were excluded because 
this could affect their responses.
All participants were told the purpose of the 
study, given basic instructions for completing the 
survey, and informed that all their data would be 
recorded anonymously. They signed an informed 
consent statement prior to their inclusion in the 
study. Our study was approved by the Rey Juan 
Carlos University Ethics and Research Committee 
(Registration number: 0103202006520).
Instruments
The current study used the following self-reported 
measurements: the perceived vulnerability to disease 
was assessed via the perceived vulnerability to 
disease scale validated in Spanish by Magallares 
et al.19 The scores of the participants were obtained 
by averaging their responses to the items on this 
scale. Higher scores indicated greater perceived 
vulnerability to infection. The response format 
was a seven-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 
1 (“Strongly Disagree”) to 7 (“Strongly Agree”). 
This scale has 2 subscales. One captures perceived 
infectiousness and is assessed by 7 items (e.g., “I am 
more likely to catch an infectious disease than people 
in my environment”), and the other captures germ 
aversion and is assessed by 6 items (e.g., “I prefer 
to wash my hands right after shaking someone’s 
hand”). The internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) 
of these subscales in this study was 0.78 for perceived 
infectivity and 0.72 for germ aversion.
The participants were also asked about:
a.	 Basic sociodemographic aspects (gender, age 
and level of education).
b.	 Medical history, specifically about the presence 
of cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, 
immunosuppression, or diabetes. 
c.	 Personal hygiene behaviors, such as using 
a mask or disinfectant and hand washing. 
The response format was carried out via a 
dichotomous question (yes/no).
d.	 The fear of going to the dentist and whether 
they would cancel an appointment for fear of 
infection. The response format was carried out 
via a dichotomous question (yes/no). 
e.	 The perception of risk of contagion when 
visiting certain places, and the survey asked 
participants to rate those places according to 
the risk of coronavirus infection (dental clinic, 
supermarket, cinema/theater, hospital, sports 
stadium, gymnasium, nightclub, health center, 
public toilet, library, and domestic flight). 
A five-point Likert scale from 1 (“No risk”) to 5 
(“Very high risk”) was used. 
f.	 The perception of risk of contagion from going 
to a dental clinic for certain dental procedures or 
in certain situations (e.g., being the last patient 
of the day, waiting in the room for more than 
15 minutes, being treated with an extraction, 
root canal, filling or a scale and polish, or just a 
simple check-up). A five-point Likert scale from 
1 (“No risk”) to 5 (“Very high risk”) was used.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 
version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The data analysis 
included descriptive statistics and the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test to evaluate the assumption of normality, 
which was confirmed. To find possible differences 
according to gender and the risk group for coronavirus 
infection (being older than 60 years and having a

baseline systemic disease), t-tests were performed 
for quantitative variables and chi-square tests for 
variables. Previous literature assumes that the elderly 
population with comorbidities has a higher risk for 
developing and dying from COVID-19.20 Significance 
levels were established at 0.05.
Results
In terms of education levels for the total sample, 
12.3% had completed primary school, 27.7% had 
completed secondary school, and 60% had obtained 
a university degree.
Regarding systemic diseases, 3.5% of the subjects 
had some type of cardiovascular disease, 6.9% 
had some type of respiratory disease, 2.6% were 
immunosuppressed, and 1.6% had diabetes.
The M and SD were 3.29 (1.15) for infectivity 
subscales and 4.14 (1.19) for germ aversion. Of the 
sample, 2.3% used masks on the street, 38.7% used 
disinfectant gel, 76.1% washed their hands when they 
arrived home, 91.6% were not afraid of contracting the 
coronavirus in the dental clinic, and 90.1% would not 
cancel a dental appointment for fear of contracting the 
coronavirus. As seen in Table 1, the average highest 
risk was for a hospital at 3.38 (1.12), outpatients at 3.26 
(1.10), and dental clinics at 3.06 (1.09). For all cases, the 
risk was medium. For clinical procedures, the most 
highly perceived risk was being the last patient of 
the day (Table 2).
Gender differences for the study variables
No significant differences by gender existed in 
the infectability subscale, but differences existed in 
the germ aversion subscale (p < 0.05).
No significant differences were found for safety 
and protection measures, except that hand disinfectant 
was used (x2 = 11,321, df = 1, p = 0.001) significantly 
more by women. No significant differences existed 
between the genders in the fear of going to the 
dental clinic or in canceling appointments due to 
coronavirus infection.
No significant differences existed between the 
two groups in the risk of visiting any space. However, 
significant differences appeared in the risk of dental 
procedures, such as waiting in the waiting room 
(p < 0.01), having a tooth extraction (p < 0.05), and 
having endodontic (p < 0.05) and filling procedures 
(p < 0.05). Women considered the risk to be higher 
than men do for these variables (Table 3). 
Differences in the study variables 
for the risk group
The sample was separated on the basis of the 
following risk factors: having at least one underlying 
systemic disease (cardiovascular disease, respiratory 
disease, immunosuppression, or diabetes) and being 
over 60 years old (34 subjects).
Significant differences existed in the infectivity 
(p < 0.01) and germ aversion (p < 0.01) subscales.
Significant differences were found for safety 
and protection measures, such as using masks 
(x2 = 169,221, df = 1, p = 0.000) and disinfectants

(x2 = 5,641, df = 1, p = 0.018), but no significant 
differences existed regarding hand washing.
Significant differences existed between groups in 
the fear of going to the dental clinic due to coronavirus 
infection (x2 = 128,125, df = 1, p = 0.000) and in 
canceling appointments (x2 = 113,635, df = 1, p = 
0.000), with higher scores in the risk group.
Significant differences existed between both 
groups for the risk of visiting a dental clinic (p <.01), a 
hospital (p <.01), a nightclub (p <0.01), a health center 
(p < 0.01), a sports stadium (p < 0.01), or a public toilet 
(p <.01), or taking a domestic flight (p < 0.05). The 
risk group shows a higher average than the nonrisk 
group does for all spaces, except for the nightclub 
and sports stadium.
For the risk of dental procedures, the risk group 
shows significantly higher scores than the nonrisk 
group does for all procedures (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study, we explored the role of perceived 
vulnerability to infectiousness and germ aversion 
in the population, as well as the perception of 
contracting the coronavirus. Despite global efforts 
to contain the spread of COVID-19 the outbreak 
continues to grow due to the pattern of spread of 
this infection. In Europe, the countries with the 
most confirmed cases are Italy, Spain, Germany 
and France. In recent days, a significant increase

Perceived vulnerability to Coronavirus infection: impact on dental practice
in cases has been reported internationally in Iran, 
South Korea and the United States.
The coronavirus pandemic in Spain reached its 
first critical point on the 9th of March, with the number 
of infected cases doubling in 24 hours. On March 14, 
the government took strong measures to contain the 
disease and declared a state of emergency in order 
to slow down the rate of infection. When the survey 
was carried out (from the 1st to the 8th of March), 
there were 1,024 confirmed cases in Spain, compared 
to 39,673 at the time of writing and this situation is 
reflected in our results. Only the population at risk 
(over 60 years of age) perceived the dental clinic as a 
high risk area for possible contagion, and therefore, 
only this risk group acted accordingly, avoiding 
dental services. The results of the study emphasize 
that, when the survey was conducted, the remaining 
population did not present high levels of perception 
of infectivity and germ aversion, without having 
modified their daily activities (including their dental 
treatments and check-ups). This attitude contributed 
to the rapid spread of the disease. Due to the unique 
characteristics of dental procedures, where a large 
number of drops and aerosols can be generated, 
and the close proximity of the working area, the 
standard protective measures routinely used in a 
dental practice (surgical mask, gloves, protective 
nonwaterproof eyewear and a nonwaterproof gown) 
are not sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19, 
especially when patients are in the incubation period 
as they do not know that they are infected or choose 
to hide their infection. 21,22,23
This research shows that a high percentage of 
the population followed the prevention protocol 
recommended by health authorities; 76.1% washed 
their hands when they arrived home and 38.7% 
used hand sanitizer. Despite this, the number of 
cases has been increasing; a significant percentage 
of infected people (approximately 14%) are health 
professionals. On March 15, the New York Times 
published an article entitled “Workers at Highest 
Risk of Coronavirus”, where an impressive schematic 
figure described that dentists are the workers most at 
risk of being affected by COVID-19, much more than 
nurses and general practitioners.24,25 Already at the 
beginning in Wuhan, of the 44,672 initial cases, 3,019 
(6.75%) were health workers. A recent clinical study 
indicated that 29% of the 138 hospitalized patients 
with COVID-19-infected pneumonia in Wuhan 
were healthcare workers.5 With increased public 
awareness and the uniform adoption of personal 
protective equipment, the risk has progressively 
decreased in Hubei Province.22 Dental professionals 
are particularly at risk if they work on an infected 
patient due to close contact and the risk of exposure 
to blood, saliva and droplets. 
This study shows significant differences in germ 
aversion, with the figures being higher in women 
than in men. This finding is consistent with previous 
results obtained in the literature.26,27 This can be 
justified by the emotional characteristics involved 
in the perception of a situation of uncertainty since 
the literature supports that women, in general, have 
a greater aversion to risk than men, although this 
question is not sufficiently studied.
This study also contributes to the understanding 
of why people over 60 with a systemic pathology 
would not go to the dentist; it is because they believe 
that it is easier to contract the coronavirus, especially 
when you are the last patient of the day, if you are late 
and must wait for more than 15 minutes, or before 
treatments, such as a dental extraction, a root canal 
or a filling.  
It is also important to recognize some limitations in 
this study. First, the representativeness of our sample of 
convenience may be questioned. However, the gender 
of the participants was reasonably balanced among 
the subjects, and the prevalence of vulnerability to 
infectivity and aversion to germs found in the sample 
was within the range identified in previous studies 
carried out in the adult population.26 
A possible second limitation comes from the 
use of self-report measures, which can be affected 
by responses based on social desirability. Third, 
the timing of the study and its cross-sectional 
design have reflected a very specific moment in 
time when the disease began to spread. Despite 
this, the information obtained is very valuable 
given the well-known dramatic situation that was 
happening in our neighboring country, Italy. The 
vulnerabilities of the populations, in general, were 
similar; therefore, the disease could lead to very

similar results in Spain as far as the seriousness of 
the spread is concerned, increasing the numbers of 
infections and deaths.28 
This research has some relevant implications for 
dental practice. During the period of data collection, 
cases and fatalities due to COVID-19 had already 
been detected in Spain. Despite this detection, the 
study shows how the population stated that they 
would not modify their activities related to the 
dental clinic. Furthermore, during this time, the 
health authorities did not report any restrictions on 
dental activity.29,30 These two factors, together with 
the lack of personal protective equipment reported 
by the Council of Dentists, have contributed to the 
spread of the virus.31,32
On 16th March 2020, the General Council of 
Dentists recommended that dentists postpone elective 
procedures for the next five weeks33, which could be 
extended depending on the evolution of the pandemic, 
and recommended that they only provide treatment 
for dental emergencies.34,35 This fact, together with 
the shortage of personal protective equipment, has 
forced the closure of most dental clinics36,37, leading to 
an interruption of oral treatment with the consequent 
deterioration of the population’s oral health and a 
high economic impact on this sector.31,38
Future lines of research will be required, at the 
end of the pandemic, to confirm the real impact on 
the oral health of the population and the economic 
effect on dental clinics.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study shows the high levels of 
vulnerability to contracting COVID-19 as perceived 
by the population over 60 years of age with a baseline 
disease at the beginning of the epidemic in Spain and 
their avoidance of dental care. The results differ for 
the remaining population, which presents low levels 
of vulnerability to contracting COVID-19.
