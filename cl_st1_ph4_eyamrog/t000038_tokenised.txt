We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to empirically derive the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) factor structure. Data (peri-traumatic stress during the COVID-19). We used data from the Physical and Psychological Reactions as Health Indicators Research (Virtual Laboratory of Affective, Cognitive and Behavioral Neuropsychometry – LAVINACC). EFA was implemented using a Polychoric Matrix and Robust Diagonally Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method. We used the Parallel Analysis with random permutation, and as a rotation technique, we used the Robust Promin. The adequacy of the model was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) fit indices. The Ratio Communality Index (RCI) reported (RCI = 0.998452) showed both subsamples have a similar amount of common variance. Results showed adequacy of the polychoric correlation matrix measured by Bartlett's sphericity (21116.6, (df = 276; p < 0.00001) and KMO = 0.939. The overall assessment (UniCo = 0.918; ECV = 0.85), MIREAL = 0.200), suggested that CPDI can be treated as a two-factor structure: first factor (internal stressors), second factor (external stressors). Replication studies to verify further validity and reliability should be undertaken.
The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is one of the most significant health challenges on a global scale this century. By 2022, two years after the outbreak in China in late 2019, there had been more than 62 million deaths worldwide from COVID-19. As no one can predict how the pandemic will evolve, this can lead the population to experience stress, fear, and anguish for a long time (Danese et al. 2020). Previous research has revealed a profound and wide range of psychosocial impacts on people at the individual levels during the outbreak of infection (Abad et al. 2020). People are likely to experience fear of falling sick or dying, feelings of helplessness, and stigma (Wang et al. 2020).
Through 2020 and 2021, the Virtual Laboratory of Affective, Cognitive, and Behavioral Neuropsychometry – LAVINACC – conducted the Physical and Psychological Reactions as Health Indicators throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic research. Among other indicators, they researched the peri-traumatic stress during the COVID-19 pandemics in Brazil using the Peri- Traumatic Distress Scale (CPDI) (Qiu et al. 2020) to a sample of 1844 participants (Abad et al. 2020).
According to Qiu et al. (2020), CPDI inquired about the frequency of 22 factors (Anger; Anxiety; Negative Mood; Irritableness; Exhaustion; Sluggishness; Helplessness; Avoidance; Indecisiveness; Sleeplessness; Poor Appetite; Distrust; Physical Symptoms; Bladder and Bowel; Obsessive Behavior; Insecurity; Fear; Sadness; Spread Negative News; Social function; Lack of Judgement; Attention Deficit). Shanghai Mental Health Center Psychiatrists verified the CPDI content validity. The Cronbach’s alpha of CPDI is 0.95 (p<0.001) (Qiu et al. 2020). This research aims to empirically derive the factor structure of the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI).
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to empirically derive the factor structure of the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) (Qiu et al. 2020). We used FACTOR, a program developed to fit the EFA model using a variety of procedures (e g., number of factors/components to be retained, factor and component analysis, rotation methods) (Lorezo-Seva e Ferrando 2013). As a preliminary analysis, the program performed SOLOMON (splitting a sample into subsamples in factor analysis) to assess if both subsamples have a similar common variance amount (Lorenzo-Seva 2021).
We implemented EFA using a Polychoric Matrix and Robust Diagonally Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method. RDWLS is advised when the univariate distributions of ordinal items are asymmetric) (Asparouhov e Muthén 2010). We used the Parallel Analysis with random permutation as an improved method to asses dimensionality. We based the decision of dimensionality on the percentage of common explained variance (Timmerman e Lorenzo-Seva 2011). As a rotation technique, we used the Robust Promin (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018).
We evaluated the adequacy of the model using the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) fit indices. According to Brown (2015), RMSEA values must be less than 0.08, with confidence intervals not reaching 0.10. TLI and CFI values must be above 0.90, or preferably 0.95.
Additionally, We use the H index to assess how well a set of items represents a common factor – factor stability – (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018). H values range from 0 to 1, showing the latent variable strength across different studies (High H values (> 0.80) suggest a well-defined latent variable, low H values suggest an ill-defined latent variable) (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018).
As a preliminary approach – the sample was over 400 observations (n = 1844) – FACTOR performed the SALOMON splitting method (Lorenzo-Seva 2021). The Ratio Communality Index (RCI) reported (RCI = 0.998452) showed both subsamples have a similar amount of common variance (the closer its value to 1, the most comparable subsamples are) (Lorenzo- Seva 2021). We have a kurtosis (p < 0.05), which indicates our data do not have a normal distribution. Therefore, the Diagonally Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method is suitable for categorical data that do not have a normal distribution (Asparouhov e Muthén 2010).
Adequacy of the polychoric correlation matrix measured by Bartlett's sphericity 21116.6, (df = 276; p < 0.00001) and KMO = 0.939 tests suggested the interpretability of the items' correlation matrix. Parallel analysis suggested two factors as being the most representative of the data (See Table 1).
We present item factor loadings in Table 2. We also report the estimates of replicability of factor scores (H-index). This index evaluates how well a set of items represents a common factor (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018). High H values (>.80) suggest a well-defined latent variable, which is more likely to be stable across studies; low H values indicate a poorly defined latent variable, which is likely to change across studies (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018).
Unidimensional Congruence (UniCo = 0.918) suggested data cannot be treated as essentially unidimensional (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018). Nevertheless, Explained Common Variance (ECV = 0.85) was within the limit, as values larger than 0.85 suggests that data can be treated as essentially unidimensional. Finally, the Mean of Item Residual Absolute Loadings (MIREAL) value (MIREAL = 0.200), lower than 0.300 suggests that data can be treated as essentially unidimensional. Additionally, the adjustment indexes which assess whether the obtained factor structure is suitable for the database show strong criteria indexes attesting to the plausibility of this model: Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA = 0.067); Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI = 0.976).
The Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) proposed to remove one item (21 Recently, I rarely talk to my family) (MSA = 0.55089) (Lorenzo e Ferrando 2021). Nevertheless, Pratt's relative importance indicator that measures how much each of the factors explains the item’s variance showed item #21 is significant for the first factor, therefore the decision was to retain the item.
The quality and Effectiveness of Factor Score estimates (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018) showed: Factor Determinacy Index (FDI = 0.982) for factor 1, and (FDI = 0.933) for factor 2; ORION marginal reliability showed (ORION = 0.964) for factor 1 and (ORION = 0.871) for factor 2 as factorial score reliability indicators. Finally, the Sensitivity ratio (SR) score was for the first factor (SR = 5.200) and (SR = 2.597) for the second factor.
Our results point out a two-factor structure of the CPDI (Qiu et al. 2020) that could be congruent if we consider stress as the physiological or psychological response to internal or external stressors (VandenBos 2015). The first factor, internal stressors (items 1, 4, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 20, 23, and 24) is suitable for inner manifestations [e g., palpitations, sweating, dry mouth, shortness of breath, fidgeting, accelerated speech, augmentation of negative emotions, longer duration of stress fatigue (VandenBos 2015)]. The second factor – external stressors (items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 22) [e g., any event, force, or condition that results in physical or emotional stress (VandenBos 2015)]. Probably, it is advisable to reformulate items (5, 6, and 21). Since the present findings are preliminary, further replication studies for validity and reliability should be conducted.
