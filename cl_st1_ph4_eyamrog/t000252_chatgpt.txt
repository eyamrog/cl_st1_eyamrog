Objective: This study aims to leverage the benefits of a ratio scale incorporating verbal anchors to assess risk perception related to the novel coronavirus infection, responsible for causing covid-19, within a questionnaire grounded in the health belief model. The primary focus is on evaluating the validity and reproducibility of this measurement approach.
METHOD: The study employed the Health Belief Model, encompassing four key dimensions: perceived susceptibility (assessed through five questions), perceived severity (also evaluated through five questions), perceived benefits (explored via five questions), and perceived barriers (addressed through five questions). In addition to these dimensions, a fifth component, termed pro-health motivation, was included and assessed through four questions. The questionnaire, comprising a total of 24 questions, was distributed electronically through social networks over a one-week period. Responses were quantified using subjective representations, measured on a psychophysically constructed scale with verbal anchors ratio (CentiMax®). On average, participants took 12 minutes to complete the questionnaire (standard deviation = 1.6).
Results: A total of 277 complete responses were collected for the form, with one response being excluded due to the participant being under 18 years old. Reproducibility measures indicated significance for 22 out of the 24 questions in the questionnaire, with a Cronbach’s α value of 0.883. Convergent validity was confirmed by Spearman-Brown’s split half reliability coefficient, showing a strong correlation of r = 0.882. The analysis revealed that significant differences among groups were particularly pronounced in the perceived susceptibility and severity dimensions, while being less prominent in the perceived benefits and barriers dimensions.
In conclusion, our questionnaire, grounded in the Health Belief Model and utilizing quantitative measures, effectively validated common perceptions regarding the risks associated with COVID-19 infection. The strength of our methodology lies in its ability to swiftly, accurately, and quantitatively pinpoint individual belief patterns across various dimensions within the questionnaire. This feature proves invaluable in facilitating communication strategies and enhancing public health education efforts.
In recent years, several viruses have garnered significant attention from the medical and scientific communities due to the substantial risks they pose to international public health. Notably, coronaviruses have emerged as a focal point, primarily due to the severe respiratory syndromes they induce. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are particularly well-known examples of these viruses, with considerable international impact.
A recent outbreak of human infection by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, now named SARS-CoV-2) has been documented in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Between December 8, 2019, and January 2, 2020, there were 41 reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus rapidly spread to various Chinese cities, leading to the Chinese government reporting 59,901 patients diagnosed with pneumonia and 1,368 fatalities due to the novel coronavirus infection by February 13, 2020. Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially designated the 2019-nCoV infection as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Due to the ease of travel between countries, the rapid and intense spread of COVID-19 cases has prompted authorities in various nations to implement non-pharmaceutical control measures, including social isolation, to curb transmission. Countries like Italy and Spain have encountered challenges in gaining population compliance with these measures. Brazil has also implemented similar strategies to contain the virus. The issue of public adherence to behavioral controls may similarly arise in our own country.
Understanding the determinants that contribute to individuals' resistance towards adhering to protective measures against the spread of the virus is crucial for the efficacy of social isolation-centered public policies, aiming to mitigate non-compliance with recommended social controls. It is anticipated that the Health Belief Model will aid in identifying these determinants influencing such behaviors.
The Health Belief Model, developed in the 1950s, serves as a framework to elucidate patient behavior concerning illness or the potential for falling ill. This model posits that positive factors enhance pro-health behaviors, while negative factors diminish or impede them. Therefore, for individuals to embrace health-promoting behaviors and mitigate disease risks, they must: (1) acknowledge their susceptibility to the disease; (2) recognize that the disease will have a negative impact, to some extent, on their life; (3) understand that adopting specific behaviors can effectively reduce their susceptibility or, if already affected, the severity of the illness; and (4) overcome significant psychological barriers crucial for successful prevention or treatment. The model has found diverse applications, including assessing diabetes severity, identifying protective factors for bulimia, determining factors influencing oral health care, and exploring cultural perceptions of dementias.
This study aims to utilize the expanded Health Belief Model to delineate the profile of our population in light of the behavioral constraints imposed by COVID-19 in our country. To enhance the capacity for analyzing responses, we employed a psychophysical scaling methodology utilizing ratio measurement, specifically the Borg CR® ratio scale with verbal anchorage (centiMax®). This methodology has proven to be highly effective in acquiring ratio measurements, enabling quantitative responses for anchoring corresponding verbal descriptors. Our experiments demonstrated that employing ratio scales with verbal anchors significantly enhances the sensitivity and quantitative measurement of major depression scores. While existing literature typically relies on ordinal measurements obtained through Likert-type scales, a notable innovation in our study is the utilization of a quantitative ratio scale. This approach yields a greater volume of information, facilitating the use of robust quantitative and statistical tools with high predictive capabilities, unlike ordinal scales that limit information to frequency levels and necessitate non-parametric analyses based on mode and association.
The data collection period spanned from March 17 to 24, 2020. The demographic information gathered included gender, age, level of education, type of healthcare system utilized, annual income, marital status, ethnicity or race, mode of transportation for daily commuting, and presence of chronic illnesses.
Data were collected through a digital form distributed on social networks (REDCap), utilizing convenience sampling and snowball recruitment techniques. Participants were first informed about the purpose of the study, following which their age was requested. If the respondent was below 18 years of age, they were automatically redirected to a message expressing gratitude for their willingness to participate. Conversely, individuals over 18 were directed to the page containing the informed consent form. Upon acceptance of the terms, participants were given instructions and the testing process commenced. The average time taken for completing the questionnaire was 12 minutes, with a standard deviation of 1.6. It is important to note that this study adheres to the principles outlined in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent revisions.
Participants were surveyed to assess their beliefs and understanding of COVID-19 contamination. The questionnaire comprised 24 questions, with five questions each dedicated to perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers. Additionally, four extra questions focused on behaviors and attitudes aimed at enhancing overall health, referred to as pro-health motivation.
Perceived susceptibility in this study refers to individuals' knowledge and beliefs regarding the likelihood of contracting coronavirus, as exemplified by statements such as "based on my overall health, my chance of catching coronavirus disease is...". Perceived severity delves into personal beliefs concerning the potential suffering and intensity of symptoms associated with the disease, as illustrated by statements like "if I caught coronavirus disease, the chance of getting too impaired to do my daily activities would be...". Perceived benefits focus on evaluating the effectiveness of behavioral mechanisms, such as wearing a mask, in preventing infection, as seen in statements like "if I wear a mask, the chance to catch coronavirus disease by walking in the street or at work is...". Perceived barriers address the challenges individuals face in adhering to protective norms and instructions to avoid coronavirus infection, as indicated by statements like "I think the possibility of using alternative transportation to come and go from my job instead of public transportation is...". Additionally, we enhanced the original model by incorporating pro-health motivation, which includes questions related to general health improvement practices like eating habits and exercise routines.
The responses obtained were numerical values on a ratio scale with verbal anchors, derived from the centiMax scale®14,24, which illustrates perception (Figure 1). This scale allows for a direct quantitative assessment of participants' perception levels on a psychophysical ratio scale22,25,26. The benefit of this quantitative approach with verbal anchors lies in the fact that qualitative descriptive anchors assist participants in swiftly identifying the range of numeric scale values, in Cmax units, that best reflect their perception. Subsequently, a numerical value is selected, with the aim of choosing the option that most precisely represents their perception.
Participants were directed to select the numerical value that most accurately reflected their perception of the question at hand, with guidance provided by the accompanying descriptors. These values were not limited to whole numbers and could include decimals. Ensuring precision in the numerical data was paramount to accurately capturing participants' perceptions and behaviors.
The statistical analysis was conducted using the Statistica program (version 10.2, Statsoft, Tulsa, USA). An asymmetry test was carried out to determine the normality required for parametric statistics. While the centiMax® ratio scale has been effectively utilized in studying various health conditions like major depression, fatigue, shortness of breath, physical exertion, and chest pain, its application in purely psychological variables remains unexplored. Hence, it is crucial to assess certain psychometric parameters. Reliability was evaluated using split-half correlations with Spearman-Brown’s correction, Cronbach’s α for internal consistency, and total items statistics to identify potential variables with minimal contribution to the questionnaire. Additionally, the standardized alpha was calculated to determine reliability if standardized values (converted into z scores) were used in Cronbach’s α calculation. Repeated measures variance analysis was employed to explore the relationship between scale dimensions and sociodemographic factors such as income level, type of health system, and transportation system used for daily locomotion, utilizing F statistics. Effect size was determined by h². Spearman’s correlation was conducted to examine the relationship between scale values and demographic data including age, schooling level, and income to confirm the measure's convergence validity. Furthermore, belief profiles on coronavirus infection were constructed to demonstrate the potential value of proportion data.
Our study gathered data from a total of 277 participants, with the responses of 276 individuals, ranging in age from 18 to 76, of both genders (women = 197), being utilized for analysis. The single excluded response was provided by an 11-year-old participant. Detailed demographic information regarding the sample is presented in Table 1.
Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the total scores of each dimension within the belief model. The mean values exhibit similarity across the dimensions, with values ranging from 52.5 (SD = 31.6) for the pro-health motivation dimension to 26.6 (SD = 23.0) for perceived benefits.
An analysis of reproducibility was conducted for the questions within each dimension of the belief model. The initial values indicated a high level of reliability with a Cronbach’s α of 0.817 and a standardized α of 0.821, along with a low correlation among the items (r = 0.168), indicating a significant degree of independence among the questions (see Table 3). However, it was observed that for question 3 related to perceived benefits and question 1 concerning perceived barriers, the item-total correlation values were notably low (r = 0.06 and r = 0.08, respectively), suggesting a detrimental impact on the overall scale.
Following the exclusion of the aforementioned questions, our scale demonstrated an improved Cronbach's α coefficient (αC = 0.883), surpassing the threshold of 0.800. This enhancement suggests a high level of scale efficiency, accounting for 80% of the anticipated population variability. Additionally, the standardized α value exhibited a minor enhancement (αP = 0.834), while maintaining a low correlation among items (r = 0.179), thereby confirming a strong internal consistency. Subsequent analyses were conducted after the removal of these two questions.
The scale reproducibility was assessed using Spearman-Brown's split-half coefficient, revealing a strong correlation (r = 0.882) and indicating robust convergent validity for our scale.
The analysis of variance conducted on the grouped scores of the items within each belief model dimension revealed significant differences in perceived susceptibility across various factors. Specifically, differences were observed in relation to the type of transportation, with urban transportation showing higher mean values (44.0) compared to personal vehicle (36.1) and walking (30.2) (F = 5.21; p = 0.003; h² = 0.014). Furthermore, household income played a significant role, as participants with incomes below R$ 1,000.00 had notably lower mean values (16.4) compared to all other income groups (F = 3.44; p = 0.008; h² = 0.009). Additionally, differences were noted in relation to severe illnesses, with participants having autoimmune diseases (83.1) and diseases affecting the immune system (42.8) showing higher values compared to other diseases and those without severe illnesses (F = 3.13; p = 0.008; h² = 0.022).
In terms of perceived severity, a significant difference was observed based on schooling level (F = 2.79; p = 0.016; h² = 0.012). Participants with complete secondary education (47.9) and incomplete secondary education (72.3) exhibited higher values compared to those with a higher level of schooling. Among individuals with severe illnesses, those with systemic arterial hypertension (47.9) and conditions impacting the immune system (47.8) reported higher values, while individuals with autoimmune diseases had lower values (22.5) than other groups (F = 10.79; p < 0.001; h² = 0.022).
The perceived benefits dimension showed significance among participants based on the health system utilized (F = 4.32; p = 0.037; h² = 0.007). Specifically, individuals utilizing private health systems (M = 21.5) exhibited higher scores compared to those utilizing the public system (M = 18.2).
The dimension of perceived barriers emerged as the final aspect displaying notable distinctions among participants (F = 3.79; p = 0.004; h² = 0.014), with public transportation users exhibiting lower values compared to other groups. No significant variances were observed based on participants' sex, and there were no noteworthy correlations identified between age and responses on the scale.
The CentiMax scale® facilitates a direct and rapid graphical analysis of each participant. Illustrated in Figure 2 are the profiles of two participants whose sum values of the scale items are nearly identical (participant A – 45.9; participant B – 45.7). Despite this similarity, distinct beliefs concerning covid-19 are clearly discernible. The vertical line at the 50 scale units mark signifies a heightened perception of the specific item. In terms of practical application, Figure 2 demonstrates how our questionnaire, coupled with the use of a ratio scale, offers a precise and nuanced gradation, allowing participants to articulate their perceptions and intensities with a greater level of detail compared to other ordinal or nominal scales.
Our study effectively achieves its objective of quantitatively mapping perceptions of risk behaviors in relation to the risk of coronavirus infection by utilizing the Health Belief Model in conjunction with a verbal anchors psychophysical scale. This method allows for a comprehensive depiction of individual perceptions. The approach has demonstrated high efficiency by revealing distinct profiles among participants with similar levels of risk perception across various variables.
The study results indicate that certain factors play a significant role in shaping risk perception. Specifically, the mode of transportation utilized for daily commuting emerges as a key determinant. Individuals relying on public transportation exhibit a heightened perception of susceptibility to contamination compared to those using personal vehicles or walking. Moreover, individuals with very low income levels and those afflicted with autoimmune diseases, such as allergies and rheumatism, also demonstrate an increased perception of susceptibility to risks.
These findings serve as crucial sources of information for informing public policies aimed at achieving the broadest possible reach. The perception that utilizing public transportation carries a higher risk of contracting Covid-19 compared to private and personal modes of transportation is noteworthy. However, the utilization of collective private vehicles, such as transportation apps, exhibited significant variability and therefore did not distinguish itself from any of the other transportation groups. Consequently, we recognize this as a pertinent demographic to target for the dissemination of additional information regarding contagion risks. Furthermore, low income emerged as a significant factor that warrants a nuanced understanding, given its association with limited access to both the quantity and quality of information, substandard housing conditions that facilitate contagion, and challenges in discontinuing daily activities due to economic constraints.
One notable observation was that individuals with diseases linked to an increased risk of contracting COVID-19, such as diabetes mellitus and systemic arterial hypertension, do not exhibit a significantly different perception of susceptibility to contamination risk compared to those without self-reported chronic conditions. This lack of distinction could potentially be attributed to the fact that many of these patients are asymptomatic and maintain stable, clinically controlled diseases, essentially resembling individuals without chronic illnesses. This finding underscores the importance of crafting information dissemination strategies that specifically target or highlight this at-risk demographic, thereby facilitating more effective communication and intervention measures.
Participants with lower levels of schooling in our sample, specifically those with some and secondary education, exhibited heightened concern regarding symptoms and disease progression. This heightened concern stemmed from their perception of greater severity of symptoms compared to participants with higher levels of education. Consequently, individuals with lower schooling levels may be more inclined to seek healthcare services at an earlier stage. However, this poses a significant issue, particularly in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as unnecessary visits to healthcare facilities increase the risk of exposure to the virus and other potentially severe illnesses.
Another intriguing finding in terms of severity perception pertained to chronic diseases. Individuals with systemic arterial hypertension and conditions impacting the immune system demonstrated heightened susceptibility compared to other groups. Interestingly, participants with autoimmune disorders exhibited significantly lower levels of concern, indicating that the precautions implemented for managing their chronic illnesses are viewed as protective measures against potential exposure. Moreover, the type of healthcare system utilized influenced perceptions of benefits concerning access to and treatment for COVID-19. Users of public healthcare systems reported fewer advantages in contrast to those utilizing private healthcare services.
Results derived from individual profiles facilitate detailed and direct quantitative analyses. For instance, in examining question 1 of the health motivation item depicted in Figure 2, it is evident that participant A attributes a belief of 30 units to the efficacy of handwashing in preventing viral infections, while participant B assigns a belief of 120 units to this behavior. Given the nature of a ratio scale, it is straightforward to assert that participant B's belief is four times greater than that of participant A regarding the effectiveness of handwashing as a health-promoting behavior. Similarly, when comparing question 2 of the perceived severity item, participant A holds a belief twice as strong as participant B regarding the likelihood of experiencing severe symptoms and complications. Had a 5-point Likert scale been employed, participant B would have scored significantly higher (a value of 5 or equivalent) in the first scenario, while participant A would have scored lower (a value of 2). In the second scenario, participant A would have received a moderate score (a value of 3), contrasting with participant B's lower score (a value of 2). This example underscores the notable disparity between using a ratio scale and an ordinal scale, with the latter's limited sensitivity and resolution hindering the accurate interpretation of participants' perspectives.
Discussion of the methodology employed in this study is crucial. The health belief model, established over 60 years ago, finds application in various health domains, including ophthalmologist education, behavioral aspects in eating behavior psychiatry, illicit injectable drug use and abuse, diabetes mellitus and endocrine clinics, among others. Typically, this model involves the use of open or semi-structured questionnaires with Likert-type scales for psychological dimension assessments. Our study represents a significant advancement in utilizing this model by employing a ratio scale with verbal anchors, facilitating ratio measurements and enhancing detailed quantitative information. This methodological approach is noteworthy as the efficacy of even a well-constructed questionnaire can be compromised if an inadequate or low-information capacity metric is utilized. The work of S.S. Stevens on psychological measurement and psychophysical scaling has broadened our understanding of metric possibilities within the psychological realm. Unlike Likert-type scales, which are ordinal and only indicate order without specifying distances between descriptors, ratio scales offer an absolute origin for mathematical continuums, enabling the use of higher-order statistics. By utilizing a ratio scale, our study ensures high information quality and an objective metric for analysis.
Our team has extensive experience in developing psychophysical measurement and scaling techniques for interval and ratio orders in the study of various psychological continua, including symptom profiles in patients with major depression, sexual attitudes, and color concepts. We advocate for the utilization of these psychophysical scaling models, particularly verbal anchor scales, due to their ease of application and comprehension of the task at hand. Moreover, these models are linked to quantitative measurements with a high capacity for information, intervals, and ratios, thereby offering significant potential for more detailed and quantitative studies in public health. This is particularly relevant as public health, much like psychology, often deals with the intricate characteristics of human behavior concerning issues of prevention, health, and illness risks.
Our study acknowledges certain limitations that may have influenced the outcomes. Specifically, our sample exhibits a bias towards moderate- and high-income groups, potentially compromising the representativeness of the sample. Consequently, future research endeavors should aim to address this social heterogeneity within the sample to enhance the validity of the findings.
In conclusion, our health belief model-based questionnaire, which utilizes a ratio scale with verbal anchors, serves as a crucial tool for comprehending the population's perception of coronavirus infection risks in a quantitative manner. This instrument offers a level of detail and information that surpasses commonly used questionnaire models and psychological metrics, like Likert-type ordinal scales. Through graphical analysis, quick access to individual profiles is granted, facilitating the development of tailored information strategies and more personalized approaches. These advancements are poised to significantly enhance communication efficiency.
