Ceramics of (1−x)Ba(Zr 0.2 Ti 0.8 )O 3 –x(Ba 0.7 Ca 0.3 )TiO 3 (BZT-BCT) are considered as potential substitutes for lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics. Some researchers refer to these compositions as Ba 1-x Ca x Ti 1-y Zr y O 3 (BCZT) while others use the term BZT-BCT. This nomenclature can imply that BCZT ceramics are fabricated through a "direct route" using precursor powders like carbonates and oxides, whereas BZT-BCT ceramics are produced through a "composite route" involving a mixture of BZT and BCT solid solutions. This study aims to investigate the impact of the processing route on the properties of these compositions. Ceramics were prepared using two methods: BCZT, considered a monophasic system, was synthesized via the direct route, while BZT-BCT, a polyphasic system, was prepared using a composite route. The results indicate that the processing method significantly affects the structure, microstructure, dielectric properties, and phase transitions of the ceramics. These findings are crucial for understanding the phase evolution and compositional intricacies of these materials.
Ceramics possessing piezoelectric properties find applications as sensors, actuators, and transducers [1]. Historically, Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) based ceramics have been favored for their high piezoelectric coefficients [2, 3]. Nevertheless, the toxicity associated with lead has prompted investigations into developing lead-free ceramics that exhibit piezoelectric properties comparable to those of PZT [1, 4].
In 2009, Liu and Ren published a paper detailing a ceramic system exhibiting exceptional piezoelectric properties [2]. The study focuses on a specific composition situated near the morphotropic phase boundary, specifically identified as Ba(Zr 0.2 Ti 0.8 )O 3 –x(Ba 0.7 Ca 0.3 )TiO 3. The authors describe the material's synthesis through a pseudo-binary system termed BZT-xBCT, where x denotes the molar percentage of BCT. Subsequent research endeavors have aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the notable piezoelectric characteristics of these compositions [5, 6, 7]. However, the literature has presented works involving the composition (1-x)Ba(Zr 0.2 Ti 0.8 )O 3 –x(Ba 0.7 Ca 0.3 )TiO 3 under two distinct designations: BCZT with a straightforward formulation as (Ba 0.85 Ca 0.15 )(Zr 0.1 Ti 0.9 )O 3 [8, 9, 10] and BZT-BCT with a composite formulation represented as (0.5BaTi 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 3 -0.5Ba 0.7 Ca 0.3 TiO 3) [11, 12, 13]. Despite the varied nomenclature, these definitions correspond to the same atomic composition.
The compositions of BCZT have garnered significant interest among researchers owing to their high piezoelectric coefficients [9]. Nevertheless, these coefficients are only observed within a limited temperature range due to the phase transitions within the ceramic system. Within this framework, the exceptional properties of these materials are occasionally linked to phase coexistence [12]. Nonetheless, the rationale behind this phase coexistence is not ascribed to a polyphasic material but rather to an exotic crystallographic characteristic.
This paper aims to shed light on the influence of route processing on the properties of lead-free ceramics, specifically investigating the structures, microstructures, and dielectric properties of BCZT and BZT-BCT. The method employed involved the preparation of 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3–0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 ceramics through two distinct routes: the direct route (BCZT), characterized as a monophasic system, and the composite route (BZT-BCT), characterized as a polyphasic system.
The ceramics were synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction method, commencing with high-purity precursor powders of BaCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), TiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), ZrO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), and CaCO3 (Vetec, 99%). The raw materials were blended based on specific formulations:
The chemical reaction represented by BaCO3 + CaCO3 + ZrO2 + TiO2 => Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.90Zr0.10O3 + CO2 (BCZT) showcases the formation of Barium Calcium Titanium Zirconium Oxide (BCZT) along with the release of carbon dioxide.
The chemical reaction involving the combination of Barium Carbonate (BaCO3), Zirconium Dioxide (ZrO2), and Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) to form Barium Zirconate Titanate (BaZr0.20Ti0.80O3) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) can be represented as BaCO3 + ZrO2 + TiO2 => BaZr0.20Ti0.80O3 + CO2 (BZT).
The reaction involving BaCO3, TiO2, and CaCO3 can be represented as BaCO3 + TiO2 + CaCO3 => Ba0.70Ca0.30TiO3 + CO2 (BCT).
The raw materials underwent a 24-hour ball milling process, followed by calcination at 1200 ºC for 2 hours. Subsequently, the mixtures were ball milled for an additional 24 hours to achieve fine powders. These powders were then compacted into disk-shaped samples and sintered at 1380 ºC for 3 hours. This approach is referred to as the direct route in this study.
In the composite route, the calcined powders of BZT and BCT were combined in a 50% BCT and 50% BZT ratio, forming BZT-BCT. These powders underwent 24 hours of ball milling, were subsequently compacted into disk-shaped samples, and then sintered at 1380 ºC for durations of 10 minutes, 3 hours, and 24 hours. The final density of each sintered specimen was determined using the Archimedes method, revealing values exceeding 95% of BaTiO3's theoretical density in all instances.
The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was conducted using a NETZSCH STA 449 instrument. The experiments were carried out in a synthetic air atmosphere (O2/N2 - ¼) at a heating rate of 10°C/min using alumina crucibles. Crystallographic structure analysis was performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Microstructure developments were examined with a scanning electron microscope (FEI - Inspect S50), and the grain size of the ceramics was determined using the intercept method directly on the SEM images. Electrical measurements, specifically impedance (Z* = Z' + jZ"), which could be converted to complex permittivity as ε* = ε' + jε", were conducted from room temperature up to approximately 200°C using a Solartron SI 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer within the frequency range of f = 100 Hz to 13 MHz. Electric contacts were established with silver (Ag) paste applied on both parallel faces of the pellets and diffused at 550°C for 30 minutes.
Figures 1a and 1b depict the DSC/TG curves derived from the reagent mixture utilized in the synthesis of BZT and the combination of calcinated powders of BCT and BZT, respectively. The curve representing the reagents (Figure 1a) displays a multi-step process culminating around 1300 ºC. Within the temperature range of 1030 o C to 1180 o C, a 14% mass loss occurs, attributed to the decomposition of BaCO3 and oxidation of CO2. Endothermic peaks at 829 o C and 986 o C are associated with structural phase transitions of BaCO3 [15]. The significant exothermic reaction at 1200 o C is linked to BCZT formation. In contrast to the reagents' behavior, the results from the calcined powders do not exhibit a distinct thermodynamic event indicative of composition reaction (Figure 1b). Notably, no subsequent thermal treatment was conducted after mixing BCT and BZT powders in this experiment. An endothermic event around 1300 o C is observed, attributed to a fusion process hinting at the formation of a Ti4+ rich phase during heating.
Figure 2 illustrates the XRD patterns of BCT, BZT, and BCZT compounds post-calcination (at 1200 °C for 2 hours). Additionally, the figure displays the XRD patterns for the BZT-BCT compounds post-milling (without further calcination). These patterns were cross-referenced with entries from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). The XRD patterns for BCT were successfully indexed with tetragonal symmetry (ICSD-71368), revealing the presence of a single phase. In contrast, the XRD patterns for BZT indicated the formation of two phases, predominantly the BZT phase (ICSD-291454) alongside a minor phase identified as BaZrO3 (BZ) (ICSD-974600). The detection of the BZ phase in the calcined powder suggests that a higher temperature may be necessary. As anticipated, the BZT-BCT composition exhibited the formation of two distinct phases, both sharing an isostructural resemblance with the tetragonal BZT and BCT phases.
Figure 3 illustrates the XRD patterns obtained at room temperature for the BCZT and BZT-BCT samples post-sintering. Prior to analysis, the samples underwent milling, and the resulting XRD patterns were cross-referenced with the ICSD database. The XRD analysis of BCZT revealed a fully crystallized ceramic exhibiting a single-phase perovskite structure, in perfect alignment with the ICSD-186490 reference. Notably, no secondary phase was detected in this composition. In contrast, the XRD analysis of the BZT-BCT ceramic unveiled the presence of two distinct phases: tetragonal (BCT) and orthorhombic (BZT), as depicted in figure 3-b.
The microstructures of the BCZT and BZT-BCT samples are illustrated in Figures 4a and b. The grain size, as determined by the intercept method, was found to be 1.5 ± 0.5 μm for BCZT ceramics. Notably, the sintered BZT-BCT exhibited a uniform microstructure with a grain size of 9 ± 4 μm. These disparities in grain growth hint at the potential formation of a liquid phase during the sintering process of BZT-BCT. The presence of a liquid phase typically facilitates mass transport between grains, thereby fostering a process of grain growth.
The temperature dependence of the dielectric constants and tan(δ) of BCZT and BZT-BCT ceramics, measured at frequencies of 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and 100 kHz, is illustrated in Figures 5a and 5b, respectively. The ε’ curve of BCZT ceramics reveals two distinct anomalies corresponding to phase transitions, with the first linked to the Rhombohedral (R) – Tetragonal (T) transition and the second to the Tetragonal (T) – Cubic (C) transition [1], mirroring findings by Liu et al. [2]. The R/T transition's maximum point remains indeterminate due to diffusivity, but an inflection point around ~50 ℃ is used as a reference. The peak of the T-C transition anomaly is observed at ~83 ℃, while the ε” curve displays anomalies at ~46 ℃ and ~77 ℃. Figure 5b demonstrates that the composite methodology yields ceramics with distinct dielectric behaviors, as only one phase transition is evident at ~93 ℃. Despite the ceramics sharing the same composition, the observed differences are likely attributed to the synthesis methodology and the phase formation tendencies of BZT-BCT.
The data analyses presented in Figure 5c illustrate the results of permittivity as a function of temperature for the sintered BZT-BCT ceramics at a consistent temperature of 1380 ºC, but with varying treatment durations: 10 minutes, 3 hours, and 24 hours. The primary aim was to ascertain whether the BZT-BCT methodology aligns with BCZT behavior under specific thermodynamic conditions. Figure 5c demonstrates that as the sintering time increases from 10 minutes to 3 hours, there is a noticeable rise in dielectric values. However, there were no significant alterations in the temperature of the phase transition. Moving from 3 hours to 24 hours, no substantial changes were observed, leading to the conclusion that any potential phase development likely concludes within 3 hours of thermal treatment, indicating that the BZT-BCT methodology does not converge with the BCZT methodology.
Figure 2 illustrates that the milling process of the BZT and BCT mixture did not provide energy for BCZT phase formation, resulting in the presence of two phases in the XRD of BZT-BCT. Thermal analyses conducted on these powders (Figure 1) indicate the absence of any thermodynamic event between the BCT and BZT powders during the heating process. Consequently, the formation of a single phase is expected to occur through a slow diffusion process between the BCT and BZT elements. Additionally, a potential fusion is evident in the DTA curves of BZT-BCT at approximately 1300°C, possibly linked to a Ti4+-rich phase. The formation of this phase could be attributed to a non-uniform diffusion of various ions during the composite's thermal treatment. Notably, the Ti4+-rich phase plays a role in defining the larger grain size observed in BZT-BCT compared to BCZT ceramics (Figure 3). This increase in grain size in the composite route suggests the presence of an intergranular liquid phase formed during the sintering process of the materials, a phenomenon commonly observed in BaTiO3-based ceramics treated at temperatures exceeding 1300°C.
The X-ray diffraction analysis of the sintered ceramics at 1380°C for 3 hours indicates that the various processing routes lead to distinct crystalline structures, suggesting potential variations in dielectric behavior. Figure 5a and b illustrate that while the dielectric response of BZT-BCT ceramics displays a single anomaly, BCZT ceramics exhibit two dielectric anomalies. A direct comparison suggests that the BCZT route yields ceramics with structural and behavioral similarities to those documented by Liu and Ren in 2009. According to the phase diagram, one would anticipate a solitary phase transition for compositions below the triple point. Consequently, the composite route (BZT-BCT) may yield a composition different from the anticipated one. Notably, both ceramics exhibit a single anomaly associated with the T-C phase transition in the temperature spectra. The peak of the curve for BCZT is around 83°C, while for BZT-BCT, it is approximately 93°C, indicating a shift of about 10°C. The determination of transition temperature through dielectric analysis is commonly used to infer the phase and composition of ceramics. Therefore, the observed shift in transition temperature could signify compositional differences.
To further the discourse, Figure 5c illustrates the dielectric properties of the BZT-BCT material sintered over varying durations. This prompts the query: Could the dielectric behavior of BZT-BCT transition towards BCZT under specific thermodynamic conditions? Intriguingly, even post a 24-hour thermal treatment, the BZT-BCT samples exhibited a consistent behavior (with only one discernible phase transition) akin to those sintered for a mere 3 hours. Conversely, an escalation in permittivity values was noted with an increase in sintering time from 10 minutes to 3 hours.
Consequently, there are phase developments or microstructural changes occurring within this time interval. However, after 3 hours of thermal treatment, no significant alterations were observed. Given that this study focused on ceramics with identical compositions, it is plausible to hypothesize that the composite method yields ceramics with varying crystalline structures. Therefore, the intricate crystalline structure of these materials is a product of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics, as well as the synthesis methodology employed.
Based on the characterizations conducted, it can be inferred that the progression of phase development is influenced by the chosen methodology, with the composite route (BZT-BCT) failing to align with the direct route (BCZT). This discrepancy is evident through the coexistence of crystalline phases in the former methodology. Consequently, this divergence leads to the formation of larger grain sizes and, notably, distinct dielectric behaviors.
