Freshwater hyphomycetes were surveyed in insular water bodies within the Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso State Park, located in the Cananéia municipality of São Paulo State, Brazil. Submerged mixed leaf litter samples were collected from six sites between June 2012 and February 2013. These samples were transported to the laboratory and incubated in Petri dishes filled with sterile distilled water at room temperature (20oC). Starting from the 5th day and continuing for at least one month, fragments of the leaf litter samples were examined under a microscope, leading to the morphological identification of 33 taxa. Among these taxa, two were identified as new records for the state of São Paulo, and four were new records for Brazil. Detailed descriptions and images of each new record are provided in the study.
The term 'aquatic hyphomycetes' lacks taxonomical significance but serves to ecologically define a group of anamorphic fungi or asexual ascomycetes that necessitate a portion, if not the entirety, of their life cycle to transpire in freshwater. This classification also encompasses fungi that are exclusively indigenous to aquatic environments (Chan et al., 2000).
Aquatic anamorphic fungi, a phylogenetically diverse group (Belliveau & Barlocher, 2005; Duarte et al., 2015), are categorized into four groups based on their tolerance to submergence or their need for water for conidiogenesis: aeroaquatic hyphomycetes, terrestrial aquatic hyphomycetes, submerged aquatic hyphomycetes, and ingoldian hyphomycetes (Goh & Hyde, 1996).
Aquatic anamorphs are recognized as a crucial ecological group of fungi that are actively involved in the decomposition of submerged leaf litter. They function either as consumers or by enhancing the palatability of substrates through nutritional enrichment, benefiting other organisms in the trophic chain, such as shredding invertebrates (Bärlocher 1992, Cheng et al. 1997, Suberkropp 1992, 2003). Consequently, these fungi are believed to have a significant impact on nutrient cycling (Belliveau & Barlocher 2005).
The significance of aquatic anamorphs is particularly highlighted in lotic systems, such as streams characterized by well-aerated, clean, and moderately turbulent waters, where their conidia are dispersed in foams or associated with decaying organic substrates (Ingold, 1975). These organisms can also be found in terrestrial environments, such as in the roots of various plants, including grasses and riparian ferns (Sati & Belwal, 2005), as well as in lentic waters (Suzuki & Nimura, 1961; Casper, 1965), and more recently, in urban, eutrophicated waters (Schoenlein-Crusius et al., 2009; Schoenlein-Crusius et al., 2014).
Numerous studies have contributed to the understanding of the geographical distribution of anamorphic fungi within the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest, with notable works by Schoenlein-Crusius and Milanez in 1989, 1990, and 1998, Grandi in 1998 and 1999, Gusmão et al. in 2001, Grandi and Gusmão in 2002, and Silva et al. in 2019. Notably, only Silva et al. (2019) incorporated sampling points within a lentic system situated on an island.
The initial investigation into the diversity of freshwater hyphomycetes in Brazilian insular regions was carried out by Moro et al. (2018) within the Ilhabela State Park (PEIb). Within this same island, Moro et al. (2015a) identified two novel species of freshwater Hyphomycetes, namely Polylobastipora setulosa and Campylospora brasiliensis, alongside the first documented occurrence in Brazil of Peyronelina glomerulata by PJ Fisher, J. Webster, and DF Kane (Moro et al. 2015c).
Studies on the diversity of fungi from various phyla have been conducted on Ilha do Cardoso island. Previous research has focused on Basidiomycota (Bononi 1979a,b,c, 1984, Bononi et al. 1984, Bononi & Capelari 1984, Capelari 1989, Gugliotta & Capelari 1995, Gugliotta & Bononi 1999), Glomeromycota (Trufem et al. 1989, Trufem et al. 1994), and more recently, Chytridiomycota and Blastocladiomycota (Jerônimo 2014, Jerônimo et al. 2015). However, there is a notable absence of records regarding aquatic anamorphic fungi, making the exploration of their diversity the primary focus of this current study. Additionally, abiotic parameters have been measured and documented for historical reference on the island.
Sampling - The State Park of Ilha do Cardoso (PEIC) is situated on the eponymous island, along the southeastern coast of São Paulo State (25º03'05"-25º18'18"S and 47º53'48"-48º05'42"W). Encompassing a total area of 22,500 hectares, the park boasts a diverse range of environments, including primary and secondary Atlantic rainforest, dunes, mangroves, sandbank formations, and the prominent Perequê river that meanders through a significant portion of the island. Additionally, the park features numerous small ponds, tributaries, river rapids, waterfalls, and brooks (Secretaria de Estado do Meio Ambiente 1998).
During the research expedition on Ilha do Cardoso island, several sampling sites were meticulously visited and studied. These included the Perequê waterfall, the Cor de Chá river, the Córrego, the Poço das Antas, and the Perequê river. Each site was carefully selected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ecological dynamics and biodiversity present on the island. The data collected from these diverse locations will contribute significantly to our research findings and help us draw meaningful conclusions about the environmental health and conservation status of Ilha do Cardoso.
The Perequê waterfall (site 1) and the Perequê river (site 5) were visited for data collection during all field trips conducted in June, August, and November of 2012, as well as in February of 2013. The Cor de Chá river (site 2) had a sufficient water flow for sampling only once, in February 2013. The Córrego (site 3) was visited during the initial three field trips, while the Poço das Antas (site 4) was only visited during the last two trips in November 2012 and February 2013.
During the field trips, 10 leaves were carefully selected from the submerged mixed leaf litter at each site, located on the shores and approximately 30 cm deep. These leaves, along with water samples from the respective sites, were meticulously placed in sterile 200 mL polyethylene bottles. Throughout the duration of the study, a total of 72 samples were systematically collected and subsequently transported to the laboratory for further analysis and examination.
At each sampling site, the temperature (°C), pH, conductivity (µS/cm), and dissolved oxygen (mg/L) of the water were measured using Horiba U10 and U50 equipment.
In the laboratory, leaf samples were individually coarsely fragmented using sterile scissors to fit loosely in sterile Petri dishes. Sterile water was then added to the Petri dishes to adequately cover the leaf fragments (Ingold, 1975). A total of 172 Petri dishes were prepared and incubated at room temperature (approximately 20°C) for a period ranging from 4 to 8 weeks. In cases where bacterial proliferation became noticeable or leaf fragments surfaced, aliquots of sterile water were added to the Petri dishes or the entire water was replaced to maintain the substrates in a clean state.
Taxonomical identification began on the 5th day, with fragments of the leaf litter samples being meticulously examined under a microscope for a minimum of one month, continuing until no new fungi were observed. These fragments from the incubated leaf samples were carefully mounted onto slides using a drop of sterile water and cover glasses, ready for analysis under an optical microscope, specifically the Olympus BX50 model.
The conidial production process was meticulously monitored, and morphological characteristics were carefully examined to facilitate the identification of taxa using specific identification keys (Ingold 1975, Marvanová 1997, Santos-Flores & Betancourt-López 1997). In order to document and preserve the specimens ex-situ, slides were meticulously prepared using PVLG (polyvinyl alcohol lactoglycerol) resin and stored at the Herbarium Maria Eneida Kaufmann Fidalgo at the Instituto de Botânica in the municipality of São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil. Digital images were captured using an optical microscope Leica DM LB2, which was equipped with a Leica DFRC 280 digital camera.
Taxa occurrence frequencies were determined following the methods outlined by Dajoz (1973) and Zak & Willig (2004). This involved dividing the number of samples in which a species was recorded by the total number of samples analyzed, then multiplying the result by 100. The fungi were classified into constancy categories as follows: C for Constant (≥ 50%), A for Accessory (≥ 25% and < 50%), and O for Occasional (< 25%).
Abiotic factors - The water temperature ranged from approximately 18 oC in August 2012 to 23 ºC in February 2013 across all sites (see Table 1). The pH levels exhibited variability, with values ranging from 5.58 to 8.75 at Cachoeira do Perequê, 5.26 to 6.64 at Rio Perequê, 5.48 to 7.12 at Córrego, and 6.14 to 6.28 at Poço das Antas. Notably, a single measurement at Rio Cor de Chá indicated an exceptionally low pH of 3.84, accompanied by a conductivity value of 0.394 S.cm-1. Dissolved oxygen levels remained relatively stable across sites, with concentrations ranging from 8.75 to 10.01 mgO2/L at Perequê waterfall, 6.73 to 8.90 mgO2/L at Perequê river, 6.50 to 7.82 mgO2/L at Córrego, and 7.50 to 10.45 mgO2/L at Poço das Antas. A solitary measurement at Cor de Chá river yielded a dissolved oxygen level of 10.17 mgO2/L.
Fungal diversity in the water bodies of Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso revealed a total of 33 taxa of aquatic Hyphomycetes, with 97 occurrences documented in Table 2. The initial sampling identified 18 taxa with 26 occurrences. Subsequent samplings showed 15 taxa in the 2nd round and 14 taxa in the 3rd round, with occurrences numbering 22 and 19, respectively. The 4th sampling yielded 17 taxa and 30 occurrences.
The Perequê waterfall exhibited the highest number of unique taxa (7) and recorded 40 occurrences. The first and second samplings had the highest occurrence numbers (11 and 14, respectively), albeit lower than the occurrences in the third and fourth samplings, which were similar (7 and 8, respectively).
The Perequê River exhibited 24 occurrences, featuring two distinct taxa, namely Blodgettia indica Subram. (see Figure 1a‑b) and Pyramidospora casuarinae Sv. Nilsson. The initial sampling yielded the highest number of occurrences (11), while subsequent samplings (2nd, 3rd, and 4th) showed no significant variation, with 4, 3, and 5 occurrences, respectively.
The Córrego site documented 13 instances of aquatic hyphomycetes, while the Poço das Antas site recorded 14 occurrences. Specifically, Córrego exhibited Pyramidospora constricta N. Singh (Figure 3d), whereas Poço das Antas showcased Ingoldiella hamata D.E. Shaw (Figure 2d).
In the Cor de Chá river, a single sampling session was conducted, resulting in the identification of six occurrences. Despite this, this particular site revealed the presence of four exclusive taxa: Dactylellina appendiculata (Anastasiou) M. Scholler, Hagedorn & A. Rubner (figure 3b), Isthmolongispora minima Matsush. (figure 2f), Pleiochaeta amazonensis Matsush. (figure 3c), and Subulispora longirostrata Nawawi & Kuthub (figure 4a).
All the taxa investigated represent new records for the Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso. The subsequent description of five species is warranted due to their novelty as records for Brazil, with one species being a new record specifically for the State of São Paulo.
Conidiophores were not detected in the observed samples. The conidia were characterized as hyaline, spindle-shaped, measuring between 42.5-62.5 µm in length and 10-12.5 µm in width, with 1-3 septa. These conidia were found to produce 1-2 lateral appendages, which were hyaline and exceeded 87.5 µm in length and 2-2.5 µm in width.
In the examined specimens, curved conidia were not observed, only straight conidia were present. However, all other morphological characteristics align with the original description.
The species initially described by Anastasiou (1964) as Dactyllela appendiculata, noted for its appendages, exhibits curved conidia when originating from a curved spore primordium or straight conidia when originating from a straight spore primordium. Subsequently, Nawawi (1976) introduced a new genus Laridospora, reclassifying Dactyllela appendiculata as Laridospora appendiculata, primarily observing curved conidia and appendages. Rubner & Gams later identified L. appendiculata as Monacrosporium tentaculatum, focusing solely on its predatory behavior and neglecting the ecological implications and conidial appendages associated with aquatic habitats, as M. tentaculatum is not an aquatic species (Rubner 1996). Finally, Scholler et al. (1999) proposed M. tentaculatum as synonymous with Dactyllelina appendiculata through molecular biology, marking the first documented occurrence of D. appendiculata in Brazil.
Conidiophores were not observed in the specimen under study. The conidial chains were uniseriate, linked by narrow isthmi, fusiform in shape, consisting of three cells, hyaline in appearance. The central cell was rectangular, while the ends of the navicular cells measured 25-33 × 2.5-3.0 µm.
The genus Isthmolongispora was initially described by Matsushima in 1971 based on specimens collected from the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, including I. intermedia and I. minima. The distinguishing features of this genus include the presence of free conidiophores and conidial serials, which are comprised of cells linked by a small isthmus. Presently, the genus encompasses nine additional species. Notably, this study marks the initial documentation of this species within Brazil.
Conidiophores were not observed in the study. The conidial chains were uniseriate and connected by narrow isthmi. The conidia were fusiform, hyaline, 2-celled, with dimensions of 10-15.7 × 2.1-4.3 µm per cell, resulting in entire conidia measuring 28.6-22.8 µm in length.
This represents the initial documentation of this species within São Paulo State.
Conidiophores were not observed in the specimen under study. The conidial chains were uniseriate, connected by narrow isthmi, and appeared solitary. They were hyaline, 4-celled, and measured between 54.5-60 × 3-4 µm in size.
The conidia of I. quadricellularia bear a striking resemblance to those found in the genus Wiesneriomyces Koord. The key distinguishing factor between these fungi lies in the conidiophores; while I. quadricellularia showcases free conidiophores, Wiesneriomyces typically presents sporodochium. However, W. laurinus (Tassi) P.M. Kirk may exhibit conidia composed of 5-9 cells in a culture medium or 7-8 cells in its natural substrate, as documented by Matsushima (1975), which contrasts with the observation of more than 15 cells by Ellis (1971). Matsushima (1975) specifically noted 4 cells, occasionally 5 cells, in I. quadricellularia conidia. In the current study, despite the absence of observed conidiophores, the presence of 4-celled conidia aligns with Matsushima's (1975) original description of I. quadricellularia, facilitating the accurate identification of the collected fungus.
The species quadricellularia is simultaneously documented in two distinct biomes in Brazil: the Atlantic Rain Forest of Ilha do Cardoso in the southeastern State of São Paulo (as discussed in this paper) and in the Caatinga region of the northeastern state of Bahia (Fiuza & Gusmão, 2014). This suggests that the geographical distribution of these taxa is more extensive than previously believed, marking the first documented occurrence of the species in São Paulo State.
Conidiophores were not detected in the observed samples. The conidia present were solitary, brown in color, cylindrical-fusiform in shape, multi-septated, with a filiform apex that curved. They were composed of a main axis measuring 160‑185 µm in length and 9-10 µm in width at the thinnest part, with 17-19 septa. Additionally, there were two side branches, thin and cylindrical, light brown in color, measuring 65-110 × 2.0-2.5 µm, with 7-9 septa.
The genus Pleiochaeta, described by (Sacc.) S. Hughes in 1951, includes the species P. setosa as its type species, along with five other described species. Characterized as a dematiaceous fungi, it features cylindrical-fusiform conidia with appendages (Castañeda Ruíz et al., 1996). Notably, this marks the initial documentation of the species in Brazil.
The conidiophore is hyaline, singular, measuring 45-70 µm in length, and carries a single terminal conidia. The conidia are produced by a primary axis measuring 30-40 µm in length, with lateral branches that are 8-12 µm in length.
The genus Pyramidospora was originally described by Nilsson (1962) with the type species P. casuarinae, which was isolated from Venezuela. The main distinguishing feature of this genus is the presence of a significant constriction in the conidiophore near its connection to the conidium, resulting in a twist in this region (Singh 1972). Presently, the genus comprises nine species. This marks the initial documentation of this species in Brazil.
Abiotic factors - The water temperature observed in this study corresponded closely to the prevailing climatic conditions (see Table 1). The recorded values of water temperature during the sampling periods align with findings from previous research conducted in the Atlantic rainforest biome. For instance, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2009) reported temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 26 °C in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI) in the State of São Paulo. Similarly, Nascimento (2007) documented temperatures ranging from 14.3 °C to 21.6 °C in the Parque Estadual da Serra da Cantareira, also located in São Paulo. These temperature ranges are considered optimal for the growth of aquatic Hyphomycetes, as these fungi are known to thrive within temperatures ranging from 15 ºC to 25 ºC, as highlighted by Ingold (1975).
There was a notable range in pH values across the sampling sites, spanning from 3.84 to 8.75. These values, however, were consistent with those reported by Nascimento (2007), falling within the range of 5.8 to 6.6, as well as Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2009), who documented pH values ranging from 3.36 to 9.08.
The conductivity levels observed generally fall within the low range, with values ranging from a maximum of 0.057 to 0.043 S.cm-1. It was anticipated that the dissolved oxygen levels would be relatively high, given that most of the sites are flowing waters, except for Poço das Antas, which is a pond, with values ranging from 6.73 to 10.45 mgO2/L (see Table 1). Comparatively, the conductivity and dissolved oxygen values obtained in this study were higher than those reported in previous research conducted in the Atlantic rainforest. For instance, Nascimento (2007) recorded conductivity values between 0.02 to 0.03 µS.cm-1 and dissolved oxygen levels ranging from 5.1 to 7.8 mgO2/L in the Parque Estadual da Cantareira.
The abiotic parameters of the freshwater ecosystem on the island align with the typical values documented for the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. In terms of fungal diversity, as outlined by Dajoz (1973), species exhibiting a frequency of occurrence equal to or greater than 50% are categorized as constant, those falling within the range of 25 to 50% are considered accessories, and those with a frequency below 25% are labeled as occasional. This classification system highlights a noteworthy correlation between the frequency of samplings conducted and the variety of fungal taxa identified.
Among the entire mycota population, the most prevalent species were Triscelophorus monosporus at 80%, Lunulospora curvula at 73.3%, and Tripospermum camelopardus at 66.6%, all of which were categorized as constant according to the data presented in Table 2.
Numerous studies have consistently demonstrated the high prevalence of T. monosporus (Schoenlein-Crusius & Martin 1990, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 1990, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 1992a, Pires-Zottarelli et al. 1993, Schoenlein-Crusius & Martin 1998, Malosso 1999, Schoenlein-Crusius 2002, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2014) and L. curvula (Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 1990, Schoenlein-Crusius & Milanez 1990, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 1992, Malosso 1995, Schoenlein-Crusius & Milanez 1998, Malosso 1999, Schoenlein-Crusius 2002, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2014). In contrast, T. camelopardus has been less frequently documented, with Malosso (1999) reporting its presence in the Guarapiranga dam.
Six taxa exhibited a frequency index ranging from 26.6% to 40%: Anguillospora longissima, Flagellospora curvula, Lunulospora cymbiformis, Scutisporus brunneus, Tripospermum myrti, and Triscelophorus acuminatus, categorized as accessory species. These particular species have been consistently documented in various studies conducted in Brazil (Schoenlein-Crusius et al., 2009; Fiuza & Gusmão, 2011, 2013, 2015; Schoenlein-Crusius et al., 2015).
Twenty-four taxa were less frequent (6.6‑20%) and classified as occasional. Blodgettia indica was recently isolated in leaves of Caesalpinia echinata and Campomanesia phaea submerged in a lake in Parque Municipal Alfredo Volpi (Moreira & Schoenlein-Crusius, 2012). Flagellospora penicillioides was isolated from submerged mixed leaf litter from the Cerrado biome by Schoenlein-Crusius (2002). Heliscus submersus was also isolated in submerged mixed leaf litter on Monjolinho river and Jacaré river in São Carlos, SP (Malosso, 1999). Ingoldiella hamata was cited by Schoenlein-Crusius (2002) in submerged mixed leaf litter in Itirapina, SP. Jaculispora submerged was recently described by Fiuza & Gusmão (2013) in the Serra da Jibóia, a Brazilian semi-arid region. Pyramidospora casuarinae was registered as the first citation in South America by Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2009). Subulispora longirostrata was registered colonizing leaves M. cabussu Hoehne and T. pulchra Cogn. in Paranapiacaba, Santo André, SP (Gusmão et al., 2001; Grandi & Gusmão, 2002). Tetracladium marchalianum was recently cited for the first time in Brazil by Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2014) in submerged mixed leaf litter in Parque Municipal do Ibirapuera, SP. Tetraploa aristata was observed by Gruppi (2008) on mixed leaf litter samples collected in the Parque Central in Santo André, SP, and by Barbosa et al. (2013) in submerged leaf litter in the city of Santa Terezinha, Bahia, in a Brazilian semi-arid region.
The other taxa were found sporadically during the sampling periods, with particular emphasis on Pyramidospora robusta Moreira & Schoenlein-Crusius (2012), which was identified in submerged leaf litter collected from Parque Alfredo Volpi, an urban park located in São Paulo city.
The findings of this study validate that the diversity of aquatic Hyphomycetes in insular environments surpasses the levels documented in other studies conducted in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. For example, within the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga-PEFI, a site reminiscent of the Atlantic Rainforest situated in São Paulo State, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2009) documented 24 taxa of aquatic Hyphomycetes thriving in submerged mixed leaf litter across 10 distinct sampling locations. Similarly, in the northeast Atlantic Rainforest, specifically at Monte da Pioneira, Serra da Jibóia north zone, Fiuza & Gusmão (2011) identified 10 aquatic Hyphomycetes thriving within stream foam.
Within the Ilhabela State Park, a total of 39 species of freshwater Hyphomycetes have been documented. Notably, Camposporidium cristatum Nawawi & Kuthub., Chaetendophragmia triangularis Matsush., Physalidiella elegans (Mosca) Rulamort, and Scutisporus brunneus K. Ando & Tubaki were identified as new records within São Paulo State. Additionally, Isthmolongispora biramifera Matsush., Lateriramulosa ainflata Matsush., Phalangispora nawawii Kuthub., and Triscelophorus ponapensis Matsush. were noted as new records for Brazil. Fiuza et al. (2017) compiled a checklist of Ingoldian fungi in Brazil, listing a total of 85 taxa, with 19 taxa found in the Amazon, 53 in the Atlantic Forest, 39 in the Caatinga, and 21 in the Cerrado. Furthermore, Silva et al. (2019) reported 23 taxa of aquatic hyphomycetes associated with submerged leaf litter in tropical lotic and lentic environments within the Atlantic Forest of Northeast Brazil.
The identified taxa represent first occurrences in Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso. These findings significantly contribute to expanding knowledge regarding the presence and distribution of aquatic hyphomycetes in the Atlantic Rainforest areas of São Paulo State and Brazil, thereby introducing studies of this group in insular regions.
