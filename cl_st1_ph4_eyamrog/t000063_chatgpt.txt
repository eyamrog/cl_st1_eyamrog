Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists and healthcare workers have been disseminating information based on scientific evidence to the general public, leading to increased visibility on social and mainstream media. Society has been able to witness science in action as these professionals have dedicated themselves to enhancing understanding and developing tools for the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control of this novel disease. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' perceptions of science, scientists, and healthcare workers, to ascertain whether it has influenced their career choices, and to examine the resulting first-year applications and enrollments in scientific and medical fields for the 2020-2021 academic year in Mexico. Through a voluntary national anonymous online survey and an analysis of the official database of the National Association of Universities and Higher Education Institutions in Mexico (ANUIES), we sought to address these inquiries. Our findings, based on 983 valid responses (CI 95%), indicate that by mid-2021, 9 out of 10 respondents aged 14-19 in Mexico held a positive view of science. Furthermore, the ongoing pandemic has enhanced their perceptions of science (69%), scientists (70%), and healthcare workers (72%), leading to shifts in their career aspirations towards pursuing careers in science (23%) and healthcare (28%). The primary motivation cited for studying these fields (40-50%) was a genuine interest in the subject matter, with only 3% attributing their choice to the pandemic. A detailed examination of the ANUIES database revealed a rise in first-year applications for scientific (22%) and healthcare (17%) disciplines for the 2020-2021 academic year compared to the preceding non-pandemic 2019-2020 academic year, with enrollment being constrained by available slots. This study suggests that a positive outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic may be the enhancement of perceptions towards science, scientists, and healthcare workers, potentially fostering a new cohort of professionals in these fields. Subsequent research should explore the longevity and further positive implications of this pandemic-induced shift, as well as investigate whether similar trends are observed in regions where adolescents have encountered varying public policies, messages, and COVID-19 outcomes.
In our study, the majority of Mexican adolescents exhibited a favorable perception of science. By mid-2021, their encounters amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic notably enhanced their views on science, scientists, and healthcare professionals, fostering a heightened interest in these fields and even motivating some to consider pursuing careers in science and healthcare.
The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated individuals to seek out information to enhance their safety, leading to the adoption of terms previously confined to academic circles and utilized by those interested in science and medicine. Platforms such as Google have noted a surge in searches for terms related to the detection, symptoms, transmission, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic. Social media platforms like Twitter have identified "coronavirus," "covid," and "pandemic" as trending topics, with "quarantine" being mentioned approximately 1.6 million times in 2020. Experts from scientific and medical backgrounds have leveraged social media to disseminate technical information in real-time to their peers and the general public. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has thrust science and health sciences into the spotlight unlike any other global event in recent history, with over 5 million confirmed deaths worldwide by December 2021.
The mainstream media, decision-makers, and the general public have shown a heightened interest in understanding and engaging with science to make informed decisions and mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Throughout the course of the pandemic, society has demonstrated significant appreciation and respect for the efforts of healthcare professionals and the scientific community in addressing and resolving this public health crisis. Major transformative events like a pandemic can profoundly influence the attitudes of young adults. For instance, the historic 1969 Moon landing inspired a generation of young individuals to pursue careers in science. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous countries and organizations have observed a surge in public trust and enthusiasm for science, as well as a notable increase in applications for scientific and medical studies, a phenomenon commonly referred to as the "Fauci effect."
This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the perceptions of Mexican adolescents towards science, scientists, and healthcare workers. Additionally, we aimed to determine whether the pandemic influenced their career choices, particularly in the fields of science and healthcare. Furthermore, we sought to ascertain whether there was a noticeable rise in first-year college applications and enrollment in Mexican universities for scientific and healthcare-related programs.
To comprehend the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the perception of science, scientists, healthcare workers, and career choices among individuals aged 14 to 19.

To investigate the impact on perception and interest in science, scientists, and health professionals, we conducted an anonymous quantitative multiple-choice online survey in Spanish. The survey was administered to a voluntary national sample of individuals aged 14 to 19 with Internet access in Mexico. Data collection took place between May 5 and June 27, 2021.
The survey was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines and standards set forth by the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), emphasizing principles of honesty, respect, and integrity.
In order to investigate topics 3 and 4, which pertain to the application and enrollment processes for scientific and health care careers at the university level, we conducted an analysis of the annual reports published by the National Association of Universities and Higher Education Institutions in Mexico (ANUIES) (13).
Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted in this study.
The cohort comprised 983 adolescents, with 63.5% being women, aged between 14 and 19 years (mean age 16.7, with 66% falling within the 16-18 age range), hailing from various states in Mexico. The distribution of participants was non-representative in relation to the population demographics. Of the total, 971 individuals (98.8%) were enrolled in school, with 69.8% attending public schools. The majority were in their final years of high school (77%), and 48% indicated that neither of their parents had pursued university education (see Fig. 1).
Participants were required to select one word from a list of eight options that they believed most accurately reflected their personal perspective on science. The list included four positive terms (knowledge, progress, solutions, well-being) and four negative terms (pollution, dehumanization, incomprehensibility, risks) as illustrated in Figure 2.
The majority of respondents (91.4%) chose a positive term to characterize their perception of science, with "knowledge" (44.0%) emerging as the most favored, closely trailed by "progress" (28.7%). A more optimistic outlook towards science was observed among male participants (94.2%), individuals attending private schools (94.5%), students in high school (92.0%), and those with at least one parent holding a university degree (92.8%).
Among the participants who held a negative perception of science, comprising 8.6% of the total sample, the term "pollution" was most commonly chosen, with a frequency of 3.8%. This group predominantly consisted of individuals who were not currently enrolled in studies (25.0%), attending public educational institutions (9.7%), female (10.3%), and lacking a parent with a university education (10.2%).
In the study, 69.1% of respondents indicated that their perception of science had improved due to the pandemic, while 23.1% stated that it had remained unchanged, and 7.8% reported a worsening view of science. These percentages were consistent across both adolescents who reported positive and negative perceptions of science in subtopic 1.1, as illustrated in Figure 3.a.
According to the data presented in Figure 3.b, 70.4% of the respondents indicated that their perception of scientists had improved due to the pandemic, while 25.9% stated that it remained unchanged, and 3.7% reported that the pandemic had actually worsened their view of scientists.
When prompted to select the most compelling rationale from a set of four options to elucidate these shifts, 53% of individuals whose perception of scientists had improved opted for "because they are individuals who contribute significant discoveries to society" as the primary justification. Conversely, 43% of those whose view of scientists had deteriorated chose "other" as their preferred explanation, with the second most popular choice (33%) being "they solely engage in discoveries and product development for financial gain."
According to the findings, a majority of respondents, specifically 71.9%, indicated that their perception of healthcare workers had improved in light of the pandemic. Conversely, 24.6% reported that their views remained unchanged, while a smaller percentage, 3.5%, stated that the pandemic had actually worsened their opinion of healthcare workers (see Fig. 3.c).
When prompted to select the most compelling rationale from a set of four choices to elucidate these shifts, 28% of individuals whose perception of healthcare professionals had become more favorable opted for "they are individuals of high intelligence who have undergone extensive education" as their primary justification, with 26% ranking "they mitigate suffering and preserve lives" as their secondary choice. Conversely, among those whose viewpoint had soured, 35% designated "other" as their primary rationale, while 24% identified "they exhibit arrogance" as their secondary explanation.
In the study, 433 adolescents, accounting for 44% of the respondents, indicated a shift in their study intentions. Among them, half (22.1%) attributed this change directly to the pandemic, while the remaining half (22.6%) cited "other reasons" for altering their study plans. Interestingly, the majority of adolescents, constituting 56%, expressed their intent to persist with their initial pre-pandemic study plans.
Among those who reported a shift in interests due to the pandemic, a higher percentage were female (23%) compared to males (20%), more were enrolled in public schools (25%) than in private schools (17%), and a greater proportion had parents who did not attend university (25.7%) as opposed to those with both parents having a university education (17.2%). Out of the 11 adolescents (1.1% of N=983) who indicated they would not pursue a career, two respondents (18%) mentioned altering their study intentions due to the pandemic.
When examining the responses of individuals who altered their career aspirations due to the pandemic based on their field of interest, it was observed that 23% of the young adults aspiring to pursue studies in science (comprising natural sciences, mathematics, and statistics) accounted for 6.2% of the total respondents. Additionally, 28% of those inclined towards healthcare professions represented 22.2% of the overall sample, while 20.0% of individuals aspiring for careers unrelated to natural or health sciences constituted 71.6% of the total participants who adjusted their educational goals due to the current pandemic situation (see Fig. 4 a. b.).
A higher percentage of respondents within the cohort expressing an interest in pursuing a career in the health sector (28%) and science (23%) reported altering their career aspirations due to the impact of the pandemic, in contrast to those focusing on different career paths (20%) or individuals not intending to pursue further studies (18%).
Among the adolescents who altered their study intentions towards health sciences in response to the pandemic, comprising 28% of the sample, a notable 26% concurrently reported an enhancement in their perception of health care workers (Subtopic 1.4). Similarly, within the cohort of adolescents who redirected their academic focus towards science disciplines encompassing natural sciences, mathematics, and statistics, constituting 23% of the participants, 15% indicated an improvement in their perception of scientists (Subtopic 1.3).
When queried about their motivations for pursuing studies in science (including natural sciences, math, and statistics) or health sciences, a predominant reason cited by individuals aspiring to enter these fields was their affinity for the knowledge associated with these disciplines. Specifically, 39.7% of respondents aiming to pursue health sciences and 48.4% of those interested in natural sciences, math, and statistics highlighted this as their primary motivation. A smaller proportion, 3.2%, indicated that the current pandemic had served as an inspiration for their decision to pursue careers in these areas.
Analyzing the official ANUIES reports' databases revealed a 6.5% overall increase in applications from the 2019-2020 to the 2020-2021 school years, with numbers rising from 2,053,348 to 2,186,739. Specifically, there was a notable 21.5% surge in applications for natural sciences, math, and statistics, escalating from 67,649 to 82,214, and a 17.1% increase in applications for health sciences, rising from 374,231 to 438,284 during the same period. Interestingly, in the initial year of the pandemic, applications for scientific fields (science and health care) experienced a substantial increase of 21.5% and 17.1%, respectively, surpassing the growth rate observed in other fields of study, which stood at 6.5% (Fig. 5.a).
Analyzing the official ANUIES reports' databases revealed that the first-year enrollment for natural sciences, math, and statistics in the 2020-2021 school year stood at 32,095, which was lower than both the total number of applications received (82,214) and the available spots (45,608), resulting in a 70.4% coverage of the places offered. Similarly, the first-year enrollment in health sciences for the same academic year was 126,132, lower than the total number of applications received (438,284) and the available spots (180,423), resulting in a 69.9% coverage of places offered. The disparity between demand and supply, among other variables, led to a first-year enrollment of 126,132 students for health sciences in 2020-2021, marking a 6.1% decrease from the previous year, and 32,095 for natural sciences, math, and statistics, reflecting a 3.9% increase from the previous year. Both the supply of places and the demand in applications have shown an upward trend in these fields over the period from 2011 to 2021 (Fig. 5.b).
In mid-2021, the majority of 14-19 year olds who participated in an anonymous questionnaire exhibited a positive perception of science, with 91% associating it primarily with "knowledge." Furthermore, 70% of adolescents reported that their encounters during the COVID-19 pandemic had a favorable impact on their views of science, scientists, and healthcare workers, while only 8% and 4% indicated a decline in their perceptions of science and these professionals, respectively. Notably, a higher percentage of adolescents (58%) reported an enhancement in their perceptions of scientists and healthcare workers due to the pandemic compared to those who reported a deterioration in their views of these professionals (1%).
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced the study intentions of a notable portion of the respondents, with 22% experiencing this impact. This influence was particularly pronounced among individuals interested in pursuing careers in healthcare, where 28% were affected, followed closely by those aspiring to study natural sciences, mathematics, and statistics, with 23% reporting an impact. Among adolescents expressing interest in health and natural sciences, the primary motivation for selecting these career paths was a genuine affinity for the subject matter, as indicated by the phrase "I like that type of knowledge." Interestingly, a mere 3% of these individuals attributed their career choice to the pandemic, suggesting that personal interest played a more significant role in their decision-making process.
Due to the persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been observed that 20% of adolescents aspiring to pursue careers in health sciences, natural sciences, mathematics, and statistics have shown an enhanced appreciation for health workers and scientists.
During the initial year of the pandemic (school year 2020-2021), there was a notable surge in applications for health sciences (17%) and natural sciences, mathematics, and statistics (22%) professions, surpassing the increase observed in other fields of study (7%) compared to the preceding, pre-pandemic academic year 2019-2020. Despite the heightened interest in these two areas of study during the pandemic's onset, actual enrollment figures were constrained by limited availability, resulting in a 6% decline in first-year health science students and a 4% rise in natural sciences, math, and statistics enrollments. It is imperative to delve into the factors contributing to this discrepancy. While there is a discernible uptick in demand for both fields, it is intriguing to note the marginal increase in science enrollments juxtaposed with the more pronounced decrease in health science enrollments.
Future research endeavors should delve into the duration and enduring repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on scientific and healthcare professions to comprehensively evaluate the true implications of the widely discussed "Fauci effect". Several studies have started to surface, examining the pandemic's influence on attitudes towards science, scientists, and healthcare professionals, along with its effects on career trajectories in various global regions. Comparing the findings of this investigation with those from diverse geographical areas, where adolescents encountered differing public health strategies, pandemic communications, and COVID-19 consequences, could provide valuable insights.
The silver lining in the pandemic may lead to the emergence of a new cohort of scientists, physicians, and healthcare professionals. Additionally, this period presents an opportunity for science communication experts to strengthen their connections with the public, for scientists to broaden their outreach efforts, and for educators to foster scientific literacy and critical thinking skills in students.
