The novel coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in China towards the end of 2019. In less than six months, its associated illness, COVID-19, has impacted over 6 million people across nearly every country globally. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially classified COVID-19 as a pandemic, marking it as one of the most formidable and alarming public health emergencies confronted by the current generation.
One notable aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is the apparent lower frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents compared to adults. Initial findings suggest that, unlike influenza or respiratory syncytial virus, children do not significantly contribute to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the community. Additionally, while the majority of infected children and adolescents exhibit either mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, recent surprising data indicating the onset of a severe inflammatory syndrome linked temporally to SARS-CoV-2 underscores the necessity for ongoing global surveillance efforts.
Data from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases across Asia, Europe, and North America, segmented by age groups, revealed that the prevalence of children and adolescents in these case series ranged from 1.0 to 1.7%. The clinical presentation of pediatric COVID-19 is diverse, spanning from asymptomatic to critically ill cases. Fever and cough emerged as consistently reported symptoms in these case series, albeit less frequently than in adults, followed by pharyngeal erythema, shortness of breath, rhinorrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Additional symptoms included myalgia, fatigue, headache, anosmia, and ageusia. Recently, various cutaneous manifestations have been documented in pediatric populations with COVID-19, encompassing erythematous rashes, urticaria, vesicular lesions, and chilblain-like lesions.
Leucopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, or procalcitonin were commonly observed in children and adolescents diagnosed with COVID-19. While the available data is relatively scarce compared to that for adults, findings suggest that lymphopenia, elevated levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase muscle and brain (MB) biomarkers are indicative of a more severe disease course in this population.
The clinical course of COVID-19 in children and adolescents rarely led to life-threatening illness with severe outcomes. In the largest case series reported from the USA, which included data on hospitalization status, around 20% of children and adolescents were hospitalized, with 2% requiring admission to Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU). Notably, infants under the age of one year had the highest percentage of hospitalization among pediatric COVID-19 patients. Less than 1% of children and adolescents experienced severe COVID-19 complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiorgan failure.
A recent study detailing the outcomes of children and adolescents with COVID-19 admitted to PICUs in the USA and Canada revealed that severe disease is less common in this population, with significantly better early outcomes compared to adults. Among the 46 children and adolescents (median age 13 years) admitted to the PICU, a substantial 83% were found to have underlying chronic health conditions. Of these, 38% required invasive ventilatory support, and tragically, only 4.2% succumbed to the illness.
In late April, cases of a severe and rare syndrome, temporally associated with COVID-19, have been reported in children and adolescents, initially in Europe and subsequently in North and Latin America. This syndrome, known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), manifests days to weeks after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical characteristics of MIS-C exhibit similarities with Kawasaki disease (KD), KD shock syndrome, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and toxic shock syndrome. While many patients with MIS-C fulfill criteria for complete or incomplete KD, affected children tend to be older, exhibit more intense inflammation, and display higher levels of cardiac injury markers. A wide array of presenting signs and symptoms and varying disease severity have been noted among reported MIS-C cases, including persistent fever, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea), rash, conjunctivitis, progressing in some instances to shock, myocarditis, acute heart failure, and the development of coronary artery aneurysms. Generally, patients who have presented with this syndrome were previously healthy, with most testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but positive for antibodies, indicating an imbalanced immune response post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory findings encompass lymphocytopenia, elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, D-dimer, ferritin), and cardiac biomarkers (troponin, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]).
Based on existing evidence, older adults and individuals of all age groups with underlying medical conditions such as severe obesity, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, active cancer, transplantation, and immunocompromised states have been linked to adverse clinical outcomes and increased fatality rates due to COVID-19.
Limited data currently exist regarding the underlying conditions in children and adolescents that may be linked to an elevated risk of infection or severe illness. Infants under one year of age and children with chronic pulmonary diseases (such as moderate to severe asthma), cardiovascular conditions (including congenital heart disease), malignancies, immunosuppression, and obesity are believed to face an increased risk of severe disease. There is a scarcity of information on immunocompromised patients with autoimmune diseases and their susceptibility to COVID-19. While the actual risk of life-threatening complications from this novel infectious disease in the context of these chronic illnesses remains uncertain, there are specific concerns surrounding SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients undergoing treatment with immunosuppressive medications, biological agents, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.
One of the most significant Latin American reference centers for pediatric liver diseases and pediatric liver transplantation in Brazil detailed their encounter with 169 non-transplant children and adolescents who were suspected and tested for SARS‑CoV-2. Notably, 13 out of 169 (8%) of these individuals were confirmed to have COVID‑19 through laboratory tests. It is worth mentioning that all of these cases were classified as mild, with the exception of one individual who succumbed to a severe genetic syndrome. Additionally, throughout the study duration, none of the 190 pediatric liver transplant patients included in the study were diagnosed with COVID-19.
The overall morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 in pediatric patients with cancer appear to be low. A prominent pediatric cancer program in New York City, one of the largest in the USA, documented that 20 out of 178 (11%) children and adolescents with cancer tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among them, only one patient required noncritical hospitalization due to COVID-19. Given the aggressive nature of malignancies in pediatric populations, which often necessitate multiple rounds of chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation, it is advised against postponing these essential therapies during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The enduring repercussions of the ongoing pandemic, characterized by prolonged school closures and enforced social isolation measures during quarantine or lockdowns, have the potential to significantly impact the sedentary habits and dietary choices of children and adolescents. This could lead to an escalation in the consumption of calorie-dense comfort foods, thereby heightening the susceptibility to weight gain and exacerbating the likelihood of developing metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. These risks are particularly pronounced among individuals residing in urban areas.
There are additional challenges faced by children and adolescents during this pandemic. Non-pharmacological interventions have emerged as crucial preventive measures, endorsed by both national and international public health authorities. Apart from the potential disruption of education during the COVID-19 crisis, home confinements can lead to increased screen time, reduced physical activity, disrupted sleep patterns, heightened risk of alcohol consumption, and a rise in domestic violence, particularly among adolescents. It is imperative to emphasize drug adherence among patients with preexisting chronic conditions and their families to mitigate the risk of disease exacerbation or progression. Furthermore, individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 require vigilant monitoring post-recovery to detect any potential reactivation of the disease.
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed immense strain on public health systems, posing a significant threat to the overall well-being of pediatric populations. This crisis has resulted in restricted access to essential healthcare services for children and adolescents, leading to compromised immunization rates and delayed medical consultations for those with pre-existing conditions. Additionally, the mental health implications and socio-economic challenges stemming from the pandemic could have detrimental effects on the youth and their families in both the short and long term. Conditions such as acute stress, anxiety, depression ranging from mild to severe, post-traumatic stress disorder, and emotional exhaustion may manifest during or following the pandemic. Consequently, there is a growing need for online mental health services tailored to pediatric populations, utilizing teleconsultation or telephone support lines to address these pressing issues.
The quest for a safe and effective antiviral therapy to enhance disease outcomes has been a focal point of extensive global research efforts. Despite this, compelling evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of various antivirals such as the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, or favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive. Furthermore, it is important to note that the bulk of these trials have predominantly involved adult populations, leaving a dearth of data, if any, on the efficacy and safety of most candidate antiviral therapies in children.
It is crucial to acknowledge that the vast majority of children and adolescents infected with COVID-19 will typically experience a mild, self-limiting form of the disease. Consequently, a substantial number of patients would need to undergo treatment to establish the efficacy of an antiviral, prompting concerns regarding potential adverse effects associated with such intervention. Therefore, in light of the current lack of evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of available drugs for treating COVID-19 in this demographic, we advocate for the routine recommendation of supportive care for most cases. However, in instances of severe disease manifestations or when strong risk factors indicate a potential for disease progression, the consideration of antiviral therapy on a case-by-case basis may be warranted, provided that the benefits outweigh the risks of potential adverse events associated with the chosen drug. It is advisable that these off-label antiviral treatments for COVID-19 in children and adolescents be administered within the context of a clinical trial whenever possible.
Post-exposure prophylaxis represents a potential strategy for employing antiviral therapies. A recent double-blind randomized trial investigated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine when administered within four days following reported exposure. Nevertheless, the findings did not demonstrate any significant impact of this medication in preventing illness consistent with COVID-19 or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection when utilized as post-exposure prophylaxis.
The most intriguing aspect of the battle against COVID-19 lies in the development of a safe and effective vaccine. Currently, over 130 candidate vaccines are in development, with at least 10 of them undergoing human trials. These vaccines utilize various platforms, such as nucleic acid-based (mRNA and DNA), vector-based, and inactivated or recombinant protein vaccines. Previous studies on other zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS‑CoV and MERS-CoV, which focused on the S protein target, have paved the way for a faster development of the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
Significant strides have been achieved in a relatively brief timeframe; however, numerous unanswered questions and obstacles persist in the quest for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. These challenges include the potential risk of Antibody-Dependent-Enhancement, the absence of clearly defined correlates of protection, the durability of immune responses post-vaccination, the optimal dosage regimen across different age demographics, the likely necessity of adjuvants to elicit a TH1 response, and the importance of high neutralizing antibody levels to minimize antigen dosing. Furthermore, the uncertainty remains regarding whether these vaccines will confer protection against infection, potentially reducing community transmission upon widespread coverage, or solely mitigate disease severity and mortality.
The potential impact of recent Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunization on preventing COVID-19 is currently under investigation in clinical trials. Prior research has demonstrated that BCG immunization, in addition to its targeted efficacy against severe tuberculosis, triggers a non-specific protective immune response against various other infections.
In conclusion, nearly six months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the epicenter has shifted from China, Europe, and the USA to Brazil, exposing our vulnerable population to devastating consequences. While children and adolescents seem to exhibit lower prevalence, milder clinical manifestations, and lower fatality rates compared to other age groups, the global crisis of COVID-19 could have a profound, long-term negative impact on pediatric populations. The recent identification of rare and severe inflammatory syndrome cases of COVID-19 in older children and adolescents underscores the unpredictable pathogenesis spectrum and outcomes of the disease. Mental health burdens, social impacts, and financial losses pose significant challenges for children and adolescents of both the current and future generations. Further multicenter and longitudinal pediatric studies involving large populations will be essential to elucidate these findings and assess specific healthy and preexisting chronic conditions in children and adolescents.
