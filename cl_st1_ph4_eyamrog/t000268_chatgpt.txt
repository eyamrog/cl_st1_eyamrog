In less than four months, an unprecedented pandemic has reshaped the global landscape, leading to the closure of institutions and businesses, the suspension of sports championships, the imposition of travel restrictions, and the implementation of widespread house quarantine measures. Immunocompromised individuals are particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes from COVID-19, yet the link between compromised immune status and SARS-CoV-2 complications remains unclear. Given that the virus spreads through inhalation or direct contact with infected secretions, dental offices are at high risk for transmission. This review delves into the existing literature on immunological aspects of COVID-19 and offers recommendations for supporting immunocompromised patients in the evolving landscape of dental care. Until more comprehensive data is available, individuals with weakened immune systems should be treated as high-risk individuals. In caring for immunocompromised patients, infection control protocols should mirror those recommended for immunocompetent individuals. During active outbreaks, elective procedures should be avoided for those under immunosuppressive conditions, even in the absence of symptoms or known exposure to COVID-19. In the event of emergent care, treatment should be conducted in a designated airborne isolation room. Post-pandemic, general dental care guidelines should apply uniformly to all patients. Proposed changes to infection control measures in response to SARS-CoV-2 require validation through future research to ensure the safest and most effective dental practices.
On December 12, 2019, a patient was admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, with severe pneumonia of unknown origin. Concurrently, clusters of similar cases were emerging within the province. In early January 2020, the unidentified pneumonia was determined to be caused by a novel viral subtype within the Coronaviridae family, specifically identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). By the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 infection a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Shortly after, the disease was officially named "coronavirus disease 2019" (COVID-19). The pandemic status was declared on March 12, 2020, and since then, the global outbreak has rapidly escalated.
While most cases of COVID-19 present as mild respiratory tract infections with cold-like symptoms, the global impact of the disease is significant. Severe outcomes are more common in older male patients with underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and heart conditions. Recent epidemiological evidence has also identified obesity as a potential risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Serum analysis has revealed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in severely ill patients, indicating a heightened immune response. The correlation between chronic diseases, compromised immune function, and COVID-19 prognosis underscores the importance of considering the host immune status in assessing disease severity. Immunocompromised individuals have been identified as being at a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
The ongoing pandemic presents an unparalleled and unprecedented challenge, standing as the most significant public health crisis of the 21st century. Numerous guidelines have been put forth to ensure safe dental healthcare practices and control the spread of the pandemic. However, there remains a notable absence of specific directives tailored towards the management of immunocompromised patients. These individuals often grapple with a spectrum of oral health issues necessitating immediate attention, consequently heightening their exposure to environments with elevated risks. In light of this, our objective is to conduct a comprehensive literature review and delve into the immunological implications of COVID-19. Furthermore, we aim to provide recommendations for supporting immunocompromised patients within this evolving landscape of clinical dental practice.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) constitute a family of enveloped, nonsegmented positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses with a broad coding capacity, categorized into four subfamilies: α, β, γ, and δ-CoVs. Historically, these viruses were primarily identified in vertebrate animals until the 1950s. Human infections predominantly stem from α and β CoVs, initially surfacing as cases of the common cold in the mid-1960s. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic marks the third CoVs outbreak in the 21st century. The first epidemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), occurred from November 2002 to July 2003 in China, resulting in 8,422 confirmed cases and 774 deaths across 26 countries. Subsequently, a second outbreak emerged in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia, attributed to a novel CoV subtype known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The MERS-CoV epidemic persists, with 2,499 cases and 858 deaths reported in 27 countries by December 2019. Although the current pandemic originated in China, the European and American continents have experienced the most severe impact.
Similar to SARS and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-CoV family. This pathogen was classified within the SARSr-CoV species due to its 87% genomic sequence similarity and 94% conserved protein domain similarity with SARS-CoV. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 shares 96% overall genome sequence identity with the bat coronavirus BaTCoV RaTG13. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that RaTG13 is the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2, forming a distinct lineage from other SARS-CoVs, providing further evidence that COVID-19 likely originated from bats.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a similar physical structure with other Coronaviruses (CoVs), with its genomic RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N) enclosed within a phospholipid bilayer. This bilayer is further enveloped by three distinct types of proteins: spike glycoprotein trimmer (S), membrane protein (M), and envelope protein (E). Among these, the S proteins are crucial for CoV attachment to host cells, thereby influencing its virulence. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins exhibit unique characteristics, being longer and molecularly divergent from previously identified CoVs. Moreover, molecular alterations in the N-terminal domain and the receptor-binding motif set SARS-CoV-2 apart from the sequence of SARS-CoV.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a type I membrane protein that serves as a direct binding site for the S proteins, playing a crucial role in facilitating viral entry into cells. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a significantly higher affinity for ACE2, approximately 10 to 20 times greater than SARS-CoV, potentially contributing to its increased human-to-human transmission rate. The S protein undergoes cleavage into two subunits (S1 and S2) during cell invasion, with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) located on the S1 subunit directly interacting with ACE2. The S2 subunit, on the other hand, is cleaved by transmembrane proteases and fuses with the cell membrane, releasing the viral genome into the cytosol. Notably, a dimeric ACE2 has the capacity to accommodate two S protein trimers simultaneously, potentially aiding in the invagination of the cell membrane and the endocytosis of the viral particle.
The upregulation of ACE2 has been identified in various organs, including the salivary glands, lung, heart, esophagus, kidney, bladder, and ileum, heightening their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, severe lung alveolar damage in certain cases has been attributed to the pronounced ACE2 expression in type II alveolar cells (AT2), which also exhibit elevated levels of other genes that facilitate viral entry. Additionally, ACE2 expression has been observed in male reproductive cells and the nervous system, potentially elucidating the neurological symptoms seen in COVID-19 patients. Consequently, the testis and brain have been recognized as additional organs at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Inflammation serves as the hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with severely ill patients exhibiting elevated plasma levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF-α compared to less severe cases. Even asymptomatic individuals displayed typical indicators of lung cell inflammatory responses on chest CT images. The precise origins of this pronounced inflammation remain unclear, prompting the exploration of various potential mechanisms rooted in prior understanding of SARS-CoV infection.
Following contagion through respiratory droplets, direct contact, and/or the fecal-oral route, viruses primarily enter human cells by binding to ACE2 receptors, infecting various cell types such as epithelial, endothelial, and immune system cells. Fu and colleagues proposed a distinction between the inflammatory responses observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection, categorizing them into primary and secondary responses. The primary response involves active viral replication potentially leading to ACE2 downregulation, shedding, and the activation of host viral responses marked by increased cytokine production, apoptosis, and pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation previously seen in SARS-CoV infection. The secondary response is characterized by the emergence of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) that can stimulate the monocytic/macrophagic response through FcR binding, ultimately contributing to severe lung injury. Additionally, the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism, involving the cellular uptake of virus-antibody complexes, may occur during this phase, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Such patients may exhibit suboptimal antibody activity early on, leading to persistent viral replication, inflammation, and an elevated risk of fatality. Nevertheless, the impact of immunosuppression on the severity of COVID-19 remains a topic of ongoing debate.
The biological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection necessitates the activation of both innate and acquired immunity. In a postmortem study, the overactivation of T cells, characterized by an increase in Th17 cells and heightened cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells, was found to be associated with severe lung immune injury. Lymphopenia, a common observation in COVID-19 patients, has been extensively linked to severe complications and mortality, potentially resulting from the sequestration of hyperactivated T cells in the lungs. Given that excessive immune responses can contribute significantly to organ damage, the anti-inflammatory properties of immunosuppression could offer protection by alleviating the "cytokine storm" associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19.
Several studies have documented an overall asymptomatic or mild progression of COVID-19 in immunocompromised individuals, including children undergoing anticancer therapy, users of immunosuppressive chronic medications, transplant recipients, and those with poorly controlled HIV or AIDS. In these cases, the few severely affected patients showed signs of recovery, and low fatality rates were observed. Furthermore, immunosuppression did not emerge as a significant risk factor for either SARS or MERS in the available literature.
In a case-control study, immunocompromised children were found to be more susceptible to lower respiratory tract infections from SARS-CoV33, while a nationwide analysis revealed that cancer patients infected with the virus had a worse prognosis. Additionally, recent research has linked the chronic use of corticosteroids prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection to severe outcomes, such as a heightened risk of mortality. Furthermore, the successful recovery of a liver transplant recipient severely impacted by COVID-19 was only possible after temporarily discontinuing immunosuppressive treatment and restoring immune function.
These conflicting findings highlight the limited understanding of the connection between COVID-19 and the immunological status of the host. Additional research is necessary to clarify the immune responses and inflammatory characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As per the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), individuals with compromised immune systems are considered at high risk for the progression of severe illness. It is crucial to closely monitor these patients until more comprehensive case-control studies are conducted to yield more definitive conclusions.
The generation of aerosols during dental care procedures is a significant concern, particularly in the current pandemic situation. Evidence of viral aerosol transmission has been confirmed with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples up to four meters away from general COVID-19 wards, with the virus capable of surviving on surfaces exposed to infected saliva droplets for up to nine days. Under optimal experimental conditions, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated prolonged viability on stainless steel and plastic, which are major components of dental instruments and equipment. Furthermore, oral tissues, particularly the salivary glands and epithelial cells of the tongue, express ACE2 receptors, making the oral mucosa highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These factors collectively highlight the vulnerability of both dental practitioners and patients in the context of COVID-19.
The immunocompromised status is closely associated with a variety of oral pathological conditions. Transplant recipients are particularly vulnerable to oral bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, oral mucosal lesions, and neoplastic diseases. Oral candidiasis has been linked to poorly controlled immunological status in HIV-infected individuals and patients undergoing anticancer therapy. Individuals undergoing head and neck cancer radiotherapy are highly susceptible to severe oral health problems such as mucositis and dental radiation cavities.
Patients with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune bullous diseases, lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, and Behcet disease, face two primary concerns. Firstly, the long-term immunomodulating treatments used for these conditions could potentially suppress antiviral immunity, leading to a heightened susceptibility to severe outcomes from COVID-19. Furthermore, discontinuing such therapies during the pandemic may trigger a worsening of autoimmune-related oral lesions, highlighting the delicate balance between managing the underlying condition and potential risks associated with treatment adjustments.
Various guidelines have been put forth for the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to ensure safe dental practices. During the ongoing pandemic, it is recommended that an initial tele screening be conducted to determine the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and assess potential exposure to high-risk situations, including recent travel and contact with individuals who may have been infected.
During an outbreak, it is recommended that elective procedures be postponed for a minimum of two weeks if the individual displays symptoms or has a known exposure history, and they should not be conducted for individuals who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Urgent care, such as addressing acute pain or mild swelling, should be managed remotely through medication prescriptions and close monitoring via telephone or video conferencing. Emergency care, particularly for conditions that obstruct the airways, should be carried out in negative pressure or airborne isolation rooms, adhering to established infection control protocols. Radiographic assessments for dental emergencies can be conducted using sectional dental panoramic radiography or intraoral radiography, with dentists and radiography staff utilizing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Elective and urgent procedures should be avoided for immunocompromised patients, even if they are asymptomatic, with emergency care being provided in an airborne isolated setting, following the recommended clinical procedures outlined above.
For immunocompetent patients without symptoms or exposure history, dental treatment can be safely conducted under specific conditions. An extensive hand hygiene protocol, utilizing 60% to 85% hydroalcoholic solution, the use of all personal protective equipment (PPE), and, when feasible, the 4-handle technique should be implemented. Equipment should be shielded with disposable physical barriers, and anti-reflux valves should be fitted on handpieces. To minimize aerosol generation, procedures such as ultrasound, bicarbonate jet, and the 3-way syringe should be avoided, while the use of rubber dams and high-volume saliva ejectors is recommended. Preprocedural mouth rinses with 1% hydrogen peroxide or 0.2% povidone are advised to reduce potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The clinical setting must be thoroughly disinfected both before and after dental procedures, using either 70% isopropyl alcohol or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite. Waste disposal should involve placing garbage in double-layer yellow medical waste bags with "gooseneck" ligation.
It is important to highlight that the current guidelines are valuable during the acute phase of the pandemic, and certain adjustments are necessary for routine dental practice post-pandemic control. The same protocols recommended for immunocompetent individuals are also advised for immunocompromised patients post-pandemic. It remains essential to conduct prior assessments of COVID-19 risk and monitor body temperature using a non-contact thermometer. Suspected cases should receive care in isolation or be scheduled on specific days. Elective procedures should be avoided in individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with management following acute pandemic phase guidelines.
Patients who exhibit no symptoms or have no known exposure history can be accommodated in collective clinical settings. However, given that most cases of COVID-19 are characterized by either asymptomatic or mild symptoms, certain precautions need to be implemented. It is imperative to ensure that dental and waiting room chairs are positioned at a minimum distance of four meters and one meter apart, respectively. The flow of consultations should be streamlined, with a designated thirty-minute period allocated for the thorough disinfection of the treatment room following each patient's care. Essential supplies such as 70% ethanol, masks, and disposable shoe covers should be readily available for both auxiliary staff and patients. Furthermore, adherence to protective measures during dental procedures remains crucial, as outlined in existing guidelines. (References: 8, 9, 10, 45, 46)
Elderly males, hypertensive patients with diabetes, and individuals with chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are well-recognized as a high-risk group for severe manifestations of COVID-19. However, the impact of the disease on immunosuppressed patients remains uncertain. A more extensive analysis of symptoms and laboratory results in a larger cohort of immunocompromised individuals is essential to understand how SARS-CoV-2 triggers heightened inflammatory reactions. These investigations will be instrumental in determining the actual risk of complications and mortality in immunosuppressed settings.
Efforts worldwide to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 during dental procedures have yielded valuable guidelines for optimal dental practices. However, the efficacy of acute phase and post-pandemic infection control measures must be substantiated through prospective epidemiological and comparative multicenter studies. In this context, we have examined the outcomes of COVID-19 in individuals with compromised immune systems, emphasizing the necessity for elective procedures post-pandemic to adhere to stringent cross-infection control protocols.
