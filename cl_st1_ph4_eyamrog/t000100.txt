Determinants and Cheeger-M¨uller Theorem on
even dimensional real projective spaces*
F.S. Rafael
August 12, 2021
Abstract
We establish formulae for the regularized determinant of the Lapla-
cian and twisted Laplacian on forms over even dimensional real projective
spaces and use them to explicitly calculate the analytic torsion of these
spaces with orthogonal and unitary representations of their fundamental
group, obtaining the ﬁrst example to show that this torsion is non-trivial
for cyclic complexes associated to even dimensional non-orientable mani-
folds. Moreover, as discussed in the introduction, the several proofs of the
Cheeger-M¨uller Theorem given throughout years left one speciﬁc question
unanswered and we answer this question for this type of space.

Introduction
Let M be a closed Riemannian manifold and let ρ : π1(M) →GL(E) be a rep-
resentation of the fundamental group of M, where E is a ﬁnite dimensional real
or complex vector space. The spectral zeta function of the twisted Laplacian
∆q
M,ρ is deﬁned in terms of the spectrum of this operator by extending mero-
morphically the function deﬁned for Re(s) suﬃciently large by the following
formula:
ζ(s, ∆q
M,ρ) =
X
λ>0
dim(E(λ, ∆q
M,ρ))λ−s,
Re(s) ≫0,
where E(λ, ∆q
M,ρ) denotes the eigenspace associated to the eigenvalue λ.
This function was created by Minakshisundaram and Pleijel on [13] and
has several applications, in particular, its derivative at zero provides us with
the important concept of regularized determinant of the Laplacian, det(∆q
M,ρ),
according to the following expression:
det(∆q
M,ρ) := exp(−ζ′(0, ∆q
M,ρ)).
The regularized determinant by itself has several applications, both in Physics
and Mathematics. Some applications of this concept to Physics are discussed

INTRODUCTION

on [6], where the authors establish a formula for determinants on a speciﬁc
class of diﬀerential operators, compare it to the already known result for the
determinant on functions over S2 (on the last paragraph of subsection 4.5) and
mention some possible applications of their work (on section 7). About appli-
cations in Mathematics, on [21] the author uses determinants of the Laplacian
on spheres to generalize a formula about multiple gamma functions; and on [19]
we have one of the most important applications of regularized determinants to
mathematics, since in this text the authors use the determinant of the twisted
Laplacian to deﬁne the analytic torsion Ta(M; ρ) of a closed Riemannian man-
ifold M in relation to an orthogonal representation ρ of its fundamental group.
The precise deﬁnition of Ta(M; ρ) is given by:
Ta(M, ρ) = exp

.
The deﬁnition of analytic torsion was created by Ray and Singer [19] as an
analytic version for Reidemeister torsion (see section 5 for a discussion about
this concept), and these authors conjectured that for odd dimensional orientable
manifolds with orthogonal representation of the fundamental group these tor-
sions were equivalent, what had already been proved for lens spaces on [18]
and for even dimensional orientable manifolds as a consequence of Theorem 2.3
of [19].
It is important to mention that these authors followed Milnor’s deﬁnition of
Reidemeister torsion, given on section 8 of [12], but they extended this deﬁnition,
since Milnor considered exclusively acyclic complexes, i. e., complexes whose
homology is trivial, and Ray and Singer considered also the cyclic cases. It is
also important to mention that both [12] and [19] considered homology when
dealing with Reidemeister torsion and this was specially relevant on [19], since
these authors needed Poincar´e duality to deﬁne the bases used for homology
groups in the cyclic case.
On 1978, Werner M¨uller [14] published a proof for the conjecture of Ray-
Singer, which is known as the Cheeger-M¨uller Theorem, and he considered ex-
clusively orientable manifolds throughout the text. Moreover, he made a slight
change in the problem proposed by Ray and Singer, since he considered the Rei-
demeister torsion of the cohomology complex associated to a manifold rather
than homology. On 1979, Cheeger [5] published an independent proof of the
same problem and also considered cohomology when proving the theorem, even
though his proof does not require orientability.
The Cheeger-M¨uller Theorem was studied by Bismut and Zhang on 1992, [1],
who also considered cohomology when dealing with Reidemeister torsion, fol-
lowing [5] and [14], but these authors extended this result to odd dimensional
closed Riemannian manifolds with unimodular representation of the fundamen-
tal group, and constructed an integral formula which describes the relation
between the two torsions on the even dimensional case.
On 1993, [15], M¨uller returned to the conjecture proposed by Ray and Singer,
this time using homology to study Reidemeister torsion, and he proved that both
torsions have the same value on odd dimensional manifolds with unimodular rep-
resentation of the fundamental group, what does not happen in general in the
even dimensional case, as exampliﬁed on page 732 of the same text, [15]. How-
ever, the approach used by M¨uller when dealing with cyclic complexes required

the use of orientability because to describe the volumes used in the cyclic case,
ﬁrst paragraph of page 729, the author needed Poincar´e duality and there is
no indication of how to replace this concept in the non-orientable setting. This
speciﬁc choice of volumes is fundamental for Theorem 2.15 and Corollary 2.16
of [15], which were originally proved by Ray and Singer on [19] for orthogonal
representations and were extended by M¨uller [15] to the unimodular case. In
section 3, the core part of the proof of Cheeger-M¨uller Theorem, the speciﬁc
choice of volumes also plays an important role, specially on page 745.
The Cheeger-M¨uller Theorem was studied again on [3], [4] and [10], but these
authors also considered cohomology when dealing with Reidemeister torsion.
In this text we prove that Cheeger-M¨uller Theorem is valid for even dimen-
sional real projective spaces in the sense discussed on [15] by explicitly calcu-
lating their analytic and Reidemeister torsions, see Theorem 5.1. To calculate
the analytic torsion we ﬁrst establish formulae for the regularized determinant
of the Laplacian, Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.3, and we use these formulae to
obtain the desired torsion, Theorem 4.2. This reasoning was inspired by [22],
even though these authors did not establish regularized determinant formulae.
To calculate the Reidemeister torsion we ﬁrst establish homology bases for odd
dimensional projective spaces, which are orientable, and we use these bases as
references for our speciﬁc choice in the even dimensional case. It is important
to mention that these torsions are not trivial for RP2m, contrary to what hap-
pens for orientable even dimensional manifolds, as expressed by Proposition 2.9
of [15]. We have no knowledge of any prior reference showing an example of this
fact for even dimensional non-orientable manifolds with cyclic representation of
the fundamental group.
Our study is divided in the following way: section 2 is dedicated to es-
tablishing the notation that will be used throughout the text as well as some
fundamental preliminary results for our determinant formulae, the most impor-
tant ones are the decomposition of the spaces of forms into SO(n + 1)-modules,
Table 2, and the derivative at zero of a speciﬁc Dirichlet series, Lemma 2.1.
Section 3 is devoted to establishing the formulae for regularized determinants,
which will be used on section 4 to calculate the analytic torsion of RP2m. On
section 5, the ﬁnal section, we deﬁne the Reidemeister torsion of real chain
complexes and describe how to ﬁx bases for the homology groups of RP2m−1,
following M¨uller’s approach to the problem, [15]. We then use these data to
determine the speciﬁc bases that would be used to calculate the Reidemeister
torsion of odd dimensional projective spaces and adapt these bases to the even
dimensional case to obtain the Reidemeister torsion of RP2m in relation to this
particular choice of bases. Since the results obtained on sections 4 and 5 are
equal, we conclude the validity of Cheeger-M¨uller Theorem for RP2m in the
setting discussed in this text.

Prerequisites for the formula
The ﬁrst step for establishing our formula for regularized determinants is to
determine the spectrum and multiplicity of eingenvalues of the Laplacian on
forms over even dimensional real projective spaces. To achieve this objective we
outline part of the study of Ikeda and Taniguchi [9].
In section 6 of [9] the authors deﬁne the spaces of harmonic polynomial forms

on Rn+1 as the sets Hq
k of α ∈C∞(Rn+1) such that, for ∆the Laplace operator
on forms over Rn+1 and δ0 the formal adjoint of the exterior diﬀerential, α
satisﬁes ∆α = 0, δ0α = 0 and α = P
0⩽i1<···<iq⩽n+1 αi1,...,iqdxi1 ∧· · · ∧dxiq,
where q ∈{0, . . . , n} (q = 0 corresponds to functions), k ∈N ∪{0} and αi1,...,iq
are homogeneous polynomials of degree k.
Moreover, they prove in Corolary 6.6 that for i : Sn →Rn+1 the inclusion
map, we have for every q ∈{0, . . . , n} that i∗: ∪k≥0Hq
k →C∞(Λq(Sn)) is
injective and has its image dense in C∞(Λq(Sn)).
Considering the natural actions A1 and A2 of SO(n + 1) on C∞(Λq(Rn+1))
and on C∞(Λq(Sn)), respectively, we see that Hq
k and i∗Hq
k are SO(n + 1)-
modules, and moreover, i∗A1 = A2i∗. So, when we decompose Hq
k in SO(n+1)-
irreducible modules we are also decomposing i∗Hq
k.
Ikeda and Taniguchi [9] provide us with this decomposition. The resulting
data is summarized on Table 1, that is also present on [17], by using the maximal
weights corresponding to the root system Q = {±ei ± ej | i ̸= j}, the positive
roots Q
+ = {ei−ej, ei+ej | i < j} and simple roots {e1−e2, e2−e3, . . . , em−1−
em, em−1 +em}. On this table we use the notation E(kΛ1 +Λq) to represent the
SO(n + 1)-module corresponding to the weight kΛ1 + Λq, with the convention
that for 1 ⩽q ⩽m, E(−1Λ1 + Λq) = E(−1Λ1 + Λ−
m) = E(−1Λ1 + Λ+
m) = {0}
is the trivial module. Note that we follow the roots used by Weng and You on
section 2 of [22], which contrast with the corresponding roots adopted on [9].

Besides using the results from [9], we also use the theory of [7, section 3.9],
which establishes that if M is a Riemannian manifold whose fundamental group
is cyclic of order l and (ρs)0⩽s⩽l are representatives for the irreducible repre-
sentations of π1(M), then
E(λ, ∆q
˜
M) = ⊕sEeq(λ, ∆q

(1)
where ˜
M is the universal covering of M, ∆q
M,ρs is the twisted Laplacian asso-
ciated to the representation ρs, λ is any real number and Eeq(λ, ∆q
M,ρs) stands
for the eigenforms of ∆q
˜
M associated to λ that are equivariant in relation to ρs.
So, to determine the eigenvalues and dimension of the eigenspaces of ∆q
RPn
it is useful to identify among the eigenforms of ∆q
Sn the ones that are equiv-
ariant in relation to the trivial representation σ of π1(RPn) in GL(R), since
the twisted Laplacian ∆q
RPn,σ is essentially ∆q
RPn. These equivariant eigenforms
are precisely the pullbacks by the inclusion map i : Sn →Rn+1 of the har-
monic polynomial forms ω ∈C∞(ΛqRn+1) that satisfy ω(x) = ω(−x) for every

x ∈Rn+1. If Hq
k is one space of harmonic polynomial forms, then Hq
k con-
tains forms with this property if, and only if, q +k is even and in this case every
element of Hq
k has this property. So, by Table 1 and (1) we obtain the decompo-
sition of C∞(ΛqRPn) into irreducible SO(n + 1)-modules, which is summarized
on Table 2. (The odd dimensional version of this table is present on [16]).

Now we just need to know the eigenvalue associated to each irreducible
module and the dimension of this space. This subject was studied by Weng and
You [22] when they calculated analytic torsion of spheres and is presented on
Table 3, with the remark that their original work had a misprint that corre-
sponds to the last line of the table when q ̸= m (see the appendix of [17] for a
proof of this statement). We present the correct version of the data.

Beyond determining the spectrum and dimension of the eigenspaces of the
Laplacian, we need some technical lemmas to simplify subsequent calculations.

Determinant of the Laplacian on even dimen-
sional real projective spaces
We proceed now with the construction of our determinant formulae. To obtain
our formulae we will use the auxiliary functions ξe
q,k(s) deﬁned on Lemma 2.4.
These functions are the same auxiliary functions deﬁned in section 3.2 of [17]
to calculate the regularized determinants of spheres. By using them and the
decomposition of C∞(ΛqRP2m) into SO(2m + 1)-irreducible modules given by
Table 2 we may describe the spectral zeta functions of RP2m in the following
way:
ζ(s, ∆0
RP2m)

So, to determine the derivatives at zero of the spectral zeta functions we
just need to determine the derivatives at zero of the functions P
k⩾0
ξe
q,2k(s) and
P
k⩾0
ξe
q,2k+1(s) for q ∈Nm.
If q ∈Nm and φ ∈{0, 1} satisfy q = 2a + b with b ∈{0, 1} and b + φ = 1,
then by Lemma 2.4:

a−1
X
k=0
4k + 2m + 3 −2q
(2k + 1)s−j(2k + 2m + 2 −2q)s−j .
Since 0 ⩽k ⩽a −1 implies 1 ⩽2k + 1 ⩽q −1 we may apply part S1 of
Lemma 2.3 to obtain:
a−1

k=0
m−1
X

An interesting corollary of this theorem is the relation between the deriva-
tives at zero of the spectral zeta functions of even dimensional spheres and
projective spaces.
Corollary 3.2. For m ∈N and p ∈Nm ∪{0}, the derivatives at zero of the
spectral zeta functions of the Laplacian on forms over spheres and projective
spaces satisfy the following property:
ζ′(0, ∆m−p
S2m ) = ζ′(0, ∆m−p
RP2m) + ζ′(0, ∆m+p
RP2m) = ζ′(0, ∆m+p
S2m ).
Proof. This result follows from direct comparison of Theorem 3.1 above and
Theorem 4.2 of [17].
We may also use Theorem 3.1 to calculate the regularized determinants
of the twisted Laplacians det ∆p
RP,ρ for orthogonal or unitary representations
ρ : π1(RP2m) →GL(E).

Corollary 3.3. Let ρ : π1(RP2m) →GL(E) be an orthogonal or unitary repre-
sentation of π1(RP2m) and let

be a decomposition of ρ into irreducible representations, where σ1 is the triv-
ial irreducible representation.
The determinant of ∆q
RP2m,ρ, q ∈{0, . . . , 2m}
satisﬁes:
det ∆q
RP2m,ρ
=
 det ∆q
RP2m
2p−N ·
 det ∆q
S2m
N−p .
Proof. By the decomposition of ρ into irreducible representations we have:
det ∆q
RP2m,ρ
=

det ∆q
RP2m,σ1
p
·

det ∆q
RP2m

N−p
,
because given two equivalent representations ρ1 : π1(M) →E and ρ2 : π1(M) →
E we have det ∆q
M,ρ1 = det ∆q
M,ρ2 for every q ∈{0, . . . , dim M}.
Since det ∆q
RP2m,σ1 = det ∆q
RP2m and
∀λ ∈[0, +∞),
E(λ, ∆q
S2m) = E(λ, ∆q
RP2m,σ1) ⊕E(λ, ∆q

⇒det ∆q
RP2m,σ2 =

the result follows.
Note that our formulae for determinants generalize the previous formula on
even dimensional projective spaces, see [8], since that formula could only be
applied to ∆0
RP2m. For a similar formula in the odd dimensional case see [16].

Now, applying Lemma 3.3 of [22], we obtain:
T3(k) = −2m.
Hence T3(x) is a polynomial that satisﬁes T3(k) = −2m for every k ∈N,
and we conclude T3(x) is the constant polynomial T3(x) = −2m.
Therefore, substituting back 2x2k by
 (2−2t+2k+1 −1)ζR(2t −2k)
′ |t=0 we
obtain for T3 :
T3 = −m((2−2t+1 −1)ζR(2t))′|t=0 = −2m log 2 + m log(2π).

unitary representations of this group, with the same reasoning. Since even di-
mensional real projective spaces are non-orientable we use their odd-dimensional
versions to obtain the important data required to develop our study. Through-
out the section n will denote an arbitrary element of N\{1} and we will specialize
to the odd or even dimensional cases when necessary. Moreover, we will follow
the treatment and notation used by M¨uller on [15] whenever it is convenient and
in particular, given a vector space E of dimension r, we will use the notations
det E := Λr(E) and E−1 := E∗, with the convention that det{0} ≃R.
Let
C : 0 →Cn
∂n
→Cn−1
∂n−1
→. . .
∂2
→C1
∂1
→C0 →0
be a chain complex of ﬁnite dimensional real vector spaces and denote by
Zq(C) the kernel of ∂q, by Bq(C) the image of ∂q+1 and by Hq(C) the quo-
tient Zq(C)/Bq(C). We deﬁne the determinant line of the complex C, det C:
det(C) := ⊗n
q=0(det Cq)(−1)q,
and also the set
det H∗(C) := ⊗n
q=0(det Hq(C))(−1)q.
For each q ∈{1, . . . , n}, let bq := dim Bq−1(C) and choose elements θq ∈
Λbq(Cq) such that ∂qθq ̸= 0. By convention, with the intention of simplifying
expression 1.3 of [15], we also set θ0 := 1 =: ∂θn+1. For each q ∈{0, . . . , n}, let
hq := dim Hq(C) and choose elements 0 ̸= µq ∈det Hq(C) and νq ∈Λhq(ker ∂q)
such that π(νq) = µq, where π : Zq(V ) →Hq(V ) is the canonical projection.
Within this framework, ∂θq+1 ∧θq ∧i(νq) is a nonzero element of det Cq, and
by setting µ = ⊗n
q=0(µq)(−1)q+1, where µ−1
q
denotes the element of det Hq(C)−1
such that µ−1
q (µq) = 1, we may deﬁne the torsion T(C) of the complex C,
T(C) ∈(det C) ⊗(det H∗(C))−1, by the expression:
T(C) =
 n
O
q=0
(∂θq+1 ∧θq ∧i(νq))(−1)q
!
⊗µ,
which does not depend on the choices of θq, µq and νq. Note that, to simplify
the expression (1.3) of [15], we adopted the convention θ0 := ∂θn+1 := 1.
The choice of speciﬁc elements ω ∈det C and µ ∈det H∗(C) establishes an
isomorphism R ≃(det C)⊗(det H∗(C))−1 which sends λ ∈R into λω⊗µ−1. This
isomorphism allows us to consider T(C) as a real number, denoted by T(C, ω, µ),
and therefore, it allows us to deﬁne the Reidemeister torsion τ(C, ω, µ) of the
complex C in relation to the volumes ω and µ by:
τ(C, ω, µ) := |T(C, ω, µ)|.
In this text we will consider the case where the chain complex C is obtained
in the following way: we select the cell decomposition of RPn formed by one
cell of each dimension {e0, . . . , en} and we use this decomposition to induce a
cell decomposition for Sn, which is then formed by two cells of each dimension
{e0
1, e0
2, . . . , en
1, en
2}. We will consider RPn as being embedded in Sn as a fun-
damental domain, so that the q-cells of Sn are translates of the q-cell of RPn
under the action of the fundamental group π1 := π1(RPn). Note that under this
procedure the real chain groups Cq(Sn) generated by the q-cells of Sn become

without loss of generality that the embedding of RPn into Sn identiﬁes the cells

N−p
: π1(RPn) →GL(RN),
for σ1, σ2 as deﬁned on Corollary 3.3, we turn RN into an R(π1)-module, and
we become able to deﬁne the vector spaces:
Cq(RPn, ρ) := Cq(Sn) ⊗R(π1) RN,
q ∈{0, . . . , n}
To simplify notation, specially on the reasoning to be developed below,
we shall use (α, v) to represent the element α ⊗R(π1) v ∈Cq(RPn, ρ). Since
the boundary operator ˜∂q : Cq(Sn) →Cq−1(Sn) originate an operator ∂q,ρ :
Cq(RPn, ρ) →Cq−1(RPn, ρ), by sending (α, v) 7→(˜∂qα, v), our deﬁnition of
Cq(RPn, ρ) produces a natural chain complex
C•(RPn, ρ) : 0 →Cn(RPn, ρ)
∂n,ρ
→. . .
∂1,ρ
→C0(RPn, ρ) →0,
whose homology will be denoted by H•(RPn, ρ).
Let {u1, . . . , uN} denote the canonical base of RN. The embedding of RPn
into Sn and the cell decomposition ﬁxed previously induce natural preferred
bases ωq = {(eq
1, ui)}i∈NN for each vector space Cq(RPn, ρ).
We will also use {u1, . . . , uN} and the cell decomposition of RPn to construct
bases µq for the spaces Hq(RPn, ρ), but we need more concepts and reasoning
to accomplish that. Our intention is to use the same method presented on the
ﬁrst paragraph of [15, page 729] to construct these bases, i. e., we will ﬁrst ﬁx
orthonormal bases for the sets ker(∆q
RPn,ρ), q ∈{0, . . . , n}, then use de Rham
isomorphism and Poincar´e duality on these bases to obtain the desired bases for
Hq(RPn, ρ). Note that since Poincar´e duality does not hold for non-orientable
manifolds, on the speciﬁc part where we apply this duality we will have to
restrict our study to the cases where n = 2m −1, but the results obtained in
these cases will allow us to propose bases for Hq(RP2m, ρ) which will result in
obtaining the same value for Reidemeister torsion that we obtained for analytic
torsion on Theorem 4.2. It is important to mention that the Reidemeister torsion
depends on the speciﬁc choice of the bases µq, so a diﬀerent procedure to the
one used on this text could lead to a diﬀerent value of the torsion.
We start our construction observing that the elements of ker(∆q
RPn,ρ) cor-
respond via pullback by the covering projection π : Sn →RPn to the elements
of ker(∆q
Sn,N) which are equivariant in relation to ρ, where ∆q
Sn,N denotes the
Laplacian on C∞(ΛqSn ⊗RN).
On [11, page 183], by using spherical coordinates (θk)k∈{0,...,n} and repre-
senting the canonical metric of Sn by g, the authors describe orthonormal bases
for ker(∆q
Sn), which are given by:
a0 =
(
1

vol(Sn)
)
,
an =
(

REIDEMEISTER TORSION AND CHEEGER-M¨ULLER THEOREM

By taking the tensor product of the elements of a0 and an with the elements of
the canonical base of RN we obtain orthonormal bases ˜a0 and ˜an for ker(∆q
Sn,N):

, ˜an =

Using the canonical metric for RPn, a form

normalization, we obtain the following orthonormal bases for ker(∆q
RPn, ρ):

where the bar indicates we are using the projection of Sn onto RPn to descend
the forms

In the case n = 2m −1, we combine de Rham Isomorphism and Poincar´e
duality to form operators Aq, which when applied to the bases b2m−1

described
above give rise to bases for Hq(C(RP2m−1, ρ)). We have:

and the bases of H0(C(RP2m−1, ρ)) and H2m−1(C(RP2m−1, ρ)) are, respec-
tively:

h2m−1

(e2m−1

)
i∈Np
.
In the case n = 2m we do not have a systematic method for choosing bases
for H0(C(RP2m, ρ)) and H2m(C(RP2m, ρ)), so we use the odd dimensional case
to choose, respectively, the following bases:
h2m
0

vol(RP2m)(e0

,
h2m
2m =
(

)
i∈{p+1,...,N}
.
Now that we have bases for Cq(RPn, ρ) and Hq(C(RP2m, ρ)) we just need
to understand the behavior of the operators ∂q,ρ to calculate the Reidemeister
torsion of RP2m.

Based on this value we can establish the validity of Cheeger-M¨uller Theorem
for even dimensional real projective spaces, as stated in the next Theorem:
Theorem 5.1. Let m ∈N and let ρ be a representation of the fundamental
group of RP2m. The analytic torsion of the twisted de Rham complex Ta(RP2m, ρ)
and the Reidemeister torsion τR(RP2m, ρ) of RP2m in relation to ρ have the
same value.
Proof. By Theorem 4.1 of the present text and Theorem 2.3 of [19] we have:
Ta(RP2m) =
p
vol(RP2m)
2m
,
Ta(S2m) = 1
so, from Theorem 4.2 and (16) it follows that
Ta(RP2m, ρ) = τR(RP2m, ρ).

Acknowledgments
The research that led to this paper was developed while I was a Ph.D student
at Universidade Federal de S˜ao Carlos. I would like to thank Picme/Capes for
granting a scholarship that allowed me to dedicate exclusively to the course.
I would also like to thank L.R. Hartmann, the advisor of the course, and to
M.Spreaﬁco for technical support during the research. It is important to men-
tion that Hartmann and Spreaﬁco sent me a preliminar version of [8], with the
intention that I should follow their reasoning and calculate the analytic torsion
of RP2m while Hartmann was on Germany and Spreaﬁco was on Italy. Since
I did not understand their approach to the problem by the time and therefore
did not follow their reasoning, Hartmann decided that we should publish our
texts separately. I strongly appreciate that decision because I know he liked this
research project and he spontaneously proposed that I published it alone. Still
in relation to them, it is important to acknowledge that the data of Table 2, as
well as the data of the corresponding table for n = 2m −1 of [16] were present
at their preliminar version of [8].
I also want to thank the students of UFSCar, some of the professors and
specially my family for supporting me during the diﬃculties of the course.
