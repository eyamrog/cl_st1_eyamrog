This research article employs Bakhtinian dialogism and the concept of centripetal-centrifugal struggle within critical discourse studies to examine the competition between powerful and marginalised discourses in political language, used to justify paradigm shifts. The focus is on German chancellor Olaf Scholz's Zeitenwende ('watershed') speech following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where he introduced a radical armament program and foreign policy change, previously unprecedented in German politics. Through a qualitative analysis utilizing Appraisal Theory strategies Attitude and Engagement, the study reveals how Scholz aligns himself with specific powerful discourses while marginalising others, framing a narrative of existential threat for Germany, the proclaimed watershed, positioning his armament policies as the only viable option. This analysis showcases the effectiveness of examining dialogically contractive and expansive strategies in critical discourse studies.
Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prominent German politicians have consistently emphasized the transformative impact of the events, referring to them as a "Zeitenwende" (dawn of a new era), a "watershed," a "new era," and a "new reality." German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, in his policy statement on 27 February 2022, stated, "With his attack on Ukraine on Thursday, President Putin has created a new reality." Similarly, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, in her address at the United Nations, declared, "Russia's war marks the dawn of a new era. It's a watershed moment. Yesterday's certainties are gone. Today, we face a new reality that none of us chose. It is a reality that President Putin has forced upon us." Notably, the term "truce" was absent from these speeches. Instead of advocating for de-escalation and dialogue, Scholz unveiled an armament plan that would elevate Germany to the world's third-largest defense spender. While Germany has never fully embraced a pacifist stance, as some self-perception myths may suggest (DALGAARD-NIELSEN, 2005; RATHBUN, 2006), Scholz's decision represents a significant shift in German military culture.
The terms Zeitenwende, watershed, new reality, and new era all suggest a lack of agency, implying that the current circumstances are not a result of a shift in perspective but rather an inherent change that necessitates adaptation. In the context of the German discourse on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, these terms position "us" as passive observers who must respond to the sudden loss of previously held certainties. This construction of perspective seems to absolve the Self of any responsibility for the actions of the Other, a notion that is questioned from a Bakhtinian dialogic perspective where the observer's position is deemed crucial. Critical discourse studies aim to elucidate how dominant discourses reinforce themselves and how politicians leverage them to justify their actions as the only viable option. Bakhtin's dialogic perspective and the concepts of centripetal and centrifugal discourses serve as valuable analytical tools in comprehending the interplay of discourses in shaping reality to serve political agendas.
In this research article, an analysis is conducted on the policy statement delivered by the German federal chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in the German parliament on 27 February 2022. The study delves into the major discourses present in the speech and examines how Scholz strategically utilizes them to legitimize his policies. The analysis focuses on two key aspects. Firstly, an appraisal theoretic perspective (MARTIN & WHITE, 2005) is employed to scrutinize the attitude conveyed in the speech, including the emotional reactions and judgements expressed, as well as how the speaker aligns himself with specific discourses. Secondly, the study explores the speaker's engagement by examining the interplay of different discourses, viewed as a centripetal-centrifugal struggle through the lens of Bakhtinian dialogism, to elucidate how Scholz rationalizes his policy decisions. The article commences by outlining the genre of policy statements and elucidating its communicative functions.
A Regierungserklärung, commonly referred to as a 'policy statement', is typically delivered by a chancellor at the onset of their term as an inaugural address. However, according to German law, chancellors have the flexibility to present one at any point, typically followed by a debate (KORTE, 2002, p.452–453; STÜWE 2005, p.21). The term itself is a combination of Regierung ('government') and Erklärung, which encompasses both explanation and declaration. Consequently, it carries a dual meaning, serving as an elucidation of government policy by offering an interpretation and justification within a given context, as well as an official declaration and directive clarification of a specific situation (PÖRKSEN, 2003, p.40).
Policy statements serve as key tools of leadership for German chancellors, with their increasing prevalence reflecting the evolution of a mediatised democracy. These statements, being public presentations, garner significant media attention, effectively embodying government policy (KORTE, 2002, p.453). Functioning as both outwardly impactful and internally coordinative governmental instruments, policy statements draw from a variety of sources such as experts, surveys, contemporaries, and diverse voices, reflecting the personal style of the chancellor (KORTE, 2002, p.460–461). While existing research in German political discourse has primarily focused on inaugural policy statements delivered at the onset of a chancellor's term (BARNICKEL, 2020; BUSCH & KAUPERT, 2018; STÜWE, 2005), studies examining strategies of legitimisation are also regularly undertaken (REYES, 2011).
Policy statements serve both an immediate and historical function. In the immediate sense, they act as a distinct manifestation of the chancellor's "Richtlinienkompetenz" (policy-making power) (Stüwe, 2005, p.26–43), outlining guidelines and programs intended to govern the entire coalition government (Korte, 2002, p.456). From a historical perspective, policy statements are viewed as crucial documents that not only address specific issues but also provide valuable insights into the chancellor's historical significance through the problematization (or lack thereof) of certain topics and the language employed (Korte, 2002, p.457).
In Bakhtinian dialogism, speakers engage in a dialogical relationship with the "alien horizon of the understanding receiver" (Bakhtin, 1981, p.282), shaping their utterances against the listener's background, where the listener, whether real or imagined, influences the utterance from its inception (Morson & Emerson, 1990, p.129). Therefore, the discursive power manifested in policy statements necessitates analysis not only in terms of immediate function and addressees, who are aligned and whose potential reactions are anticipated, but also in terms of historical function, specifically how it communicates with future addressees who may assess the role of the speaking chancellor in the discursive construction of historical reality. To achieve this, a dialogic perspective proves to be particularly apt, as I will elaborate on in the subsequent section.
 they are always in conversation with other utterances, past or present. This dialogic nature of language implies that meaning is not fixed or determined by a single speaker but is constantly negotiated and shaped through interaction with others. Bakhtin also emphasizes the heteroglossia of language, highlighting the multiplicity of voices, languages, and discourses that are present in any utterance. This plurality of voices creates a dynamic and complex interplay of perspectives, leading to a rich and nuanced understanding of communication. Overall, Bakhtin’s concept of dialogism challenges traditional notions of authorship, authority, and meaning in language, offering a more inclusive and interactive view of communication.
According to Bakhtin (1981), the living utterance, which acquires meaning and form within a specific historical context and social environment, inevitably intersects with numerous dialogic threads woven by socio-ideological consciousness around the subject of the utterance. Consequently, it becomes an active participant in the ongoing social dialogue.
Utterances are influenced by both historical uses of specific discourses and anticipated future applications (Voloshinov, 1973 [1929], p.86). Todorov (1984) suggests that all discourse engages in a dialogue with preceding discourses on the same subject and those yet to emerge, foreseeing and preparing for their reactions. Morson and Emerson (1990) differentiate between the not-yet-spoken discourses, which involve anticipating responses, and the already-spoken discourses, which encompass past utterances on the topic. A discourse is defined as a "system of meaning—a set of propositions that cohere around a given object of meaning" (Baxter, 2011, p.2). Baxter (2011) further explains that discourses within an utterance compete when the meanings they propose contradict each other in some manner.
This comprehension of dialogue holds significant relevance for discourse studies. Appraisal Theory employs a dialogic approach to scrutinize how language positions the writer/speaker in relation to the value positions referenced in the text and in relation to the backdrop of alternative opinions, viewpoints, and value judgments against which all texts function (MARTIN & WHITE, 2005, p.94). A distinctive advantage of a Bakhtinian dialogic perspective lies in its ability to identify the nature of "bare assertions" or monoglossic discourse, which fails to explicitly acknowledge other voices, alternative viewpoints, or conflicting discourses (BAXTER, 2011, p.127; MARTIN & WHITE, 2005, p.99). Monoglossic discourse presents itself as a solid and indivisible entity, imbued with authority, assuming a taken-for-granted status that allows for complete acceptance or rejection.
Within the realm of heteroglossic expressions, the dialogic nature of an utterance varies based on the extent to which additional voices are either incorporated and contemplated or concealed (MORSON & EMERSON, 1990, p.146). Utterances can be characterized as either expansively dialogic or contractively dialogic. The former encourages the exploration of diverse perspectives and voices, while the latter inhibits dialogic space through the dismissal, avoidance, or limitation of alternative viewpoints (MARTIN & WHITE, 2005, p.102–103), a phenomenon termed discursive struggle.
In analyzing how power operates through discursive struggle, Baxter (2011) employs Bakhtin's concept of centripetal (centralizing) and centrifugal (decentralizing) forces (Bakhtin, 1981, p.270–272). Marginalized discourses tend to be overshadowed or silenced in comparison to what is centralized. The center is often legitimized as normative, typical, and natural, serving as a standard against which everything else is measured, holding a position of privilege and, consequently, power over the centrifugal (Baxter, 2011, p.123). I interpret power in a Foucauldian manner as something that requires explanation, not to be taken for granted as a societal condition (Pennycook, 2021). Power is thus situated within the systems of meaning - the discourses - that shape the social reality we perceive (Baxter, 2011, p.124), rather than being attributed to individuals or social groups. Centripetal discourses hold more power than centrifugal ones because their systems of meaning are presented as the social reality (Baxter, 2011, p.124). Through discourses, we wield power by utilizing language to construct reality rather than merely reflecting it, creating "domains of objects and rituals of truth" (Foucault, 1979, p.194). In Bakhtinian terms, "social life and historical becoming" generate within languages "a multitude of concrete worlds, a multitude of bounded verbal-ideological and social belief systems" (Bakhtin, 1981, p.288), leading to the notion that we are only exposed to conflicting interpretations of the truth (Pennycook, 2021, p.112). A Bakhtinian comprehension of languages as worldviews and discursive struggle implies that meaning-making always occurs within power dynamics and that there is no truth independent of power.
This comprehension represents a significant advantage compared to other discourse study methodologies. Many critical discourse approaches adopt an ideology perspective that posits an "ideal order distorted, disordered, or perverted by power operations" through corrupting ideologies. These approaches often assume that Critical Discourse Analysis can use discourse analytic tools to distinguish truth from falsehood (Pennycook, 2021, p.106). Structuralist or neo-Marxist frameworks, where ideology (falsehood) intertwines with power (stemming from dominant worldviews) while truth remains external to such power (as revealed by the analyst), can result in a condescending notion. This notion implies that individuals are ideological pawns, and the discerning analyst can unveil the blindfolds of ideological confusion (Pennycook, 2021, p.112).
In the present context, the EU's decision to ban Russian state-owned media, referred to by President Ursula von der Leyen as the "Kremlin's media machine," aims to halt the dissemination of "toxic and harmful disinformation" that seeks to justify Putin's war and sow division within the Union (VON DER LEYEN, 2022). There is a prevailing assumption that our media system is free and balanced, contrasting with the belief that the media of the Other is constrained by ideology and rife with propaganda. This familiarity with our own system often blinds us to the potential impacts of being inundated with one-sided, emotionally charged war propaganda, affecting our thinking, reasoning, and willingness to critically evaluate claims or policies, while also shaping our comfort level with dissenting views (GREENWALD, 2022). The notion of a "new reality" can only be conceived within an idealized (Western) order distorted by non-Western powers and corrupt ideologies. From a non-Western standpoint, the invasion of Ukraine does not represent a radical departure from an 'order' primarily existing in the minds of Western observers rather than in reality (BACEVICH, 2022). International law, as a concept, is not fixed but contingent on the willingness and ability of nations to enforce it, with the US's narrative dominance ensuring that international law is enforced only with its approval (C. JOHNSTONE, 2022). In the realm of discursive struggle, NATO discourse exerts hegemonic influence, shaping the military, political, and diplomatic landscape of international relations, with the US dictating the framework within which other countries, including potential rivals like Russia and China, must operate (COOK, 2022). This hegemony enables NATO to define terms like preventive war, humanitarian intervention, and collateral damage, framing its own actions as necessary reactions while often portraying the actions of others as escalations. To delve deeper into the ongoing conflict, a brief contextual overview will be provided.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine can be viewed as the tragic culmination of a crisis that has been unfolding since the Maidan protests in 2014, where democratic protest against electoral fraud was overtaken by far-right groups (ISHCHENKO, 2016). This situation became intertwined with geopolitical contestation, with US politicians rushing to Ukraine to express support for its NATO and Euro-Atlantic aspirations (SAKWA, 2016, p.52–53). The perspective that "Ukraine’s existence diminishes Russian power significantly" (BRZEZINSKI, 1996, p.4) has influenced US geopolitical strategy, underscoring the broader significance of the current conflict for European and global peace (GARDNER, 2016). The Paris Charter of 1990, following the Helsinki Final Act and marking the Cold War's end, aimed at lasting peace and unity in Europe but failed due to the signatory states' differing security cultures and traditions, as outlined in the Charter (MEYER, VON BREDOW & EVERS, 2015). The EU, led by Swedish and Polish foreign ministers Carl Bildt and Radek Sikorski, created the Eastern Partnership to include former Soviet states other than Russia, institutionalizing divisions rather than bridging them and contributing to Ukraine's separation from Russia, which heightened tensions with the EU perceived as a threat by Russia akin to NATO (SAKWA, 2016, p.39–41). While this article cannot fully capture all implications, a wealth of relevant literature exists (D. JOHNSTONE, 2022; PETRO, 2017; POCH-DE-FELIU, 2003, p.357–374).
The expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe, cited as a key factor in the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Klare, 2022), has incited anger in Russia and is viewed as a breach of promises by Western leaders, as evidenced in documented sources (Poch-de-Feliu, 2022; Sarotte, 2021; Savranskaya & Blanton, 2016). Drawing from their analysis of declassified documents from the US, Soviet Union, Germany, Britain, and France, Savranskaya and Blanton assert that...
The documents reveal that several national leaders were deliberating on and dismissing the idea of Central and Eastern European inclusion in NATO from early 1990 through 1991. Moreover, discussions surrounding NATO during the German unification negotiations in 1990 were not solely focused on the status of East German territory. It is evident from contemporaneous written memoranda and telephone conversations at the highest echelons that subsequent Soviet and Russian grievances regarding being misled about NATO expansion were well-founded (Savranskaya & Blanton, 2017).
The debate surrounding NATO expansion revolves around differing perspectives: whether it is viewed as a strategic move to prevent a Eurasian alliance, a response to the pleas of new Central and Eastern European democracies disrupting East-West cooperation, or a critical mistake in the post-Cold War era. Each viewpoint is subjective, emphasizing the absence of an "objective position." Drawing from Bakhtinian dialogism, it is argued that engaging not just in discourse but with discourse itself is essential, incorporating evaluation and response within dialogical understanding. In the dynamic realm of politics, analysts not only observe but also influence political processes, highlighting the inseparable link between decision-making and standpoint. Individual perspectives, often labeled as researcher bias, inevitably influence any form of analysis. Keeping this in mind, the subsequent section will outline the methodology employed in this study.
The passage under scrutiny is the Regierungserklärung (‘policy statement’) delivered by Olaf Scholz on 27 February 2022, just three days subsequent to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sourced from the German government’s website (SCHOLZ, 2022), this text not only presents the original German version but also offers translations into English and Russian, suggesting additional target audiences. The translations utilized in this study are a combination of official versions and my own interpretations.
The analysis comprises two distinct steps. Initially, I engage in a thematic analysis to discern discourses that have been articulated and those that remain implicit within the speech. These discourses may manifest overtly or remain latent; the former are explicitly stated, while the latter represent underlying presuppositions and assumptions that are tacitly accepted (BAXTER, 2011, p.158–159). To identify latent discourses, one must consider what contextual knowledge a listener requires to comprehend a given textual segment and which sociocultural and interpersonal discourses must be invoked to grasp its significance (BAXTER, 2011, p.159). Leveraging the resources of Attitude within Appraisal Theory (MARTIN & WHITE, 2005, p.42) proves valuable, as they illuminate what is perceived as conventional or normative: "Judgements articulated in discourse are underpinned by an often unspoken system of meaning" (BAXTER, 2011, p.160). Both articulated and unspoken discourses can be categorized as proximal or distal: the former originate from directly involved parties, while the latter stem from broader cultural contexts, articulated by individuals outside the immediate relationship (BAXTER, 2011, p.53).
Attitude encompasses affect, which pertains to the emotive dimension of meaning and reactions to behavior; judgement, which involves the ethical or moral dimension of meaning and the evaluation of behavior based on certain norms; and appreciation, which relates to the aesthetic dimension of meaning and the assessment of a text, process, or phenomenon (Martin & White, 2005, p.42–44). These manifestations of attitude can be viewed as "institutionalized feelings that transport us from our everyday common sense world to the uncommon sense realms of shared community values" (Martin & White, 2005, p.45). Judgement, whether implicitly or explicitly, calls upon certain rules or regulations and "transforms feelings into proposals regarding behavior," while appreciation involves the evaluation of "semiotic and natural phenomena" and "transforms feelings into propositions about the value of things" (Martin & White, 2005, p.45). It is important to note that appreciation and judgement are not entirely distinct but rather intersect, with affect contributing a more personal evaluation within both domains (refer to the diagram in Martin & White, 2005, p.45).
The second step involves analyzing how the identified discourses are brought into competition, distinguishing between centred and marginalised discourses. To achieve this, I will utilize resources of engagement, which serve to establish a heteroglossic backdrop of prior utterances, alternative viewpoints, and anticipated responses (Martin & White, 2005, p.97). These resources can be categorized as dialogically expansive or contractive, as elaborated in Section 3. Dialogically contractive resources of engagement include disclaim (deny, counter) and proclaim (concur, pronounce, endorse), while dialogically expansive resources encompass entertain and attribute (acknowledge, distance) (Martin & White, 2005, p.134). For a more comprehensive understanding of these resources, refer to Martin & White (2005, p.97–98).
The speech comprises seven parts: an introduction, followed by the five "courses of action" proposed by Scholz, and a concluding segment. In the original text, Scholz mentions "Fünf Handlungsaufträge liegen nun vor uns," which translates to 'five mandates of action now lie ahead of us,' implying a sense of passivity and the imposition of these mandates by an external entity, possibly a higher force like moral obligation or time. This passivity is evident as Scholz refers to a challenge "vor die die Zeit uns gestellt hat" ('that time has brought us up against'). However, this passive reactivity is absent in the official translation, which states "there are five courses of action that we must take" and "the challenge that now faces us," where time is no longer portrayed as an active agent.
Scholz initiates his speech by asserting that the Russian invasion of Ukraine signifies a "Zeitenwende" in European history, officially translated as 'watershed'. This will be referred to as the watershed discourse. Positioned at the level of the proximal not-yet-spoken, it serves as the Scholz government's rationale for justifying a spectrum of potentially contentious policies, premised on the notion that a new era necessitates novel responses. The discourse is intricately linked to Russia's actions, as evidenced by Scholz's examination of the purported turning point (example 1), introduced with the emphatic declaration "im Kern geht es um" to underscore Scholz's grasp of the fundamental essence of the situation.
Essentially, the crux of the matter lies in the inquiry of whether authority is permitted to violate legal statutes, if we are willing to permit Putin to regress to an era reminiscent of the dominant powers of the 19th century, or if we are capable of mustering the strength to restrain belligerents such as Putin.
The analysis presented in this study shifts the focus from the involvement of modern great powers in the Ukraine war to framing it as a historically revisionist attack. This perspective also suggests that power does not typically violate international law, a notion that seems peculiar given recent NATO operations worldwide and the conflict in Yugoslavia in Europe (GRAY, 2018; D. JOHNSTONE, 2022). While Scholz strongly asserts that the invasion of Ukraine signifies the beginning of a new era, the subsequent political discourse on armament appears to be aimed at preventing such a shift and maintaining the current order. This raises questions about the nature of this purported new era. Is Scholz's reference to "warmongers like Putin" an indication of an expectation of similar actors emerging? If the objective is to uphold the existing security and legal framework in Europe and avoid a return to military aggression and conflict, why do Scholz and other German policymakers fervently advocate for a new era of defense spending?
Scholz expresses moral indignation regarding the violation of international law, drawing an analogy to the Second World War and incorporating a personal perspective. This approach is endorsed by speechwriters, as it establishes credibility by beginning with one's personal attitudes, feelings, and values (PÖRKSEN, 2003, p.35). The discourse of moral outrage is subtly present, manifested through various judgments sanctioned by society, such as describing the act as "starting a war of aggression in cold blood," being "inhumane," or highlighting "Putin's complete ruthlessness." Personal engagement is conveyed through emotional realizations like "the horrible images," "appalling injustice," and "terrible news." The personal viewpoint is also evident in the emotional treatment of another discourse, that of international law, as seen in phrases like "malicious breach of international law," implying that some breaches may be considered benevolent. Additionally, the characterization of the Russian veto, a right held as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, as an "emergency brake" and the exclamation "What a disgrace!" further emphasize the emotional perspective on the matter.
There is a discourse surrounding personal war experiences, evident in the reference to "Erzählungen unserer Eltern und Großeltern […] vom Krieg" ('tales of war from our parents and grandparents'), which evokes World War 2 memories and shapes a narrative of something unprecedented in Europe since that time, drawing on emotional realizations such as "Entsetzen" ('horror') and the notion that "für die Jüngeren ist es kaum fassbar: Krieg in Europa" ('for younger individuals, it is almost incomprehensible: war in Europe'). This theme is reiterated when Scholz asserts that Putin is dismantling the European security order that had been in place for nearly half a century following the Helsinki Final Act. Despite the war in Ukraine marking the first land, air, and sea invasion since World War 2, the suggestion that Europe has not witnessed war or significant border alterations since then is deceptive, as it overlooks NATO's and Germany's contentious involvement in the Yugoslav conflicts.
The fifth discourse identified is the discourse of indivisible security (example 2), which is evident through the use of indirect reported speech ("redet von"). This briefly introduces the security assurances that Russia has requested based on the norm of indivisible security established by OSCE countries in the Helsinki Final Act and reiterated in the Paris Charter. While Scholz does not explicitly mention these treaties, he portrays Putin's demand in a vague, ambiguous, and personalized manner through the phrase "reden von," thereby not only rhetorically undermining its validity but also positioning the discourse at a level closer to the present rather than the past. This represents a dialogic expansion through distancing, followed by the juxtaposition of countering and the declaration "Tatsächlich aber," implying that Putin is being dishonest and that Scholz is aware of the true intentions behind the demand.
President Putin frequently references the concept of indivisible security, yet his current actions suggest a desire to fragment the continent into traditional spheres of influence using military aggression.
Dialogic contraction through pronouncement is employed to assert that Putin initiated the war "aus einem einzigen Grund" ('for a single reason'), thereby undermining the notion of indivisible security discourse in favor of a discourse portraying Putin's actions as a deliberate attack on the free world. This narrative characterizes the invasion as an unprovoked assault by a potentially unstable individual actor who seeks to "ein unabhängiges Land von der Weltkarte tilgen" ('erase an independent country from the map').
The discourse is further exemplified in example (3), where Scholz preempts a potential argument referencing the OSCE accords. In order to negate Eurasian partnership arguments, he intertwines the discourse on indivisible security with that of watershed by employing a contrasting construction: while he concedes that sustained peace in Europe hinges on Russia, he rebuts this by asserting that Russia currently poses a threat to such security, substantiated by a declaration in the final sentence.
Yes, in the long term, security in Europe cannot be attained through opposition to Russia. However, in the foreseeable future, Putin's actions are posing a threat to this security. It is imperative to clearly acknowledge this reality.
The initial course of action announced by Scholz revolves around providing support to Ukraine, a significant shift that now includes the delivery of arms to a conflict zone, a practice previously considered taboo in Germany. This move can be interpreted as part of Germany's emerging military power narrative at a level that is implied but not explicitly stated. Scholz strategically adopts the discourse of a pivotal moment ("in einer neuen Zeit", 'in a new era'), which frames a "neue Realität" ('new reality') to justify the necessity of the policy change regarding arms delivery to conflict zones. Any potential dissent is preemptively countered by presenting this decision as the only viable option, as indicated by the assertive denial "konnte es keine andere Antwort geben" ('there could be no other response').
The discourse of Putin's war resurfaces in this context, as Scholz aims to differentiate between the will of the Russian people, presumed to align with the Western free-world perspective, and that of its president, thereby isolating him. At a more implicit level, the discourse seeks to oversimplify the conflict by framing it within a binary framework of good versus evil, preempting potentially conflicting perspectives that historically justify Russia's actions. This discourse remains latent through a blend of emotional appeal ("verzweifelten Lage", 'desperate situation') and evaluative language, with Scholz asserting that Ukrainians are not only defending their homeland but also fighting for "Freiheit und ihre Demokratie, für Werte, die wir mit ihnen teilen" ('freedom and democracy, for values that we share with them'), positioning them as champions of democracy and European ideals. By standing in solidarity with them, "we" are positioned "auf der richtigen Seite der Geschichte" ('on the right side of history'), a phrase that evokes personal wartime experiences and Germany's historical position on the wrong side of history. The shift in arms delivery policy is thus portrayed as morally justified and historically imperative, contrasting it with the malevolence of "Putins Aggression" ('Putin's aggression').
Scholz's second course of action involves attempting to divert Putin from his path of war. In this strategy, Scholz outlines the sanctions against Russia and, employing a contrasting approach, acknowledges that Putin is unlikely to change his course immediately. However, he argues that the impact of these sanctions will be evident in the near future, emphasizing this point with the statement "ohne irgendwelche Denkverbote" ('no thought whatsoever is prohibited'). The discourse on Putin's war is reiterated through the emphatic declaration "gehört es deutlich ausgesprochen: Dieser Krieg ist Putins Krieg" ('it must be clearly stated that this war is Putin's war!'). Additionally, the characterization of the conflict as a "Konflikt zwischen Putin und der freien Welt" ('conflict between Putin and the free world') sets up a morally charged dichotomy reminiscent of the "with us or against us" rhetoric employed by George W. Bush post-9/11.
Scholz establishes a link between the distinction of Putin from the Russian populace by examining the discourse of German reconciliation, evident in the distal already-spoken level and exemplified in example 4. This connection between the discourses serves to morally justify the personal criticism directed at Putin, suggesting a historical obligation to guide Russia towards integration into the democratic world.
This distinction holds significance for me as the reconciliation between Germans and Russians following the Second World War stands as a crucial chapter in our shared history.
In this study, a latent regime change in Russia discourse is identified, operating at a level of the unspoken yet proximal. This shift is evident in the observations of protests against “Putin’s war” in various Russian cities, showcasing “great courage and true bravery”, and the solidarity expressed towards those in Russia who bravely challenge Putin’s regime and reject his actions in Ukraine. Notably, Scholz’s speech exhibits a preference for dialogic contraction, contrasting with the dialogically expansive strategies employed in this discourse, emphasizing the importance of not forgetting the protests and expressing confidence that freedom, tolerance, and human rights will eventually prevail in Russia. While this language introduces the possibility of protests and the promotion of fundamental rights, it also leaves room for arguments suggesting that the Russian populace supports Putin and that these values are not currently widespread in Russia, a claim that is both strong and unsubstantiated, reminiscent of past Western justifications for military interventions.
In the third section, Scholz highlights a significant challenge in preventing Putin's war from spreading to other European countries. The discourse of NATO alliance is evident at the proximal level, manifested through references to discussions with allied countries in Eastern Europe and through contractive pronouncements emphasizing the collective defense obligation within NATO. The resolve to stand "unconditionally" by this obligation and the commitment to defend every square meter of NATO territory are underscored with statements like "We are absolutely serious about this." This discourse is intertwined with the perception of Germany as a military power, subtly conveyed through a list of recent actions undertaken by the German army, described as "important" signals. Soldiers are acknowledged for their crucial services, with a statement that aligns the audience with the speaker's position, saying, "surely also in your name."
In introducing the fourth course of action, Scholz once more directs his address to the audience and further links the discourse on Germany as a military power to the discourse on watershed, albeit now in a latent manner, as evidenced by the utterance in example (5). In doing so, he explicitly characterizes the newly announced military policy as both essential and "standard."
Given the watershed moment that Putin's aggression represents, our commitment is clear: we will take all necessary actions to ensure peace in Europe.
This section of the speech is the most extensive, where Scholz establishes a connection between the previously introduced watershed and Putin's war discourses, asserting that Putin "wants to build a Russian empire." This assertion is underpinned by a strategy of acknowledgment through negative appraisal of Putin's voice, evident in his "historicising essays," televised declaration of war, and personal conversations Scholz has had with him. This voice is then encapsulated in the dialogically restrictive statement "can no longer have any doubt," allowing for only one possible conclusion, the one drawn by Scholz. The validity of his conclusion is further supported by the dialogically restrictive affirmation "We can see that today in Ukraine," and his assertion that "he has no qualms about using military force."
Scholz constructs a discourse of national security threat that is both proximal and latent, particularly evident in his portrayal of the war in Ukraine as an act of aggression aimed at potentially expanding an empire that could include Germany. This construction of threat is primarily achieved through the use of a rhetorical question regarding Russia's capabilities and the measures needed to counter this perceived threat, hinting at a prolonged conflict with Russia that might necessitate Germany acquiring nuclear weapons. Scholz leaves the rhetorical question unanswered, employing the assertive phrase "Klar ist" ('it is clear') to emphasize the imperative for Germany to significantly enhance its security measures to safeguard "our freedom and our democracy." Furthermore, the discourse on national security threat is reinforced by the suggestion that Germany, given its size and importance in Europe, should be capable of maintaining a robust military force, thereby underscoring the notion of Germany as a military power within the region.
There exists a latent discourse within the EU regarding internal discipline, operating at a level that is not yet explicitly articulated but is discernible in the emphasis on maintaining "Geschlossenheit" (translated as 'unity', though the term 'united front' is used in official translations) as an opportunity. This discourse is further evident in the dialogically restrictive assertion that unity entails member states not merely focusing on what they can gain for their own countries in Brussels, but rather on determining the best course of action for "our" Union as a whole. This discourse is intricately linked to a pivotal narrative shift ("die Zeitenwende […] trifft ganz Europa", meaning 'the watershed affects all of Europe'), indicating that the new reality being constructed discursively by German politicians is envisioned to have implications for the entirety of Europe.
Scholz's final point emphasizes that "Putin's war" signifies a significant shift in German foreign policy, akin to a "Zäsur" or caesura, invoking a watershed moment. While he is somewhat ambiguous about the future direction of foreign policy, he does assert that "we will not refuse talks with Russia," suggesting a willingness to engage in dialogue but not actively seek it. His statement, "Anything else, I believe, would be irresponsible," entertains the possibility of voices advocating for a diplomatic break with Russia, while disregarding those in favor of pursuing talks. Scholz aims to avoid naivety, defining it as "no talking for the sake of talking," and asserts that Putin has never shown interest in dialogue. This viewpoint places all blame and responsibility on Putin, indicating Scholz's lack of confidence in the efficacy of dialogue. Consequently, the anticipated shift in German foreign policy appears to point towards a prolonged conflict with Russia.
True dialogue necessitates a mutual willingness to engage, a quality conspicuously absent on Putin's side, particularly evident in the recent days and weeks.
Scholz's recent statements on foreign policy suggest a departure from Merkel's pragmatic approach, characterized by a strong commitment to the Minsk negotiations, the Normandy Format, and frequent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin to uphold dialogue with Russia (RÁCZ, 2022, p.3). The incoming coalition government is anticipated to adopt a more assertive stance in alignment with US preferences, viewing Merkel's approach as "naive" and drawing parallels to the appeasement policies of 1938 (RIPSMAN & LEVY, 2008; LATHAM, 2021).
In the concluding section, there is a discussion on German unity, which is implicit and already articulated at a distant level, intertwined with the discourse of perceived threats to national security, as evident in the statement "das große Glück, das unser Land seit über dreißig Jahren genießt" ('the great fortune our country has enjoyed for over thirty years') and the contemplation of a potential future where the thirty years of German unity could be viewed as a "historical anomaly". To prevent this scenario, Scholz emphasizes the necessity, stating, "müssen wir alles tun für den Zusammenhalt der Europäischen Union, für die Stärke der NATO, für noch engere Beziehungen zu unseren Freunden, Partnern und Gleichgesinnten weltweit" ('we must do everything we can to maintain the cohesion of the European Union, the strength of NATO, to forge even closer relations with our friends, our partners and all those who share our convictions worldwide'). This further reinforces the discourse that a robust NATO is indispensable for German national security, while simultaneously marginalizing critical perspectives on NATO.
The latent discourse of free democracy is evoked through the phrase "wir wissen um die Stärke freier Demokratien," creating a sense of unity among individuals. This discourse is linked to Putin's war narrative, as the attack on Ukraine is portrayed as an assault on the peaceful order in Europe and globally, further emphasized by the repeated reference to "Putin's war." The declaration "wir werden es verteidigen" ('we will defend it') in the concluding sentence reinforces the discourse of Germany as a military power.
In this section, the speech has been thematically analysed, with a focus on identifying both manifest and latent discourses. Various appraisal strategies have been employed to demonstrate how Scholz either expands or contracts dialogue surrounding these discourses through engagement, as well as how he connects them to position himself and rationalize his future policies. The subsequent section will offer an overview and interpretation of the interplay of these discourses from a dialogic standpoint, specifically examining centripetal and centrifugal discourses.
The primary centripetal discourses revolve around the watershed and Putin's war discourses, distinguished by their high frequency of occurrence and the resources of engagement employed. The watershed discourse establishes a new reality necessitating a complete paradigm shift due to the invasion of Ukraine, discussed three days after its commencement. This invasion is portrayed as an unprecedented act of aggression in Europe since World War 2, perpetrated by a solitary and merciless oppressor aiming to eradicate Ukraine and establish a Russian empire, a perspective succinctly termed the Putin's war discourse.
Scholz argues for a necessary paradigm shift in military spending to elevate Germany to a position of military power commensurate with its significance in Europe, advocating for a budget that would rank Germany third globally in defense expenditure, trailing only the US and China. This discourse on Germany as a military force is characterized by a centripetal approach, employing naturalization techniques to emphasize the inevitability of increased defense spending and the imperative for NATO to remain robust in safeguarding German freedom and democracy. By invoking fears of a potential future threat, Scholz seeks to legitimize his call for heightened military investment. Given Germany's influential role in the EU, Scholz not only perceives this as a threat to Germany alone but anticipates that the entire European continent should align with his proposed paradigm shift.
The shift is framed as a necessity rather than a choice to safeguard Germany from potential Russian aggression, both presently and in the future. Despite anticipating a prolonged conflict with Russia and a significant shift in diplomatic stance, the Ukraine conflict is portrayed as "Putin's war," an act of aggression by an isolated individual lacking public support within his own country. Rather than being viewed as a substantial military threat, it appears that Scholz perceives Putin's challenge to the NATO world order as the catalyst for a new era, underscored by an emerging discourse on regime change. Scholz's assessment of Putin's standpoint relies solely on the argument of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with no additional justifications deemed necessary as Scholz articulates from a perspective of NATO dominance. Scholz seizes upon the invasion of Ukraine, devoid of its broader context and historical background, as validation for making bold assertions regarding Putin's intentions and aspirations, devoid of substantial political or historical analysis. Any potential counterarguments suggesting that Putin had pursued dialogue for an extended period are summarily dismissed through denial. Instead, employing techniques of neutralization (Baxter, 2011, p.171; Deetz, 1992), the conflict is elevated to a moral dichotomy of good versus evil, portraying it as a struggle between the free world and oppression.
The historically documented Russian position, as detailed in Section 4, is characterized by the indivisible security discourse, which exerts a centrifugal force. This marginalization, as I have posited earlier, bolsters Putin's war discourse by portraying the concept of indivisible security as a mere fabrication entertained solely by Putin. This perspective is reinforced by the pervasive watershed discourse, which posits that Putin will remain a security threat in the foreseeable future, thereby discrediting potential competing discourses advocating for indivisible security and diplomatic solutions. When engaging with alternative viewpoints, Putin tends to adopt a more rigid stance, such as those advocating for a complete break in dialogue with Russia or asserting that freedom, tolerance, and human rights are largely absent in the country.
In conclusion, this article highlights the efficacy of Bakhtinian dialogism in discourse analysis, particularly in its application through the operationalization of the centripetal-centrifugal struggle concept. It illustrates how dominant, centralized discourses are utilized in political rhetoric to marginalize alternative discourses and rationalize a radical shift in foreign policies and military expenditures. This approach proves particularly valuable in global examinations where certain discourses and ideologies, predominantly of Western descent, are often unquestioningly accepted.
