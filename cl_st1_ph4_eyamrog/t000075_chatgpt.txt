Over the past three decades, mainstream studies on capital accounts have undergone significant transformations. Initially rooted in theoretical models advocating full capital account liberalization, the financial crises that struck emerging markets in the 1990s and the global financial crisis of 2008 exposed various flaws in financial globalization. Subsequent to the global crisis, new empirical evidence emerged regarding the efficacy of regulatory measures. In light of mounting evidence contradicting earlier ex ante models, numerous mainstream authors have developed fresh frameworks supporting the implementation of capital controls. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to scrutinize the recent developments in mainstream economics concerning capital account liberalization and capital controls, with a specific focus on emerging evidence and theoretical realignments. It posits that the latest mainstream models signify a novel phase in its approach to regulating international capital flows.
Authors within the Keynesian/Structuralist tradition in economics have long highlighted the inherent instability of capital flows, a concern that traces back to Keynes' seminal works on the subject. A specific focus within this tradition revolves around the concept of 'currency hierarchy', which underscores the ability of select currencies to dictate debt contracts and derivative instruments in international markets. This hierarchy suggests that a significant portion of capital flows towards economies with inconvertible currencies may be influenced by international investors' liquidity preferences. Consequently, the interest rates in these peripheral economies could face pressures stemming from their exchange rates, leading to a loss of monetary policy independence and challenging the 'impossible trinity' condition. This vulnerability is particularly pronounced in economies with structurally deficient current accounts. In light of these challenges, proponents of the Keynesian/Structuralist perspective advocate for the use of capital controls and macroprudential policies as tools for peripheral economies to address the asymmetries inherent in the contemporary International Monetary and Financial System (IMFS). By implementing such measures, these economies may mitigate the adverse effects associated with the inconvertibility of their currencies.
On the other hand, it is widely acknowledged that mainstream economics did not embrace this interpretation in the 1970s and 1980s, a period when the perceived advantages of free capital mobility were emphasized. However, the mainstream perspective on financial openness and capital controls has undergone significant changes over the past two-and-a-half decades for various reasons. The orthodox assumptions that underpinned financial openness in the 1980s and 1990s were challenged by the crises that affected emerging economies in the late 1990s. Furthermore, the global financial crisis of 2008 marked a crucial turning point in mainstream research, which was further influenced by the adoption of capital controls by numerous emerging nations in the post-crisis era. Consequently, recent mainstream literature is characterized by: i) new recommendations regarding regulatory measures on capital flows; ii) empirical studies examining the efficacy of capital controls and macroprudential policies; and iii) novel orthodox models supporting the use of capital controls. Unlike two decades ago, when mainstream economics advocated unrestricted capital movement, contemporary empirical research and theoretical frameworks suggest that countries, particularly emerging economies, can utilize capital controls to safeguard financial stability, maintain monetary policy independence, and potentially enhance economic growth rates.
This paper examines the recent developments in mainstream economics regarding capital account liberalization and capital controls, with a specific focus on new evidence and theoretical shifts, particularly in the post-global crisis era. To achieve this, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, encompassing esteemed publications on financial openness and capital controls from reputable journals, as well as working papers from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), among others. The analysis suggests that contemporary mainstream models mark a distinct phase in their theoretical stance towards regulating capital flows. Presently, capital controls are more widely accepted within mainstream economics, viewed as crucial tools at the disposal of central banks. While this signifies a new phase, it falls short of being a definitive turning point, as significant constraints persist in the consistent application of these regulatory measures. These limitations stem largely from the enduring disparities between mainstream economics and the Keynesian perspective on the current International Monetary and Financial System.
Following this introduction and conclusion, the article is structured as follows. Section 2 offers a concise overview of key mainstream studies that challenge the conventional assumptions underpinning the capital account liberalization processes in emerging economies during the 1990s. Section 3 delves into mainstream studies that provide empirical support for new recommendations regarding capital controls and macroprudential policies. Section 4 critically examines the efficacy of capital controls and macroprudential policies as discussed in recent literature. Moving forward, section 5 outlines the principal orthodox models that underpin the utilization of capital controls and subsequently synthesizes the key findings from selected papers on the effectiveness of capital controls and prudential policies. This section also traces the evolution of mainstream economics concerning financial openness and capital controls, spanning from the era of liberalizing reforms to the post-global financial crisis period.
The shift towards prioritizing capital controls within the mainstream did not happen abruptly but rather evolved over time. Approximately two decades ago, mainstream discourse predominantly supported complete financial openness. However, the current research identifies a transformation in mainstream perspectives, particularly following the currency and financial crises experienced by numerous emerging economies in the late 1990s. These crises served as a pivotal moment prompting a reevaluation of capital account liberalization within mainstream economic studies. The subsequent financial turmoil that plagued emerging economies during the late 1990s and early 2000s spurred a surge in empirical research challenging conventional beliefs regarding the advantages of financial openness, particularly in relation to emerging economies. The prevailing literature highlights key findings that contradict orthodox views on the purported benefits of financial openness, particularly for emerging economies.
Several studies, including those by Prasad et al. (2003), Kose et al. (2009), and Rodrik and Subramanian (2009), have found no significant correlation between financial openness and increased rates of economic growth.
Advanced economies exhibit a more robust risk-sharing mechanism compared to emerging countries, primarily attributed to a greater level of financial integration and interconnectedness among advanced economies, as highlighted by Kose et al. (2009), Bluedorn et al. (2013), and Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007). Consequently, consumption volatility did not consistently decrease for emerging countries; in fact, this metric even showed an increase during certain periods, as noted by Prasad et al. (2003) and Levy-Yeyarti and Calderón (2009).
International capital flows exhibit a pro-cyclical nature and are significantly impacted by the monetary policies and economic conditions of advanced countries, as demonstrated by Arora and Cerisola (2000), Calvo and Reinhart (2002), and Kaminsky et al. (2004).
Institutional investors' behavior significantly constrains the ability of emerging economies to issue external liabilities, consequently limiting their capacity to absorb foreign savings. This phenomenon has been highlighted by scholars such as Eichengreen et al. (2003), Reinhart et al. (2003), and Eichengreen et al. (2007).
As a result of the aforementioned findings, emerging economies experience disruptions and reversals in their access to international financial markets, leading to adverse effects on their economic activity. This phenomenon has been observed by scholars such as Rodrik and Velásco (1999), Calvo et al. (2004), and Edwards (2007). Furthermore, these processes contribute to a reduction in monetary policy autonomy for emerging economies, thereby challenging the concept of the impossible trinity.
Despite the mounting evidence, the mainstream did not advocate for the implementation of capital controls as an external insertion alternative for emerging economies. The authors of the study grounded their recommendations on the threshold approach, positing that the advantages of capital account liberalization might only materialize after a certain period in emerging economies. Essentially, the benefits of financial openness are believed to become effective only when financial integration reaches a specific threshold in relation to GDP.
The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 prompted a shift in mainstream perspectives towards capital account liberalization. In contrast to the previous threshold approach to financial openness prevalent between the crises in emerging economies and the global crisis, current mainstream studies advocate for capital controls in their recommendations. It is important to note two key caveats before delving further into this discussion. Firstly, capital controls and (macro) prudential policies on capital outflows are designed to limit the outflow of domestic resources rather than impeding the repatriation of invested resources from non-domestic entities. For instance, in the 1990s and 2000s, numerous emerging economies relaxed restrictions on domestic capital outflows, allowing for increased cross-border operations by domestic residents such as banking institutions, non-banking financial institutions, non-financial companies, and individuals. Secondly, mainstream literature has started to adopt a typology similar to that proposed by authors like Ostry et al. (2010; 2011) and Ghosh et al. (2014), which categorizes capital controls as regulatory measures based on the investor's residency. An example of this would be the implementation of an IOF tax on capital inflows from foreign investors, considered a capital control under this classification. On the other hand, macroprudential policies do not discriminate based on residency but rather on the currency denomination of cross-border financial transactions. For instance, tightening restrictions on banking institutions' open positions in foreign currencies would be classified as a macroprudential policy falling under 'foreign exchange related measures'.
The term 'Capital Flows Management Measures (CFMs)' encompasses both capital controls and macroprudential policies. This distinction is crucial in understanding the effectiveness of CFMs imposed by developed countries compared to emerging economies, a topic explored in Subsection 4.3. Developed countries primarily focus on macroprudential policies within their CFMs, as they have moved away from strict capital controls that discriminate based on investors' residency since the liberalizing reforms of the 1970s and 1980s. On the other hand, emerging economies typically utilize a combination of capital controls and macroprudential policies in their CFMs. With these distinctions in mind, the subsequent section will delve into key studies offering fresh insights and recommendations on this complex subject.
In their 2014 study, Ghosh et al. examined the primary determinants and magnitudes of net financial flux surges, introducing a distinction between surges driven by foreign investors and those influenced by domestic investor behavior, categorizing them as liability-driven and asset-driven surges, respectively. Their analysis revealed that external factors exhibited a greater explanatory power compared to domestic factors in predicting the occurrence of surges, contributing to the synchronization of this phenomenon across emerging markets. The liability-driven surges, which were more prevalent in terms of probability, were found to be particularly sensitive to changes in external factors, contagion effects, and the level of financial interconnectedness. Based on these findings, Ghosh et al. advocate for the implementation of capital controls to mitigate excessive volatility in this surge category, as well as the necessity of coordinated policies between emerging economies receiving these financial inflows and the advanced countries serving as the source of such capital outflows.
The traditional economic policy mix has experienced significant changes in recent years. In response to the substantial capital inflows observed in emerging economies following the global financial crisis, De Gregorio (2014) advocates for the implementation of an economic framework centered on: i) a flexible exchange rate to deter one-sided speculations and arbitrages, ii) an inflation targeting system, and iii) a sustainable fiscal equilibrium. Nevertheless, the author acknowledges that these strategies may prove inadequate in addressing an overflow of financial flows, necessitating the imposition of capital controls. However, the implementation of regulatory measures should be complemented by the adoption of sustainable macroeconomic policies, as recommended by the author.
In light of recent capital flow volatility, numerous economists have turned their attention to examining the assumptions and theories supporting the free movement of capital. A significant example of this is the challenge to the validity of the macroeconomic trilemma (or impossible trinity) for emerging economies, as demonstrated in Rey's work (2015). Through econometric regressions, Rey concludes that the cross-border financial flows facilitated by banking institutions (financial credits) lead to deviations in interest rates uncovered parity in emerging economies, irrespective of their exchange rate regime or macroeconomic fundamentals. These findings suggest that the only way to enhance an emerging economy's monetary policy autonomy is through the implementation of capital controls, specifically targeting financial credit and debt bond flows. Furthermore, Rey recommends that these regulatory measures be enforced during periods of financial inflows and relaxed during downturns to effectively manage capital flow volatility (Rey, 2015).
The push towards stricter regulation of cross-border capital flows finds support in influential economic circles, notably the Committee on International Economic Policy and Reform (CIEPR). Building on this momentum, CIEPR and Eichengreen (2011) emphasize the crucial role of macroprudential regulation in addressing asset inflation and credit booms. They also highlight the challenge faced by small, liberalized nations in implementing effective domestic policies independently. Consequently, these economies are advised to employ macroprudential tools and temporary capital controls, particularly on inflows that support domestic financial institutions. This approach is deemed necessary as the external equilibrium of emerging economies cannot solely rely on the assumption of real adjustments in exchange rates.
In this section, we examine the efficacy of capital controls and macroprudential policies through three key lenses: i) Primary objectives and potential spillover ramifications; ii) The distinction between enduring and intermittent capital controls; and iii) A comparative analysis of Capital Flows Management Measures (CFMs) in emerging economies versus developed economies.
This study posits that in response to strong capital inflows post the global financial crisis, emerging economies implemented capital controls and macroprudential policies, prompting mainstream researchers to scrutinize the efficacy of these regulatory measures across various dimensions. This emerging research trend can be viewed as a shift in the mainstream's focus and scope.
The emerging economies that instigated the CFMs had six primary objectives: to counter an appreciation of the exchange rate, enhance monetary policy autonomy, extend the maturity of external liabilities, reduce the net volume of financial inflows, mitigate credit booms, and address asset inflation (Habermeier et al., 2011). Capital controls, however, are not solely significant for their impact on the economies implementing them. Other research highlights the spillover effects of CFMs. In examining the efficacy of capital controls enforced by emerging economies, Habermeier et al. (2011) conducted VAR regressions, revealing the relative effectiveness of enhancing monetary policy autonomy for Brazil, Thailand, and Colombia, as well as extending the maturity of external liabilities for the latter.
During the post-global crisis period, when several emerging economies implemented capital inflow controls, economists extensively scrutinized their potential efficacy amidst high global liquidity and the looming risk of these Capital Flow Management measures evolving into a new form of 'impoverishing the neighborhood' policy. Noteworthy among these scholars, Pasricha et al. (2018) significantly enriched the discourse on capital controls and macroprudential policies. Leveraging a capital controls database, the authors meticulously assessed the effectiveness of these measures in emerging economies pre and post-financial crises, focusing on financial flows, exchange rate fluctuations, and monetary policy autonomy. Through the examination of two models, the authors delved into the domestic repercussions of capital controls and the spillover effects of their implementation by select BRICS nations on other emerging economies.
In the period leading up to the 2008 crisis, the impulse-response functions indicate that a net restriction on inflows bolstered monetary policy autonomy and alleviated pressure on exchange rate appreciation, albeit with mixed and less pronounced outcomes. Conversely, a net loosening on outflows diminished the monetary policy autonomy of emerging economies. However, following the crisis (2008-2011), regressions reveal that net restrictions on inflows only marginally enhanced monetary policy autonomy, while net loosening on outflows failed to yield significant effects on the 'trilemma' variables. This decline in control effectiveness was largely attributed to the global context of heightened liquidity (Pasricha et al., 2018).
In terms of spillover effects, certain impulse-response functions indicate that these effects were heightened during the post-crisis period. Not only did they elevate net financial flows and exert pressure on exchange rate appreciation compared to the pre-crisis era, but they also diminished the autonomy of monetary policy in other emerging markets. The regressions suggest that spillover effects were more pronounced in Latin American economies than in Asian economies, primarily due to the former's higher level of financial openness and dependence on bank flows for external funding.
Brazil's implementation of extensive capital controls following the global financial crisis makes it a significant case study in this area. Unlike broader cross-country analyses focusing on the efficacy and spillover ramifications of such controls, Forbes et al. (2016) specifically delved into the impact of Brazil's controls between 2006 and 2013 on other economies, in addition to their direct influence on the Brazilian capital account. Through regression analysis, Forbes et al. (2016) found that the introduction of IOFs during the specified timeframe led to a decrease in institutional investors' positions in the controlled asset class, particularly fixed income instruments. Interestingly, the study revealed that this reduction in investor positions was even more pronounced in certain equity classes, indicating a heightened apprehension among investors towards the government's regulatory measures.
After uncovering evidence supporting the efficacy of capital controls in diminishing portfolio flows to Brazil throughout the sample period, the researchers delved into potential spillover effects on other nations in reaction to the regulatory actions taken by the Brazilian government. The regression analysis conducted to explore this notion revealed encouraging signs, including positive spillovers leading to increased investor positions in countries within the same region (Latin America), those with financial markets akin to Brazil's, and major exporters to China. Conversely, there were negative spillovers resulting in decreased investor positions in countries perceived as prone to implementing capital controls (Forbes et al., 2016). These findings hold significant implications for the discourse surrounding the multilateral dimensions of capital controls, as there exists a concern that such regulations could evolve into a new form of 'impoverishing the neighborhood' policy.
The debate surrounding capital controls revolves around the question of whether these measures should be implemented permanently or intermittently. Recent experiences in emerging economies post-crisis suggest a preference for the latter approach. To address the trade-offs associated with these differing types of capital account regulations, numerous econometric studies have been conducted to determine the superiority of one over the other under various conditions. It is important to note that permanent capital controls do not signify a complete closure of a country's borders to cross-border capital flows; rather, they involve the imposition of controls on specific asset classes or debts that are maintained over an extended period. This distinction is irrespective of the level of taxation or administrative measures associated with the imposed capital controls. Conversely, sporadic capital controls are characterized by government interventions that are swiftly altered or lifted, potentially yielding more pronounced effects compared to permanent capital controls.
Within this research domain, Klein's (2012) study stands out as particularly pertinent. The author adeptly distinguishes between nations that implemented capital controls as a sporadic or temporary measure and those that enforced them permanently. The former category encompassed Latin American and certain developed nations, whereas the latter primarily comprised Asian economies. Consequently, several panel regressions were conducted to scrutinize the disparities in economic performance, financial vulnerability, and exchange rates stemming from varying capital control strategies. The initial analysis revealed that during the period of 1995-2010, countries with enduring capital controls exhibited superior economic growth rates and lower increments in financial variables.
This strand of literature examining various approaches to capital controls also incorporates Fernández et al.’s (2016) study. The authors utilize a database listing multiple financial assets subject to controls and assess the efficacy of capital controls through co-movements between these regulatory measures and an aggregate control indicator. Their analysis of co-movements involved calculating the correlation of controls imposed on different financial assets and between controls on inflows and outflows over time. For 'gate' countries (intermittently applying capital controls), findings suggest a moderate correlation between controls on the most liquid financial assets and controls on both inflows and outflows. In contrast, 'wall' countries (consistently applying capital controls) exhibited a high correlation, particularly between controls on the most liquid assets and financial credit, with controls on both inflows and outflows.
The methodology suggests that permanent capital controls were more effective than sporadic capital controls, predominantly implemented by middle-income countries during the sample period (Fernández et al., 2016). A key factor contributing to the efficacy of these controls was the high correlation between inflow and outflow restrictions, indicating a robust regulatory and administrative framework that deterred or mitigated capital control evasion.
A significant research focus in recent literature on capital controls involves comparing the effectiveness of capital controls implemented by emerging and developing economies with the financial regulatory measures enforced by developed nations using various methodologies. The latter measures typically consist of prudential regulations that indirectly impact outbound investments by domestic entities. Numerous studies indicate that the prudential measures implemented by developed countries on their capital outflows are more successful in mitigating cross-border flows when compared to inflow controls imposed by emerging economies. This emerging evidence, outlined below, holds substantial importance in the ongoing discourse surrounding the multilateral dimensions of capital controls and the necessity for international coordination between countries that serve as recipients and sources of capital.
Binici et al. (2010) conducted a study to assess the efficacy of capital controls and other regulatory measures in managing financial fluxes. Their research, spanning 1995-2005 and encompassing 74 countries, focused on the impact of CFMs on equity, FDIs, and debts. The findings revealed that CFMs on outflows were particularly effective in reducing the overall volume of financial instruments, with the most significant impact observed in the debt category among high-income nations. Notably, the study highlighted that the effectiveness of CFMs on outflows in high-income countries surpassed that of similar measures in medium and low-income nations.
Aizenman and Binici (2016) make a significant contribution to the subject by analyzing the impact of capital flows and CFMs on exchange rates and international reserves of emerging and OECD countries during the 2000-2014 period, specifically focusing on countries' 'exchange market pressure' (EMP). Their findings reveal that the implementation of CFMs by OECD nations alleviated some pro-cyclical pressures on EMP, with stricter measures imposed on inflows compared to outflows. Conversely, CFMs in emerging countries did not effectively mitigate the pro-cyclical pressures of short-term capital flows on EMP, despite their more frequent and intense use of regulatory measures. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of capital controls in reducing exposure depends on institutional quality, potentially offering greater benefits to OECD countries compared to more vulnerable emerging markets (Aizenman & Binici, 2016, p. 86).
In the ongoing discourse regarding the multilateral dimensions of capital controls and prudential policies, alongside the imperative for international cooperation on this matter, Ghosh et al.'s (2014) research emerges as noteworthy. Their study delves into the efficacy of capital controls and related regulatory strategies, such as macroprudential policies, when implemented concurrently on both capital inflows and outflows, originating from emerging recipient and advanced source nations. By examining whether these measures effectively curtail cross-border banking flows, the authors analyze a dataset comprising 76 capital recipient countries and 31 capital source countries, conducting separate regressions for each category. The findings reveal that prudential regulations, particularly those concerning external loans, exert a significant influence in diminishing bank flows from source countries. Similarly, regulatory interventions on capital inflows by recipient nations demonstrate a degree of effectiveness in reducing cross-border banking activities.
An essential finding highlighted by these regressions is the comparative effectiveness of regulatory measures implemented by source countries on their capital outflows in contrast to the inflow controls enforced by recipient economies (Ghosh et al., 2014). The authors argue, based on their regression analysis, for the critical need for global coordination concerning capital controls and regulatory policies, not only between source and recipient economies but also among recipient economies themselves. Such coordination is believed to have the potential to mitigate currency wars, as discussed in Korinek (2012).
A new theoretical literature is emerging in the mainstream that supports the relevance of capital controls, responding to the shortcomings of orthodox models advocating full capital account liberalization. This emerging literature also takes into account empirical evidence showcasing the effectiveness of capital controls and macroprudential policies implemented by various countries across different parameters. This article contends that the orthodox models supporting full liberalization are essentially ex-post constructions, drawing on empirical studies that highlight the efficacy of capital controls. This shift represents a significant reorientation within the mainstream, considering the substantial impact of theoretical modeling on shaping future economic policies.
Korinek (2011) was among the pioneering theorists who laid the foundation for the application of capital controls in this particular context. The theoretical framework he developed formalizes the prudent utilization of capital controls. The model posits that emerging economies tend to accumulate excessive external debt as a result of capital inflows, primarily because private entities fail to fully grasp the implications of potential future debt constraints arising from their mounting indebtedness. Throughout the boom phase, debt inflows fuel domestic consumption, drive asset inflation (which is often utilized as collateral for financing activities), and trigger currency appreciation. However, any adverse shock to these variables can set off financial amplification, characterized by currency devaluation, asset devaluation, and a decline in overall demand. This, in turn, initiates a detrimental cycle for private entities, leading to a relative halt in external funding or an escalation in borrowing costs.
The implementation of prudential capital controls serves to prompt domestic agents to internalize their decisions regarding indebtedness, thereby preventing a financial amplification process. Furthermore, these controls have the potential to facilitate the smoothing of consumption over time and contribute to economic growth, challenging the prevailing orthodoxy as outlined by Korinek (2011). Building on this argument, Ostry et al. (2012) suggest that controls on capital inflows, by targeting this externality, seek to diminish the consumption component of the representative agent and, consequently, encourage intertemporal consumption smoothing.
In the realm of empirical literature concerning the effectiveness of capital controls, orthodox models have sought to provide theoretical explanations for the varying degrees of success in achieving control objectives. A pivotal contribution to this field was made by Magud et al. (2011), who outlined a framework for understanding the economics of capital controls. The authors posited that countries implement capital controls with the primary goals of curbing short-term capital inflows, mitigating the risks associated with large capital inflows, managing exchange rate pressures, and enhancing monetary policy autonomy. Capital controls can prove effective in reducing short-term debt levels, thereby extending the maturity profile of external liabilities, and in bolstering monetary policy autonomy if the responsiveness of short-term inflows to total external liabilities exceeds one. Consequently, the implementation of capital controls would result in a relative decrease in short-term inflows relative to total external liabilities, while also fostering greater monetary policy independence by creating a divergence in interest rate differentials between short-term and long-term external liabilities (Magud et al., 2011).
Recent research has shed light on the efficacy of capital controls, prompting economists to delve into the identification of specific classes of capital flows that would warrant the use of Capital Flow Management measures (CFMs). Among the notable contributions in this realm, Blanchard et al.'s (2017) study stands out for its theoretical advancements over traditional open economy models. The authors introduce a distinction between capital flows directed towards emerging economies, categorizing them into bonds and non-bonds. Debt bonds fall under the former category, while the latter primarily comprises equity instruments and Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs). This differentiation serves as a means to discern whether capital flows are expansionary or contractionary in nature. According to the authors, debt bonds are deemed contractionary within the framework of IS-LM-BP models, as they lead to exchange rate appreciation without contributing to an expansion of domestic credit denominated in foreign currency. Conversely, non-bond flows can have either an expansionary or contractionary impact on economic activity, contingent upon their net effect. Non-bond flows typically trigger exchange rate appreciation and an expansion of domestic credit denominated in foreign currency. If the latter effect outweighs the former, non-bond flows are considered expansionary. Consequently, the implementation of capital controls on bond inflows is consistently advisable, while the imposition of controls on non-bond inflows is recommended only when their net effect is contractionary (Blanchard et al., 2017).
In the evolving theoretical literature, some models now advocate for the international coordination of capital controls, marking a departure from traditional beliefs favoring full capital account liberalization rooted in the efficient markets hypothesis. This shift underscores the growing formalization of multilateral aspects of capital controls, with recent research proposing coordination among capital recipient nations and between recipient and source countries. A key argument in these studies is that unilateral imposition of capital controls by emerging economies carries escalating and nonlinear costs, ultimately diminishing welfare in the utility function of private agents within heavily regulated economies. To mitigate these costs, policies promoting international coordination of capital controls are deemed necessary to distribute the burden among recipient nations and between recipient and source countries, thereby alleviating the convex costs associated with unilateral control measures on capital inflows (Ostry et al., 2012; Korinek, 2012).
In the realm of currency wars, characterized by the successive imposition of capital controls by emerging economies grappling with spillover effects, Ostry et al. (2012) contend that the unilateral imposition of such controls is no longer Pareto efficient in addressing the externalities stemming from excessive external indebtedness, as posited by Korinek (2011). Thus, the coordination of capital controls among recipient countries could potentially mitigate these currency wars. Korinek (2012) suggests a coordinated approach to not only alleviate the convex costs linked to unilateral regulatory measures but also to consider the impact each economy has on international interest rates. According to his model, this impact is determined by factors such as capital flows and current account balances, implying that advanced economies should face stricter controls on capital outflows. Nevertheless, Ostry et al. (2012) rightly note that unlike emerging economies, source economies lack a clear incentive to tighten regulations on their capital outflows, as their private agents are not constrained by the 'costly controls' element in their utility functions. One potential argument to persuade source economies to enhance regulation on capital outflows is that such coordination could prevent future financial crises in emerging economies, thereby safeguarding financial institutions based in developed countries from potential losses (Ostry et al., 2012).
This article examines the key points of discontinuity in significant shifts in the mainstream view on capital account liberalization and capital controls in recent years. The rigorous econometric analysis conducted in these studies has enabled the identification of objectives that can be readily attained by Capital Flow Management measures (CFMs) as well as those that pose greater challenges. The findings, outlined below, offer valuable insights that can inform policymakers in shaping future regulatory strategies.
Cross-country studies have highlighted the relative effectiveness of Capital Flow Management (CFMs) in enhancing monetary policy autonomy, extending the maturity of external liabilities, and mitigating credit booms, with the latter primarily achieved through macroprudential policies. However, the outcomes regarding the ability of CFMs to counter pressures on exchange rate appreciation were inconclusive, and there is limited evidence supporting the notion that CFMs can effectively reduce the overall volume of capital flows. These findings were predominantly presented by Magud et al. (2011), Habermeier et al. (2011), Fernández et al. (2015), Aizenman and Binici (2016), Pasricha et al. (2018), and Forbes et al. (2016). Figure 1 synthesizes the collective outcomes regarding the efficacy of CFMs as identified through the collaborative analysis of these studies.
The findings presented above pertain specifically to sporadic CFMs; however, other research comparing permanent and sporadic capital controls offers insights into their respective efficacy. Permanent capital controls have demonstrated superiority over sporadic controls in stimulating economic growth and mitigating financial risks. Additionally, permanent controls exhibit a more robust correlation among various asset and debt classes subject to regulation, suggesting a greater ability to deter evasion. Key studies by Klein (2012) and Fernández et al. (2016) serve as primary sources supporting this conclusion.
An important contribution of mainstream studies lies in their investigation of the relative effectiveness of prudential measures and capital controls imposed by both developed and emerging economies, alongside the analysis of spillover effects. These studies play a crucial role in the ongoing debate surrounding the multilateral aspects of capital controls and are essential for future discussions on the international coordination of CFMs. Developed countries' prudential measures, which discriminate based on the currency denomination of transactions, were found to be more effective in reducing cross-border capital flows compared to capital controls imposed by emerging markets, which discriminate based on the investor's residency. These conclusions are drawn from studies conducted by Binici et al. (2010), Ghosh et al. (2014), and Aizenman and Binici (2016. Figure 2 provides a systematic overview of the relative effectiveness of CFMs imposed by developing and developed economies, with the latter primarily employing prudential policies as measures.
Furthermore, capital controls were notably more effective in enhancing the maturity of external liabilities and bolstering monetary policy autonomy leading up to the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. However, in the aftermath of the crisis, marked by worldwide low interest rates, the capital controls implemented were less impactful and exhibited more pronounced spillover effects. This conclusion is supported by findings from Pasricha et al. (2018) and Forbes et al. (2016), as well as the model developed by Korinek (2012).
Chart 1 presents a categorization of the effectiveness of CFMs based on the analysis of selected papers. For the sake of clarity, CFMs are identified with the following objectives: 1) extending the maturity of external liabilities, 2) enhancing monetary policy autonomy, 3) decreasing the overall volume of capital flows, 4) reducing the net volume of capital flows, 5) mitigating pressure on nominal exchange rate appreciation, and 6) addressing credit booms. Furthermore, within this classification, studies that report achieving only one (or none) of the CFMs' goals are labeled as Null/Low effectiveness, while those that demonstrate the attainment of at least two of the CFMs' goals are categorized as Medium/High effectiveness.
Figure 3 visually represents the progression of mainstream economics concerning capital account liberalization and capital controls, tracing the shift from liberalizing reforms to the post-crisis era. The orthodox perspective on capital controls undergoes a notable theoretical reorientation, indicating the emergence of a fresh orthodox paradigm within mainstream economics.
It is important to highlight that the aforementioned processes are still ongoing. With the significant reorientation observed in mainstream economics in the past twenty-five years, it is plausible to anticipate a further integration of capital controls into orthodox economic theory in the future.
This article posits that the conventional models advocating full capital account liberalization during the 1980s and 1990s have been gradually undermined by empirical studies highlighting their shortcomings, alongside research demonstrating the benefits of capital controls. In light of this evidence, new orthodox models endorsing the implementation of capital controls have emerged. These fresh models can be viewed as ex-post theoretical constructs, contrasting with the ex-ante theoretical frameworks of the past. The reorientation of theoretical perspectives was catalyzed by the aftermath of the global financial crises of 2008, which exposed the detrimental impacts of volatile international capital flows on national economies, particularly those of emerging economies.
These novel ex-post models potentially signify a shift in the prevailing theoretical framework and conventional viewpoint regarding capital account liberalization and capital controls. This shift acknowledges the alignment of theory with reality, suggesting that it was not the theory that was correct and reality that was mistaken. Consequently, it can be asserted that the emerging mainstream models signal a fresh phase in their theoretical stance towards the management of capital movements. Presently, mainstream economics increasingly accepts capital controls with reduced constraints, recognizing them as significant tools at the disposal of central banks.
However, despite some mainstream economists beginning to advocate for the implementation of capital controls and macroprudential policies with objectives similar to those supported by Keynesian economists, our study indicates that their respective theoretical foundations still diverge. Rooted in the Keynesian/Structuralist tradition, the primary justification for employing capital controls lies in the inherent asymmetry of the current International Monetary and Financial System, where the volatility of capital flows and their adverse effects stem largely from the presence of a 'currency hierarchy'. Conversely, the theoretical shift occurring within orthodoxy is predominantly centered on the concept of correcting externalities, leading to a research methodology that heavily emphasizes individual agents and their reactions to government interventions.
The observed differences imply distinct practical consequences: according to the Keynesian viewpoint, capital controls should be regarded as a permanent economic policy tool, as currency inconvertibility might persist for an indefinite period. Conversely, the prevailing orthodox stance suggests that capital controls and macroprudential measures ought to be employed intermittently, particularly in response to a sudden influx of capital that could heighten financial vulnerabilities and lead to currency overvaluation.
Only time will reveal whether the continuous evolution in the literature on open economics will lead to a new consensus on capital controls.
