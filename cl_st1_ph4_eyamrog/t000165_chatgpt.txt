A normal distribution approach has been utilized to forecast the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic. The fit to the daily COVID-19 cases in Mexico during the initial phase of the epidemic demonstrates a highly accurate continuous approximation to the data, with an R2 value of 0.976. By deriving this function, insights into the daily increase/decrease or acceleration of new cases, which may be obscured within the raw data noise, can be obtained. The predictions are visually represented in a unique 3D format to illustrate the evolution of forecasts as new data emerges. These estimations align closely with the logistic and Gompertz functions fitted to the respective epidemic models, falling within standard deviation. This methodology can serve as a tool for modeling the epidemic and aiding decision-making at a municipal or regional level. Emphasis is placed on simplicity coupled with robust predictive capabilities, enabling local government advisors or personnel unfamiliar with specialized statistical methods to comprehend and implement the model effectively.
The evolution of epidemics has been extensively studied through mathematical modeling, aiming to predict key aspects of disease dynamics such as the timing of the infectious peak and the peak number of new cases. Various models have been developed to address different aspects, including robustness to daily fluctuations in data, international spread, and other factors. For a comprehensive overview of epidemic models, recent historical accounts are available. The deterministic approach, mathematically speaking, involves a system of partial differential equations that capture essential disease propagation characteristics. Analytical or numerical methods are employed to solve these equations, depending on their complexity (e.g., SIR, SIRS, SEIRS models). Generally, models with more parameters tend to provide better fits to the data. However, challenges such as sensitivity to initial conditions and the weighting of factors based on different criteria or available data persist. For instance, accurately determining the crucial basic reproductive number R0, especially in the early stages of an epidemic, remains a significant challenge.
To predict the future course of an epidemic, models with fewer parameters can offer advantages over more complex models. These simpler models require a reduced number of coefficients, making it easier to obtain analytical solutions for continuous-time models that describe the new or cumulative number of cases. These analytic functions can be easily derived or integrated to calculate other quantities like the acceleration of the spreading. Additionally, non-specialists can efficiently implement and understand these models. However, these benefits come with a trade-off. While these models excel at forecasting the epidemic's evolution over time, they do not provide insights into the underlying mechanisms or ways to modify them. Nevertheless, if the focus is on prediction, as in the current study, the benefits can outweigh the limitations, allowing for a quick and reliable assessment of epidemic forecasting.
Epidemic predictions play a crucial role in guiding the implementation of various policies aimed at mitigating the impact of diseases [7]. In response, national and local governments take measures such as enhancing hospital infrastructure, imposing activity restrictions [8], advocating for social distancing [9], and introducing other strategies to curb person-to-person transmission [10]. The significance of flattening the curve, especially in situations where resources are limited, cannot be overstated [11]. Reports highlight the lack of preparedness in mid to low-income countries worldwide to effectively combat large-scale epidemics [12]. The potential indirect increase in mortality due to disruptions in healthcare systems and reduced access to food is a looming concern [13]. Latin American countries, with their predominantly modest public healthcare systems, face significant challenges in readiness to tackle the spread of COVID-19 [14]. The impact on the Caribbean region, barring Cuba, is anticipated to be severe [15]. The inadequacy of healthcare system investments in Mexico over the past decades has been glaringly exposed by the current emergency [16]. In Mexico, COVID-19 patients with underlying chronic conditions and multimorbidity are experiencing heightened rates of pneumonia and mortality [17]. Hence, timely and accurate assessment of epidemic trends at various governance levels is essential for effectively managing health crises.
In this study, the pandemic evolution is modeled using a normal distribution for several reasons. Firstly, the Gaussian function allows for the visualization of changes in spreading speed and total case numbers through its derivative and integral. The consideration of spreading acceleration, often overlooked, proves to be a crucial and sensitive factor for decision-making, as we will demonstrate. Secondly, by limiting the parameters to a minimum of three, the model eliminates the complexity of assessing numerous parameters, especially during the initial stages of an epidemic [18]. Lastly, simplicity is prioritized for clarity, enabling researchers and personnel unfamiliar with intricate mathematical or statistical models to comprehend and apply the model effectively at a local level.
The method is demonstrated using COVID-19 data from Mexico, tracking the epidemic's progression from March to mid-July. Section 2 presents the results of fitting a Gaussian curve to the number of new confirmed cases on specific dates, providing insights into the maximum expected daily cases, the timing of this peak, and the projected duration of the outbreak. The cumulative cases function is derived through direct integration of this curve, while the derivative of the Gaussian curve proves to be a valuable tool for assessing the rate of spread. In Section 3, a unique approach is taken to showcase how the results evolve over time, illustrating changes based on when predictions were made through dynamic time-time 3D plots. Section 4 delves into the potential applications of this technique at local and micro-regional levels. Finally, in the concluding section, a comparison is drawn between the present approach and other methodologies, revealing the surprising accuracy of the current model when contrasted with more complex models.
The measurement of disease impact on a population can be assessed through various parameters or criteria, each with its own specific emphasis. These definitions may vary, encompassing factors such as geographical spread [19], the percentage of the infected population [20], among others. Complications can arise when case definitions are altered as an epidemic progresses, as exemplified by the seven versions issued within three months during the COVID-19 outbreak in China [21]. A commonly accepted metric involves tracking the number of new cases within a specified timeframe, typically reported on a daily basis. This raw data serves as the foundation for the analysis conducted in this study. Specifically, the daily confirmed new cases in Mexico were sourced from the 'Secretaría de Salud' of the Mexican government [22] and cross-verified with additional reputable sources [23].
The daily count of new COVID-19 cases is commonly viewed as a random variable, subject to the central limit theorem. This theorem dictates that the mean and variance of numerous observations culminate in an average that, as the sample size grows, converges to a normal distribution. In the context of a stochastic Markovian epidemic model operating in continuous time with maximum entropy, this variable assumes a normal distribution. Given that the number of new daily cases arises from a multitude of independent circumstances, its distribution is anticipated to approximate normality. The continuous variable denoting daily confirmed new cases, denoted as N, is represented by a Gaussian function expressed as N = Nmax exp −(t −tmax)2 w2 !. Here, Nmax signifies the projected average peak of new cases during the highest infection rate, tmax indicates the projected time of the peak infection rate, and w serves as a metric for the disease's duration, measured from the point where the infection rate escalates from 1/e to its maximum value.
The values of the three parameters Nmax, tmax, and w were determined through a least squares fit of the Gaussian function to the data spanning from 18 March 2020 to the specified date. The fitting process, depicted in Figure 1, utilized data up to 18 July. The R2 value of the fit stands at a commendable 0.976, affirming the suitability of the Gaussian function as a continuous approximation to the dataset. The parameter values, along with their associated uncertainties, are detailed in Table 1.
The daily number of confirmed new cases, denoted as N, serves as an indicator of the rate at which the infection is spreading among individuals. Consequently, Nmax can be interpreted as a forecast of the average speed at which infections are occurring during the peak of the outbreak.
The Gaussian function integrates to the error function, necessitating a shift to ensure that the initial condition aligns with zero cases at −∞, particularly during the first appearance of the disease prior to subsequent outbreaks. The cumulative cases function, denoted as Ncum = Z N dt = π 2 Nmax w erf ((t −tmax) w ) −π 2 Nmax w erf (−∞) (2), represents the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, as depicted in figure 2. This integral serves to estimate the total number of cases based on the Gaussian fit, although this quantity can also be derived from the sum of all cases up to the present date. A comparison between the total number of cases derived from the raw data and the fit provides a preliminary validation of the fit's accuracy. Specifically, the cumulative number of cases from the raw data stood at 338,913 on 18 July [23], while the result obtained from the integral of the fit, as per Equation (2), amounted to 339,887 cases, reflecting a 0.3% discrepancy.
An estimation of the increase or decrease in new cases can be determined by subtracting the number of new cases from two consecutive days. Some websites, such as the World Health Organization, display the 'Daily Increase/Decrease' directly in their tooltip [23], as illustrated in Figure 3. The daily reports exhibit significant variability due to the necessity of collecting data from various geographical regions with diverse infrastructure and communication systems. Factors like weekdays, weekends, and different time zones also contribute to the fluctuations in these reports. The day-to-day fluctuations in the increase or decrease are so substantial that extracting meaningful information from this plot becomes challenging. This could explain the limited attention given to the rate of change in new daily cases. Furthermore, more advanced models often yield solutions with derivatives that are not straightforward to evaluate. The derivative of the Gaussian function is represented as a = dN dt = −2Nmax (t −tmax) w2 exp (t −tmax)2 w2 ! . (3)
This function assesses the rate at which infections are either increasing or decreasing. The derivative of the fit produces a smooth curve, as depicted in Figure 4, contrasting the discrete data illustrated in Figure 3. This curve's sensitivity is notably tied to the pandemic's stage of evolution. Notably, inflection points in the new cases curve (Figure 1) are easily discerned as peaks and troughs in the derivative curve (Figure 4). In the realm of physics, a = dN dt symbolizes the acceleration (or deceleration) of new infections. However, a level of training is required to interpret and analyze the graph accurately. It is important to note that the ordinate scale is significantly smaller than that derived directly from the raw data. For instance, hypothetically, if a specific location has the capacity to handle 1000 new patients daily, with one bed allocated per patient, and an assumption that discharged patients equal incoming patients from the previous day, a scenario can be envisioned. In a typical curve, as shown in Figure 4, at the peak of acceleration (7 June), 85 beds would need to be added daily. At the peak of new cases, where the acceleration hits zero, no additional beds would be required. The acceleration curve intersects the x-axis at this peak, pinpointing the moment precisely (23 July in Figure 4). As the crisis progresses beyond the disease peak, negative acceleration values indicate a reduction in the number of COVID-19 beds needed.
The projected trajectory of the epidemic typically represents a snapshot at a specific date, assessed using the most recent data at hand. Visual representations often depict prediction uncertainties through bands surrounding the model fit, a common practice to illustrate how uncertainty grows as the prediction moves further away from the evaluation date [24]. As new data emerges daily or at specified intervals, frozen images are generated, leading to the discarding of previous day's or past predictions in favor of more accurate forecasts with increased data availability. It is crucial to consider not only the accuracy of predictions but also how they evolve, especially when observing varying patterns at different stages of the epidemic.
An intriguing method for visualizing the dynamics of predictions, as opposed to mere snapshots, involves examining the parameters of the fit in relation to the day on which the prediction was made. The key parameters of the Gaussian fit include the maximum anticipated number of cases (Nmax), the time (tmax) at which this maximum is projected to occur, and the anticipated duration of the disease (w).
In Figure 5, a three-dimensional plot illustrates the evolution of predictions over consecutive days. The anticipated maximum number of cases, Nmax, and the corresponding date of this peak, tmax, are depicted as a function of the evaluation day, teval, when the prediction was generated. This representation forms a time-time plot where the height signifies Nmax. The triad (teval, tmax, Nmax) showcases how the prediction altered as new data was integrated into the model. The initial data point for Mexico was recorded on 18 March 2020. For a given evaluation time, teval, the number of data points corresponds to teval minus the initial recording date. In Figure 5, the first prediction was made on 8 May 2020, based on 53 data points, while the final prediction was on 18 July 2020, utilizing 123 data points. A noticeable correlation emerges between dates further from the evaluation date and the projected maximum number of new cases. Initially, the peak was expected around 10 May in evaluations conducted in early May, but this shifted to the second half of June in subsequent assessments. The anticipated peak date transitioned from mid-July to the latter part of July as the evaluations progressed.
Global policies at a multinational level are coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Nations, on the next scale, establish their own policies, which, notably, have been quite diverse in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Moving down to smaller units, depending on the geopolitical divisions of countries, there are states, counties, and other mid-sized structures, further divided into municipalities or districts with a wide range of population and geographical sizes. The local attributes of these smaller structures vary significantly across different countries. For instance, Brazil currently has 5,570 municipalities with healthcare falling under their responsibility. In Mexico, there are 32 states and 2,457 municipalities, with healthcare and health decision-making transitioning between the national and state levels with varying degrees of success or failure. A recent survey of Canadian municipalities revealed that the intensity of policy responses is strongly correlated with municipal population size and case totals, and to a lesser extent, with province and local ideology.
In Mexico, the majority of COVID-19 information is managed at a national level, with only a few large metropolitan areas handling their own data. Local municipal levels, on the other hand, have significantly less information processing. Despite this, certain municipalities have made independent decisions concerning COVID-19, such as prohibiting entry into the area or refusing the setup of emergency mobile hospitals for the virus. Additionally, there is limited involvement from non-governmental organizations or civil society members in utilizing or producing local data to inform their positions on the issue or implement crucial measures to mitigate risks.
It is crucial for both local governments and the general population to have timely and accurate information about diseases. Informed decisions are more likely when both local and global data are effectively analyzed and communicated to decision-makers and the public. While central governments can handle information at broader levels, processing data at the micro-level centrally is impractical. Therefore, it is essential for individuals at the local level to interpret and compare locally collected information with global patterns. Unfortunately, a widespread issue globally has been the censorship and intentional distortion of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Local knowledge can play a vital role in combating restricted or biased information dissemination.
The current framework has the potential to offer a modest yet significant contribution towards assessing the COVID-19 outlook at a micro-level. Locally derived knowledge serves as a supplementary resource to global trends, enabling communities to grasp the unfolding events in their immediate vicinity. This localized information equips decision-makers at the micro level to make informed choices based on empirical evidence and well-founded forecasts. As this project progresses, it becomes imperative for certain community members to possess basic skills in curve fitting and graph interpretation. Utilizing mathematics software capable of conducting linear regressions and visualizations, alongside access to local data on new infection cases, is essential. The software program utilized in this study is replicated in the supplementary materials. It is conceivable that a web applet could be developed to allow micro-communities to input local data through a web browser and receive predictive values and graphs online. The former approach necessitates the use of mathematics software, while the latter relies on an internet connection.
At the Institute of Physics, UNAM, the peak of COVID-19 in Mexico was predicted to occur on 27 June, with almost 6000 new cases, utilizing the logistic function and data up to 23 May [24]. In contrast, the peak prediction in the current study, using the normal distribution function for the same dataset, indicated 1 July as the peak date with 4448 new cases. Despite a mere four-day difference between these two estimations, Nmax differed by 26%. Various groups closely collaborating with the Mexican government include CIMAT-Gompertz, CIMAT-IM-UNAM, CONACYT-CRIP, IMSS, and the CDMX epidemic model. The CIMAT-Gompertz group projected the peak time to be on 29 June, with just under 4000 new cases per day, based on data evaluated up to 1 June [27]. In comparison, the present model forecasted the peak time to be on 26 June, with 4694 new cases based on data up to 4 June. The CDMX epidemic group's approach is founded on a SEIR model with nine coupled partial differential equations, specifically designed to account for hospital patients with varying infrastructure requirements, focusing on health infrastructure needs in the Mexico City area [28]. The CIMAT-IM AMA model, on the other hand, is a compartmental SEIRD model aimed at predicting hospital occupancy in metropolitan areas across the 32 states of the country, although their report lacks a national forecast [29]. Comparisons with publicly available results from other groups are sourced from the 'Secretaría de Salud' spokesman [30]. Initially, predictions in late April and early May suggested a peak around 10 May, but subsequent shifts have moved it towards late July. In light of these comparisons, the current method demonstrates peak time and maximum new cases predictions that align with calculations from other models.
The anticipated duration of the epidemic presents a complex scenario. Post-peak behaviors vary significantly based on regional factors and policies in place. While certain regions, such as the Russian Federation, demonstrate a plateau in cases, others like Italy show a steady exponential decline, with potential for different trends in the near future. Conversely, some areas, like the Republic of Korea, face a second outbreak shortly after the initial peak. When propagation conditions differ, assumptions of model constants need adjustment. This necessitates solving equations with time-varying parameters, a task that is intricate, or considering piece-wise solutions for segments with constant parameters. The current methodology is not ideal for addressing these complexities. Although the normal distribution is symmetric, asymmetric piece-wise solutions can be incorporated if needed.
The fitting of COVID-19 daily cases in Mexico indicates that Gaussian fits can effectively predict the peak number of new cases per day and the expected time of the peak. The normal progression or deceleration curve of daily new cases offers a valuable means to evaluate the pandemic's trajectory. Three-dimensional plots illustrating how forecasts evolve with available data demonstrate the dynamic nature of the predictions. Utilizing this model alongside data visualization tools serves as a supplementary decision-making tool that should be promoted. The model's simplicity renders it a suitable candidate for implementation at a municipal level, especially in mid to low-income countries where specialized local human resources are limited.
