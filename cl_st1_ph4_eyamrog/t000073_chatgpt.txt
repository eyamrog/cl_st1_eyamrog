In this initial review of Gasteroid fungi (Agaricomycetes, Basidiomycota) in Paraguay, a comprehensive list of 40 species documented in the country since the earliest recorded collection is provided. These species are spread across 16 genera and 4 families. This study marks the first consolidated dataset on this particular group of fungi in Paraguay. The enumeration of these species underscores the limited number of formally documented fungi within the Paraguayan mycological community.
Gasteroid fungi exhibit a diverse array of basidiomata structures, with these unique features often resulting in the classification of numerous genera as either monotypic or containing only a few represented species.
The available bibliographic data on the group of gasteroid fungi in the previous century was notably limited, primarily consisting of a few references by Spegazzini (1884, 1888, 1891). In these works, Spegazzini documented a total of 12 species from the region, including Geastrum saccatum Fr. (referred to as Geaster saccatus), Tulostoma cyclophorum Lloyd (referred to as Tylostoma berteroanum), Lycoperdon lilacinum (Mont. & Berk.) Speg., Lycoperdon pseudo-lilacinum Speg., Lycoperdon pseudogemmatum Speg., Simblum sphaerocephalum Schltdl., Geastrum saccatum (also known as Geaster spegazzinianus), Lanopila guaranitica Speg., Bovista dubiosa Speg., and Lycoperdon scleroderma Speg.
The majority of the recent citations have been contributed by modern mycologists following Spegazzini's last publication 122 years ago. The subsequent documentation of gasteroid fungi in the region was noted in 2013 (Campi et al., 2013), with further investigations conducted by Campi and colleagues in subsequent years (Campi et al., 2015; Campi & Maubet, 2015a, 2015b; Campi et al., 2017; Maubet et al., 2018).
Over the past decade, there has been a notable increase in the documentation of gasteroid fungi. However, despite the dedicated efforts of mycologists in recent years, our understanding of the gasteroid mycobiota in Paraguay remains fragmented and incomplete. This is primarily due to sporadic collection efforts that have been limited to only a few specific regions within the country.
Paraguay is divided into two distinct geographical regions, the eastern and western, separated by the Paraguay River. The western region, also known as the Chaco, encompasses three ecoregions: the Humid Chaco, Dry Chaco, and Pantanal. On the other hand, the ecoregions of eastern Paraguay consist of the Humid Chaco, Atlantic Forest, and Cerrado (Dinerstein et al., 1995).
This study represents a comprehensive revision of existing data and serves as an updated compilation of the records of gasteroid fungi species found in Paraguay.
This checklist has been compiled based on literature records of gasteroid fungi documented from Paraguay. The information extracted from the literature encompasses distribution records per department (Figure 1), notes regarding habitat and substrate, and comprehensive descriptions and observations of the basidiomata. The current taxonomic position is specified, as described in previous publications, along with a concise overview of the most notable characteristics of each species. The classification and nomenclature adhere to the Mycobank database (http://www.mycobank.org). Genera and species are arranged alphabetically (Table 1), with the authorities for the binomials, as well as the author names and spellings, in accordance with the Robert et al. (2005) database.
The research documented a total of 40 gasteroid fungi species in Paraguay, spanning across 16 genera and four families. The predominant family was Agaricaceae, boasting 14 species (39%), closely followed by Phallaceae and Geastraceae, each with 10 species (28%). Among the genera, Geastrum stood out with the highest species count at nine taxa (25%). The Central department, situated in the humid Chaco ecoregion, held the highest number of records at 19 (47.5%), while the Paraguarí department, representing the transition ecoregion between humid Chaco and Atlantic Forest, accounted for 15 records (37.5%). Notably, two gasteroid fungi species were documented in the Atlantic Forest ecoregion (5%), eight in the Pantanal ecoregion (20%), and two in the dry Chaco (5%).
It is challenging to determine the most prevalent species in Paraguay due to the limited sampling across various ecoregions. Previous studies by Dring (1973) and Miller & Miller (1988) have suggested the presence of around a hundred genera of gasteromycetes in the country. However, the current literature only documents 15 genera, indicating a significant gap in representing the diversity of this group in Paraguay.
The taxonomic classification of Agaricaceae Chevall. has been a subject of interest and debate among mycologists. This family of fungi, commonly known as the agaric mushrooms, encompasses a diverse group of species with varying morphological characteristics. The taxonomy of Agaricaceae has undergone several revisions over the years, with new molecular data playing a crucial role in elucidating the relationships among different genera and species within the family. Despite these advancements, there are still unresolved issues regarding the classification and phylogeny of Agaricaceae, highlighting the need for further research and analysis in this area. By studying the evolutionary history and genetic relationships of agaric mushrooms, researchers aim to gain a better understanding of their biodiversity, ecological roles, and potential applications in various fields.
