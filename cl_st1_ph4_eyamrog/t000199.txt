Since the first quarter of 2020, the world has been facing the Coronavirus 
disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by the new SARS-Cov-2 
coronavirus.1 Despite the multiple procedures to prevent and control the spread 
of the disease that have been adopted for the general population, there are 
some groups that are more susceptible to the risk of contagion and that require 
specific care, such as total laryngectomy patients.2        

This population is mostly composed by immunosuppressed elderly 
individuals with multiple comorbidities, in which a permanent tracheostomy 
allows the flow of unfiltered and humidified airflow directly into the lower 
airways, thus increasing the incidence of tracheobronchial infections3 and, as a 
result, exposing them to the contagious nature of SARS-Cov-2 through 
respiratory droplets and aerosolization.2 

A Heat and Moisture Exchange (HME) device is an option to mitigate the 
vulnerability of total laryngectomized patients to COVID-19. This device consists 
of a foam sponge impregnated with calcium chloride4 placed over an airtight 
seal around the tracheal stoma.5 These filters increase airflow resistance and 
also filter, heat and humidify the air, thus reducing the need to use external 
humidifiers and vaporizers and optimizing lung performance.6,7  In addition, as 
the HME reduces of cough, sputum production and expectoration, it minimizes 
the risk of viral transmission by aerosolizing tracheal secretions.2,5,8 

There are HME devices with specific bacterial and/or viral filters8 that 
have pores smaller than 0.6 microns and are able to retain some pathogens 
(bacteria and viruses), acting as a biological barrier against pulmonary 
infections9. This is especially important in the context of the COVID-19 
pandemic, as the SARS-Cov-2 particles have an estimated size of 0.12 
microns.10 

Although the effectiveness of heat and moisture exchangers in 
preventing COVID-19 has not yet been specifically tested, it is assumed that a 
HME device made of electrostatic filtering material, which has a higher 
percentage of viral filtration, would be the most suitable for use during the 
pandemic. 2,8,12 It should also be noted that the HME requires fixation 
accessories, such as disposable hypoallergenic adhesives 2 or specific silicone 
tracheostomy cannula.11 All of these elements together have a prohibitive cost 
to most of total laryngectomized patients in the Brazilian context of 
socioeconomic inequality. In addition, the lack of a national health care policy 
for total laryngectomized patients makes access to pulmonary protection 
supplies difficult at a time of pandemic. 

Some legal provisions support this population, such as the SAS/MS 
Ordinance No. 400, of 11/16/2019 12, which establishes national guidelines for 
the care of people with ostomy; Law No. 13,146, of 6/11/201513, which institutes 
the Statute for Persons with Disabilities; and, more recently, Resolution 
202/CIB/2019 14, as established by the Secretary of State for Health of Santa 
Catarina and published on 09/26/2019,  which was supported by the 
Associação de Câncer de Boca e Garganta (Mouth and Throat Cancer 
Association – ACBG, Brazil) to set the Guidelines for Health Care of 
Laryngectomized and/or Tracheostomized People and the standardization to 
distribute the necessary supplies for pulmonary and speech rehabilitation in that 
state, including HME devices. This is a pioneering initiative with a legal basis 
that should be followed as an example by other states of the federation. Given 
the difficulties in obtaining the supplies through administrative means, some 
users turn to the courts to ensure their supply. In 2019, for example, a user in 
Rio de Janeiro filed a demand against the state government and had his 
request granted, according to the magistrate's favorable understanding.15 

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both the need for specific 
management with total laryngectomy patients and the failure of public 
authorities to provide the necessary support to these users. The most 
recommended approach currently available for this population to ensure 
protection against aerosolization and inhalation of SARS-Cov-2 in the 
community environment, consists of three steps: 1) cover nose and mouth with 
surgical or tissue mask; 2) cover stoma with high collar clothing or scarf; 3) use 
HME with specific bacterial and/or viral filters.8 When access to HME is not 
viable, total laryngectomy patients should be instructed to strictly follow the 
other conducts. At the same time, this moment should also be used to give 
visibility to the needs and vulnerabilities of this group.
