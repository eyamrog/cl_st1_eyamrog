Abstract 25 SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), as well as SARS- 26 CoV from 2003 and MERS-CoV from 2012, is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus 27 of the Nidovirales order and is currently the cause of the pandemic called COVID-19 (or 28 Coronavirus disease 2019). COVID-19 is characterized by cough, fever, fatigue, and 29 severe cases of pneumonia and has affected more than 9.1 million people worldwide until 30 June 22nd, 2020. Here we present a review of the cellular mechanisms associated with 31 human coronaviruses replication, including the unique molecular events related to the 32 replication transcription complex (RTC) of coronaviruses. Information regarding the 33 interactions between each viral protein and cellular proteins is presented, associating to 34 known host-pathogen implications for the coronavirus biology. Finally, a specific topic 35 addresses the current attempts for pharmacological interventions against COVID-19, 36 highlighting the possible effects of each drug on the molecular events of viral replication. 37 This review intends to contribute to future studies for a better understanding of the SARS- 38 CoV-2 replication cycle and the development of pharmacological approaches targeting 39 COVID-19. 40

1. Introduction 51 In 2002 and 2003, the first coronavirus outbreak started in Guangdong province 52 in China, causing a total of 8,098 cases and 774 deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate 53 of around 9% (Fehr and Perlman 2015). This outbreak was responsible for causing Severe 54 Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS. In 2012, another outbreak started in the middle- 55 east, called MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), with an initial mortality rate of 56 close to 50%, getting controlled in the following years. In 2014, a total of 855 cases and 57 333 deaths were reported by the MERS-CoV, with a 40% mortality rate, according to the 58 European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (Fehr and Perlman 2015). Before 59 these two outbreaks, coronaviruses were believed to cause only self-limiting mild 60 respiratory tract infections in humans. 61 In December 2019, a group of patients from the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, 62 China, was initially diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown etiology and 63 epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wildlife market in the city (Rothan and 64 Byrareddy 2020). Afterward, reports predicted the appearance of a potential coronavirus 65 outbreak, given the reproduction number for the new 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID- 66 19, as named by WHO on 11 February 2020) significantly greater than 1, estimated 67 between intervals of 2.24 to 3.58 (Zhao et al. 2020). Since then, until June 22nd, 2020, 68 the number of infected people has reached 9,154,232 cases and 473,849 deaths worldwide 69 (Coronavirus Resource Center, John Hopkins University). 70 Symptoms of COVID-19 infection appear after an incubation period of 71 approximately 5.2 days. The period between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and death 72 has a median of 14 days, varying from 6 to 41 days. The most common symptoms at the 73 beginning of COVID-19 disease are cough, fever, and fatigue, in some cases including 74 sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, diarrhea, dyspnoea, and lymphopenia (Rothan 75 and Byrareddy 2020). 76 2. Taxonomy and genomic organization of coronaviruses 77 The Coronaviridae family is part of the Nidovirales order and can be divided into 78 2 subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The Coronavirinae subfamily has 4 79 genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 (also called 2019- 80 nCoV) is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and together with SARS-CoV and 81 4
MERS-CoV, are part of the genus Betacoronavirus. A study showed that SARS-CoV-2 82 is more similar (88% identity) to two SARS-like coronaviruses derived from bats (bat- 83 SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21), collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, 84 than with SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%) (Lu et al. 2020). 85 Another study has shown that SARS-CoV-2 genome is 91.02% identical to Pangolin- 86 CoV, despite a higher identity of 96.2% between SARS-CoV-2 and another bat 87 coronavirus (RaTG13) (Zhang et al. 2020c). The coronaviruses genome is composed of 88 a single-stranded positive RNA (ssRNA+), therefore included in class IV of the Baltimore 89 classification (Baltimore 1971). The genomic organization of coronaviruses can be 90 divided into two main parts, the genes encoding the non-structural poly-proteins pp1a and 91 pp1b and the genes encoding the structural genes, including the S, E, M and N genes, as 92 shown in figure 1. 93 3. The replication and the non-structural proteins (nsps) of 94 coronaviruses 95 The replication of SARS-CoV-2 begins with the translation of the pp1a and pp1b 96 polyproteins from the single-stranded positive polarity genomic RNA (ssRNA+), which 97 is 5’-capped and 3’-polyadenylated (figure 1). The pp1b polyprotein is produced in fusion 98 with pp1a, through a -1 frameshift mechanism, generating 2 polyproteins, called pp1a 99 (without frameshift) and pp1ab (with frameshift) (Brierley et al. 1989). The frameshift 100 occurs due to a slippery sequence in the genome (5’-UUUAAAC-3’) and a pseudoknot 101 structure in the secondary structure of the RNA before the STOP codon of pp1a ORF, 102 causing a pause in the ribosome reading and the translation of pp1b ORF in fusion with 103 pp1a ORF, thus generating pp1ab (Fehr and Perlman 2015). 104 Once produced, the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins undergo proteolytic cleavage, 105 forming a total of 16 proteins, detailed in table 1 and outlined in figure 1. The cleavage is 106 made by 2 proteases, nsp3 which is a Papain-like protease (PLpro) and nsp5 which is a 107 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Nsp3 cleaves the sites between nsp2 to nsp4, generating, 108 therefore, nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3. On the other hand, nsp5 cleaves the other sites generating 109 the other non-structural proteins (Ziebuhr et al. 2000; Báez-Santos et al. 2015). 110 Table 1.

123 Figure 1. Molecular mechanisms related to the production of non-structural 124 proteins (nsps) and assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription 125 complex (RTC). Process 1: after recognition of the ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting 126 Enzyme 2) cell receptor, the viral nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm by 127 endocytosis or fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. Process 2: the 128 7
translation of the pp1a and pp1b genes from the 5’-capped and 3’-polyadenylated 129 genomes (+) of the virus produces the pp1a or pp1ab polyproteins, the latter being 130 generated by a -1 frameshift of ribosomes. These polyproteins are then cleaved by viral 131 proteases generating 16 virus nonstructural proteins (nsps), of which some are used to 132 assemble the RTC, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or nsp12). 133 Pharmacological interventions targeting specific points of the replication cycle of 134 coronaviruses are highlighted. RTC: Replication and transcription complex; RdRp: RNA- 135 dependent RNA polymerase. 136 The next processes of coronavirus replication and transcription are outlined in 137 figure 2 below. Once produced and processed, part of the non-structural proteins together 138 with nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), assemble the Replication and 139 Transcription Complex (RTC). RTC acts primarily by producing a set of single-stranded 140 negative RNAs (ssRNA-), including copies of the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, 141 which will then serve as templates for the production of the genome and mRNA, 142 respectively. These intermediate negative RNA molecules are about 1% as abundant as 143 their respective positive counterparts and contain anti-leader sequences, present in the 5’ 144 untranslated region (UTR) of the antigenome and in the 3’-UTR of the genome (Sethna 145 et al. 1991). On the other hand, in the 5’-UTR of the viral genome and 3'-UTR of the 146 antigenome there are leader sequences. The leader and anti-leader sequences are used by 147 the RTC to initiate replication and transcription. In the 5’-UTR of the genome and at the 148 beginning of each ORF of the structural genes there are other regulatory regions, called 149 Transcriptional Regulatory Sequences (TRS), as shown in figures 1 and 2. During the 150 transcription of ssRNA molecules, two mechanisms may happen, according to the 151 currently established model of replication of coronaviruses (Pasternak et al. 2006; 152 Sawicki et al. 2007): 153 1) The RTC, after binding to the 3’ anti-leader sequence of the viral genome, 154 initiates the synthesis of negative RNA throughout the molecule until it finds the leader 155 region in the 5’ end, generating a complete copy of negative polarity of the genome, called 156 antigenome. This antigenome will serve as a template for the synthesis of the genome (+) 157 (figure 2, processes 1a and 1b). 158 2) The RTC may, however, temporarily pause the transcription in each of the 159 TRS regions of each ORF and continue in the 5’-UTR of the genome, given the 160 complementarity of the TRS regions. Therefore, a leader region is incorporated in each 161 RNA, generating subgenomic RNAs of negative polarity. These subgenomic RNAs will 162 8
serve as a template for mRNA (+) synthesis, containing their 3’ regions co-terminal to 163 the genomic RNA (figure 2, processes 2a and 2b). This process is often called “copy- 164 choice” mechanism and is presented in other viruses, allowing recombination, as it will 165 be discussed later (Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011). 166

Figure 2. Molecular events related to the expression of structural proteins, 184 replication of the genome, and assembly of the SARS-CoV-2. Processes 1a and 1b: the 185 synthesis of RNA (-) by RTC, initiated in the 3’ anti-leader sequence of the genome (+), 186 may occur continuously, generating a complete copy of the genome called antigenome (- 187 ). The antigenome is then used by RTC to produce multiple copies of the genome (+). 188 Processes 2a and 2b: RNA synthesis by RTC may, however, be temporarily interrupted 189 when a TRS is copied. The newly synthesized RNA (-) is then transferred to the 5’ end 190 of the genome, where the complementarity of sequences allows the RNA (-) synthesis to 191 continue in the leader TRS, merging the sequences between body and leader TRSs. In 192 turn, these subgenomic chimeric RNAs (-) serve as templates for the continuous synthesis 193 of subgenomic mRNAs (+). Process 3: the structural S, E, M, and N proteins are then 194 translated from the 3’-co-lateral subgenomic mRNAs (+), where S, E, and M proteins are 195 produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Process 4: the N protein produced in the 196 cytosol interacts with the viral genome (+), forming the nucleocapsid. Process 5: 197 membrane proteins S, M, and E then interact with viral nucleocapsids to form virions in 198 the ERGIC. Process 6: finally, the virions are externalized from the cell by exocytosis via 199 the Golgi pathway. TRS: Transcriptional Regulatory Sequences; ER: endoplasmic 200 reticulum; RTC: Replication Transcription Complex. ERGIC: Endoplasmic Reticulum - 201 Golgi Intermediate Compartment. 202 Once the complete genomic RNA and mRNAs of each structural ORFs are 203 produced, the translation of these genes begins to occur (figure 2, process 3), generating 204 the S, E, M and N proteins, which are essential for the assembly of the viral particles, 205 among others (ORFs 3a, 6, 7a / b, 8 and 9). The specific functions of these proteins will 206 be described later. The viral replication cycle then continues through the interaction of 207 the N protein with viral genomic RNA, forming the nucleocapsid in the cytosol (figure 2, 208 process 4). On the other hand, the production of S, E, and M proteins are directed to the 209 rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) (Fehr and Perlman 2015). Finally, interactions 210 mediated between these structural proteins culminate in the recruitment of nucleocapsids 211 into the compartment between RER and the Golgi apparatus called ERGIC (Endoplasmic 212 Reticulum - Golgi Intermediate Compartment) and finally in the exocytosis of the viral 213 particles (figure 2, processes 5 and 6) (Fehr and Perlman 2015). 214 An important feature related to the replication of coronaviruses is the high rates 215 of mutation and recombination, altering viral protein properties, host range, and 216 pathogenicity. For example, the heterologous recombination between subgroup A 217 Betacoronavirus and other virus is reported, since some of these coronaviruses have the 218 hemagglutinin esterase gene, derived from influenza C virus (Zeng et al. 2008). The 219 recombination between coronaviruses targeting different species is also largely reported 220 and may explain the similarity between the genome sequence of human SARS-CoV-2 221 10
and bat and pangolin coronaviruses (Lu et al. 2020; Lau et al. 2020). Three aspects may 222 explain this increased capacity for recombination/mutation: 223 1) the RdRp of coronaviruses has low fidelity. Although a 3’-5’ exonuclease 224 proofreading activity is reported, the mutation rate of this polymerase is about 2.0 × 10-6 225 mutations per site, per replication cycle (Eckerle et al. 2010); 226 2) the unique RNA replication mechanism using the TRS motifs, known as the 227 “copy-choice” mechanism, may induce homologous RNA recombination between genes 228 of different coronaviruses (Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011); 229 3) Coronaviruses have the largest genome (26–32 kb) among RNA viruses 230 (Terada et al. 2014). 231 Several studies have shown the modulation of cellular pathways by coronavirus 232 proteins, favoring the viral cycle or impacting the viral pathogenesis, which is 233 summarized in table 2. Among these studies, interactions were found between the 234 coronavirus nsp1 protein with the cyclophilins PPIA, PPIG, PPIH, and FKBP1A, 235 FKBP1B, which are capable of modulating the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway, which plays 236 an important role in the activation of immune cells (Pfefferle et al. 2011). The same study, 237 which used the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate those interactions, showed that 238 the inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of 239 different CoVs, including the human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, CoV-229E and -NL-63, 240 the feline CoV and the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Another study has 241 demonstrated the interaction between the SARS-CoV nsp2 and cellular prohibitins, 242 suggesting that this nsp may be involved in the disruption of intracellular host signaling 243 (Cornillez-Ty et al. 2009). 244 Table 2.

247 The PLpro protein (nsp3) from SARS-CoV significantly triggered the activation of 248 the TGF-β1 promoter through ROS/p38-MAPK/STAT3, correlating with the positive 249 regulation of pro-fibrotic responses in vitro and in vivo (Li et al. 2016). Another study 250 showed that p53 downregulates SARS-CoV replication and is a target of nsp3 via an E3 251 ubiquitin ligase (Ma-Lauer et al. 2016). The other viral protease, 3CLpro (nsp5), was 252 proven to cleave STAT2, but not JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, and IRF9, which are key 253 molecules of the JAK-STAT pathway, antagonizing the type I interferon signaling (Zhu 254 et al. 2017). 255 Coronaviruses nsp6 is known to interfere with autophagy, limiting the 256 autophagosomes diameter at the point of omegasome formation, which may favor viral 257 infection by compromising the ability of the autophagy system to degrade viral 258 components via lysosomes (Cottam et al. 2014). Another study reported that the 259 coronavirus endoribonuclease nsp15 is required for evasion of dsRNA sensors and 260 apoptosis since the loss of nsp15 activity is related to attenuation of the disease in mice 261 and stimulated a protective immune response (Deng et al. 2017). Nsp16 can downregulate 262 the activities of RIG-I and MDA5, inhibiting innate immunity to promote viral 263 proliferation (Shi et al. 2019). 264 Finally, an important study recently showed cellular pathways related to the 265 coronaviruses RTC, using MHV (mouse hepatitis virus) as a model (V’kovski et al. 266 2019). The study identified that RTC interacts with translation initiation factors, which 267 may not persist throughout the replication cycle but may be of transitory importance 268 during specific phases of the replication cycle. In addition, the knockdown of some of 269 these factors, such as eIF3E, eIF3F, and eIF3I, impacted in the MHV replication. Proteins 270 related to transport and intracellular organization were also related to RTC in this study. 271 4. The structural proteins of coronaviruses 272 4.1. The S protein 273 14
Among all the structural proteins of coronaviruses, S, E, M, and N proteins are 274 considered essential and their functions are described below. Homotrimers of S protein 275 form the spikes in the viral surface, which give the virion a crown or corona aspect and 276 the name of the family Coronaviridae, being responsible for binding to host receptors 277 (Beniac et al. 2006). S protein has about 150 kDa and contains an N-terminal signal 278 sequence that gives access to the endoplasmic reticulum (RER) for its synthesis, being 279 strongly N-terminal glycosylated. Trimeric S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein and 280 mediates host receptor binding (Bosch et al. 2003). A recent study showed that the 281 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well 282 as for SARS-CoV, being trimeric protein S its ligand (Yan et al. 2020). In addition, the 283 serine protease TMPRSS2, targeting ACE2, facilitates the cellular entry of SARS-CoV 284 and SARS-CoV-2 and a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, camostat mesylate, partially inhibits in vitro 285 SARS-CoV-2 infection (Hoffmann et al. 2020). 286 4.2. The E protein 287 E protein plays a role in the assembly and release of virions from cells, being 288 involved in viral pathogenesis (DeDiego et al. 2007). It is a small protein (~8–12 kDa) 289 and is found in small amounts within the virion. Protein E is a homopentameric 290 transmembrane protein, possessing an N-terminal ectodomain, a C-terminal endodomain, 291 and ion channel activity, and such activity in SARS-CoV is not necessary for viral 292 replication but has an impact on viral pathogenesis (Nieto-Torres et al. 2014). 293 Recombinant viruses without protein E are viable but attenuated, unlike other structural 294 proteins, although this effect is dependent on the virus type (DeDiego et al. 2007). 295 Interacts with M membrane protein in the budding compartment of the cell, located in the 296 ERGIC (Chen et al. 2009a). SARS-CoV E protein interacts with PALS1 protein (Protein 297 Associated with Lin-Seven 1) via the PDZ binding motif in its C-terminal domain and 298 delays the formation of tight junctions, altering epithelial morphogenesis (Teoh et al. 299 2010). Another study showed that palmitoylation of E protein is crucial for the assembly 300 of murine coronavirus (Boscarino et al. 2008). 301 4.3. The M protein 302 The M protein presents three transmembrane domains and is responsible for the 303 shape of virions, promoting the membrane curvature and binding to the nucleocapsid 304 15
(Neuman et al. 2011). It is the most abundant structural protein in the virion, having 305 approximately 25–30 kDa and presenting a small glycosylated ectodomain at the N- 306 terminal and a larger C-terminal endodomain that extends from 6 to 8 nm in the viral 307 particle (Nal et al. 2005). M protein forms a dimer in the virion and can adopt two 308 different conformations, interacting with nucleocapsid N protein and S protein (Neuman 309 et al. 2011). The interaction with the nucleocapsid N protein promotes the complete 310 assembly of the virion and was mapped to occur between the C-terminal of the M protein 311 endodomain and the N protein CTD (Hurst et al. 2005). As already reported, its 312 interaction with protein E has also been demonstrated (Chen et al. 2009a). M protein 313 directs most of the protein-protein interactions necessary for the assembly of 314 coronaviruses. A study showed that the expression of M protein alone is not sufficient for 315 the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) (Bos et al. 1996). However, when M protein 316 was expressed together with E protein, the formation of VLPs occurred, suggesting the 317 important role of the two proteins in producing the envelopes of coronaviruses. A study 318 showed that the surface proteins of coronaviruses S, M, and E show differential 319 subcellular locations when expressed alone, suggesting that additional cellular or viral 320 factors may be necessary for coordinated traffic to the viral assembly site in the ERGIC 321 (Nal et al. 2005). 322 4.4. The N protein 323 N protein is the only viral nucleocapsid protein and contains two domains. The 324 two structural domains of N protein, the N-terminal RNA binding domain (RBD) 325 (residues 45-181) and the C-terminal dimerization domain (DD) (residues 248-365), do 326 not interact with each other and are surrounded by flexible linkers (Chang et al. 2006). It 327 is reported that N protein can bind to nsp3 to assist the binding of the viral genome to the 328 RTC and the packaging of the encapsidated genome in virions (Hurst et al. 2009; Chen et 329 al. 2020b). The interaction between N and nsp3 supports a model in which this interaction 330 tethers the genome to newly translated RTCs at an early stage of infection (Hurst et al. 331 2013). Besides, one of the N protein domains is critical for the recognition of the M 332 protein during virus assembly in cells. The interaction of N protein and viral nucleocapsid 333 with the membrane proteins S, E, and M for viral packaging takes place in the ERGIC, 334 forming the mature virions that are then extruded from the cells by exocytosis via Golgi 335 (de Haan and Rottier 2005). The expression of N protein increases the formation of VLPs, 336 16
suggesting that the fusion of encapsidated genomes in the ERGIC improves viral 337 envelope formation (Siu et al. 2008). 338 Regarding cellular interactions, several targets of N protein have been proposed. 339 A study has shown that coronavirus N protein is a viral suppressor of RNA silencing 340 (VSR) since the ectopic expression of SARS-CoV N protein could promote MHV-A59 341 coronavirus replication in RNAi-active cells but not in RNAi-depleted cells (Cui et al. 342 2015). Besides, a proteomics study has demonstrated interactions between the 343 coronavirus N protein and several cellular components, including ribosomal proteins, 344 translation initiation factors, nucleolar proteins, helicases, and hnRNPs (Emmott et al. 345 2013). Some of those interactions, like NONO and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), were 346 potentially mediated by RNA and the interactions with caprin-1, G3BP-1, and G3BP-2, 347 which are involved in the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules, explain the 348 localization of N protein in these cell structures. The interaction between N protein and 349 NCL is a possible explanation of how coronavirus N proteins can localize to the nucleolus 350 of cells (Chen et al. 2002). Finally, the impact of some cellular targets for viral replication 351 was evaluated by RNA-interference depletion, demonstrating the functional importance 352 of NCL, RPL19, or GSK3 proteins in the biology of coronavirus (Emmott et al. 2013). 353 5. Other ORFs of coronaviruses 354 Besides pp1ab, S, E, M, and N proteins, SARS-CoV-2 present at least 5 more 355 ORFs, called ORF3a, ORF6a, ORF7a/7b, ORF8, and ORF10, which much less 356 information is known regarding their molecular mechanisms of action in the viral 357 replication cycle. SARS-CoV ORF3a is reported to bind to TRAF3 and ASC, promoting 358 TRAF3 ubiquitination and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Siu et al. 2019). 359 Other studies have demonstrated that ORF3a presents binding affinities for caveolin-1 360 and calcium (Padhan et al. 2007; Minakshi et al. 2014). SARS-CoV ORF6 is localized in 361 the ER and Golgi membranes in infected cells, binding to karyopherin alpha 2 and 362 karyopherin beta 1 proteins and hindering STAT1 nuclear import and its function 363 (Frieman et al. 2007). Another study showed that nsp8 interacts with ORF6, suggesting 364 that ORF6 protein plays a role in virus replication (Kumar et al. 2007). 365 Coronavirus ORF7a has been recognized as a type I IFN antagonist only when in 366 the presence of ORF3 protein, protecting the virus from the antiviral state induced by this 367 17
cytokine (Dedeurwaerder et al. 2014). ORF7a protein also binds to BST-2 (Bone marrow 368 stromal antigen 2 or tetherin), an antiviral protein that restricts SARS-CoV infection, 369 blocking its glycosylation, whereas the loss of ORF7a leads to a much greater restriction 370 (Taylor et al. 2015). ORF7a expression has been also associated with cell cycle arrest at 371 the G0/G1 phase in HEK 293 cells via the cyclin D3/pRb pathway (Yuan et al. 2006). 372 Another study has found that the translation of SARS-CoV ORF7b may be mediated by 373 leaky scanning of ribosomes and that it localizes in the Golgi compartment and is 374 incorporated into viral particles (Schaecher et al. 2007). Finally, a study has demonstrated 375 that SARS-CoV ORF8 may have originated through recombination from SARS-related 376 coronavirus from bats, which may have an impact on animal-to-human transmission (Lau 377 et al. 2015). 378 6. Analysis of cellular pathways related to coronavirus replication 379 To further analyze the cellular proteins related to coronaviruses biology, we 380 performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, using the list of proteins presented in table 2. 381 This allowed the generation of a canonical pathways list, presented in table 3, that may 382 be important or modulated during the replication cycle of coronaviruses. The top 10 383 pathways were selected based on their associated p-value. The modulation of key 384 molecular players, such as p53 and mTOR pathways, the inhibition of the host immune 385 response by restraint of IFN induction and changes in cell cycle and cell growth, has been 386 highly associated with the proteins of coronaviruses. These events may create a 387 proliferative state that favors viral replication and inhibits apoptosis, facilitating viral 388 cycle progression. 389 Table 3. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) reveals the top 10 canonical pathways 390 related to the cellular proteins that interact with coronavirus proteins, as 391 summarized in Table 2. 392

397 6.1. Immune system pathways 398
399 SARS-CoV infects poorly monocytes/macrophages, even though viral proteins 400 are expressed, replication is incomplete in these cell types, that respond secreting low 401 levels of IFN-β and high levels of chemokines like IP-10 and MCP-1 and may be part of 402 the inflammatory response that participates in the pathogenesis of the disease (Cheung et 403 al. 2005); dendritic cells infected by SARS-CoV induce low levels of IFN-α, IFN- β, IFN- 404 γ, IL12p40, moderate levels of TNF- α and IL-6 and high levels of MIP-1A, IP-10, and 405 MCP-1 (Law et al. 2005). SARS-CoV shows a delayed induction of IFN- α (Spiegel 406 19
2006). Comparison of SARS-CoV with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) and Newcastle 407 virus indicates that SARS-CoV induces lower levels of IFN-α, β, and γ, independently of 408 viral replication. Differently from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is able to establish a 409 productive infection in human macrophages and induce higher levels of IL-12, IFN- γ, 410 IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, RANTES, and IL-8 (Zhou et al. 2014). 411 The low activation of IFN pathway is mediated by viral regulation of IRF3, a 412 transcription factor activated by phosphorylation or polyubiquitination, and then 413 translocates to the nucleus and induces the IFN response genes (Chattopadhyay et al. 414 2016). The SARS-CoV PLpro inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation, preventing its nuclear 415 translocation and disrupting IFN response, probably through inhibition of STING 416 (stimulator of interferon genes), that is responsible for IRF3 phosphorylation (Chen et al. 417 2014). Nsp3 DUB domain of MHV-A59 and SARS-CoV promotes deubiquitination of 418 IRF3 and also prevents its activation, blocking NF-κBsignaling (Frieman et al. 2009). 419 PLpro of MERS-CoV has also been described to inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation (Yang 420 et al. 2014). Interferon inhibition makes PLpro an important determinator of virulence of 421 coronavirus (Niemeyer et al. 2018). SARS-CoV Nsp1 protein also participates in IFN 422 inhibition through decreasing STAT1 phosphorylation (Wathelet et al. 2007). While 423 ORF3a protein induces ER stress, activates PERK (PKR-like ER Kinase), and promotes 424 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IFNAR1, attenuating interferon 425 response (Minakshi et al. 2009). The SARS-CoV N protein has also been described to 426 inhibit IFN production at an early step, by sequestering PACT (protein activator of the 427 dsRNA activated protein kinase R) and TRIM25 (tripartite motif protein 25), which bind 428 to RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducer gene I) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation gene 5) and 429 activate IFN production (Ding et al. 2017). Finally, ORF4b of MERS-CoV is another 430 protein that has been characterized to inhibit IFN and NF-κB signaling (Matthews et al. 431 2014). 432 STAT3 modulation plays an important role in pro- and anti-inflammatory 433 responses. As already mentioned, SARS-CoV PLpro activates TGF-β1 through 434 p38MAPK/ERK1-2 pathway, promoting STAT3 activation (Li et al. 2016). MERS-CoV 435 strains with mutations in the NSP3 and ORF4a display differential STAT3 activation and 436 different inflammatory cytokines profiles (Selinger et al. 2014). In SARS-CoV infection 437 it is observed a reduction of IL-4, which participates in humoral protection, an increase 438 of IFN- γ, that participates in a potent cell-mediated immune response and also the 439 elevation of IL-10, that plays a part in disease susceptibility (Zhu 2004). 440 20

441 6.2. Cell cycle pathways 442
443 SARS-CoV has also been described to arrest the cell cycle. Nucleocapsid protein 444 was shown to arrest cell cycle at S phase, through direct interaction with cyclin D and 445 inhibition of the CDK4/Cyclin D complex, preventing phosphorylation of Rb 446 (Retinoblastoma) protein, a central player in cell cycle control (Surjit et al. 2006). IBV 447 infection also reduces Cyclin D1, which participates in G2/M transition, inducing cell 448 cycle arrest at G2/M (Harrison et al. 2007). 449 The blockage of G0/G1 progression has been observed by SARS-CoV ORF7a and 450 ORF3a proteins through the reduction of cyclin D3 expression, decreased activity of 451 cyclin D/CDK4/6, and inhibition of Rb phosphorylation (Yuan et al. 2006). Nsp15 is able 452 to alter cellular localization of Rb and function, promoting pRb ubiquitination and 453 degradation, increasing the proportion of S-phase cells, while overexpression of ORF4 454 (3b) protein arrests cell cycle at G0/G1 and promotes apoptosis (Yuan et al. 2005; 455 Bhardwaj et al. 2012). 456 Expression of viral proteins regulates cell fate, not only cell cycle, but also 457 controls apoptosis, since its importance for viral replication. SARS-CoV S protein 458 suppresses extrinsic apoptotic pathway, downregulating TRAIL and FasL, and activates 459 of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, through upregulation of Bax and down-regulation of 460 Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and MDM2, leading to increased levels of p53 and p21 induction 461 and G1/S arrest (Yeung et al. 2008). ORF9b protein when accumulated in the nucleus 462 induces caspase 3-mediated apoptosis (Sharma et al. 2011). Inhibition of apoptosis is also 463 mediated by SARS-CoV E protein, which down-regulates IRE-1 (inositol-requiring 464 enzyme-1) and DUSP1/10 proteins, critical regulators of innate immune response and 465 apoptosis (DeDiego et al. 2011). SUD domain of PLpro interacts with RCHY1 and 466 promotes p53 degradation, playing a role in cell cycle and apoptosis control, whereas p53 467 overexpression was able to inhibit viral replication (Ma-Lauer et al. 2016). SARS-CoV 468 promotes the expression of a truncated form of p53, that inhibits apoptosis mediated by 469 wild-type p53 (Leong et al. 2005). This is supported by the observation that the Porcine 470 epidemic diarrhea vírus (PEDV) production is increased in p53 knockout cells (Hao et al. 471 2019). 472
473 6.3. Protein synthesis control pathways 474 21

475 Protein synthesis pathways are often modulated by viruses. The activation of the 476 PKR pathway by RNA viruses is an important cellular defense mechanism, which is in 477 several cases counteracted by viruses, including coronaviruses. Dengue virus for example 478 sustains activation of the cap-dependent machinery at early stages of infection, switching 479 the protein synthesis to a cap-independent process in the late stages by downregulation of 480 p70-S6K, 4E-BP1 and eIF4 factors (Villas-Bôas et al. 2009). The SARS-CoV ORF3a is 481 known to cause endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of eIF2α (eukaryotic 482 initiation factor 2 alpha) and PERK, affecting innate immunity by suppression of type 1 483 IFN signaling (Minakshi et al. 2009). PKR and PERK, which promote phosphorylation 484 of EIF2a that may suppress host translation, are expressed at high levels during SARS- 485 CoV replication, although knockdown of PKR does not affect viral replication, 486 suggesting that SARS-CoV possesses a mechanism to overcome the inhibitory effects of 487 phosphorylated eIF2α on viral mRNA translation (Krähling et al. 2009). On the other 488 hand, another study has shown that depletion of the antiviral PKR pathway enhanced 489 virus replication, increasing SARS-CoV protein expression and virus production (de 490 Wilde et al. 2015). 491
Metformin and rapamycin are known modulators of viral infection and translation 492 control pathways, such as mTOR. It is reported for example that in the 1971 influenza 493 outbreak, diabetic patients treated with phenformin and buformin presented a lower 494 incidence of infection compared to diabetics treated with sulfonylureas or insulin (Lehrer 495 2020). The immunoregulation of COVID-19 with mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin 496 has been recently proposed (Zheng et al. 2020). 497 7. Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of diseases associated 498 with coronaviruses 499 Severe coronavirus infection leads to epithelial cell proliferation, macrophage 500 infiltration in the lung (Nicholls et al. 2003) and can cause pulmonary fibrosis, which can 501 still be present in recovered patients (Antonio et al. 2003). About 15% of COVID-19 502 patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe cases 503 should be treated in intensive care units (ICU) and receive oxygen therapy and mechanical 504 ventilation (Li et al. 2020). In extreme cases of COVID-19, lung transplantation is a viable 505 option (Chen et al. 2020a). The pharmacological interventions against coronaviruses, as 506 22
summarized in figure 1 and table 4, are reviewed regarding their molecular mechanisms 507 of action, effectiveness in vitro and in vivo, and ongoing clinical trials. There are two 508 important aspects in the clinical outcome of COVID-19: one is viral entry/replication and 509 the second is host response. Both are intimately linked and can be targeted by different 510 compounds. 511

7.1. Interventions on viral entry/replication 517
518
Strategies to hinder viral binding have been investigated. Human recombinant 519 ACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery in vitro and protected mice from acute lung injury 520 caused by SARS-CoV (Monteil et al. 2020). A chimeric protein composed of the 521 extracellular domain of ACE2 fused with the Fc region of IgG1 exhibited 522 pharmacological properties in mice (Lei et al. 2020). SARS-CoV-2 has two possible entry 523 mechanisms, through endosome or membrane fusion. Arbidol is a potent broad-spectrum 524 antiviral, that blocks viral envelope fusion (Teissier et al. 2011) and clathrin-mediated 525 endocytosis (Blaising et al. 2013), suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV in vitro 526 (Khamitov et al. 2008). Patients treated with Arbidol had a shorter period of SARS-CoV- 527 2 infection compared to patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (Zhu et al. 2020). 528 Several drugs have recently been used to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, 529 including the adenosine analog remdesivir, which targets the RNA dependent RNA 530 polymerase and is incorporated into viral RNA chains, resulting in premature termination. 531 Remdesivir was firstly shown to be effective against the Ebola virus (Warren et al. 2016) 532 but presents activity against other viruses, including members of the Filoviridae, 533 Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae families (Brown et al. 2019). 534 Remdesivir inhibits SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Sheahan et al. 2017), even though the 535 identity among the coronaviruses RdRps range from 70-90%, remdesivir shows a broad 536 spectrum of activity (Brown et al. 2019). Recently, a study showed that remdesivir also 537 acts against SARS-CoV-2, according to its potential antiviral mechanism as a nucleotide 538 analog (Wang et al. 2020b). Other nucleotide analogs, such as Ribavirin, Sofosbuvir, 539 Galidesivir, and Tenofovir, can bind to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (Elfiky 2020). Favipiravir, a 540 purine analog used against Influenza, is being tested against COVID-19 and reduced the 541 time for viral clearance compared to patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (Cai et al. 542 2020). There are currently ongoing clinical trials to evaluate Remdesivir and Ribavirin 543 against COVID-19, regardless of its cost and administration routes there are also concerns 544 regarding its side effects and efficacy (Khalili et al. 2020). 545 Furthermore, studies reported that the protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, 546 used as HIV antivirals, also appear to have effects against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 547 (Chu et al. 2004; Choy et al. 2020). Both drugs can interact with the protease 3CLpro; 548 ritonavir has a higher binding affinity compared with lopinavir (Nutho et al. 2020). 549 Animal experiments against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV showed that the combination 550 24
of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) with IFN-β significantly reduced viral load and improved 551 pulmonary function. The combination of LPV/r shows a synergistic effect in the treatment 552 of SARS patients (Yao et al. 2020). A clinical trial (NCT02845843) is currently testing a 553 combination of lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon-β1b against MERS (Arabi et al. 2020). 554 Combined LPV/r reduced the time for the patients to become negative for SARS-CoV-2 555 (Yao et al. 2020), and increased eosinophils, indicating an improvement in COVID-19 556 clinical outcome (Liu et al. 2020). Another study, however, reported no difference in the 557 administration of lopinavir and ritonavir in a group of patients with COVID-19 already 558 in an advanced stage (Cao et al. 2020), or shortening of the duration of SARS-CoV-2 559 shedding (Cheng et al. 2020). A retrospective analysis of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 560 from patients with COVID-19 admitted at the First Hospital of Changsha in China 561 revealed that about 64% of the observed ADRs were correlated with the use of LPV/r 562 (Sun et al. 2020). Patients treated with LPV/r presented a significantly higher proportion 563 of abnormal liver function (Fan et al. 2020). There are about 211 clinical trials ongoing, 564 considering these antivirals, using Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, in 565 combination, alone or with other drugs in SARS-CoV-2 patients (Cochrane COVID-19 566 Study register). 567 Chloroquine (CQ) has been tested as well against SARS-CoV. It promotes 568 alkalinization of acid vesicles in cells infected by intracellular pathogens (Rolain et al. 569 2007) and emerged as a substitute to quinine against malaria. CQ and hydroxychloroquine 570 (HCQ) have been tested against viral hepatitis (PAREJA‐CORONEL 1963), dengue virus 571 (Farias et al. 2015), HIV (Paton et al. 2002), other viruses, and also against other 572 pathogens, such as intracellular bacteria (Coxiela burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei), 573 bacteria-like Legionella pneumophila and Mycobacterium spp, and fungal infections by 574 Histoplasma capsulate and Cryptococcus neoformans (Rolain et al. 2007). CQ is active 575 in Vero E6 and Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV (De Wilde et al. 2014), but not in 576 dendritic cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (Cong et al. 2018). CQ is also active 577 in vitro against SARS-CoV either before or after virus exposure, interfering with ACE2 578 glycosylation and inhibiting viral binding (Keyaerts et al. 2004; Vincent et al. 2005). In 579 addition, CQ induces alteration of endosomal pH that inhibits viral infection (Simmons 580 et al. 2004). 581 Moreover, CQ and HCQ have shown some in vivo effects against SARS-CoV-2 582 (Wang et al. 2020b). A group of Chinese researchers recently reported beneficial effects 583 of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19, however, without yet publishing data (Gao 584 25
et al. 2020). Another group of French researchers reported that hydroxychloroquine 585 decreased SARS-CoV-2 levels in a small group of tested patients, and the administration 586 of azithromycin appears to improve such effects (Gautret et al. 2020). A recent review 587 analyzed several ongoing clinical trials and indicates there are paradoxical results, some 588 have shown beneficial results, others point to the toxicity issues (Sharma 2020). One 589 important point is that there are different strains of SARS-CoV-2 circulating (Wang et al. 590 2020a). Importantly, CQ has pro-apoptotic activity and the prophylactic use of CQ has 591 been linked to the selection of intracellular pathogen strains that promote cell resistance 592 to apoptosis and enhanced lethality, as observed for HIV and SARS-CoV (Parris 2004). 593 Despite being a low-cost drug, it is a consensus among health agencies such as the WHO 594 that further studies are needed for the clinical use of CQ and HCQ for COVID-19 595 treatment. Until now, 390 clinical trials are registered using HCQ or CQ to enlighten their 596 role in SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment (Cochrane COVID-19 Study register). 597
598 7.2. Interventions on host cell response 599
600 The host response to viral infection is another important factor in COVID-19. 601 SARS-CoV-2 induces secretion of IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, IP-10, and MCP-1 (Huang 602 et al. 2020). Patients in intensive care units show higher levels of IL-2, IL-7, GCSF, IP- 603 10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-α that may induce cytokine storm and exacerbated 604 inflammatory response (Huang et al. 2020). SARS-CoV infects not only alveolar 605 epithelial cells, but also vascular endothelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, and 606 lymphocytes. Rapid viral replication causes endothelial cell damage and vascular leakage, 607 leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Seroconversion of the host leads to 608 the presence of IgG anti-S protein, which may promote the accumulation of 609 proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage and release of MCP-1 and IL-8 and have been 610 linked to severe lung injury (Fu et al. 2020). Viral clearance depends on the activation of 611 both innate and adaptive immune responses. IFN-γ and IL-6 contribute to neutrophil 612 recruitment and transition to the adaptive response. However, exacerbated levels of IL-6 613 and reduced expression of IFN-γ may decrease CD4+, CD8+, and NK cells and may be 614 connected to cytokine storm (Lagunas‐Rangel and Chávez‐Valencia 2020). 615 Tocilizumab is a humanized anti-IL6R monoclonal antibody that prevents IL-6 616 signaling. Preprint studies indicate that it is safe and shows good efficiency against 617 COVID-19. As there is a need for more clinical trial data, it is suggested that it is used 618 26
only in critically ill patients with a profile of high levels of IL-6 (Zhang et al. 2020a). 619 Early clinical data recommends the use of repeated doses (Luo et al. 2020). Some of the 620 concerns that have been raised are about the development of osteonecrosis of the jaws 621 and the development of acute hypertriglyceridemia (Bennardo et al. 2020; Morrison et al. 622 2020). 623 Interferon release is one of the most important natural defense mechanisms against 624 viral infection. In vivo experiments showed that treatment with IFN-β1b reduced 625 pulmonary infiltrates, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, and viral load against MERS-CoV 626 (Chan et al. 2015). IFN-α, a mismatched double-stranded RNA Interferon inducer, and 627 the IFN inducer Ampligen, inhibited SARS-CoV replication in the lungs (Barnard et al. 628 2006). IFN-λ also showed activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, establishing an 629 antiviral state and presenting minimal systemic inflammation (Prokunina-Olsson et al. 630 2020). Antibodies against cytokines are presented in 88 studies, while 34 focus on IFN, 631 either by inhibiting them or by giving their recombinant form to treat patients (Cochrane 632 COVID-19 Study register). 633 CQ and HCQ have also shown anti-inflammatory activity and have been used in 634 inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (Sharma 2020). CQ and 635 HCQ intervene with lysosomal acidification, inhibiting antigen presentations, 636 phospholipase A2, Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), T and B cell receptors, and production 637 of cytokines, like IL-1 and IL-6 (Sinha and Balayla 2020). The inhibition of GSK3β by 638 CQ may also be responsible for its immunomodulatory activity against COVID-19 (Embi 639 et al. 2020). 640 Metronidazole is a redox-active prodrug that reduces the levels of pro- 641 inflammatory cytokines, increases circulating lymphocytes, and decreases ROS produced 642 by neutrophils and has also been suggested for the treatment of COVID-19 (Gharebaghi 643 et al. 2020). Another class of anti-inflammatory drugs is the Statins, and they have been 644 included in some treatment protocols. However, as Statins also modulate TLR response, 645 the use of Statins in animal experiments against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV resulted in 646 increased viral load, severe lung damage, and death (Dashti-Khavidaki and Khalili 2020). 647 Nitazoxanide is used against protozoan and helminthic infection. Tizoxanide, the active 648 form of nitazoxanide inhibits 16 strains of Influenza A and one strain of Influenza B, 649 rotavirus, HCV, Yellow fever virus, HBV, HIV, norovirus, and others (Rossignol 2014). 650 Nitazoxanide reduces the viral load from different coronaviruses (Cao et al. 2015) and 651 27
suppresses IL-6 production in mice (Hong et al. 2012), being suggested for COVID-19 652 treatment. 653 In viral RNA infections, the use of nutraceuticals has been suggested to inhibit 654 NOX2, which in turn, restores TLR7 response to single-stranded viral RNA infection and 655 induces IFN; nutraceuticals could also up-regulate mitochondrial antiviral-signaling 656 proteins (MAVS) and reduce pro-inflammatory signaling (McCarty and DiNicolantonio 657 2020). Besides nutraceuticals, Vitamins A and D, Selenium, Zinc, and probiotics may be 658 beneficial for COVID-19 patients, by enhancing immunity and preventing respiratory 659 infections (Grant et al. 2020; Jayawardena et al. 2020). Thus, the nutritional status of 660 COVID-19 patients may be of further interest in future therapies since it might have an 661 impact on disease development. 662 The clinical progression of COVID-19 indicates that the initial symptoms are due 663 to increased viral load and, in the following weeks of infection, seroconversion of IgG 664 reduces viral load at the same time that some patients present worsening of the symptoms 665 related to immunopathological damage (Peiris et al. 2003). Convalescent plasma (CP) has 666 been used for SARS, MERS, Ebola virus and Chikungunya virus disease to improve 667 survival rate (Alzoughool and Alanagreh 2020). Different groups have tested critically ill 668 COVID-19 patients with CP and obtained good recovery with no severe adverse effects 669 (Duan et al. 2020; Shi et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020b). FDA has approved CP to treat 670 critical patients (Tanne 2020), although it has the risk of aggravating hyperimmune 671 response, presenting a better response if administered in the early onset of the disease 672 (Zhao and He 2020). Key points to the use of CP are: establishing eligibility criteria of 673 donor COVID-19 convalescent patients, pre-screening tests of the donors, criteria for CP 674 collection, and treatment of plasma (Epstein and Burnouf 2020). Currently, CP is being 675 tested in 212 clinical trials worldwide against COVID-19 (Cochrane COVID-19 Study 676 register). 677
678 8. Conclusions 679 In summary, the cellular mechanisms associated with coronaviruses replication 680 form a complex and integrated network of molecular events, starting from the translation 681 of Nsps, proteolytic cleavage of polyproteins, assemble of RTC, transcription of 682 antigenome, genome and subgenomic RNAs, translation of structural proteins and finally 683 viral particles assembly and budding. The analysis of the cellular proteins related to 684 28
coronaviruses proteins reveals the modulation of key cellular pathways related to innate 685 immunity, cell cycle, and protein synthesis. The current therapeutic approaches for 686 COVID19 are partially related to these molecular events and pathways, but future 687 pharmacological interventions may take advantage of a better understanding regarding 688 the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2. 689
