Abstract
Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with suspected severe acute respiratory 
syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection at a cancer center.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective single-center study selected 91 patients who had chest CT and real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test collected at the same day. CT results were classified in negative, typical, indeterminate or atypical 
findings. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated for two different scenarios: in the first, only typical find-
ings on CT were considered positive; in the second, both typical and indeterminate findings were considered positive.
Results: Mean patients’ age was 58.2 years, most were male (60.4%) and had prior diagnosis of cancer (85.7%). CT showed typi-
cal findings in 28.6%, indeterminate findings in 24.2% and atypical findings in 26.4%. RT-PCR results were positive for SARS-CoV-2 
in 27.5%. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in the first and second scenarios were respectively 64.0%, 84.8% and 79.1%, 
and 92.0%, 62.1% and 70.3%.
Conclusion: CT has a high accuracy for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Different interpretation criteria can provide either 
high sensitivity or high specificity. CT should be integrated as a triage test in resource-constrained environments during the pan-
demic to assist in the optimization of PCR-tests, isolation beds and intensive care units.

Objetivo: Avaliar a acurácia da tomografia computadorizada (TC) de tórax em pacientes com suspeita de infecção por SARS-CoV-2 
em um centro oncológico.
Materiais e Métodos: Estudo retrospectivo e unicêntrico que selecionou 91 pacientes que realizaram TC de tórax e teste RT-PCR 
no mesmo dia. Os resultados da TC foram classificados em negativos, achados típicos, indeterminados ou atípicos. Acurácia 
diagnóstica, sensibilidade e especificidade foram calculadas para dois cenários: no primeiro, apenas TC com achados típicos foi 
considerada positiva; no segundo, achados típicos ou indeterminados foram considerados positivos.
Resultados: A média de idade dos pacientes foi de 58,2 anos, sendo a maioria homens (60,4%) e com história de câncer prévio 
(85,7%). TC demonstrou achados típicos em 28,6%, indeterminados em 24,2% e atípicos em 26,4%. Resultados da RT-PCR foram 
positivos para SARS-CoV-2 em 27,5%. Sensibilidade, especificidade e acurácia no primeiro e segundo cenários foram, respectiva-
mente, de 64,0%, 84,8% e 79,1%, e 92,0%, 62,1% e 70,3%.
Conclusão: A TC tem alta acurácia para o diagnóstico de infecção por SARS-CoV-2. Diferentes critérios de interpretação fornecem 
maior sensibilidade ou especificidade. A TC deve ser integrada como um teste de triagem em ambientes com recursos limitados du-
rante a pandemia, para ajudar na otimização da utilização de testes de PCR, leitos de isolamento e unidades de terapia intensiva.

lethality (1–3.5%). However, it is estimated that 15–20% of 
infected people can develop severe pneumonia and 5–10% 
may need intensive care. Elderly patients with comorbidi-
ties are at higher risk of death from the disease. The cur-
rent gold-standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-
CoV-2 infection is reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens(1,2).
INTRODUCTION
The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-
CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavi-
rus 2) has generated increasing demand for health services 
and there are still many uncertainties related to its manage-
ment. The disease caused by this virus (COVID-19, coro-
navirus disease-19) is highly transmissible, but with low

Several studies have demonstrated the imaging as-
pects of this disease, with an emphasis on high-resolution 
computed tomography (CT) of the chest(3–18). This method 
is not yet routinely recommended for screening or initial 
diagnosis of COVID-19, but it can be useful in assessing 
the severity of the disease, response to treatment, pres-
ence of complications and differential diagnoses(19). Few 
studies have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT 
in screening patients with suspected COVID-19(11,17,18). 
This analysis is important due to the presence of other en-
demic and seasonal viruses, especially in scenarios where 
there is little availability of the serological test (PCR) or 
delay in providing the results.
Cancer patients appear to have a higher risk of de-
veloping COVID-19 as well as a worse prognosis of the 
disease when compared to non-cancer patients(20). CT 
findings could be associated with a higher risk of devel-
oping severe events in cancer patients(21). These patients 
are also at increased risk for the development of other 
pulmonary complications related to the disease itself or 
its treatment, such as opportunistic infections, thrombo-
embolism, drug toxicity, actinic pneumonitis, among oth-
ers(22,23). These complications may represent differential 
diagnoses or be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 
cancer patients.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of 
chest CT in patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 
at a cancer center.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This retrospective, observational, single-center study 
was approved by the National Commission for Research 
Ethics and informed consent was waived. We selected all 
patients who had chest CT due to suspected SARS-CoV-2 
infection and RT-PCR test collected at the same day be-
tween February and March 2020 at a cancer center.
Clinical variables included age, gender, presence and 
type of neoplasia, time of onset of symptoms, signs and 
symptoms at admission and serological tests. Chest CT 
exams were reviewed by two experienced radiologists and 
imaging findings were classified, according to the consen-
sus statement on reporting chest CT findings related to 
COVID-19 issued by the Society of Thoracic Radiology, 
the American College of Radiology, and the Radiology So-
ciety of North America(24) in:
Typical – Multifocal ground-glass opacities with 
round morphology in a peripheral, posterior, and diffuse 
or lower lung zone distribution, with or without consolida-
tion, visible intralobar lines (“crazy paving”), halo sign and 
reversed halo sign (Figure 1).

positive for enterovirus. B: Typical findings of usual interstitial pneumonia in a patient with multiple myeloma.
Indeterminate – Nonspecific imaging features that 
do not match the typical features, such as ground-glass 
opacities with diffuse or central distribution, not rounded 
or unilateral (Figure 2).
Atypical – Isolated lobar or segmental consolidation 
without ground-glass opacities, discrete small nodules 
with centrilobular “tree-in-bud” distribution, cavitation, 
isolated pleural effusion, or mediastinal lymph node en-
largement (Figure 3).
Negative – No significant findings on chest CT.
Frequencies and percentages were used to describe 
categorical variables, and mean, median, interquartile 
range (IQR) and range were used to describe continuous 
variables. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, posi-
tive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value 
(NPV) were calculated for two different scenarios. In the 
first scenario, only chest CT with typical findings were 
considered positive, while in the second scenario, chest 
CT with typical or indeterminate findings were considered 
positive. The RT-PCR test was considered as the gold-
standard. Proportions were provided, along with binomial 
exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the “exact” 
Clopper-Pearson CIs for sensitivity and specificity, and 
the standard logit CIs for PPV and NPV(25). We compared 
sensitivity and specificity between both scenarios using 
the McNemar test(26). P values less than 0.05 were con-
sidered to represent statistically significant differences. 
All analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 
20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
RESULTS
From 136 chest CT exams performed due to clinical 
suspicion of COVID-19 in the study period, 91 patients 
(66.9%) had RT-PCR results available and were included in 
the study. Most patients were male (n = 55; 60.4%). Mean 
age was 58.2 years (median, 61 years; IQR, 51–68 years;

range, 19–88 years), including 47 (51.6%) patients with 
more than 60 years. Most common symptoms were cough 
reported by 55 patients (60.4%), fever in 34 (37.4%) and 
dyspnea in 36 (39.6%). The mean of referred symptoms du-
ration was 6.0 days (median, 5 days; IQR, 1–7 days; range, 
1–30 days), including 30 (33.0%) patients with 0–2 days, 
15 (16.5%) with 3–5 days and 18 (19.8%) with 6–7 days.
Most patients (n = 78; 85.7%) had prior diagnosis of 
cancer, being the most common hematologic malignan-
cies (n = 21; 23.1%), breast cancer (n = 13; 14.3%) and 
lung cancer (n = 8; 8.8%). At least, 25 patients (27.5%) 
were undergoing oncologic treatment (chemotherapy, im-
munotherapy or radiotherapy) in the moment of the exam. 
Other comorbidities were present in 17 patients (18.7%), 
the more common were cardiopathy and pneumopathy in 
6 cases (6.6%) each. 
Chest CT showed typical findings in 26 patients 
(28.6%), indeterminate findings in 22 (24.2%), atypical 
findings in 24 (26.4%) and was negative in 19 (20.9%). 
RT-PCR results were negative in 55 cases (60.4%), posi-
tive for SARS-CoV-2 in 25 (27.5%) and positive for other 
viruses in 11 (12.1%).
In the first scenario, considering only chest CT with 
typical findings as positive, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, 
NPV and accuracy were respectively 64.0%, 84.8%, 61.5%, 
86.2% and 79.1% (Table 1). In the second scenario, con-
sidering chest CT with typical or indeterminate findings 
as positive, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and ac-
curacy were respectively 92.0%, 62.1%, 47.9%, 95.3% and 
70.3% (Table 2). The sensitivity of chest CT was higher 
in the second scenario (92.0% vs. 64.0%; p = 0.016) and 
the specificity was higher in the first scenario (84.8% vs. 
62.1%; p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION
The results of the present study show that chest CT 
has a good performance for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 
infection patients at a cancer center. We classified the 
results of chest CT scans according to findings already 
described for the interpretation of studies in patients with 
suspected COVID-19. We studied two scenarios for the 
CT interpretation: in the first one, we considered positive 
for COVID-19 only chest CT with typical findings and, in 
the second one, we also considered positive the CTs with 
findings described as indeterminate. This information can 
be useful in a triage situation when CT scans are avail-
able but access to the RT-PCR test is limited, the results 
are time consuming and there is a shortage of hospital 
beds and isolation units. It is interesting to note that the 
first scenario showed high specificity, which gives confi-
dence to select patients with positive results as those who 
should benefit from investigative or intervention mea-
sures, because there will be few false-positive results. The 
second scenario showed high sensitivity, which provides 
confidence to select patients with negative CT results as 
those in which other investigative or intervention mea-
sures can be avoided or optimized, such as RT-PCR test, 
isolation and hospitalization, because false negative CT 
results are rare.
We therefore believe that our data add clinical evi-
dence that allow the CT triage recommendation, as an al-
ternative indication, in resource-constrained environment 
for patients with suspicion for COVID-19 infections. Re-
cently, a Fleishner Society statement suggested that chest 
CT could be indicated for medical triage of patients with 
suspected COVID-19 who present with moderate-severe 
clinical features and a high pre-test probability of disease, 
especially when rapid point-of-care COVID-19 tests are 
not available(19).
Prior studies found a high sensitivity (97%) and low 
to moderate specificity (25–56%), however they did not 
define the criteria used to classify chest CT findings as 
positive in that study(11,18). On the other hand, Bai et al. 
demonstrated that CT has a high specificity to differenti-
ate COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias, with mod-
erate sensitivity(17). These findings suggest that different 
criteria used to evaluate CT findings can achieve different 
diagnostic accuracy results.
It is also important to consider that the imaging 
findings also depends on when infected patients are im-
aged(8,12,16). More than half of patients with less than 
two days from the symptoms’ onset could have a negative 
CT(27). In our sample, 30 patients had CT scans performed 
less than two days from the symptoms’ onset and only two 
of them had false-negative results.
This study has some limitations related to the small 
sample size and short follow-up. RT-PCR test, which was 
used as gold-standard in this study, is believed to have high 
specificity but sensitivity of 60–70% to diagnose SARS-

CoV-2 infection(10,11). It is known that RT-PCR has poten-
tial vulnerabilities related to preanalytical issues such as 
inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport 
and storage of the swabs, as well as analytical problems, 
including testing outside the diagnostic window and other 
specific technical issues(28). Prior studies demonstrated 
that COVID-19 patients may show very early CT changes 
even before positive RT-PCR(11,29). Probably, the most ef-
ficient strategy for diagnosing COVID-19 in suspected 
patients should combine clinical and epidemiologic suspi-
cion with RT-PCR test and chest CT findings, and repeat-
ed RT-PCR should be collected in patients with initially 
negative results and high clinical and imaging likelihood 
of having COVID-19.
In conclusion, CT has a high diagnostic accuracy for 
the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should be in-
tegrated as a triage test in resource-constrained environ-
ments during the pandemic to assist in the optimization of 
PCR-tests, isolation beds and intensive care units.
