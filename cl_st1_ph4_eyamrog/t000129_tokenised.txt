Psychometric analyses including 11 sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, accuracy, and ROC curves were 12 used to test combinations of questions to determine the most effective screener to assess 13 households at risk for food insecurity when compared to a gold standard scale. Participants 14 included National Demographic Health Survey on Women and Children (PNDS-2006) 15 surveyed households with a valid Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale 16 (EBIA) response. The sample included 3,920 households representing 11,779,686 households 17 when expanded using PNDS sample weights. With overall prevalence of food insecurity at 18 21%, a Brazilian 2-item food-insecurity screen showed sensitivity of 79.31%, specificity of 19 92.95%, positive predictive value of 74.62%, negative predictive value of 94.50% and ROC 20 area 86.13%. This screen also presented high convergent validity for children’s nutrition and 21 health variables when compared with the gold standard, the EBIA full scale. Based on its ability 22 to detect households at risk for food insecurity, a 2-item screening tool is recommended for 23 widespread adoption as a screening measure throughout Brazil, especially when rapid decision- 24 making has been made fundamental, as under the COVID-19 pandemic. This screener can 25 enable providers to accurately identify families at risk for food insecurity and promptly 26 intervene to prevent or ameliorate adverse health and developmental consequences associated 27 with food insecurity and swiftly respond to crises. 28 Keywords 29 Screening tools, food insecurity, hunger, nutrition, child development 30 Introduction 31 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2156 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 2


In 2004, the Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale (EBIA) 1 was adapted 32 to Portuguese and validated using the United States Household Food Security Survey Module 33 (US-HFSSM) as model. Since then, EBIA has been included in some national health surveys 34 and a few smaller regional or local studies, capturing food insecurity information 35 intermittently. 36 Results from national datasets allow for population food-insecurity prevalence surveillance, 37 and its association with socioeconomic, demographic and health related variables generates 38 scientific evidence to inform public policies. Because national surveys are developed primarily 39 for generating national prevalence estimates, data collected from representative samples of the 40 national population are not meant to identify individual food-insecure households for 41 immediate intervention. To fill in this gap, data from regional or local surveys are considered, 42 however these studies are not always done systematically. 43 In 2010, Hager et al. 2 validated a screening tool to identify individual households with young 44 children at risk for food insecurity. The Hunger Vital Sign™ (HVS) is a 2-question food 45 insecurity screening instrument, derived from the US Household Food Security Survey Module 46 (HFSSM), showing high sensitivity, specificity, and convergent validity. The HVS measures 47 families’ concerns about access to food much the way health care providers check other key 48 vital signs, such as pulse and blood pressure. Healthcare and social service providers, 49 community-based outreach workers, teachers, and others who work with families with young 50 children can use the HVS to identify households that may be in immediate need of food 51 assistance. This tool has been recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics 3 for use 52 at all well-child visits, and in 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 53 incorporated the HVS into its Accountable Health Communities Screening Tool 4. In 2015, the 54 HVS was validated for use among youth and adolescents 5, and in 2017 it was validated for use 55 among adults 6 as well. Others have suggested use of the HVS within healthcare systems for 56 older adult populations 7, and it also has been translated to multiple languages 8. 57 The development and validation of a Brazilian 2-item screening tool based on the EBIA would 58 allow for identification of families currently at risk for food insecurity while also functioning 59 as a local or regional risk-monitoring tool. These capacities are especially useful during crises 60 such as the one posed by COVID-19, for targeting effective evaluation of health care and 61 nutrition interventions, following the Brazilian health services’ priorities. In addition, inclusion 62 of a 2-item screening tool for food insecurity in routine health center visits could strengthen 63 the Brazilian Food and Nutrition Surveillance System (SISVAN) by helping to identify 64 families living in food-insecure households in a timelier way. If a 2-item screening tool proves 65 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2156 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 3


as effective for the Brazilian population as it has been for the US, it will complement 66 national/regional data collected by the extended EBIA questionnaire in beneficial ways. By 67 generating individual/local data, a Brazilian “Hunger Vital Sign” could allow more timely 68 social policy solutions to reduce food insecurity while permanent changes in government- 69 supported social infrastructures are being designed and implemented. Thus, the aim of this 70 study was to develop a brief 2-item screening tool to identify Brazilian households that include 71 families with children at risk for food insecurity. 72 Methods 73 Gold Standard: EBIA at PNDS 74 The third edition of the National Survey on Demography and Health of Women and Children 75 (PNDS 2006/07) aimed to describe the health and nutrition of reproductive-age women (15-49 76 years old) and their children under 5 years of age. This survey also gathered data on social, 77 economic and cultural factors, including food insecurity at the household level using the 78 Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (EBIA). The PNDS 2006/07 used a complex probability 79 sampling design, with national representativeness with data collected in two stages; the primary 80 sampling unit was the census area and the secondary sampling unit the household. The sample 81 included only non-institutionalized private households, from ten independent sampling strata 82 obtained from the combination of five geographic regions and urban/rural areas within each. 83 Eligible households were selected at random, considering the number of census areas in each 84 region, and whether they were located in urban or rural areas. The survey methodology, 85 including sample design and selection, data collection procedures, data consistency, weighting 86 and expansion techniques for complex samples and ethical/human subjects’ aspects are 87 described elsewhere 9. 88 The PNDS 2006/07 used a modified EBIA, containing 16 questions, with question number five 89 (“In the last three months, did you or other adults in the household ever cut the size of your 90 meals or skip meals because there wasn’t enough money to buy food”) split into two parts (“In 91 the last three months, did you or other adults in the household ever cut the size of your meals 92 because there wasn’t enough money to buy food”, and “In the last three months, did you or 93 other adults in the household ever skip meals because there wasn’t enough money to buy 94 food”). For analysis purposes, as recommended by PNDS, these two questions were 95 recombined as a negative answer ("no") when both parts had negative responses, or "do not 96 know" to one part, and "no" to the other. For other response combinations the answer was 97 marked positively ("yes"). 98 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2156 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 4


The number of questions affirmed indicates the level of food security in a household, and is 99 the basis for classifying households in one of the four food security categories. In this version 100 of EBIA, the four food security categories for households with children under 18 years are: 101 Food Secure (0 questions affirmed); Mild Food Insecurity (1-5 questions affirmed); Moderate 102 Food Insecurity (6-10 questions affirmed); and Severe Food Insecurity (11-15 questions 103 affirmed) 10. All questions in the EBIA refer to the three months preceding the survey. 104 Prevalence estimates and inferential analyses were conducted using the food security status 105 variable dichotomized as households not considered at risk, including the Food Secure and 106 Mild Food Insecurity categories (Food Security) and households at risk, comprising Moderate 107 and Severe Food Insecurity categories (Food Insecurity). The Food Insecurity composite 108 category represents the greater severity of food scarcity in a household, wherein adults and 109 children could be experiencing hunger during the three months preceding the interview. When 110 responses were "do not know" to questions regarding conditions of access to food (1st to 4th 111 questions), the interview was terminated and that record was eliminated (n=17, corresponding 112 to 0.35% of sample). 113 Eligibility and selection criteria for the study sample 114 For this research, eligible children included those ≤59 months of age, living in the same house 115 as their mothers, with the EBIA filled correctly, totaling 4,800 children. Because the study unit 116 is the household, PNDS replicated EBIA answers for all individuals living in a particular 117 household. Therefore, it was necessary to select one child per household to avoid duplication 118 of sample unit representation in the data analysis. When a woman had more than one child 119 younger than five years, the younger child/children was/were dropped out of the sample and 120 the oldest child was retained (n=784). When there were two or more children under age five, 121 and they were children of different mothers residing in the same household, the younger 122 child/children was/were excluded (n=61). In addition, when there were twins in the household, 123 we retained in the sample only the twin who was born in better condition, using birth weight 124 as reference. We excluded the twin with the lower birth weight noted on the child's official 125 Brazilian health record card. If the card was unavailable, birth weight reported by the mother 126 was used. If neither of these was available, the younger twin was excluded (n=35) using the 127 variable stating the children’s order of birth. Selection criteria followed a rationale of 128 maintaining in the sample children who had lived longer under respective environmental 129 conditions. After exclusions, 3,920 children (one per household) were available for analysis 130 representing 11,779,686 households when expanded using PNDS sample weights. 131 Development of the 2-item Screening Tool 132 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2156 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 5


Seven steps were involved in development of the screen: calculation of sensitivity, specificity, 133 positive and negative predictive values (with ROC curves), accuracy and convergent validity. 134 Sensitivity identifies the screen’s ability to correctly identify food-insecure households 135 (minimizing false negatives), while specificity describes the screen’s ability to correctly 136 identify food-secure households (minimizing false positives). Positive predictive value shows 137 the percent of those identified by the screen as food insecure that are actually food insecure, 138 negative predictive value displays the percent of those not identified by the screen as food 139 insecure that are actually food secure. The area under a ROC curve exposes the screen test’s 140 ability to diagnose households with and without the food insecurity, and the accuracy reveals 141 the degree to which the screen correctly describes food insecurity. And the convergent validity 142 assesses the relationships between screening results and variables theoretically related to food 143 insecurity, such as socioeconomic, demographic and health variables. 144 Combinations of 1, 2, 3 and 4 questions were tested as possible screening tools using 145 contingency table procedures. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, 146 and accuracy were calculated and a Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC) was 147 plotted for each combination of candidate screening items. The combination of 2 questions that 148 exhibit the best sensitivity, specificity and convergent validity was selected as the screen. 149 Convergent Validity 150 Socioeconomic and child nutrition and health variables were used to test the convergent 151 validity of candidate screens. To test the hypothesis that children under five living in a moderate 152 or severe food-insecure household would have significantly worse health conditions when 153 compared to their food-secure peers, we performed Poisson regression analysis 11 in two 154 separate sets of analyses, one using the gold standard and the second using the 2-item screening 155 tool. Variables with p<0.20 in bivariate analyses with the food security predictor or the health 156 outcome variable were considered eligible for inclusion as potentially confounding variables 157 in the multivariate analysis. The final model contained only the strongest associated variables, 158 with p<0.05, using a backward stepwise elimination technique. Dependent, health outcome 159 variables were selected according to their association with food insecurity in a previous study 160 12. All models were adjusted for macro-region, urban-rural classification, living conditions, 161 economic status, cash transfer program participation, maternal education, marital status, 162 number of children in the household, child’s gender and age. These covariates were chosen on 163 the basis of theoretical and bivariate associations with both food insecurity and the outcomes. 164 Macro-region was dichotomized to contrast Brazilian development areas, with the North (N) 165 and Northeast (NE) identified as less-developed regions and Midwest (MW), Southeast (SE) 166 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2156 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 6


and South (S) as more-developed regions. Urban or rural household status was also included 167 as a covariate. Representing household’s economic status, the Brazilian Economic 168 Classification Criterion (CCEB) was used as an indicator of families’ purchasing power 13. A 169 dichotomized variable was used grouping household economic status in wealthier classes - 170 from A1 to C2, and less wealthy classes - D/E. A dichotomized Living Conditions variable was 171 considered “adequate” if the household contained all five of the following items: indoor 172 availability of water, water connected to a sewage system, shingle or concrete slab on house 173 roofs, brickwork walls and wooden floor, vinyl floor covering, ceramic tiles, cement or carpet 174 floor, otherwise the household Living Conditions were classified as “inadequate”. Cash 175 Transfer Program (CTP) participation was dichotomized to indicate whether a resident of the 176 household received at least one of the seven available social safety-net programs in 2006. 177 Maternal Education was dichotomized as “≤ eight years of study” or “more than eight years”. 178 This categorization of education attainment is equivalent to graduation from middle school or 179 not, respectively. The Marital Status variable followed PNDS criteria: when a woman was 180 formally married or was in a stable union, she was considered “having a partner”. If a woman 181 was single, widowed, separated, legally separated, or divorced, she was considered “without a 182 partner”. The Number of Children living in the same household was dichotomized as “1-2 183 children”, or “≥ 3 children”. 184 Dietary intake was obtained using the PNDS qualitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) 185 composed of 20 typical Brazilian foods. The frequency of children’s consumption of each food 186 was reported by the mother for the 7 days preceding the interview 14. For children aged 6 187 months to 5 years variables were coded as follows: four types of meat were chosen from the 188 FFQ to reflect the child’s consumption of meat (cow/pig, liver, chicken, and fish). A 189 dichotomous variable was created indicating that either a child had eaten meat at least one time 190 per day in the past seven days (coded as “at least 1x/day”), or a child had eaten meat but not 191 every day in the past seven days (coded as “not every day”). To compose the Fruits & 192 Vegetables variable, three food groups were selected from the FFQ. Daily consumption of 193 fruits and vegetables (from the Brazilian questionnaire: “frutas”, “verduras”, “legumes”) 194 indicates the child consumed at least three healthy foods daily, as recommended by the 195 Brazilian Ministry of Health 15,16. A dichotomous variable was created indicating either a child 196 had eaten fruits and vegetables every day in the past seven days (coded as “every day”), or a 197 child had eaten fruits and vegetables but not every day in the past seven days (coded as “not 198 every day”). Children under six months of age were included in the analysis by adding children 199 in the "every day" category who had not eaten fruits and vegetables or meat on any given day 200 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2156 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 7


in the past seven days, implying that breastfeeding or formula feeding were the only forms of 201 food they had eaten. 202 Anthropometric measurement equipment, training and standardization of interviewers, 203 supervision and quality control of measurement techniques used to obtain all measurements 204 followed standard PNDS procedures 17,18. Weight-for-Age categories, described in Z-scores 205 (WAZ), were based on the World Health Organization standards 19. For analysis purposes a 206 dichotomous variable named Nutritional Status was created considering a child “underweight” 207 if WAZ < -2.0, and “not underweight” if WAZ ≥ -2.0. Hospitalizations were based on mother’s 208 report of whether children were hospitalized for diarrhea or pneumonia at least once in the 12 209 months prior to interview (coded as “yes”). 210 Data Analysis 211 To merge and analyze PNDS 2006/07 datasets, Stata/IC 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, 212 TX, USA) was used. To correctly reflect the stratification and clustering effects of the complex 213 sampling design, all analyses were performed using the complex survey command (svy) to 214 represent the Brazilian population. However, to avoid overestimating associations in 215 subgroups, sample weights were only used in descriptive analysis(11). Chi-square tests with a 216 second-order Rao-Scott correction 20 were used in descriptive bivariate analysis of associations 217 of socioeconomic, demographic, biological variables with disaggregated food insecurity. 218 Unadjusted and adjusted multivariate analysis used Poisson regression. 219 Ethical Standards 220 This study was approved by the Ethics Committee in Research of the Universidade Federal de 221 São Paulo/Hospital São Paulo (080567/2016). 222 Results 223 A sample of 3920 households was selected for analysis representing 11,779,686 households. 224 Table 1 describes socioeconomic, demographic and child nutrition and health variables by food 225 security status. As expected, food insecure households were more prevalent in the north and 226 northeast regions and rural areas. Majorities of families living in food-insecure households 227 were from low economic strata, had inadequate living conditions and participated in safety net 228 programs. More mothers living in food-insecure households reported less than 8 years of 229 education, being without a partner, and having 3 or more children, who were prominently older 230 than 2 years of age. More children living in food-insecure households did not eat meat, or fruits 231 and vegetables every day. Food insecurity was also associated with undernutrition (WAZ< - 232 2.0 Z-score) and children´s hospitalizations during the year preceding the interview. 233 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2156 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 8

Food Insecurity Screen 234 After detailed examination of each EBIA positive response using cross tabulations, the 235 combination of questions 2 and 4 showed higher sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative 236 predictive values and ROC area when compared with the gold standard. Question number 2 in 237 the EBIA (“Nos últimos três meses a comida acabou antes que você tivesse mais dinheiro para 238 comprar mais”) corresponds to HFSSM question Q2: “In the past 12 months the food that 239 (I/we) bought just didn’t last, and (I/we) didn’t have money to get more”); and EBIA’s question 240 number 4 (“Nos últimos três meses, você teve que se arranjar com apenas alguns alimentos 241 para alimentar os moradores com menos de 18 anos, porque o dinheiro acabou?”) corresponds 242 to HFSSM question Q4: “In the past 12 months, did (you/you or other adults in your household) 243 ever cut the size of your meals or skip meals because there wasn't enough money for food?”. 244 Prevalence of food insecurity assessed by EBIA was 20.7 percent and the Brazilian 2-item 245 food-insecurity screen comprised by questions 2 and 4 provided prevalence of 22 percent, 246 sensitivity of 79.31 percent, specificity of 92.96 percent, positive predictive value of 74.62 247 percent, and negative predictive value of 94.50 percent.

Discussion 261 The Brazilian 2-item food-insecurity screen showed sensitivity of 79.31%, specificity of 262 92.95%, positive predictive value of 74.62%, negative predictive value of 94.50% and ROC 263 area 86.13%. This screen also presented high convergent validity for children’s nutrition and 264 health variables when compared with the gold standard, the EBIA full scale, becoming a valid 265 tool to identify families at risk for food insecurity in clinical and other settings. 266 Food security, when all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to 267 maintain a healthy and active life 21,22 is a critical part of the ideal environment in which to raise 268 a child. However, this ideal setting can be disrupted. Difficulty in accessing food can include 269 lack of money to buy food, environmental or health crises such the COVID-19 pandemic, 270 leading families to experience different levels of severity of food insecurity. Access to 271 nutritious food is particularly critical during the first years of life when a child is experiencing 272 rapid growth and brain development 23. Decreasing food quality and/or quantity – behaviors 273 often seen in food insecure households – are strategies used to avoid experiencing hunger 22. 274 Over the years, EBIA was incorporated as part of the data collection routine of 275 national/regional surveys 24. Despite efforts, high implementation costs force long intervals 276 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2156 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 11


between surveys in Brazil. The National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) included EBIA in 277 three of its editions, 2004, 2009 and 2013. The National Survey on Demography and Health of 278 Women and Children (PNDS) included EBIA in its 2006 edition. The Family Budget Survey 279 (POF) included EBIA for the first time in its 2017/2018 edition. In addition, its long form 280 demands time and effort which could heavily interfere with its implementation in the hurried 281 routine of health care professionals in clinical contexts. 282 Indeed, Brazil enjoys shorter survey versions such as the adult eight-item 25 and the five-item 283 scales 26. However, the country does not yet have a very short screening instrument to promptly 284 assess individual households at risk for food insecurity. The adoption of a 2-item screen will 285 allow Brazil to rapidly identify families likely living in food-insecure households, thus helping 286 to avoid health and development consequences for children and adults associated with food 287 insecurity and hunger, or responding to immediate crises such as COVID-19. For a more 288 comprehensive assessment of the severity of food insecurity and its prevalence in populations, 289 the longer version of EBIA should be administered. 290 To assess validity, accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed Brazilian 2-item food insecurity 291 screen, a combination of all seven components of its psychometric profile is required: 292 sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, area under the ROC 293 curve, and convergent validity. 294 The proposed Brazilian 2-item food insecurity screen provided sensitivity of 79.3 percent, 295 attesting satisfactory foundations of the screening test. Moreover, the screen demonstrated 296 specificity of 92.96 percent, indicating that the screen correctly identifies almost all families 297 that live in food-secure households. Supporting this result, the negative predictive value of 298 94.50 percent shows that among those screening negative practically all households were in 299 fact food-secure. Namely, the screen effectively rules out families that are not at risk for food 300 insecurity, avoiding unnecessary interventions and use of financial resources. Further, the 301 Brazilian 2-item food insecurity screen exhibited accuracy of 90.13 percent and an area under 302 the ROC curve of 86.13 percent, indicating acceptable overall ability of the screen to identify 303 households with and without food insecurity based on its results. 304 The positive predictive value of 74.62 percent indicates the proportion of households with a 305 positive screening result that actually are food-insecure. In other words, it focuses on the 306 usefulness of the test in clinical practice. Given that the screen is a risk assessment tool, 307 respondents screening positive will further respond to the EBIA full scale. In this sense, the 308 positive predictive value of approximately 25 percent of households (false positives) indicates 309 that one quarter of the sample will be responding to the full scale despite being classified as 310 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2156 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 12


food secure by the gold standard. It leads us to further the discussion on the gold standard food 311 security cut-off point used in this project. 312 EBIA’s sum of affirmative items classifies households into four levels using cutoffs arising 313 from expert discussions informed by psychometric analyses and policy considerations. The 314 cut-off points validated for households with children in Brazil are as follows: Food Secure (0 315 questions affirmed); Mild Food Insecurity (1-5 questions affirmed); Moderate Food Insecurity 316 (6-10 questions affirmed); and Severe Food Insecurity (11-15 questions affirmed). 317 Consequently, when combining Food Security and Mild Food Insecurity, we considered food 318 secure all households with up to 5 affirmative responses. In other words, some of the false 319 positives are in fact mild food-insecure households. Thus, families in these households might 320 benefit from being classified as positive in the screen, further responding the EBIA full scale 321 to be correctly identified as food secure or insecure. To spark the conversation, a study 322 published in 2016 27 suggested that, in terms of raw score, Brazilian households endorsing only 323 one item of the scale would be better classified by being placed in the same stratum as those 324 with negative responses on all items, or considered food-secure using EBIA. This way, we 325 could more appropriately distinguish food-secure from food-insecure households, decreasing 326 the number of false positives in the model. 327 The correspondence between the food insecurity screen and theoretically related health 328 variables displayed by the convergent validity adjusted by socioeconomic and demographic 329 variables showed significance in four variables. These results suggest that EBIA and the 330 Brazilian 2-item food insecurity screen have similar power to capture the negative impacts food 331 insecure pose on children’s health. Children living in food-insecure households are more likely 332 to not eat meat or fruits and vegetables every day, to be classified as underweight and be 333 hospitalized by diarrhea or pneumonia. These health conditions suggest increased vulnerability 334 among children living in food-insecure households and the need for immediate referrals to 335 desirable services is imperative. 336 The Brazilian 2-item food insecurity screen and the COVID-19 pandemic: a practical 337 example of how this tool can be used 338 The COVID-19 pandemic has created public health and economic crises worldwide that are 339 likely to test the ability of national, state, and local governments and policymakers to protect 340 their populations from extreme deprivation for an extended period of time. Constraints on 341 available resources resulting from the worldwide economic downturn will also increase stresses 342 involved in efforts to respond to the need for assistance of all kinds, particularly food assistance 343 28, 29. In this context, a brief screener to identify families and individuals at risk for food 344 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2156 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 13


insecurity is urgently needed for use in clinical settings, and by public health workers and social 345 service providers. 346 In summary, the adoption of a Brazilian 2-item food insecurity screen is likely to identify 347 families at risk for food insecurity and place fewer demands on the healthcare system, be more 348 accessible, less expensive and less time-consuming. In addition, the screen can encourage 349 appropriate and timely decision making in times of crisis, such as the one posed by COVID-19 350 regarding this invisible and harmful condition called food insecurity. 351 There were limitations to this study. First, the authors acknowledge that while the methods 352 used for identifying items to be included in a screening tool were systematic and met 353 established standards and the replicability criteria from the Hunger Vital Sign™ set for this 354 study, they were not as conservative or rigorous as item-response theory (IRT) methods. 355 Second, these analyses were conducted using households with at least one child under 5 years 356 of age. Consequently, it is not possible to assert that the 2-item screening tool proposed here 357 would have the same applicability in assessing risk for food insecurity in households containing 358 older children, adults, or elderly people. Conversely, the Hunger Vital Sign™ validation also 359 used a similar sample, and currently the American tool has been validated to be used in 360 households with youth, adolescents and adults. Therefore, additional validation studies of the 361 proposed Brazilian 2-item screening tool need to be conducted using samples from older 362 populations and other types of households. 363 Acknowledgements and statement of author’s contributions to manuscript 364 Dr. Ana Poblacion contributed substantially with the conception and design, data acquisition, 365 analysis and interpretation.
