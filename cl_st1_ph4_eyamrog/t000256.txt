A 69-year-old caucasian man presented fever (38Â°C) with abdominal pain, left 
posterior chest pain without cough or dyspnea and mild occipital headache that 
remained in the next few days. Eleven days later, he woke up with binocular diplopia 
and a severe stabbing occipital headache. There were no peripheral signs of 
systemic vasculitis. Neurologic evaluation identified bilateral paresis of the IV cranial 
nerves. He had well-controlled arterial hypertension and denied trauma or use of 
other medications. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by the reverse transcription 
technique followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a nasopharyngeal 
swab. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with MRI angiography and 
vessel wall study showed signs of vasculitis of the vertebrobasilar system1, as well 
inflammatory radiologic signs in periaqueductal region, along with the topography of 
the trochlear nuclei (FIG.1). Chest computed tomography (CT) showed peripheral 
ground-glass parenchymal opacities, suggesting viral pneumonia. Cerebrospinal 
Fluid (CSF) revealed 2 cells/mm3 (69% lymphocytes, 29% monocytes, 2% 
macrophages) and proteins slightly increased from 46 mg/dl (with 17,01% of gamma 
globulin). CSF antibody tests were negative for syphilis and other viruses. 
Rheumatological causes, hypovitaminosis and thyroid dysfunction were ruled out. 
Erythrocyte 
sedimentation 
rate 
(ESR) 
was 
33 
mm/h. 
He 
received 
IV 
methylprednisolone for 5 days with complete improvement of pain and diplopia. 
This case is the first report of cerebral vasculitis related to COVID-19 infection in an 
adult patient. We emphasize that headache2 could be an alarm signal of cerebral 
vasculitis in these patients.
