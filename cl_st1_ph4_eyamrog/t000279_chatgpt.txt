CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The ongoing COVID-19 health crisis necessitates a profound reevaluation of our social structures and healthcare practices. With no definitive treatment available for the virus, health authorities advocate for preventive measures such as staying at home and practicing social isolation. This study seeks to conduct a scoping review to consolidate existing evidence on telehealth applications in the context of COVID-19.
METHODS: This study presents a protocol outlining the rationale, hypothesis, and planned methods for our scoping review. The review will encompass randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, qualitative studies, and/or case series that detail telehealth interventions developed or implemented in response to COVID-19. Our search will span databases including Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane Library (specifically Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - CENTRAL), Portal Regional BVS - LILACS, and Scopus. We will consider studies conducted from December 2019 onwards, without language restrictions. To evaluate the included studies, we will utilize the Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for critical appraisal. Additionally, the certainty of evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.
The world is currently facing the threat of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with the rapid spread of the disease overwhelming healthcare systems globally. The primary challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be its high transmissibility, making it crucial to reduce the speed of transmission to alleviate the burden on healthcare systems. Telemedicine has emerged as a viable strategy to expand access to medical care, particularly for those in need and individuals residing in remote areas. This approach proves beneficial for screening, diagnosing, and monitoring patients with various conditions.
Given the absence of a confirmed effective treatment, social distancing stands as the primary defense against COVID-19 (4). This approach has swiftly altered the dynamics of patient evaluation and interaction for healthcare professionals (5). Numerous providers have sensibly opted to postpone non-urgent procedures and transitioned in-person appointments to virtual video consultations or telephone conversations (5). Additionally, telehealth platforms have emerged with the objective of screening and overseeing individuals suspected of carrying the virus (6).
Amidst the global emergency, significant efforts have been dedicated to scientific advancements. Daily publications of new studies on COVID-19 contribute to the continuous evolution of scientific knowledge. However, this surge in information also brings about a challenge: the proliferation of inaccurate or unreliable data, impeding effective decision-making and resource allocation. For frontline professionals combating the pandemic and healthcare administrators, the task of synthesizing this vast amount of information proves daunting and often insufficient. Consequently, our objective is to conduct a scoping review to consolidate the existing evidence on telehealth for COVID-19.
This protocol intends to outline the planned methods for our scoping review, adhering to the Extended Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines (7).
The study will encompass randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, and/or case series that delineate telehealth applications in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. All patients utilizing any form of telehealth applications will be included, without constraints pertaining to the intervention modality, age, or gender of the participants. Various technologies such as software, online programs, social media platforms, video education, mobile applications, or other similar information and communication technologies employed or devised for screening, diagnosing, or monitoring COVID-19 patients will be taken into account.
The outcome measures used in this study were carefully selected to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. These measures included standardized tests, self-report questionnaires, and observational assessments. The standardized tests were chosen for their reliability and validity in measuring the specific constructs targeted by the intervention. Self-report questionnaires were utilized to gather subjective data from participants regarding their experiences and perceptions. Observational assessments were conducted by trained observers to provide an objective evaluation of participants' behavior and performance. By employing a combination of these measures, a comprehensive understanding of the intervention's impact was achieved. The selection of outcome measures was based on established research methodologies and best practices in the field, ensuring the rigor and credibility of the study's findings.
Primary outcomes of this study include the effectiveness of diagnostic and prognostic evaluation, as well as the hospitalization rate.
Secondary outcomes in this study encompass adherence, feasibility, user satisfaction, cost, self-management, and self-efficacy. These factors are crucial in evaluating the overall effectiveness and practicality of the intervention being studied. Adherence refers to the extent to which participants follow the prescribed intervention protocol, while feasibility assesses the practicality and ease of implementation of the intervention in real-world settings. User satisfaction gauges the subjective experience and acceptance of the intervention by the participants. Cost analysis provides insights into the economic implications and sustainability of the intervention. Self-management and self-efficacy outcomes focus on the participants' ability to independently manage their condition and their belief in their capability to achieve desired outcomes. By examining these secondary outcomes, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the intervention's impact and potential for widespread adoption and success.
We will conduct a comprehensive search across various databases including Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane Library - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Portal Regional BVS - LILACS, and Scopus. This search will involve utilizing relevant descriptors and synonyms, with adjustments made to cater to the specific requirements of each database in order to identify a range of published, ongoing, and unpublished studies. Our search will encompass studies conducted from November 2019 onwards, with no limitations imposed on language during the selection process.
In our research, we will explore the COVID-19 specific databases, including the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L·OVE platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). Furthermore, we will utilize the snowballing technique to expand our search by examining the reference lists of the included studies.
We will employ terms pertinent to the issue at hand, the intervention, and the publication date filter. The search strategy conducted in Medline through Pubmed is detailed in Table 1.
Two authors, FSAR and RRPS, will be responsible for selecting studies for inclusion in the review. In cases where duplicate studies are identified, only one will be considered for inclusion. If reports involve the same participants but different outcome measurements or assessments at varying time points, both reports will be included as components of a single study. Following the removal of duplicates, the authors will screen study titles and abstracts, excluding those that clearly do not meet eligibility criteria. The remaining studies will undergo a thorough assessment for potential inclusion. Any disagreements between authors regarding study inclusion will be resolved by the third author, VFMT. Explanations for study exclusions will be provided. To streamline the screening and selection process, the Rayyan application (8) will be utilized.
Two authors, FSAR and RRPS, will autonomously extract data, with any discrepancies or disagreements resolved by a third author, VFMT. Data extraction from included studies will be conducted using a predefined form encompassing details on: (I) Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients or participants; (II) Time points utilized for assessments; (III) Methodology for managing missing data (including data imputation procedures and the use of intention-to-treat approach); (IV) Outcome measures; (V) Sources of funding; and (VI) Potential conflicts of interest.
The critical appraisal of randomized clinical trials will be conducted using the Risk of Bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews (9), while observational studies will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (10). The quality of evidence will be evaluated through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) (11). Our findings on the quality of evidence will be summarized using the GRADE profiler software (12). Two authors (FSAR and KMMM) will independently assess the risk of bias and certainty of evidence, resolving any disagreements through discussion or consultation with a third author (VFMT) if necessary.
When two or more studies exhibit adequate homogeneity in terms of their design, participants, intervention, and outcome measurements, we will consider the feasibility of combining their findings through meta-analysis. All analytical procedures will adhere to the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (9). In cases where there is a lack of information or the studies are too diverse, a qualitative synthesis will be conducted to summarize the results.
For the evaluation of prognosis, we will conduct analyses in accordance with the guidelines set forth by Cochrane and the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group. When the response of interest is presented as a continuous variable, we will analyze it in terms of mean difference (MD) or Hedge’s/Cohen’s (SMD). In instances of dichotomous responses, we will combine hazard ratios (unadjusted or adjusted) or odds ratios along with their standard errors for outcomes such as hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, respiratory support for adult inpatients with COVID-19, and mortality. Other parameters like standard deviation (for MD or SMD) and the number of events (RR or OR) will also be pooled. For all analyses, we will utilize the generic inverse variance method with a random-effects model. The software package "meta" (version 4.11-0) will be employed for these analyses.
In instances where studies do not furnish a mean and its corresponding standard deviation (SD), we will rely on the information and outcomes disclosed in the text or tables, making appropriate inferences. In cases where the predetermined parameters are absent, we will derive estimates based on alternative parameters, ensuring accuracy and reliability of the information provided.
We will reach out to the principal investigators of the studies included in our research to request supplementary data or seek clarification on any issues pertaining to the studies. Should we not receive a response from the authors, we will present the data in a descriptive fashion, refraining from making any assumptions or imputations.
The Cochran’s Q test will be utilized to evaluate the presence of heterogeneity, with a threshold set at a P value < 0.1 to indicate its presence. Furthermore, statistical heterogeneity will be evaluated by analyzing the Higgins I2 statistic, with the following thresholds applied: < 25% indicating no heterogeneity, 25% to 49% denoting low heterogeneity, 50% to 74% representing moderate heterogeneity, and ≥ 75% indicating high heterogeneity.
The implementation of strategies such as social distancing, quarantine, and isolation to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 is imperative in the current scenario. In this regard, the utilization of telehealth as a means of providing healthcare services presents itself as a compelling alternative. Given the rapid advancements in information and communication technologies, understanding the potential benefits and outcomes of telehealth interventions is crucial for addressing various health concerns. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review is to consolidate the existing evidence on the use of telehealth in the context of COVID-19.
One potential limitation of this study is the risk of encountering biased studies, which could render them inadequate for offering accurate estimates or dependable information.
