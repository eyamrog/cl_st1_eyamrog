We present an experience report on the implementation of real-time telehealth in speech-language and hearing therapy for patients previously seen on an outpatient basis in a primary health care service. When the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in southern Brazil, twenty-five users were under the monitoring of the Speech-Language Therapy (SLT) team. Among them, twelve patients were identified as needing at least bi-weekly monitoring calls. Teleconsultations were initially provided on an emergency basis during the project's implementation phase in this format. The primary goal was to ensure continuity of care for patients who might experience worsening conditions or comorbidities due to the suspension of SLT sessions. These appointments were conducted via video calls by SLT students and therapists from the extension project, under the supervision of a speech-language therapist, in a synchronous manner. All interactions and guidance during teleconsultations were delivered calmly, with playful activities incorporated for pediatric patients. Telehealth has proven to be an effective tool for addressing the needs of patients requiring SLT services, offering remote care of equal quality to in-person sessions. Moreover, it holds significant potential, particularly in regions where there is a scarcity of qualified SLT professionals, catering to a substantial number of patients in need of assessment and therapy.
The 2019 Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has presented unprecedented challenges in the 21st century, necessitating a reorganization of individuals in various aspects of their lives including family, leisure, work, and consumption of goods and services. The global and regional recommendation for social distancing has been emphasized due to the absence of a definitive treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, highlighting the urgency to prevent and manage infections (1).
The relationship between healthcare providers and users of non-essential health services was disrupted during periods of social distancing. Non-urgent and emergency services, categorized as non-essential or elective, typically do not necessitate immediate attention, such as outpatient speech therapy rehabilitation. Consequently, individuals who were undergoing ongoing rehabilitation or systematic follow-up in speech therapy outpatient clinics were unable to access care during this period of social distancing. This particularly impacted patients recovering from phonological disorders or children with language delays, leading to potential difficulties in writing and speech intelligibility. Furthermore, consideration was given to the most vulnerable groups at risk of infection and mortality from the virus, including adults and the elderly with comorbidities, individuals post-stroke, or those experiencing swallowing or communication issues due to age-related factors.
Approximately 50 days after the initial cases were reported in Brazil and over 30 days since certain cities began advising social distancing measures, patients resumed treatments as the issues related to communication and swallowing persisted, irrespective of the timeframe. Consequently, in response to this evolving scenario, the conventional in-person approach to therapy (typically conducted in an office setting, involving direct interaction with the patient, and occasionally with parents or caregivers) necessitated modification and modernization.
Telehealth, also known as teletherapy, refers to the remote provision of healthcare services through various telecommunication tools including secure telephone, video conferencing, email, messaging, and mobile applications, with or without video capabilities. This approach is increasingly viewed as a viable option in the current landscape. The primary goal of utilizing these technologies is to enhance healthcare accessibility, particularly for patients residing in remote or hard-to-reach areas, as well as those with motor coordination challenges. Moreover, telehealth has proven to be advantageous in emergency situations like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, these tools aid in broadening the scope of healthcare professionals and support personnel, ensuring a continuous care framework for preventive measures, diagnostics, and treatment protocols.
On March 16, 2020, an extension project was initiated at a basic health unit adjacent to a university hospital in southern Brazil, aimed at establishing a speech therapy call center. The initiative was spearheaded by the professor, a team of students, and speech therapists affiliated with the research group Epidemiology of Human Communication and Disorders (EPI-DCH). The following section provides a detailed account of the development and implementation of this proposal.
Initially, when the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, the speech therapy team was attending to or monitoring a total of 25 users. Efforts were made to contact all patients scheduled for consultations, with only one managing to have their first appointment. The team conducted a survey to gather information on the complaints, age, and status of the speech and language therapy (SLT) treatment each individual was undergoing at that time. These cases were then categorized into three groups: those "under treatment" receiving speech therapy services at least fortnightly, those "for monitoring" scheduled for a review within three months, and those "for discussion" in case of any uncertainties regarding the previous two categories.
Following the initial survey, the team comprised a Speech-Language Therapy (SLT) Professor, a scientific initiation student, and two speech therapists who engaged in discussions regarding all cases to either confirm or revise the classifications previously outlined. The exclusion criterion for the call service was applied to users who, although not yet ready for discharge from speech therapy, demonstrated a lack of commitment to home exercises and a low risk of worsening their clinical condition. Consequently, such individuals were already on a therapeutic pause, such as older adults with vocal complaints who failed to adhere to the prescribed home exercises yet continued to experience the same complaint.
Initially, it was determined that eight patients did not meet the criteria for participation in the call service or telemonitoring. Among the remaining 17 patients eligible for tele-audiology services, 12 were designated for regular calls requiring assistance at least every two weeks, while the remaining 5 were allocated for periodic reviews necessitating at least one call during the specified period to monitor their case status.
In response to the pandemic and in consideration of patient safety, individuals were personally contacted and notified that all in-person visits would be suspended for a minimum of two months, with the possibility of extension. Additionally, they were advised of the availability of a call service during this period.
In the initial phase, the call service operated on an emergency basis, primarily through phone communication, with the option for video calls if the patient consented. The primary aim was to ensure continuity in the treatment of patients at risk of deterioration or experiencing comorbidities linked to the discontinuation of speech therapy.
Initially, two elderly patients expressed their reluctance towards utilizing this particular technology and indicated a preference to discontinue treatment. Despite this, a speech therapist from the team reached out to them once more, suggesting a trial for treatment and monitoring of their swallowing disorders (dysphagia), emphasizing the importance of addressing even mild cases. Eventually, the patients agreed to participate in the teleconsultation model, with the assistance of a family member to navigate the technological aspects of the process.
The call service was conducted by speech therapy students, project extension staff, and was synchronously supervised by a speech therapist. Telephone video calling technology was utilized due to its accessibility and ease of use, as patients were familiar with and regularly used the application. Throughout the service, the patient interacted with the intern with whom they were accustomed to having face-to-face consultations. The supervisor remained off-camera and muted, following the audio without directly intervening in the patient's consultation.
In face-to-face appointments, speech therapy consultations at the basic health unit typically extend for a minimum of 30 minutes on average. In contrast, teleconsultations range between 20 to 60 minutes, varying based on the complexity and nature of the case being addressed.
Especially when working with children, prolonged screen time is deemed inappropriate. Therefore, exercises are conducted directly with the children, while parents or caregivers are provided with practical guidelines to follow between sessions. All discussions and instructions are delivered in a calm manner, often incorporating playful activities tailored to the child's interests. However, screen exposure is limited to the essential minimum. Additionally, for infant patients diagnosed with phonological disorders residing in shelters or foster homes, we have initiated weekly sessions during this period to enhance the efficacy of speech therapy rehabilitation.
For adults and the elderly, the approach remains consistent. In the outpatient setting, patients typically visit the clinic every two weeks or less frequently, contingent upon their individual circumstances. Regularly, prescribed exercises or maneuvers are diligently performed at home on a daily basis.
Following the consultations, students undergo supervision by a speech therapist via video call, during which they discuss cases, relevant literature, and suitable therapeutic approaches tailored to each individual. Due to the interns' lack of access to the UBS medical records system, they compile and exchange progress reports in an electronic document. Here, the intern documents the progress, which is then reviewed by the speech therapist overseeing the case. These reports are later integrated into the electronic medical record system of the basic health unit through remote access facilitated by the project's supervising speech therapist teacher amidst the ongoing pandemic.
The utilization of a call service for speech therapy demonstrated its efficacy as a valuable tool in navigating the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the context of reorganizing health services. Research conducted in the United States highlights the significant role that technology plays as a robust ally in healthcare, spanning across various stages of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.
Initially, the patients were contacted by project interns who were themselves adjusting to this novel form of session, potentially leading to the initial non-adherence of two patients. However, upon being contacted by a more experienced professional, these patients began adhering to the teleconsultation model. It is crucial to have a structured conversation script in place for all stages of contact. Research indicates that the manner in which patients are approached significantly impacts their adherence to the call center proposal and subsequent treatment protocols (4,6).
Research indicates that effective communication plays a crucial role in ensuring patients' confidence in adhering to novel forms of care. Clear, dynamic, and easily comprehensible communication is essential to bridge any potential gap between therapists and patients, thereby reducing the risk of non-adherence to teleconsultation stemming from uncertainties, queries, and conflicts. It is recommended to provide training in communicative skills to achieve the desired outcomes.
Another contributing factor to patients' lack of receptiveness towards technology is the assumption that teleconsultations do not hold the same value as in-person consultations. This perception can lead to a negative bias against remote services, creating barriers to understanding and appreciating the true benefits of teleconsultations. To address this challenge, a strategy was implemented to enhance the reliability of the service and encourage patient adherence to teleconsultations. Interns who had prior experience with face-to-face interactions were assigned to attend to the patients, under the supervision of a speech therapist who had previously conducted in-person consultations. Patients were reassured that the care provided through teleconsultations would mirror that of face-to-face consultations, with the same level of attention and aiming for similar positive outcomes.
Eikelboom and colleagues (2005) investigated patients' dedication to utilizing remote resources and the determinants impacting decision-making. The study revealed that 75% of participants lacked familiarity with the subject, with their incentive primarily linked to cost and time savings. Conversely, a strong inclination towards traditional care (in-person) was evident, particularly among women aged over 55 (9).
Despite being considered elective, outpatient speech therapy can play a crucial role in preventing disorders that may necessitate tertiary care, such as dysphagia, which can lead to respiratory issues due to aspiration and laryngotracheal penetration. These conditions not only strain hospitals but also expose already vulnerable patients to a higher risk of infection. Moreover, the option of seeking a second expert opinion in cases of swallowing disorders is particularly significant in a geographically vast country like Brazil, where the availability of specialists in oropharyngeal dysphagia varies widely across regions.
The wide range of time intervals between consultations can be attributed to the heterogeneity present in age groups and the specific demands being addressed. When it comes to children, shorter consultations are typically preferred due to the challenge of sustaining their attention during remote sessions. The home environment, with its numerous distractions, poses a significant obstacle compared to a controlled office setting. On the other hand, consultations with the elderly necessitate a more substantial adjustment in terms of technology usage, as well as a longer duration to ensure comprehension of guidelines and instructions, resulting in extended consultation times.
The involvement of parents and caregivers plays a crucial role in enhancing teleconsultation, aiding in technology utilization and overseeing home exercise routines (3,11). Additionally, the enforced social distancing measures have resulted in increased family bonding time, leading to improved adherence to prescribed daily exercises and ultimately benefiting the patient's overall prognosis.
In terms of ethical considerations, it is imperative that all patient rights are upheld, mirroring the standards expected in face-to-face sessions. The speech therapist is entrusted with the responsibility of providing efficient and confidential services while meticulously documenting each case. To ensure the delivery of a just and proficient service, akin to the practices in basic health units, we have opted to employ techniques that are substantiated by scientific evidence. A study conducted in Australia scrutinized orofacial motor skills in dysarthric patients through the comparison of videoconference and traditional assessment methods, revealing a high level of agreement between the two approaches across most evaluated parameters.
The call service facilitated a higher frequency of consultations compared to face-to-face appointments due to the absence of resource-intensive factors like transportation, physical space requirements within the health service (often shared among multiple teams), and the provision of more flexible scheduling, all of which contribute to fostering a stronger therapist-patient relationship, particularly for users with psychosocial needs. Nonetheless, it did present certain limitations, including challenges related to sound and video quality during calls, as well as the adjustment required by both the user and therapist to this mode of service delivery. To address these issues, we chose to utilize platforms that are familiar and easily accessible to patients, while also ensuring a more reliable internet connection, scheduling appointments during off-peak network usage times for better stability, and, whenever feasible, conducting sessions without video to mitigate potential technical difficulties.
The initial 30-day period of telehealth implementation for patients previously under primary care has demonstrated its efficacy in addressing speech therapy needs, offering remote care that matches the quality of in-person services. It is essential to assess each case for suitability in this format, yet in times of social distancing, telehealth proves to be a valuable tool in delivering essential care to patients. Furthermore, this underscores the significance of telehealth in the realm of speech therapy, as it opens up avenues for broader access to services for individuals residing in areas with limited availability of specialized professionals.
