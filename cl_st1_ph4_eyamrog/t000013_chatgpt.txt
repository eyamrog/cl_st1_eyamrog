This article delves into the integration of health into Brazilian foreign policy from 1995 to 2010 and the enabling factors that bolstered the country's global standing. A relatively unexplored area in the realm of Brazilian health diplomacy, we scrutinize the intricacies of this phenomenon through a policy analysis lens. Leveraging a combination of literature review, document scrutiny, and interviews with key stakeholders, we reassess policies that were instigated by profound and multifaceted historical shifts within Brazil. The study underscores the intricate connections between foreign policy and social policy, particularly in the realm of health, which only gained prominence during the Lula administrations (2003-2010), significantly enhancing Brazil's international presence. The internationalization of Brazil's domestic policies, particularly through South-South cooperation, played a pivotal role in this evolution. These advancements were facilitated by the proactive engagement and dedication of various State and non-State actors operating on both national and transnational fronts, alongside the coordinated efforts of Brazilian diplomats and government officials in tandem with civil society advocates. Institutional frameworks underwent transformations in response to varying circumstances, constantly navigating conflicts and strategic maneuvers.
In the initial decade of the 21st century, Brazil has solidified its position as an emerging global power and boasts one of the largest and most promising economies worldwide. Moreover, the nation has actively engaged in 'health diplomacy,' assuming a progressively prominent role in international health forums.
The vast body of literature on Brazilian health diplomacy often lacks analyses that explore the intricate connections between foreign policy, health, and international relations. While some studies do draw parallels between national and global dynamics, setting the stage for further exploration and deeper insights, the focus typically remains on decision-making in international forums or the impact of social movements on specific health issues like HIV/AIDS, and their interactions with the state, particularly the executive branch, and international organizations.
From a policy analysis standpoint, the connections between health and international relations in Brazil are relatively recent. It is crucial for such analysis to consider the historical, contextual, and dynamic aspects of the political system, along with the diverse governmental circumstances. Likewise, national policies targeting 'global health' stem from negotiations that engage a range of stakeholders from the health, social development, and foreign policy domains.
Foreign policy is a public policy that operates at the crossroads of domestic and international policy, influenced by the asymmetric order of the state system and global capitalism. This policy is crafted within the state, with its formulation and execution subject to the dynamics of governmental decisions shaped by negotiations, coalitions, bargaining, disputes, and agreements among representatives of various interests. As with any public policy, foreign policy is not only a site of conflict but also subject to transformation with each new government in power.
Most authors (and actors) understand health diplomacy (or ‘global health diplomacy’) as the advocacy for specific issues, policies, or actions related to various dimensions of health on the international stage, pursued by any actor, government or otherwise, without necessarily equating it with the foreign policy of nation-states or the diplomacy of a country as such. The conceptual vagueness of the term allows for its versatile use, with the meaning of the term contingent on the chosen perspective of analysis and the object of study. From this viewpoint, health diplomacy emerges as a policy-shaping process wherein governmental, nongovernmental, and other institutional actors engage in negotiations to address health challenges or utilize health concepts and mechanisms in policy-making and negotiation strategies to achieve broader political, economic, or social objectives.
This study delves into the integration of health issues into Brazilian foreign policy and the underlying factors that facilitated their contribution to the country's global presence, particularly from 1995 to 2010. The primary aim is to elucidate the unique characteristics of Brazilian health diplomacy and its impact domestically and internationally through a comprehensive analysis of data, events, and policy evaluations influenced by various political shifts in Brazil. While acknowledging the distinctions between foreign policy and sectoral policies, notably social policies such as health, the study highlights the substantial interconnections between them to grasp the essence of what is termed as 'Brazil's health diplomacy'.
The research drew upon a comprehensive literature review encompassing primary and secondary sources, such as reports and websites from governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Additionally, it involved triangulating perceptions gathered through interviews with key Brazilian policymakers, public health officials, and representatives from civil society, focusing on Brazilian health concerns within the realm of foreign policy. The majority of interviews took place between 2017 and 2018, with a few additional ones conducted in subsequent years, namely 2019 and 2020.
The research delves into a unique era of political stability in Brazil, spanning from the center-right (PSDB) administrations of 1995-2002 led by Fernando Henrique Cardoso (FHC) of the Social Democratic Party (Partido Social Democrata, PSDB) to the center-left governance of 2003-2010 under Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula) of the Workers' Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores, PT). Both leaders, each with their distinctive approaches, aimed to enhance Brazil's global influence and formed diverse political alliances. They instigated shifts in Brazil's foreign relations by reassessing traditional diplomatic frameworks and actively positioning the country for increased prominence and recognition within the international arena.
The primary argument posited in the article is the intricate interplay between national and international policies, emphasizing that domestic dynamics and societal engagement, while crucial, are not independently sufficient. Governmental decisions, rooted in values and principles and bolstered by ever-shifting political coalitions, play a pivotal role in shaping a country's perceived position within the global system and dictating its actions on the international stage. Consequently, the non-material aspects of foreign policy, encompassing symbolic and interpretive elements, are deemed significant variables that must be integrated into the decision-making process. These elements facilitate the construction of diverse international scenarios, contingent upon decision-makers' perceptions and the emphasis placed on a nation's specific 'heritage' during international negotiations, influenced by national practices and ideological perspectives.
The initial section of the paper offers a historical retrospective of Brazilian foreign policy (BFP) and international relations spanning from the late 1980s to the FHC and Lula administrations. Subsequently, it delves into the interconnections between domestic social policies, particularly in the realm of health policies, and the foreign policy strategies pursued by these administrations. The final segment of the paper presents a concise analytical recapitulation of the research outcomes and proposes avenues for prospective investigations.
Brazilian foreign policy (BFP) has historically prioritized international 'prestige' over 'contestation', garnering support from the country's elites that was neither absolute nor enduring. During the authoritarian military rule spanning from 1964 to 1985, Brazil's international stance leaned towards defensiveness and discretion, particularly concerning sensitive topics like human rights. The political shift in the mid-1980s and global transformations post-Cold War gradually reshaped Brazil's economic development model, societal dynamics, and the formulation and execution of national policies, including foreign affairs, which had traditionally been shielded within the diplomatic circles.
Historically, the BFP has played a central role in the economic development models adopted by governments during pivotal periods such as the mid-1960s, the 1990s, and more recently since 2016. These junctures mark times when existing national development trajectories and international engagements have reached a point of exhaustion, prompting the emergence of new sociopolitical coalitions that reshape both domestic and foreign policies. Despite the prevalence of a singular and widely accepted development model, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the political aspects of foreign policy. In some instances, foreign policy undergoes significant scrutiny and potential overhaul without any corresponding changes in the political regime, highlighting the complex and nuanced nature of foreign policy dynamics.
The re-democratisation of Brazil in the 1980s necessitated a more proactive approach from Brazilian diplomacy to establish and execute an agenda that would bolster domestic legitimacy for Brazil's international stances and objectives, as well as facilitate the formation of national coalitions conducive to altering the existing status quo. This shift led to a reduction in the traditional decision-making autonomy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with a corresponding rise in 'presidential diplomacy', where Presidents actively engaged in the decision-making processes of the Brazilian Foreign Policy (BFP). Concurrently, the significance of political coalitions escalated in Brazil, culminating in a system termed 'coalitional presidentialism'. The political landscape, as enshrined in the 1988 Constitution, coupled with the presidential system, vested the president with authority to set the agenda and engage in negotiations, while also imposing the challenging task of ensuring governability among the legislature and ruling elites to enact the governmental agenda within extensive political coalitions. Given the intricate nature of the Brazilian political system characterized by numerous parties, low loyalty, high fragmentation, and unconventional practices among deputies, the president's capacity to coordinate relations between the executive and legislative branches emerged as a pivotal aspect.
The growing politicization of BFP has made it a significant issue, showcasing the deepening connections between national and international realms within a globalized world. This evolution has also unveiled distinct factions within the diplomatic corps, particularly within Itamaraty, which was once perceived as a unified entity holding exclusive expertise in international affairs. Furthermore, these divisions have become apparent in the executive branch and among the legislative coalitions backing government leaders.
Another notable aspect of the Brazilian Foreign Policy (BFP) during the twentieth century and into the early decades of the twenty-first century was its emphasis on multilateral spaces, such as institutions and arenas, as the primary platforms for Brazil's diplomatic engagements. Additionally, Brazil positioned itself as a mediator between the North and South, consistently upholding the principle of non-interference, which necessitated making certain concessions and leveraging soft power. This strategic approach enabled the BFP to enhance its political influence by promoting policies based on principles, values, culture, and accomplishments, while also fostering collaborations with a diverse array of stakeholders.
The Brazilian Foreign Policy (BFP) has consistently aimed for international recognition of Brazil, viewing the country as inherently deserving of a prominent position in the global system. Nevertheless, the approaches to realizing this objective have fluctuated with shifts in governmental leadership. At certain junctures, this aspiration has waned or been entirely forsaken.
Some scholars critique the assertion that Brazil's autonomy in the global sphere has consistently characterized the BFP29,8,25. They contend that while autonomy has been present, it has been constrained to "exceptional moments and disruptions in the dependent evolution of foreign policy," instances that "might be disrupted by conservative factions"8(42-43).
In the 1990s, the international discourse heavily focused on 'social issues', particularly during the UN conferences held between 1990 and 1996, aimed at reevaluating development strategies. This reevaluation was prompted by the escalating levels of poverty and inequality worldwide, stemming from the economic policies of the 1980s, as well as the necessity to explore alternatives to Welfare State approaches that were ill-suited to the new neoliberal economic landscape post-Cold War. These UN conferences served as pivotal platforms for shaping the organization's social agenda, drawing in a diverse array of participants from both state and non-state sectors. They not only highlighted these pressing concerns but also underscored the growing involvement of actors from civil society, local governments, and other non-traditional diplomatic entities in global discussions. Notably, Brazil played a significant role in actively engaging in these conferences.
The international dynamics observed in this context are reflective of and also influence domestic movements. For instance, the push for health sector reform in Brazil, spearheaded by preventive medicine and public health professionals in conjunction with health professional unions and opposition political parties, has roots tracing back to the 1970s. Similarly, the movement aimed at combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which emphasizes human rights, solidarity, and collaboration with other social movements such as feminists and advocates of the 'sexual option,' has been active since the 1980s. These movements are interconnected and share common principles, contributing to a broader network of advocacy and reform efforts.
Governments' decisions, social and political influences, and systemic elements, such as geopolitical transitions (the conclusion of the bipolar era) and geoeconomic transformations (the United States' hegemony in decline and China's ascent), have expanded the opportunities for countries situated on the periphery of the global stage, potentially alleviating them from 'structural conditioning factors'. This shift has enabled foreign policy to harness the state's authority by utilizing its institutional framework and managerial proficiencies, thereby utilizing domestic resources for international objectives.
In a similar vein, the processes of internationalizing economies (globalization and economic liberalization/opening) and democratizing societies (intensification of debate among social actors on ideas and ways of institutionalizing demands) - phenomena also observed in Brazil - were key factors contributing to the 'politicization' of public policies, including foreign policy. The heightened complexity of policymaking stemming from these developments further prompted various government agencies and civil society institutions to actively participate in shaping and executing both domestic and foreign policies.
The Brazilian literature is engaged in a fervent debate regarding whether the foreign policies of FHC and Lula signify continuity or innovation. Amidst this discourse, a degree of consensus has emerged concerning both the continuities and changes observed in their respective approaches.
Some scholars perceive foreign policy processes as maintaining a consistent trajectory between administrations, with adjustments primarily in goals and programs, including the emphasis on health. Conversely, others argue that Lula not only extended changes initiated during the FHC era in the Bolsa Família Program (BFP) but also capitalized on a more favorable national and international economic climate. The prevailing argument in the literature advocates for continuity in the historical paradigms of the BFP, albeit under distinct diplomatic traditions that influenced the foreign policies of FHC and Lula. Both administrations accommodated social currents and are often viewed as pursuing increased autonomy for Brazil in its global engagements. Nevertheless, certain analysts contend that true autonomist characteristics were only evident during Lula's tenure.
The pivotal global context of the 1990s, characterized by the conclusion of the Cold War and the proliferation of macroeconomic structural adjustment initiatives on a global scale (and, within Brazil, by the emergence of a fresh constitutional political framework and a state grappling with financial turmoil), prompted the Brazilian economic elite to endorse domestically the 'orthodox neoliberalism' espoused by the FHC administration. During the initial FHC administration, two key priorities emerged: the implementation of currency stabilization measures (Real Plan) and the revision of the 1988 constitution.
The foreign policy objective of the FHC government was centered on restoring Brazil's international credibility by departing from the 'Third World thesis' and previous alliances, thus diminishing the significance of solidarity and identification with Southern countries. This shift aimed at aligning with global trends as a means of implementing macroeconomic stabilization policies. Domestically, the government pursued trade liberalization and privatization measures. Externally, there was a deliberate effort to strengthen ties with Western powers, particularly the United States, and engage with international regimes on issues such as human rights, security, and nuclear proliferation. The genesis of this strategic approach can be traced back to the 1990s, during Itamar Franco's presidency, when Fernando Henrique Cardoso served as foreign minister (October 1992 to May 1993) and subsequently as finance minister (May 1993 to March 1994). Departing from Mercosul's regional focus, FHC's foreign policy emphasized flexibility through the negotiation of free trade agreements with countries beyond the region, such as those within the European Union.
The government deemed it unrealistic to address structural determinants of social inequalities within the international political and economic context. Instead, they believed it would be more productive to mobilize developed countries to support Brazil's agenda by contributing financially to solve the country's problems, in exchange for Brazil's backing of their policies. In this view, Brazil should adhere to the established rules and work towards legitimizing its economic development positions within those parameters while addressing internal issues.
During the FHC governments, international cooperation was not a priority or was deemed of little importance within the context of BFP, with the exception of initiatives related to AIDS, which will be further elaborated upon. A notable characteristic of this era was the emergence of 'presidential diplomacy', denoting the heightened involvement of the president in diplomatic endeavors.
President FHC, despite enjoying significant support and prestige within the Brazilian elite, faced challenges as his economic and political strategies failed to yield the desired outcomes. The implementation of the 'Real Plan' in 1994 successfully stabilized the currency; however, by the early 2000s, Brazil's economic landscape was marred by issues such as fiscal adjustment without economic growth, escalating unemployment, poverty, and inequality, as well as exchange rate and currency crises in 2002. Simultaneously, the political environment witnessed a deterioration in living and working conditions. These factors collectively tarnished Brazil's international reputation, ultimately leading to the election of Lula, the Workers' Party (PT) candidate, in 2002.
Lula extended macroeconomic adjustment policies by implementing a new (third) phase of fiscal and monetary stabilization rooted in the neoliberal paradigm. Nonetheless, he embraced a 'neo-developmental' strategy, particularly from 2006 onwards, by bolstering the domestic market and aiming for synergy between economic and social policies to achieve an 'economy governed by social expenditure'. This shift was evident in the incorporation of measures that supplemented the universal approach and incorporated "conditions in the formulation of particular policies".
Lula's foreign policy was defined by the pursuit of 'political autonomy', necessitating a strategic approach that balanced Brazil's national interests with its international engagements. This approach aimed to assert Brazil's independence on the global stage while fostering diplomatic relationships with a diverse range of countries. Lula's administration sought to strengthen South-South cooperation, particularly with other emerging economies, in order to enhance Brazil's influence in multilateral forums. Additionally, the emphasis on political autonomy led to a more assertive stance on issues such as trade negotiations and environmental policies, reflecting Brazil's growing role as a regional and global player. Overall, Lula's foreign policy agenda was marked by a commitment to promoting Brazil's interests while engaging constructively with the international community.
The assertion of international leadership is not merely a declaration but rather an assertion aimed at questioning the current global regulations, emphasizing a proactive approach to establishing new rules rather than passively adhering to existing ones. This approach also involves a shift towards a more extended outlook on the geopolitical disparities between the North and South, as well as a commitment to actively aligning with like-minded nations in the South and fostering integration with neighboring countries in the region (Author, Year, Page).
The fundamental principles of this approach were to highlight the inherent contradictions of globalization and to capitalize on any flexibility remaining due to the decline of U.S. hegemony. This strategy aimed to create new avenues for promoting Brazil's interests internationally, whether through progress or positioning within the global framework. The prevailing assessment was that the global order was shifting towards multipolarity, necessitating a range of partnerships in the South American region and with other emerging or developing nations.
Emphasis was placed on the concept of 'strategic partnerships' or forming coalitions with 'variable geometry', indicating closer ties with emerging nations to enhance Brazil's representation and bolster less powerful countries, positioning Brazil as a spokesperson. The Brazilian Foreign Policy (BFP) actively engaged in activities within more focused forums, advocating and backing the establishment of new entities (such as IBAS in 2003, BRICS in 2006, and Unasul in 2008) while reinforcing existing institutions like Mercosul. Within South America, the BFP aimed to intertwine Brazil's prosperity with that of its neighboring countries to address the structural disparities among them. This approach underscored a multidimensional diplomatic strategy, encompassing simultaneous efforts across global, regional, and bilateral spheres. Concurrently, substantial diplomatic endeavors were undertaken to champion a social agenda on the global platform, with a particular emphasis on health-related issues.
The trade interests of major national corporations and conglomerates were extended beyond their borders. These potentially conflicting objectives were met with skepticism, defensiveness, or at best, suspicion in certain countries within the region.
Presidential diplomacy was heightened, leading to a strengthening of ties between the President and the Chancellor, Celso Amorim, a distinguished diplomat. Both figures played pivotal roles in both Lula administrations, engaging in numerous international visits and regional trips, including those to South America and Africa. The establishment of new embassies, particularly in previously overlooked countries and regions, marked a significant shift. Additionally, the President assumed a more prominent role in various global forums. Concurrently, there was a notable increase in the number of training positions for diplomats at the Rio Branco Institute, with the introduction of new specialties aimed at addressing social issues, particularly in healthcare, as highlighted in an interview with a key player from Itamaraty.
Brazil's involvement in negotiations and decisions deemed highly political, such as those concerning international security matters like UN peacekeeping missions resulting in MINUSTAH, faced significant criticism, particularly from proponents of a more conservative foreign policy stance. Additionally, Brazil's pursuit of a permanent seat on the UN Security Council was maintained despite opposition.
The policy of international cooperation, encompassing South-South and triangular collaborations, experienced significant growth and strategic importance, propelled by Brazil's improving economic conditions and the global outreach of national policies. Subsequently, technical, political, and economic cooperation emerged as a means to fortify alliances and coalitions among nations sharing perceived similar levels of development and aspirations. Notably, during the second Lula administration, the expansion of the budget allocated to the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC) served as a tangible indicator of this evolving dynamic. The Brazilian Foreign Policy (BFP) adamantly rejected the classification of Brazil as a 'donor' country by OECD standards, instead viewing South-South cooperation as an expression of solidarity and a dedication to mutual assistance among nations within the Global South, particularly encompassing South America, the Caribbean, and Africa.
The foreign policy debate in Brazil experienced a notable revitalization, with various actors within the federal structure and organized civil society emerging as key players in both national and international affairs.
Brazil's international positioning underwent a significant transformation as it embarked on a path of substantial economic and political internationalization, a concept known as 'dual internationalization'. Within the economic realm, the country implemented policies aimed at industrial and technological development domestically, while actively promoting leading national companies on the global stage. This strategy bolstered the competitiveness of agricultural and mining products in the international market, solidifying Brazil's role as a driver of development. Concurrently, policy shifts occurred at both domestic and international levels. Domestically, efforts focused on broadening the social base by extending political citizenship and incorporating marginalized groups through enhanced consumption opportunities. On the international front, Brazil sought to expand its participation in various global forums and negotiation arenas across multiple sectors to advocate for reforms within multilateral institutions, such as the UN Security Council, albeit without adopting radical approaches.
The external projection of national social inclusion policies warrants careful consideration in this context.
There is a general consensus in the literature that the social policy innovations introduced during the FHC administrations have been continued by subsequent Lula governments, albeit with varying nuances and emphases. It is further acknowledged that none of the administrations within this timeframe altered the universal principles or institutional framework of the Brazilian social protection system.
The social policy guidelines of FHC integrated the restructuring of universal social services with efforts to reduce poverty and inequality through targeted redistributive measures, particularly focusing on equalisation programmes. This strategic choice was influenced by the concept of 'targeting within universalism', emphasizing the importance of addressing specific needs within a universal framework.
Social policies were only partially compensatory, as they were often overshadowed by the necessity of budgetary adjustments. Certain innovations introduced fragmented approaches to poverty reduction efforts at both federal and local levels, resulting in what has been termed as 'indirect privatisations'. These practices, such as public-private partnerships for health service delivery within the SUS xi framework, became entrenched in subsequent decades. Despite the introduction of new programs, they proved inadequate in fully offsetting the losses experienced.
Relationships with national-level social movements, particularly those associated with AIDS, gained international visibility and spurred transnational activism, resulting in significant shifts in global policies aimed at managing the AIDS epidemic. Within multilateral platforms such as the WHO, UNDP, and Unaids, a notable sense of 'militancy' was evident among representatives from the federal bureaucracy and other non-state actors, all working towards advocating for the provision of HAART (highly active triple antiretroviral therapy) on both national and international scales.
Brazilian diplomacy achieved significant successes in this process. From 1986 onwards, it took a prominent stance in the formulation and endorsement of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in 1994, championing the interests of developing nations, forging alliances, and opposing the unilateral objectives of the United States. This pivotal agreement marked the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the same year.
In 1996, FHC implemented two contradictory laws: the Universal Access to HAART Act (SUS) and the new Patent Act23. The SUS law established early treatment for AIDS and HIV-positive individuals, emphasizing nationwide coverage and financing, in response to community activists and technocratic demands. On the other hand, the Patent Act23 favored countries and companies holding relevant patents, impeding domestic production of generic drugs while allowing for compulsory licensing. This internal conflict reflected the FHC government's international strategy.
This interpretation is reinforced by the successes of Brazilian diplomacy over the United States in the WTO regarding the disputes on patents (2001) and agricultural subsidies (2003). Collaboration among actors from Itamaraty and other ministries played a crucial role in both instances, along with the backing from national and transnational civil society. Nevertheless, there were uncertainties surrounding the efficacy of the TRIPS agreement. According to a key actor from Itamaraty, "When the TRIPS was signed [in 1994], many of us perceived it as a setback, but [at least] we had managed to preserve certain ambiguities [...] Nonetheless, it remains a constant struggle, far from being straightforward."
During the drafting and signing of the TRIPS agreement, Brazilian diplomats did not prioritize the health sector. It was only later that the significance of compulsory licensing for the production of generic drugs was acknowledged, particularly due to changing conditions and the pressing issue of access to medications for AIDS treatment. A key actor from Itamaraty highlighted that health matters were initially viewed as technical concerns and were only considered in relation to diplomacy on a peripheral basis, lacking significant diplomatic importance. From the perspective of official foreign policy, health issues were not deemed central.
The perspective shifted during the deliberations preceding the Fourth Ministerial Conference in Qatar in 2001, culminating in the adoption of the Doha Declaration that permitted the compulsory licensing of medications during public health crises. An interview with a key actor from Itamaraty highlighted this transformation, noting that the launch of the Doha Round in 2001 occurred amidst significant global changes, particularly in the context of the AIDS epidemic. These shifts in the global landscape influenced and motivated the strategies employed during the Doha Round negotiations, with what were initially perceived as ambiguities being reframed as flexibilities that were enshrined in the Declaration.
Numerous international initiatives across various forums and organizations have endorsed the notion of early AIDS treatment. Both international bodies and developing nations have shown a growing inclination towards universal treatment policies, accompanied by a rise in transnational advocacy endeavors. Notably, leading ARV pharmaceutical companies seem to have yielded to calls for reduced pricing and voluntary licensing of specific products in select regions, particularly in response to the looming specter of compulsory licensing and generic production, deftly wielded by Brazilian diplomacy during negotiations at the WTO, as highlighted in an interview with a key figure from Itamaraty.
José Serra's term as Minister of Health (MoH) from 1998 to 2002 had positive aspects beyond providing institutional stability. He did not assume the role at his own behest but rather accepted it to advance his electoral aspirations. His tenure as minister was characterized by his adept utilization of technical resources in the field to leave a political imprint. This was evident, for instance, during deliberations on the 2000 annual report of the World Health Organization (WHO), which evaluated member states' health systems using a composite performance index where Brazil (along with other nations) fared poorly. The methodology of this ranking was heavily scrutinized. Additionally, Serra's influence was notable during debates concerning the contentious issue of patents and access to AIDS medications.
Interviews with key stakeholders have confirmed that the minister has been actively engaged in personal battles to enhance visibility and garner support for his election campaign. Despite this, he is acknowledged for his significant contributions to international forums, where he has advocated positions that diverge from those of the government, aligned himself with other initiatives of Brazilian diplomacy, and played a crucial role in bolstering Brazil's presence and reputation on the global stage, particularly through engagements related to AIDS.
Serra, an economist who served as the minister of health, specialized in the field of generics. A significant alignment occurred with Celso Amorim in Geneva, where Amorim, with prior experience working in the Ministry of Science and Technology from 1977 to 1989, had been actively engaged in discussions on patents. He had been part of the resistance against patent law changes imposed by the Americans during the Sarney government in the mid-1980s, a pressure that persisted through the Collor government in the 1990s. Upon his return to Geneva in 1999-2000, these issues resurfaced, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing discourse surrounding patents and generics. This insight was gleaned from an interview with a key actor at Itamaraty.
According to an interview with a key actor from the Ministry of Health, Itamaraty was not explicitly opposed to or unsupportive of local medicine production. However, during that period, the ministry lacked the necessary determination to actively promote and advance this agenda.
International technical cooperation on HIV/AIDS played a pivotal role in Brazilian health diplomacy, serving as a key objective of the Brazilian National Programme and being institutionalized to enhance the international visibility of the Brazilian experience. This visibility was facilitated through the World Bank loans AIDS I (1994-1998) and AIDS II (1999-2003), and further bolstered by the establishment of the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (Unaids) in 1994. These initiatives not only solidified the national programme but also facilitated the implementation of triangular agreements for collaboration, involving cooperation between Brazil and developing countries with the support of aid donors. This model of collaboration reflects a traditional approach to international cooperation in Brazil.
The formalization of cooperation on AIDS began in 1996 with the establishment of the Horizontal Technical Cooperation Group on HIV/AIDS (HTCG). This group, led by the Brazilian National Programme, brought together AIDS national coordinators primarily from South American countries and collaborated with Unaids. The HTCG facilitated direct communication with national program directors, bypassing the official Ministry of Health channels like the Advisory Service on International Health Issues (Assessoria de Assuntos International de Saúde, AISA), which was formally established in 1998 under the Minister of Health Office. Administrative contacts with Itamaraty's Cooperation Agency (Agência Brasileira de Cooperação, ABC) were also established. Discussions initiated within these frameworks focused on the 'horizontal' (South-South) principles and values that would later come to define Brazilian cooperation efforts.
Brazil's experience was highlighted at the 13th International Conference on AIDS in Durban (July 9-14, 2000), where it challenged the stances of international agencies and put forth a new global consensus. The argument was made that boosting the production of antiretroviral drugs could be achieved by fostering competition and driving down drug prices, a notion that captured the interest of the Minister of Health, José Serra. Additionally, Brazilian professionals at the conference extended an offer of technical cooperation from Brazil on AIDS, presenting it as an innovative alternative to the conventional technical assistance provided by international organizations and agencies.
The Brazilian report presented at the Conference garnered positive reception both domestically and internationally, playing a pivotal role in enhancing collaboration between the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Itamaraty for formulating Brazil's stance at the 2001 Special Session of the UN General Assembly in New York (UNGASS-AIDS). This collaboration involved various Brazilian agencies and facilitated the alignment of positions and interventions among Southern countries at UNGASS, leading to the endorsement of universal access to antiretroviral drugs. Subsequently, Brazilian professionals became part of UNAIDS teams, and the inception of the first global civil society organizations, namely the Global Network of People Living with HIV (GNP+) and the International Council of AIDS Service Organizations (ICASO), ensued.
In 2002, the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Itamaraty) jointly initiated the International Cooperation Programme for HIV Control and Prevention Activities in Developing Countries (Programa de Cooperação Internacional para Ações de Controle e Prevenção do HIV para Países em Desenvolvimento, PCI). This program, in collaboration with the national HIV/AIDS program, solidified Brazil's technical cooperation efforts in the field of HIV/AIDS.
During the Lula administrations, existing policies were upheld but underwent significant modifications. Social initiatives were implemented to enhance the living standards of the most impoverished communities and areas, garnering political backing from a demographic distinct from the traditional base of social movements and labor unions that typically aligned with the party. Nonetheless, these efforts did not alter the underlying structural factors and determinants that perpetuated poverty and inequality.
In brief, the social policies implemented by PT governments revolved around conditional cash transfers facilitated through the Family Allowance Programme, commonly known as Bolsa Família (BF). Initiated in 2003, this comprehensive Programme consolidated various existing initiatives with the primary objective of alleviating both absolute and relative poverty among millions of Brazilians, all the while emphasizing the interconnectedness of poverty reduction with advancements in health and education.
The Bolsa Familia (BF) program was established in connection with the National Social Assistance Policy to address poverty and the rising levels of extreme poverty. Formulated in the 1990s through extensive discussions and civil society mobilization processes, the BF is considered part of a 'second generation' of social policies in Latin America, as noted by Eclac. This shift towards programs like the BF reflects the limited advancements in poverty reduction that have been observed since the 1990s.
The Basic Family Grant (BF) enhanced the existing cash transfer program by reaching approximately 28% of the population in 2016, effectively targeting and reducing poverty and extreme poverty. Despite its success, the BF did not establish itself as an inherent right and was susceptible to discontinuation or interruption. Another effective strategy was the elevation of the minimum wage, consequently increasing the value of social security benefits and transforming them into a potent redistributive tool. In summary, Lula's income policies, coupled with monetary stability and the economic growth resurgence during the second government term, facilitated a rise in formal employment opportunities.
In the realm of healthcare, the implementation of the SUS persisted with vocal political backing from the President, despite exacerbating underfunding due to the cessation of the CPMF in 2007. Nonetheless, Brazil's global standing was bolstered and enhanced by the tenets of a universal public health system and the mandatory license issued in 2008 for the manufacturing of the antiretroviral medication Efavirenz.
Lula's administration maintained the fundamental concept and strategic approach to international cooperation in combating AIDS, yet it notably broadened and diversified its execution with substantial involvement from Itamaraty and its associated agencies. The emphasis on international South-South cooperation within the Brazilian Foreign Policy (BFP) framework was significantly heightened during this period.
The third World Bank loan (AIDS III, 2004-2007) facilitated the expansion of the national programme's directorate to incorporate "consultative functions" and enhance triangular collaboration with international agencies and new donors. In 2005, a memorandum of understanding between the Ministries of Health and Itamaraty formalized more efficient operations within Itamaraty.
The collaborative endeavors between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to enhance technical cooperation on HIV/AIDS, particularly during the years 2005-2006, were meticulously coordinated and executed. These efforts involved engaging in dialogues with various government sectors and multiple nations to effectively propagate this policy on a global scale, as highlighted in an interview with a key actor from the Ministry of Health.
In 2005, the National AIDS Programme achieved recognition as the Unaids Technical Support Facility, leading to the creation of the International Centre for Technical Cooperation on HIV/AIDS (ICTC). This initiative facilitated the collaboration of various Brazilian and international institutions and organizations, functioning as a unified network with shared governance. The successful execution of cooperative efforts by the national program within this expansive partnership and funding framework demanded a significant level of coordination.
The focus of concern revolved around the manufacturing and dissemination of pharmaceuticals, sparking a global dialogue on patent regulations. This period marked a pinnacle of effective coordination, as the alignment of national priorities with international frameworks was meticulously orchestrated, reflecting the collaborative efforts of the health and diplomatic sectors as emphasized in an interview with a key actor from the Ministry of Health.
Between 2007 and 2010, there were consistent working sessions held with the Minister of Foreign Affairs to address health-related matters, marking a significant qualitative shift. It is crucial to emphasize the collaborative efforts of various government entities such as agencies, the Ministries of Commerce, Science and Technology, and Health, the Diplomatic Service, the Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Court of Audit in formulating cohesive strategies aimed at ensuring robust policy choices that were legally defensible, as exemplified by the case of compulsory licensing of Efavirenz, as noted in an interview with a key actor from the Ministry of Health.
The external funding provided to ICTC allowed for the engagement of higher-caliber external professionals as consultants to address the diverse cooperation requirements of various countries, resulting in internal discord within the Ministry of Health. Concurrently, the agendas of international partners encroached upon the decision-making processes of Brazilian cooperation efforts.
In 2009, the Ministry of Health underwent internal restructuring, leading to the establishment of the National Department of Sexual Transmissible Diseases (STDs/AIDS) and Viral Hepatitis, which operated jointly under the National Health Surveillance Secretariat. Simultaneously, modifications were implemented in the World Bank-funded activities (AIDS-SUS) with a focus on enhancing planning horizontality and fostering integration across government levels, thereby gradually reshaping the institutional framework for AIDS control. It was within this department that tensions within the ministry's techno-bureaucracy began to surface, as indicated by a key-actor interview at the MoH. Despite these internal shifts, the operational aspects of the programme remained unaffected during this period, with the department maintaining collaboration with social movements. Notably, the National AIDS programme allocated resources towards initiatives aimed at combating stigma and discrimination, such as supporting events like gay parades, through the Programme of Actions and Goals, which facilitated the transfer of funds to states and municipalities, as highlighted in another key-actor interview at the MoH.
Efforts to align cooperation on AIDS with ABC/Itamaraty practices, leveraging the national program's expertise in dialogue mediation and leadership both domestically and internationally, faced resistance from international stakeholders, undermining Brazil's ability to independently make decisions in this realm. Consequently, in 2010, following the expiration of the second Memorandum of Understanding with Unaids, the Brazilian government opted to depart from this framework. Subsequently, the management of the ICTC was transferred to ABC/Itamaraty, with the Ministry of Health assuming the primary role in funding cooperation efforts. Shortly thereafter, the ICTC was ultimately shut down.
South-South cooperation in health has been increasingly emphasized in official Ministry of Health (MoH) documents, including the "2004-2007 National Health Plan: a pact for health in Brazil" and the "More Health: Everyone's Right 2008-2011," along with their subsequent iterations up to 2015. This emphasis is closely tied to the "internationalization of the MoH" and highlights successful experiences within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in areas such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, and smoking control, all of which are explicitly linked with foreign policy considerations.
Lula's approach of connecting poverty, hunger, and development stemmed not only from the AIDS crisis but also from the pressures of civil society. Following extensive political and economic deliberations, Lula's administration embraced the 'Zero Hunger' ('Fome Zero') initiative as its central policy proposal. The concept of 'poverty reduction' had long been a focal point for the World Bank, dating back to McNamara's tenure (1968-1981), aiming to transform the Bank into a 'development agency.' By the 1990s, the World Bank had expanded its involvement in health matters, solidifying its influence in this domain. The Bank had already placed poverty and global health on its agenda, reflecting a growing commitment to addressing these critical issues.
The matter was revisited during the Meeting of Heads of State on "Combating Hunger and Poverty," which took place at the United Nations Headquarters in New York (UN) at the behest of the Presidents of Brazil, France, Chile, and Spain, concurrently with the UN General Assembly on September 20, 2004. The proposition put forth was to consolidate efforts towards a shared objective and explore strategies to attain it.
A policy aimed at addressing hunger necessitates the restoration of sustainable economic growth accompanied by increased employment opportunities and rising incomes. Additionally, it requires addressing the significant disparities present in the global economy to achieve a more balanced trade relationship between nations and alleviate financial burdens on developing countries. Merely placing demands on wealthy nations is insufficient; it is imperative to engage impoverished nations in the process. Developing countries cannot remain passive observers but must actively contribute to these efforts, as emphasized in President Lula's opening speech at the 2004 meeting.
Prepared by the four countries, a technical report discussed innovative financing mechanisms aimed at initiating a new phase in the battle against hunger and poverty, necessitating multilateral negotiations and potentially voluntary adoption, as highlighted in President Lula's speech at the meeting in 2004. This rhetoric has been echoed in various global conferences and summits on development, such as the 2005 New York Declaration on Innovative Sources of Financing for Development.
However, Brazil failed to establish Zero Hunger as an international policy.
Meeting the president's directives to address hunger proved to be a challenging task, prompting a shift in focus towards improving access to medicines. This shift presented a tangible health-related opportunity that not only involved multiple countries but also promised to impact the ongoing battles against hunger and poverty. Consequently, efforts were redirected towards enhancing access to medicines, with the underlying goal of contributing to the broader fight against hunger and poverty. This strategic pivot ultimately led to the establishment of UNITAID, marking a significant milestone in the global health landscape. Reflecting on this shift, a key actor from Itamaraty noted, "[…] I think that from then on [2004] we have become more aware that health is of great importance. There were initiatives before, but they were rather sparse."
The establishment of UNITAID in 2006 represents a significant development in this trajectory, as elucidated by Jorge Bermudez, a Brazilian national and former director of the organization.
UNITAID is a pioneering financial institution that employs market-driven mechanisms to enhance the availability of treatment and diagnosis for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The organization aims to strike a balance between reducing drug prices and guaranteeing high quality, swift availability, and widespread access.
In essence, the Bolsa Familia program, the tenets of the Unified Health System (SUS), governance mechanisms, and the intricate interplay between hunger, poverty, and structural factors gave rise to a set of values and principles that were effectively synchronized, extensively propagated, and globally embraced through addresses delivered by President Lula and diplomatic envoys, as well as in collaborative health initiatives within the framework of South-South cooperation.
The concept of 'Brazilian health diplomacy' can be comprehensively grasped by framing Brazilian foreign policy as a public policy and analyzing the influence of social policy, including health policy, on the development and execution of foreign policy during a specific timeframe, alongside the impact of politics on this discourse. A pivotal aspect of this understanding lies in the emphasis placed on 'social' issues within Brazil's global engagements, a trend that originated from the pressures exerted by civil society movements.
The transition in Brazil from military dictatorship to democracy brought about significant changes that were evident across all public policies, including foreign policy. The government initiated collaborations with a diverse array of traditional and non-governmental entities, addressing various agendas in multiple spheres. The evolving global landscape, influenced by international developments and globalization, intersected with domestic concerns, sparking dialogues on a plethora of topics and expanding Brazil's international engagements. This diversification created opportunities for extensive political mobilization and advocacy, notwithstanding the persistent structural disparities and disparities among nations within the global system.
The health sector also has a rich history of antecedents. Since the 1960s, Brazil has been at the forefront of pioneering initiatives that have later been adopted globally. Brazilian personnel brought these experiences to PAHO and subsequently to WHO, introducing several primary health care concepts in Brazil a dozen years prior to Alma-Ata. This trend extends to areas such as human resources, social determinants of health, and more. It can be argued that the concept of 'Collective Health,' coined in Brazil during the 1970s, was essentially born internationalized. Major health movements in Brazil and the Latin American region, including social medicine, strategic health sector planning, and health care reform, have had strong ties to international institutions, actors, and ideas, collaborating closely with them since the 1950s.
In Brazil, there has been a longstanding concern among a significant portion of healthcare professionals and key institutions such as Fiocruz, the National Cancer Institute, and the Butantan Institute regarding the imperative to solidify SUS as a universal public system, fortify health services and activities as a public good, and recognize health as a fundamental element of development. The enhancement of the healthcare system has consistently been a focal point for Brazilian delegates at the World Health Organization.
Brazilian actors played an increasingly significant role in these discussions, which had been evolving gradually since the onset of the political transition period (1985-1990) and gained momentum in the 1990s. This marked a crucial step in the restoration of democracy in Brazilian society, as social movements expanded - driven by sectoral (e.g., health care reform) and thematic (e.g., combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic) concerns - advocating for social, human, voice, and voting rights, as well as universal public policies in solidarity. This activism added depth to the fight against dictatorship and the political transition. The involvement of activist professionals in the state apparatus further solidified this practice, suggesting that Brazil was engaging in a form of 'health diplomacy' even before the term was coined.
During the two Lula administrations, the issue of health finally found its place within Brazil's foreign policy agenda, marking a significant shift in the country's international presence and prestige. This period saw the consolidation and invigoration of Brazilian health diplomacy, which attained a level of 'autonomy' within the health sector, thanks to the active involvement and dedication of various state and non-state actors associated with social movements and governmental structures. Concurrently, the 'internationalisation of Brazilian domestic politics' capitalized on these internal advancements, aligning with the nation's strategies for global ascension and forging connections with South-South cooperation. This dynamic reshaped historical dialogues that had influenced the Brazilian government's post-democracy initiatives, ushering in a new era of engagement on the international stage.
During the period from 2003 to 2010, South-South cooperation in health emerged as a significant foreign policy strategy, particularly in leveraging and sustaining Brazilian health diplomacy. This approach, primarily directed towards Africa and Latin America, operated on a demand-driven basis. Brazilian foreign policy during this time embraced a professed ethic of solidarity among developing nations, emphasizing a political dimension that facilitated cooperation among countries seeking to bolster their bilateral and multilateral alliances to enhance their bargaining power on the global stage.
Brazilian diplomatic activism in the health field encompasses the actions of specific health policy circles within national and global sociopolitical environments, as well as the activities of diplomats in specific periods and on specific issues. This activism operates on two main lines: one focused on national and transnational advocacy, and the other on coordinated activities involving Brazilian diplomats and representatives of other agencies in international arenas, often in collaboration with civil society and state apparatus activists. The intersection of internal and external variables in the formulation and implementation of these policies is crucial to understanding this dynamic. This internal-external interrelation is evident in Brazil's leading role in the preparation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control since the 1980s, which combined the expertise of Brazil's tobacco use control policy, an initiative of the National Institute of Cancer, with the effective actions of Brazilian diplomacy in international arenas.
Despite the significance of these advancements, they do not imply that all actors hold equal influence both within their own countries and on the global stage. Furthermore, social activism does not necessarily directly translate into a country's foreign policy, although it could play a role in shaping and executing effective temporary domestic policies and extending its challenges to an international platform. The internationalization of values and principles does not automatically manifest as a mere replication of other nations' politics or as a duplication of processes instigated by a distinct national setting.
Social advocacy plays a crucial role, yet its efficacy hinges on the collaboration of other key stakeholders and the support of institutionalized national and international public policies. The stability of these policies can be undermined by political alliances, as institutions are inherently process-oriented, as elucidated by Jönsson & Hall (2005) and referenced by Almeida81. These institutions rely on a combination of formal and informal rules that dictate behavior, impose constraints, and shape expectations, making them susceptible to change in varying contexts and circumstances. Indeed, institutional frameworks have continuously evolved and adjusted in response to the interactions among stakeholders, a dynamic process fraught with conflicts and uncertainties.
From this perspective, consistent advocacy alone may not suffice to instigate change in national and international political arenas. Nonetheless, it plays a crucial role in sustaining the fight for human rights and fostering solidarity among different populations. Hence, there is a pressing need for more methodical and thorough research to explore the potential and constraints of the connections between health and global relations.
