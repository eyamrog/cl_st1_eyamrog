In producing this issue of RAE, we were struck by the profound impact of the global spread of COVID-19. The current situation, as I write in early April in São Paulo, mirrors the apocalyptic themes of Lars Von Trier's film Melancholia. The unpredictable nature of the pandemic's trajectory in Brazil adds a layer of uncertainty to our academic journal's carefully planned schedule, with articles and forums for 2020 and even 2021 already in progress. Anticipating a potential decrease in submissions next year due to the ongoing crisis, we remain hopeful that the field of business administration will witness a surge in creative scientific output in the years ahead. While we lack a crystal ball to foresee the exact changes that lie ahead, ongoing discussions point towards significant transformations in various domains. These include the complexities of organizational behavior, the crucial role of leadership and engagement during crises, evolving work structures, the impact of social media marketing and online retail, the growing importance of humanitarian logistics, the realm of behavioral finance, corporate responsibility towards human rights and social impact, sustainability aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, health management, and the dynamics of public-private partnerships. The dawn of the 21st century seems to have truly arrived, prompting questions about the future of globalization, travel patterns, and business education. Despite the distressing circumstances, the surge in scientific research offers a glimmer of hope, inspiring professors and researchers alike. As we navigate this challenging period, the post-pandemic world beckons with opportunities for rebuilding and innovation. Scientific journals across disciplines are issuing calls for papers addressing the new reality, research centers are forging collaborations for joint projects, and funding agencies are stepping up to support initiatives. While uncertainties loom large, the current crisis has sparked a wave of creativity in exploring novel approaches to management and governance.
The forum presented in this issue of Organizational Studies proves to be invaluable, particularly in the context of integrating studies with colleagues in Latin America. It prompts a critical examination of the principles that have traditionally guided research in the field. Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz, the president of Fapesp, emphasizes the significance of internationalizing research for scientific advancement. This dedicated issue on Latin America challenges the established principles that have shaped the growth of Organizational Studies in the region. The works included in this issue delve into various aspects: "Organizational Studies in Latin America: Towards a research agenda" by Diego Szlechter et al., "To think from Latin America in dialogue with the organization of decolonial social struggles: Exploring possibilities" by Maria Ceci Misoczky and Guilherme Dornelas Camara, "Organizational Studies in Latin America: back to the rough ground!" by Diego René Gonzales-Miranda, "Experiencing Agreste: Trials for research about people and business in a peripheral context" by Marcio Sá, "No politics, no society: Questioning the justification of entrepreneurship in Chilean public policies" by Oriana Bernasconi and Juan Felipe Espinosa-Cristia, "Tupi, or not Tupi that is the question": Amerindian perspectivism and Organizational Studies" by Sergio Eduardo de Pinho Velho Wanderley and Ana Paula Medeiros Bauer, and "Organizing the Organizational Studies in Chile: History of the creation of the Minga Group" by Gregorio Perez-Arrau et al.
The essay "Where did we come from, where are we going? A collective self-criticism and desirable horizons for Organizational Studies in Brazil," authored by Marcio Sá, Rafael Alcadipani, Ariston Azevedo, Ariádne Scalfoni Rigo, and Luiz Alex Silva Saraiva, serves as a conclusive contribution to this issue. The authors not only delve into the central theme of this forum but also offer critical insights and perspectives on the trajectory and future directions of Organizational Studies in Brazil.
