In January 2020, a novel coronavirus has been announced 
as the etiologic pathogen of COVID-19 disease that had 
become a major epidemic threat in China.   It has widely 
spread since December 2019 not only in China but also in 
many countries around the world, which became a major 
challenge for public health.1,2  World Health Organization 
(WHO) announced COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in 
March 2020 and it constitutes a public health emergency of 
international concern.3 As of April 20, 2020, there have been 
more than 2.3 million confirmed cases and 157.000 deaths 
globally.4 COVID-19 consequences on the global economy 
and financial crisis are already tangible.  Quarantines, 
disruptions of daily life, travel, work, school education and 
social isolation that occurred worldwide may have impacting 
consequences on mental health.5 

Previous public health emergencies have demonstrated to 
have an influence on mental health.6 Literature shows that 
psychological reactions to previous epidemics and pandemics 
depend on individual vulnerability such as intolerance of 
uncertainty, perceived vulnerability to disease, and anxiety.6 
In the current situation, there are many uncertainties 
concerning SARS-CoV-2 origin, nature, government capacity 
to prevent the spread of infection, and seriousness of the 
risk.7 Moreover, the lack of faith in the healthcare system 
to deal with new cases, worries about becoming infected, 
fear of death, increase in hygienic and avoidance behaviors, 
lack of information and misinformation fuel excessive fear 
and create an environment of anxiety and depression 
that interfere with basic daily activities, including sleep 
quality.7,8,9  In addition, people who are quarantined lose 
social connections and feelings of loneliness and anger may 
develop.10,11  It has already been well documented the strong 
impact that COVID-19 is having on the psychological 
issues in China, where a significant portion of 
population has reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.12 
Medical health-care workers, mainly females, are also 
facing increased levels of anxiety and stress.9,13  

It is well established the importance of psychosocial 
factors in development and maintenance of 
Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) and the high 
prevalence of psychological disturbances in TMD 
patients, mainly in those who suffer from masticatory 
muscle disorders.14-16 Moreover, there is a significant 
relationship between painful TMD, depression, 
and anxiety.16-19 All psychological issues involved 
in emergency and threatening situations like the 
ones faced with COVID-19 pandemic are able to 
trigger a chain of events that culminate with higher 
levels of sympathetic activity and further release 
of adrenocortical steroids which lead to muscle 
vasoconstriction and increased peripheral vascular 
resistance.  Feelings of warmth and cold, palpitations, 
tachycardia, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and 
constipation can all be the consequences of autonomic 
stress responses.20  All these events are supposed to 
create/perpetuate a situation of system overloading, 
a common finding in TMD patients. The autonomic 
impairment may also lead to increased sympathetic 
drive and sensation of hyperarousal which create and 
perpetuate any sleep disturbance.21 If maintained, this 
cycle may play an important role in pain maintenance, 
especially in psychological vulnerable individuals. 
Hence, the occurrence of post-pandemic signs and 
symptoms of chronic orofacial pains, including TMD, 
is expected in a very similar pattern to well described 
posttraumatic stress syndrome.

The association between bruxism and psychological 
aspects has been documented,22-27 although the 
intensity of sleep bruxism has not been associated 
to self-reported stress, depression, TMD or TMD-
related pain.22-24   A recent systematic review, 
however, reported that some specific symptoms of the 
anxiety disorders spectrum might have association to 
probable sleep bruxism.25 Awake bruxism, in contrast, 
has psychosocial factors such as anxiety, stress and 
difficulty in identifying and describing feelings as 
important as somatic causes in its occurrence and 
maintenance.26 Patients with high levels of stress are 
almost 6 times more likely to report awake bruxism.27 
Sustained muscle contraction of head and neck is 
also related to a required body posture associated 
to fight-or-flight response. Therefore, muscle 
contraction in awake bruxism could be part of the 
defense behavior associated with anxiety and stress.28 
The anxiety-related processes occur in the CNS and 
involves interactions among prefrontal cortex, limbic, 
paralimbic structures (amygdala, insula, anterior 
cingulate gyrus) and motor regions of the brain stem 
that leads to motor and physiological responses 
not only to stress, but also increased alertness and 
attention.29 Under non-stress conditions, the prefrontal 
cortex (PFC) regions regulate behavior, thought and 
emotion, including inhibition of inappropriate motor 
responses. However, in stressful conditions, the 
amygdala activates pathways in the hypothalamus 
and brainstem and impairs PFC regulation.30      

Moreover, it is important to highlight that some 
other long-term effects of COVID-19 may be described 
in the future and deserve attention.  Viral infections in 
the nervous system may lead to meningoencephalitis 
and neuropathies as seen for herpesviruses, Zika virus, 
and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).31,32,33  Since 
SARS-CoV-2 infection has caused central nervous 
system manifestations,34,35 possible consequences as 
neuropathic pain states may also be a possible long 
term manifestation of the pandemic.

In conclusion, COVID-19 outbreak may lead 
to major impacts in applied oral sciences for the 
next years.  Remarkably, it could be expected that 
psychological factors associated to pandemic may 
lead to a greater risk of developing, worsening and 
perpetuating bruxism (mainly awake bruxism) and 
TMD.  Orofacial pain specialists should be aware of 
this fact. Guidelines for patient’s education, self-
management, home care and relaxations techniques 
are already available on the WEB and are useful tools 
in times of social isolation and pain.
