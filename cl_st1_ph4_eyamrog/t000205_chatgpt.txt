The COVID-19 infection is characterized by its high transmissibility, prompting the implementation of various measures aimed at controlling its spread.
Objective: The aim of this study was to identify and consolidate evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews (SR) pertaining to strategies for managing the spread of COVID-19 infection. Study Design: This review of Cochrane SR was conducted within the Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and the Division of Emergency Medicine and Evidence-Based Medicine at the Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil.
Methods: A thorough search conducted in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews yielded all Cochrane SRs directly pertinent to control measures for the dissemination of COVID-19. The key features and findings of each included SR were succinctly outlined and deliberated upon.
Results: The qualitative synthesis incorporated three Cochrane Systematic Reviews, which assessed both populational and individual measures aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19.
The findings suggest that implementing quarantine measures for individuals exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases can lead to a significant reduction in incident cases and deaths, with estimates ranging from 44% to 81% and 31% to 63%, respectively, compared to no interventions. Moreover, the study indicates that the earlier these quarantine measures are put in place, the more cost-effective they become. Additionally, the research highlights the importance of clear communication regarding infection control and prevention guidelines in ensuring the successful implementation of such measures. Furthermore, it was observed that individuals wearing long gowns had lower contamination rates compared to those in coveralls, although the latter proved to be more challenging to remove. The study underscores the need for further systematic reviews to enhance strategies aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 infection.
The disease caused by the novel coronavirus, known as Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), is a respiratory tract infection that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. While many individuals infected with COVID-19 experience mild symptoms or an uncomplicated infection, approximately 14% develop a severe form of the disease necessitating hospitalization and oxygen support, with 5% requiring intensive care unit admission. This virus primarily spreads among individuals through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing, but can also be transmitted via contaminated surfaces. The incubation period typically ranges from 5 to 6 days in most cases, but can extend up to 14 days. The infectious period is not precisely defined, with transmission possible 24 to 48 hours before symptom onset, and a high viral load detected in the upper respiratory tract at the disease's outset.
During the emergence of a widespread respiratory infection like the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative for healthcare professionals to strictly adhere to established protocols to prevent contamination and infection. These protocols encompass the utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks, face shields, gloves, and gowns, alongside patient isolation and rigorous cleaning procedures. Given the practical challenges associated with consistently following these strategies, it is essential for healthcare authorities and facilitators to provide the necessary support to enable healthcare professionals in their implementation.
During epidemics and pandemics involving highly infectious diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, and COVID-19, health professionals face the greatest risk of infection as a result of their direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected patients.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends quarantine, which involves isolation along with other public health measures, as a strategy to control the spread of infections. Quarantine and social isolation are both epidemiological interventions aimed at mitigating infectious diseases and decreasing the likelihood of transmission. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these measures, along with other strategies to manage the pandemic, continues to be a topic of ongoing debate.
Various countries implement interventions to control the spread of infections, including both individual and collective measures like the utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE), social isolation, and mandatory quarantine. However, the effectiveness of these strategies necessitates further research to provide substantial evidence.
This study sought to identify and consolidate evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews (SR) on strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19 infection.
This review of the Cochrane Systematic Review was conducted at the Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and the Division of Emergency Medicine and Evidence-Based Medicine at the Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil.
All complete Cochrane Systematic Reviews (SRs) that have been published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) were eligible for inclusion in this study, without any limitations on the publication date. Any withdrawn or outdated versions of systematic reviews and protocols for systematic reviews were deemed irrelevant and therefore excluded from the analysis.
All participants, regardless of gender, age, severity of condition, or treatment location (outpatient or hospital), who were at risk of contagion, exhibited suspected clinical symptoms, or had confirmed COVID-19 infection were deemed pertinent for inclusion in the study.
We reviewed systematic reviews (SRs) that assessed interventions aimed at controlling the spread or reducing the contagion of COVID-19 infection, comparing them to standard care or another intervention in at least one arm of the study.
All epidemiological, clinical, or laboratory findings pertinent to the patient were taken into account, as evaluated by the authors of the included systematic review (SR).
On April 26, 2020, we conducted a meticulous systematic search on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) through Wiley. Our search utilized MeSH terms such as 'Coronavirus Infections' and 'Coronavirus', encompassing all relevant variants, alongside free terms within titles, abstracts, and keywords. The comprehensive electronic search strategy is outlined in Table 1.
Two researchers (RLGF and LCUN) independently evaluated the titles and abstracts to determine if the systematic review (SR) met the inclusion criteria utilizing the Rayyan software (rayyan.qcri.org/welcome). Any discrepancies were resolved through consultation with other authors (PIFP and CDQF) or through discussion. The systematic reviews were chosen and summarized by two authors (RLGF, PIFP).
The search results and the systematic reviews (SRs) that were included were presented through a qualitative synthesis using a descriptive approach.
Our search strategy yielded 19 references, from which six systematic reviews (SRs) were pre-selected following a screening of titles and abstracts. Upon a thorough evaluation of the full texts, three reviews were found to meet the inclusion criteria and were subsequently included in the qualitative summary.
The most recent iterations of all the incorporated Systematic Reviews (SRs) were released in April 2020 within the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). Table 2 outlines comprehensive information on the review design, intervention characteristics, comparisons, results, and the level of certainty or confidence in the evidence presented in these SRs.
A rapid review was conducted to provide support for the World Health Organization's quarantine-related measures following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Nussbaumer-Streit et al. conducted a systematic review with abbreviated methods (rapid review) to assess two key questions (KQ): 1) the impacts of quarantine (whether isolated or in conjunction with other public health measures) on individuals who had been in contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 2) the effects of quarantine on individuals who have either traveled from countries with a declared pandemic or reside in regions with high disease transmission rates.
The systematic review (SR) authors incorporated 29 studies into their analysis, comprising 10 modelling studies on COVID-19, four observational studies, and 15 modelling studies on SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as outlined in Table 2. Owing to the disparities in measurement and analysis methods across the results of interest, a meta-analysis could not be conducted, leading the SR authors to present a narrative synthesis of the data. Employing the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach, the level of evidence ranged from low to very low due to the nature of evidence available for this systematic review.
Modeling studies have demonstrated the efficacy of simulated quarantine measures, with findings indicating that quarantining individuals exposed to confirmed or suspected cases can prevent a substantial percentage of incident cases and deaths, ranging from 44% to 81% and 31% to 63%, respectively, compared to scenarios with no measures in place. These results were observed across various settings and were supported by multiple modeling studies conducted on COVID-19 and SARS, albeit with low-certainty evidence. Additionally, research suggests that implementing quarantine measures early can lead to cost savings, as indicated by two modeling studies on SARS. However, evidence regarding the effectiveness of quarantining travelers from countries with reported outbreaks was found to have a limited impact on reducing disease incidence and mortality, based on two modeling studies on SARS. Furthermore, when quarantine measures were combined with other preventive strategies such as school closures, travel restrictions, and social distancing, modeling studies revealed a more pronounced effect in reducing new cases, transmissions, and deaths compared to implementing these measures individually. These combined findings were consistent across studies conducted on COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, highlighting the importance of comprehensive approaches to disease control and prevention.
This systematic review (SR) focused on transmission, reducing mortality, and the allocation of quarantine resources as outcomes of interest selected by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, the SR authors did not incorporate an analysis of the psychological impact of quarantine on individuals. It is crucial to acknowledge that there could be additional adverse economic and health consequences resulting from quarantine that were not evaluated in this review, such as effects on quality of life, unemployment, and domestic violence. Consequently, this SR was unable to address the question of when quarantine and other public health measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 should be eased or restricted. Furthermore, the SR authors did not subject two modeling studies, which discuss resource utilization, to specific critical assessments for economic evaluations. They also refrained from drawing conclusions on the relative costs or effectiveness of quarantine in isolation or in conjunction with other measures compared to these individual public health interventions or measures.
This systematic review demonstrates the crucial role of quarantine in mitigating the incidence and mortality rates amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is important to note that the evidence primarily stems from modeling studies that rely on assumptions derived from existing knowledge. The timely initiation of quarantine measures, coupled with the integration of other public health interventions, has been shown to be pivotal in enhancing the overall effectiveness of containment strategies. It is imperative for policymakers to maintain a vigilant stance by consistently monitoring the evolving outbreak dynamics and evaluating the efficacy of the implemented measures. Conducting widespread testing across diverse settings can aid in gauging the actual prevalence of infections and thereby reducing the uncertainties associated with modeling assumptions.
This rapid review focuses on synthesizing evidence regarding the factors influencing health professionals' adherence to infection control and prevention (ICP) protocols for respiratory diseases. These protocols encompass the utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, face shields, gloves, and aprons, patient isolation in cases of infectious respiratory diseases, and the implementation of more stringent cleaning routines. The review authors specifically conducted their search on the MEDLINE database through OVID, encompassing various primary studies without imposing restrictions on publication date or language. To evaluate the confidence in each outcome, the review authors employed the GRADE-CERQual approach (Trust in Evidence from Qualitative Research Reviews).
The systematic review authors identified 36 pertinent studies, with 20 studies undergoing qualitative analysis for this review. No meta-analysis was conducted, and the findings were presented descriptively (refer to Table 2). Among the included studies, ten were conducted in Asia, four in Africa, four in Central America and North America, and two in Australia. These studies shed light on the perspectives and experiences of nurses, doctors, and other healthcare professionals managing SARS, Influenza A (H1N1), MERS, tuberculosis (TB), or seasonal influenza. The majority of the participating healthcare professionals were based in hospitals and primary care settings.
The factors identified in this study, whether acting as barriers or facilitators, have been evaluated with a level of confidence ranging from moderate to high.
Health professionals expressed feelings of uncertainty when faced with lengthy and ambiguous local guidelines that deviated from national or international standards. The constant evolution of these guidelines added to their sense of being overwhelmed. Additionally, they highlighted the impact of infection control and prevention (ICP) strategies on their workload and fatigue, citing examples such as the requirement to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and engage in heightened cleaning protocols. The level of support provided by their management team was noted as a crucial factor influencing their adherence to ICP guidelines.
Clear communication of infection control and prevention (ICP) guidelines was deemed essential by health professionals. They highlighted the insufficient training provided on the infection itself and the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Additionally, the absence of mandatory training was identified as a significant issue.
Adequate space for patient isolation was deemed crucial, with the absence of isolation rooms, antechambers, and showers posing a significant challenge. Health professionals also emphasized the importance of practical measures such as reducing overcrowding, promptly screening infected patients, limiting visitor access, and ensuring convenient availability of handwashing facilities.
The insufficient availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the substandard quality of equipment emerged as significant concerns among healthcare workers and administrators. Additionally, they emphasized the necessity of adapting the quantity of supplies in response to ongoing infection outbreaks.
Health professionals were more inclined to adhere to infection control and prevention (ICP) guidelines when they comprehended the significance of these protocols. Motivation to comply with the guidelines stemmed from concerns about personal and familial infection risks, as well as a sense of responsibility towards patients. However, some professionals encountered challenges in using masks and other protective gear, particularly when it led to patient isolation, fear, or stigma. Additionally, discomfort associated with wearing masks and equipment posed further obstacles. The workplace culture played a pivotal role in shaping professionals' adherence to ICP guidelines.
In numerous instances, health professionals emphasized the significance of incorporating all staff members, such as cleaning personnel, doorkeepers, kitchen staff, and other support personnel, in the implementation of Infection Control and Prevention (ICP) guidelines.
Several factors can act as barriers to effective infection control and prevention strategies. One significant issue is the lack of alignment between national and international protocols, which can result in uncertainty among healthcare professionals when trying to adhere to them. Additionally, the shortage of personal protective equipment or the provision of substandard materials can lead to discomfort and compromise safety. Even when healthcare workers have access to regulations, it can be difficult to comply with protocols, particularly in high-pressure or critical situations.
The review authors highlight various factors that impact health professionals' adherence to ICP guidelines in managing respiratory diseases. These factors encompass aspects related to the guideline's clarity and communication, managerial support, workplace culture, training, physical infrastructure, availability and trust in personal protective equipment, and the motivation to deliver high-quality patient care. Additionally, the review underscores the significance of involving all facility staff, including support teams, in the implementation of ICP guidelines.
During outbreaks of epidemics or pandemics, healthcare professionals face heightened infection risks stemming from increased exposure to infected patients' bodily fluids. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) serves as a crucial tool in mitigating this risk. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of various full-body PPE types and dressing/undressing methods in minimizing contamination and infection risks for healthcare workers. Additionally, the study seeks to identify effective training strategies that can enhance healthcare professionals' adherence to safety protocols.
The systematic review (SR) authors incorporated 24 studies encompassing 2,278 participants in their analysis. Among these, 14 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one was a quasi-RCT, and nine followed a non-randomized design. Within the pool of 24 studies, eight delved into comparing various types of personal protective equipment (PPE), six assessed adapted PPE, eight scrutinized dressing and undressing procedures, and three focused on different training methodologies. A predominant 18 studies utilized simulated exposure scenarios involving fluorescent markers or benign microbes. In these simulation studies, the average contamination rates stood at 25% for the intervention groups and 67% for the control groups.
The certainty of the evidence for all results is generally deemed to be very low, unless explicitly stated otherwise. This low certainty arises from the reliance on a limited number of studies, the utilization of indirect evidence in simulation studies, and the potential for bias in the studies included in the analysis (refer to Table 2).
The utilization of an energized respirator and air purifier in conjunction with coveralls has been shown to offer superior protection against contamination risks compared to an N95 mask and gown, as indicated by a relative risk (RR) of 0.27 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 0.17 to 0.43. However, it was noted that this combination was more challenging to wear, with a non-conformity relative risk of 7.5 and a 95% CI of 1.81 to 31.1. In a randomized controlled trial involving 59 participants, individuals wearing long gowns exhibited lower levels of contamination in comparison to those wearing overalls, with the latter being reported as more cumbersome to wear, although the certainty of this evidence was deemed to be low. Furthermore, it was observed that long aprons (gowns) offer better protection against contamination than short aprons, with a mean difference (MD) of -10.28 and a 95% CI ranging from -14.77 to -5.79. Personal protective equipment (PPE) crafted from more breathable materials was found to result in a similar number of stains on the trunk when compared to water-repellent materials, with an MD of 1.60 and a 95% CI ranging from -0.15 to 3.35. However, the former material type was associated with higher user satisfaction levels, as indicated by an MD of -0.46 and a 95% CI ranging from -0.84 to -0.08 on a scale from 1 to 5.
Several modifications to the design of personal protective equipment (PPE) have been identified that could potentially reduce contamination when compared to standard PPE. These include the combination of a sealed gown and gloves (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), a more appropriate fit around the neck, wrists, and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), improved coverage of the dress-wrist interface (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78, with evidence of low certainty), as well as the inclusion of additional guides to aid in the proper donning of masks (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31).
Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations has been shown to result in reduced contamination levels in comparison to situations where no guidance is followed (small spots: MD -5.44, 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45). The simultaneous removal of gloves and gown has been associated with decreased bacterial contamination (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) but not a significant reduction in fluorescent contamination levels (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28) when compared to the separate removal of these protective items.
The utilization of double gloves has been shown to result in reduced viral or bacterial contamination in comparison to single gloves (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66), although it does not significantly decrease fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, CI 95% 0.75 to 1.28). Moreover, the provision of additional verbal instructions has been associated with a decrease in execution errors (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4) and a reduction in points of contamination (MD -5, 95% CI -8.08 to -1.92).
Incorporating supplementary computer simulations has the potential to decrease errors in the process significantly (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7). When comparing a video lecture on PPE placement to a conventional lecture, the former yields higher skill scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26). Furthermore, face-to-face instructions have been shown to be more effective in reducing non-compliance with guidelines in contrast to solely providing folders or videos (odds ratio (OR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98).
The utilization of different components of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) induces discomfort during its application, potentially heightening the likelihood of healthcare professionals becoming contaminated while removing it.
Wearing an energized respirator and air purifier in conjunction with overalls posed greater difficulty (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1).
This systematic review (SR) revealed low to very low-certainty evidence suggesting that increased coverage of the body results in better protection, although such PPE is typically more challenging to wear or produce and may offer less user comfort, potentially leading to increased contamination. PPE that is more breathable may still result in similar levels of contamination but can enhance user satisfaction. Implementing modifications to PPE design, such as incorporating gripping guides, can help reduce the risk of contamination. Adhering to CDC guidelines for placement and manufacturing procedures, including removing gloves and gowns simultaneously, double gloving, providing verbal instructions during execution, and disinfecting gloves, can effectively decrease contamination rates and improve compliance. Furthermore, face-to-face training on PPE usage has been shown to reduce errors more effectively than training based on printed materials like folders.
The systematic review authors assert the necessity for further randomized controlled trials (RCTs) incorporating extended follow-up periods, as well as simulation studies involving larger participant cohorts, to ascertain the most effective personal protective equipment (PPE) combinations and procedures for optimal protection. Emphasizing the urgency for a consensus on exposure simulation methodologies and result evaluation, they underscore the critical need for additional real-world evidence. Consequently, they advocate for the mandatory registration of PPE usage among healthcare professionals facing highly infectious diseases, coupled with prospective monitoring of infection risk to enhance overall safety protocols.
The COVID-19 pandemic currently stands as the most substantial global health threat, characterized by rapid dissemination that has impacted a minimum of 146 countries.
One of the disease control guidelines outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) involves quarantine, a measure that entails the separation of healthy individuals who may be susceptible to infection by a virus and have the capacity to transmit the disease. Another related recommendation is isolation, which is akin to quarantine but specifically pertains to individuals exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, social distancing is advised, where healthy individuals maintain a physical distance from others to minimize the risk of transmission.
During massive pandemics like the one caused by highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19, health professionals are at a heightened risk of contamination due to their increased exposure to infected individuals, potentially leading to earlier onset of infectious conditions. It is imperative to establish effective strategies and protocols tailored to these professionals to ensure their strict adherence to safety regulations. By incorporating routine use of personal protective equipment including masks, goggles, face shields, gloves, aprons, and coveralls in the care of infected patients, and meticulously following guidelines for donning and doffing, the likelihood of contamination can be significantly reduced. However, the practical implementation of these strategies often poses challenges, underscoring the necessity for enhanced support mechanisms to facilitate their seamless execution by healthcare workers.
Numerous measures were implemented in response to the pandemic, including the integration of case isolation, domestic quarantine, and social distancing among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and individuals with comorbidities. This combined approach has been identified as the most effective policy for mitigating the spread of the virus and flattening the epidemic curve.
Through the Cochrane Systematic Reviews (SRs), it becomes feasible to discern the impacts of strategies employed to educate healthcare professionals on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage and the significance of its application. Adherence to care protocols aimed at preventing contamination enhances the safety of these professionals. Furthermore, the reviews enable the assessment of the effects of quarantine, whether in isolation or in conjunction with other public health interventions, in mitigating the incidence and mortality rates amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. It is evident that the timely initiation of quarantine measures is crucial for their efficacy in combating the spread of the virus.
The efficacy of these approaches stems not solely from their successful execution but predominantly from the inherent biological and natural history of the specific pathogen, its transmissibility, and the practicality of the intervention within the framework of the country's public health system.
The quantity of Cochrane systematic reviews focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic remains restricted; however, endeavors are underway to promptly generate top-tier syntheses of evidence that hold significance for health professionals and policymakers.
Following a systematic search, three Cochrane Systematic Reviews (SRs) were incorporated, providing valuable evidence on population measures (e.g., quarantine and isolation) and individual measures (e.g., the utilization of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), specific types of PPE, etc.) aimed at controlling the transmission and effectively managing COVID-19 infections.
Low-certainty evidence suggests that quarantining individuals who have been exposed to confirmed or suspected cases can prevent a significant percentage of incident cases and deaths, ranging from 44% to 81% and 31% to 63%, respectively, when compared to taking no measures. Furthermore, it is noted that the implementation of quarantine measures at an earlier stage can lead to greater cost savings.
High confidence in the importance of clear communication regarding ICP guidelines was evident for their successful implementation. Additionally, moderate confidence was observed in health professionals feeling uncertain about adhering to lengthy, ambiguous, or non-aligned local guidelines, which did not mirror national or international standards. Adequate space for patient isolation was also deemed crucial for effectively implementing these guidelines.
Low-certainty evidence suggests that individuals wearing long aprons experienced lower levels of contamination compared to those in coveralls, with the latter being noted as more cumbersome to wear. Additionally, improved coverage at the dress-cuff interface may result in reduced contamination when compared to standard PPE, although this finding is supported by evidence of low certainty. The optimal use of PPE for controlling the spread of COVID-19 remains uncertain due to the very low certainty of the available evidence.
