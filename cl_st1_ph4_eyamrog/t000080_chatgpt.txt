The scarcity of Glut-4 transporters in the sarcolemma of cardiac cells is a defining feature of myocardial insulin resistance (MIR), distinct from generalized insulin resistance. Insulin receptors are prominently present in both heart muscle and vessels, with mitochondrial activity playing a crucial role in MIR by maintaining cellular homeostasis through cell replication, cell survival, and energy production.
Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the mechanism of MIR and its implications on signaling pathway design.

By utilizing reproduction contigs sourced from the KEGG database, we were able to construct a detailed signaling pathway involving the bio-molecules responsible for insulin resistance myocardial. Consequently, the interplay among various mechanisms triggers the release of factors that actively contribute to the progression of insulin resistance myocardial.
In conclusion, the intricate interplay of diverse mechanisms and molecular interactions plays a crucial role in the development of myocardial infarction (MI).
Insulin resistance is a clinical and pathological condition characterized by hyperinsulinemia and disrupted glucose homeostasis, impacting cellular functions and contributing to the development of multiple diseases. This phenomenon is not limited to type 2 diabetes but is also evident in various organs and tissues such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, hepatic parenchyma, vascular tissue, and cardiac muscle, often only assessed during the progression of chronic illnesses. It has been suggested that the heart serves as a marker of systemic insulin resistance and myocardial insulin resistance (MIR), with MIR identified as a distinct risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
The myocardial insulin resistance (MIR) is characterized by the impairment of glucose uptake and utilization as an energy source by the cardiac muscle. MIR typically manifests concurrently with systemic insulin resistance or as a result of systemic insulin resistance.
The heart is an organ sensitive to insulin, with research indicating the presence of myocardial insulin resistance (MIR) particularly in individuals with heart failure. Studies have revealed a notable correlation between MIR and the onset of heart failure, even among metabolically stable diabetic patients.
The intracellular signaling pathway of MIR is intricate, encompassing various factors and molecules, with activation of specific points in the myocardium observed in individuals with insulin resistance. Disruptions in typical insulin signaling pathways, as seen in MIR, serve as heightened risk factors for the onset of cardiac dysfunctions. Consequently, when contemplating the impact of insulin resistance on the heart, it becomes crucial to distinguish between outcomes stemming from the excessive activation of signaling pathways that retain sensitivity to insulin and alterations resulting from insulin's diminished capacity to regulate glucose metabolism.
The intricate ramifications of insulin signaling pathways in cardiac muscle, intertwined with the systemic metabolic alterations characterizing insulin-resistance states, will ultimately dictate the manifestation of MIR2.
The aim of this study was to assess the mechanism of MIR and to design a signaling pathway based on existing research articles.
The creation of molecular pathway maps entailed a thorough extraction of molecular properties from medical literature, which was then used to establish various components in a sequence of interconnected events.
In this research paper, we selected well-reasoned pathways and gathered characteristic expression outlines from these pathways. The PubMed database was utilized to assess review publications that have investigated the MIR. The referenced data of the signaling pathway was selected by aggregating references from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) serves as a comprehensive database housing signaling pathway maps, along with references pertaining to biological process networks, genome sequencing, and protein domains. Its primary objective is to facilitate a deeper comprehension and scientific utilization of this wealth of data.

In our study, we integrate a revision analysis with computer modeling to elucidate the signaling pathway that culminates in the MIR.
Insulin facilitates glucose uptake in cardiac muscle, adipocytes, and skeletal muscle by binding to cellular insulin receptors. Insulin resistance, characterized by diminished cellular responsiveness to insulin, impacts multiple metabolic pathways involved in glucose transport to tissues. This condition is closely linked to various clinical conditions, notably type 2 diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and the metabolic syndrome.
Myocardial insulin resistance (MIR) is a metabolic disorder affecting cardiomyocytes, characterized by a diminished ability of myocardial cells to uptake glucose, alongside impaired mitochondrial function and reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity. Consequently, MIR emerges as a distinct risk factor for systemic insulin resistance and subsequent heart disease.
We illustrate the advancement of myocardial insulin resistance (MIR) via a signaling pathway supported by multiple studies. The initial cascade in the progression of MIR involves hyperglycemia, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), angiotensinogen (AGT), free fatty acids (FFA), and insulin. Typically, normal cardiomyocytes derive their primary energy from glucose oxidation in the fed state and from FFA in the fasting state.
Hyperglycemia has been associated with myocardial insulin resistance (MIR) due to its impact on the antilipolysis effect of insulin, resulting in elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFA) that modulate glucose utilization within myocardial cells.
TNF-α, an essential endocrine and paracrine regulator, is produced by activated macrophages and monocytes, exhibiting immune and inflammatory activities along with pleiotropic cellular actions. Its association with the onset of insulin resistance is well-documented, as elevated levels of TNF-α contribute to metabolic dysregulation in various tissues, including the myocardium. Acting as a crucial pro-inflammatory mediator, TNF-α plays a significant role in inducing insulin resistance at the cellular level within the myocardium by activating diverse transcriptional pathways, thereby disrupting insulin signaling through serine phosphorylation. The primary membrane receptor responsible for binding TNF-α is tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), which not only triggers the activation of other transcription factors involved in cell survival and inflammation regulation but also correlates with mitochondrial abnormalities in cardiac muscle and myocardial insulin resistance.
Alpha-globulin (AGT) is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system, playing a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte balance. Synthesized in both the liver and adipose tissue, AGT serves as a significant regulator of blood pressure and is implicated in insulin resistance due to its involvement in muscle vasoconstriction. Moreover, hyperglycemia has been shown to increase the transcription of AGT secretion by the local angiotensin-converting enzyme. Studies have indicated that the overexpression of angiotensinogen in the myocardium leads to a decrease in cardiac fatty acid oxidation levels, concomitant with reductions in medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα).
FFA, or free fatty acids, are lipid species formed from triacylglycerol breakdown due to lipase activity. In fasting conditions, the myocardial cell primarily relies on FFA for energy production. Consequently, increased circulating FFA levels trigger molecular pathways that alter insulin signaling within cardiomyocytes, ultimately influencing MIR16. These fatty acids enter cardiomyocytes either facilitated by transport proteins or through passive diffusion. Additionally, FFA uptake by myocardial cells can be facilitated by cluster of differentiation 36 in response to insulin stimulation.
The INSR receptor is a heterotetrameric receptor classified within the family of tyrosine kinase receptors. It is composed of two α subunits that span the extracellular segment, along with two β subunits that encompass the transmembrane and intracellular domains. Studies have highlighted the distinct actions of insulin and underscored the significance of disrupted signaling pathways in individuals exhibiting MIR, a condition marked by diminished INSR activity.
Insulin, when directly interacting with myocardial cells, triggers the activation of insulin-stimulated protein kinase-1 and protein phosphatase 1 through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. This cascade of events plays a crucial role in muscle glycogen production, thereby influencing the pathogenesis of myocardial insulin resistance (MIR) by reducing glycogen levels within cardiomyocytes.
In the central part of the MIR progression signaling pathway cascade, several key components are involved, including cJun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), nuclear factor-kB kinase β (IKK β), reactive oxygen species (ROS), peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor α (PPAα), fatty acids oxidation (FAO), Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase, classic (PKCC).
JNK1, a stress-activated protein kinase, plays a crucial role in the regulation of MIR21. The mechanism by which JNK1 influences MIR involves the inhibition of insulin signaling through the serine-307 phosphorylation of IRS-122. Additionally, an important aspect of MIR activation is the upregulation of JNK1 due to elevated macrophage levels within myocardial tissue.
IKKβ, one of the two serine-threonine kinases, functions to impede insulin action by reducing phospho-tyrosine residues of IRS1, thereby inducing insulin resistance. This kinase can directly disrupt the metabolic arm of insulin signaling by phosphorylating IRS1 or by phosphorylating the inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB, leading to insulin resistance. Additionally, IKKβ is crucial in modulating pro-apoptotic activity in response to oxidative stress, serving as a feedback mechanism. Similarly, IKK, when activated by TNF-α, triggers an increase in inflammatory mediators, playing a pivotal role in the induction of MIR25.
Research has illustrated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in myocardial dysfunction linked to insulin resistance. It is evident that ROS play a part in causing cardiac damage from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MIR) by influencing protein signaling, changing cardiomyocyte metabolism, and fostering cardiac dysfunction. Elevated levels of ROS are triggered by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, kickstarting intracellular molecular signaling. Consequently, cardiomyocyte-generated ROS serve as a crucial messenger in the MIR signaling cascade.
PPAα, a nuclear receptor, regulates numerous genes involved in various lipid metabolism pathways and is crucial in mitochondrial respiratory function (MIR). Within cardiomyocytes, PPAα significantly influences fatty acid oxidation (FAO) through processes such as fatty acid transport, beta-oxidation, and esterification. Despite increased fatty acid mobilization, PPAα activators effectively lower plasma free fatty acids (FFAs). Studies propose that PPAα's negative impact on MIR regulation could be linked to PPAα inhibition facilitated by the PIK3/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.
Myocardial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is a complex system, and research indicates that FAO can lead to damage in cardiomyocytes through alterations in mitochondrial metabolism, including the blockage of glucose oxidation, increased production of lactic acid, and hydrogen ions, ultimately contributing to metabolic inflexibility and heart failure. Consequently, studies propose that diminishing the efficiency of FAO could lead to the buildup of long-chain fatty acids, resulting in the production of detrimental lipid metabolites that accelerate the progression of metabolic inflexibility and related complications.
IRS-1 plays a crucial role in insulin signaling, with its phosphorylation serving as a pivotal step in initiating the insulin resistance signaling pathway. This molecule is vital for maintaining the heart's function and balance, but hyperinsulinemia-induced metabolic stress can suppress IRS-1 in cardiomyocytes, contributing to the onset of MIR32. Subsequently, IRS-1 recruits and activates PI3K, setting off a cascade of signaling processes that culminate in the activation of AKT and its associated targets. Consequently, the deficiency of IRS-1 is closely linked to the activation of this pathway, underscoring the significance of MIR in this context.
PI3K, heterodimeric groups comprising mediating and catalytic subunits, play crucial roles in glucose metabolism and diverse cellular activities, spanning from cell growth to apoptosis. Research into PI3K activity within insulin signaling has revealed a decrease in its functionality in cases of insulin resistance. In metabolic insulin resistance (MIR), changes in PI3K-related insulin signaling are linked to diminished rates of cardiomyocyte fatty acid oxidation (FAO), stemming from mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased PPARα expression.
PKCc, a family of serine/threonine kinases, holds significant importance in cellular physiology by serving as key players in signaling pathways that trigger various cellular responses. These kinases have the potential to impact insulin signaling by phosphorylating IRS-136 at serine residues. Hyperglycemia triggers the activation of PKCc, and studies on insulin resistance in muscle have revealed that PKCc is consistently controlled and phosphorylated in such conditions. Furthermore, the phosphorylation mediated by PKCc plays a crucial role in regulating glycogen synthase, thereby influencing signaling changes in myocytes associated with insulin resistance. Consequently, the presence of PKCc in muscle is sufficient to modulate the insulin signaling cascade and bring about alterations in cardiomyocyte glucose metabolism.
Implicated in the final outcome of the MIR signaling cascade are several key components: insulin-stimulated protein kinase 1 (ISPK1), type-1 protein phosphatase (PP-1), AKT2, mTOR, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GKS3), and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4).
ISPK-1 belongs to the family of serine/threonine protein kinases known as ribosomal S6 kinases and is predominantly expressed in muscle, playing a role in the pathogenesis of intensified insulin deficiency in glycogen synthesis. It has the potential to disrupt insulin's metabolic functions by phosphorylating regulatory proteins and directly activating PP-1 through serine phosphorylation in the G subunit. Oxidative stress on PP-1 leads to decreased glycogen production, ultimately triggering MIR.
AKT2, as one of the three isoforms within the AKT family, holds a significant role in the insulin signaling pathway. Research indicates that AKT1 and AKT2 are the predominant isoforms present in the myocardium, with AKT2 specifically being crucial for facilitating glucose uptake by myocardial cells. This function is independent of AKT1 and plays a pivotal role in the progression of MIR41. Furthermore, AKT2 is involved in the phosphorylation of mTOR, thereby activating the AKT/mTOR signaling cascade, ultimately leading to the initiation of MIR2.
GSK3 plays a crucial role in protein biosynthesis, cellular metabolism regulation, and glycogen reduction. Its involvement in glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance initiation is attributed to its control over glycogen synthesis. Inhibiting GSK3 activity has been found to enhance insulin function. Studies have demonstrated that GSK3 in cardiomyocytes and MIR is linked to oxidative stress and decreased glycogen production.
MicroRNA (miRNA) demands a multitude of factors within its signaling pathway, with the intricate interplay among various mechanisms and molecular interactions playing a crucial role in the development of miRNA.
