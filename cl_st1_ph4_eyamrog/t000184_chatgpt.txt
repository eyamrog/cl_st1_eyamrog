The diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is a widespread pest known for causing leaf-area reduction in Brassicaceae plants. DBM populations exhibit significant genetic variability, leading to varying feeding preferences and reproductive behaviors across generations. In this study, we investigated the impact of different Brassicaceae cultivars on biological and behavioral parameters over 18 generations of DBM populations maintained on three Brassicaceae varieties: Brassica oleracea var. acephala (kale), Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli), and Brassica oleracea var. capitata (cabbage). We assessed generations P, F6, F12, and F18, examining aspects of young adulthood and fertility parameters of adults reared on each host plant over multiple generations. Larvae and adults underwent dual-choice and multiple-choice tests (feeding and oviposition) between cultivars throughout the generations. Our findings revealed that P. xylostella larvae consumed larger quantities of kale and broccoli cultivars, averaging 4.05 cm2, compared to cabbage at 2.7 cm2. The number of eggs per female in the F18 generation was 1.95 and 2.17 times higher than in the parental (P) generation when raised on kale and cabbage, respectively. Populations exclusively reared on kale exhibited higher net population growth rate (R0), intrinsic rate (rm), finite rate (λ), and generation time (T) than those reared on broccoli and cabbage. In the later generations, larvae reared on cabbage displayed a preference for feeding (F18) and oviposition (F12 and F18) on cabbage. This suggests the presence of learning, characterized by pre-imaginal conditioning to cabbage cultivars across multiple DBM generations.
The diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is recognized as the most destructive pest of Brassicaceae globally, significantly impeding the cultivation of these plants. This pest exhibits a widespread distribution, with its caterpillars inflicting damage by reducing leaf area, thereby impeding plant growth, diminishing product quality, and potentially resulting in complete crop loss (Castelo Branco & France, 2001; Cheng et al., 2008). The impact of DBM infestations can be severe, with plant defoliation levels reaching up to 80%, translating to annual economic losses estimated at around $4 to $5 billion USD (Zalucki et al., 2012).
The substantial genetic diversity of P. xylostella enables the emergence of resistance to insecticides, a primary method for pest control (Ahmad et al., 2012; Zago et al., 2014). Consequently, research is underway to explore alternative approaches for effectively managing this pest. Investigating the life-history and behavior of DBM reared on various Brassicaceae cultivars is crucial for identifying cultivars that exhibit greater resistance and are less favorable for the pest's development and reproduction (Badenes-Perez et al., 2010).
Species within the Brassicaceae family exhibit a range of defense mechanisms against herbivory, encompassing both chemical and mechanical deterrents (Travers-Martin et al., 2008; Karowe & Grubb, 2011). The selection of specific varieties tailored to particular environmental conditions can significantly impact insect herbivory levels (Louda & Collinge, 1992). Pest insects exhibit a preference for plants that offer favorable conditions for their survival and reproduction (Thompson, 1988). Chemical defense compounds found in Brassicaceae, such as sinigrin, display notable quantitative variations among cultivars (Thuler et al., 2007). Sinigrin, a compound of significance in plant-insect interactions, may have a positive impact on the Diamondback Moth (DBM) by stimulating their feeding and oviposition behaviors (Sarfraz et al., 2006; Hopkins et al., 2009).
Physical characteristics found in Brassicaceae plants, such as trichomes and leaf surface wax layers, serve as a form of mechanical protection against insects, including interference with the feeding and oviposition of P. xylostella. Research has demonstrated that the Diamondback Moth (DBM) exhibits reduced growth rates in cultivars with higher trichome densities compared to those with fewer mechanical defenses (Mathur et al., 2011).
In studies involving plants abundant in trichomes, black mustard (Brassica nigra) was favored for oviposition over broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. lieutenant) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) (Newman, 2014). This indicates that the presence of trichomes may not be the primary factor influencing females' selection of oviposition sites.
The ability of insect pests to effectively feed and complete their life cycle encompasses a series of behaviors (Karban & Agrawal, 2002). Learning in holometabolous insects, such as P. xylostella, occurs in both the larval and adult stages, with retention of learned behavior after metamorphosis from larvae to pupae and then to adults (Bernays & Chapman, 1994). While host location and selection learned behavior has been extensively studied in the imaginal stage, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that preimaginal conditioning influences preferences in adults (Bernays, 1995). Conditioning may impact the life-history traits, such as life cycle or fecundity, and substrate preference for feeding and oviposition in Lepidoptera (Bernays & Weiss, 1996). Research on multiple generations of DBM reared on kale has indicated that when DBM is introduced to another Brassicaceae cultivar, like cabbage, it leads to a reduction in various biological parameters (De Bortoli et al., 2011, 2013). Our hypothesis posits that the biological and behavioral aspects of P. xylostella can undergo changes over generations when reared on different Brassicaceae cultivars. To further investigate this hypothesis, we assessed the biological parameters of P. xylostella across three Brassicaceae cultivars, their reproductive behavior, and their preferences for feeding and oviposition over 18 generations.
The research was conducted at the Laboratory of Biology and Insect Rearing (LBIR) within the Department of Plant Protection at UNESP in Jaboticabal, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The insects utilized in the rearing experiments, spanning approximately 185 generations, were maintained in accordance with a methodology adapted from Thuler (2009) for studies involving Brassica oleracea var. acephala-kale HS20 (Horticeres®, Indaiatuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil) at LBIR. Diamondback moth (DBM) populations were cultivated in a controlled environment set at 25 ± 1°C, with a relative humidity of 70 ± 10%, and a photoperiod of 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of darkness.
The biological characteristics of Diamondback Moth (DBM) were assessed across multiple generations: P (parental), F6, F12, and F18, which were raised on three different Brassicaceae varieties. The cultivars included Brassica oleracea var. acephala (kale - HS20 cultivar from Horticeres), Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli - Piracicaba cultivar from Feltrin®, Farroupilha, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), and Brassica oleracea var. capitata (cabbage - Bob Cat cultivar from Sakata®, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil). These host plants are commonly utilized by brassica producers in the São Paulo state of Brazil. Seeds of each cultivar were sown in 10L pots filled with a substrate mixture of ravine soil, cattle manure, and rice husk in a ratio of 3:1:1. The potted plants were grown in a greenhouse specifically designed for plant cultivation. After 60 days, only fully developed leaves were chosen as substrates to eliminate age-related interference.
To initiate the populations of P. xylostella on kale, broccoli, and cabbage host plants, around 3,000 pupae were extracted from the reared stock and distributed into three cages for adult emergence. Each cage housed approximately 1,000 newly emerged adults along with leaves of the respective cultivar discs. These cages were equipped with a circular plastic container (12-cm diameter × 15-cm height) sealed with cling film (PVC). Within each cage, a foliar disc (8-cm diameter) of the specific substrate (kale, broccoli, or cabbage) and a filter paper disc (9-cm diameter) moistened with distilled water were placed. After 24 hours, the leaf discs containing eggs were removed and transferred to Petri dishes (9-cm diameter) where they were kept until larvae hatched. About 50 newly hatched larvae from each substrate were chosen for the first generation (parental) study, while the remaining populations were maintained using the methodology outlined by Thuler (2009) for subsequent generations (F6, F12, and F18) to continue the research.
Caterpillars in the first instar of the parental population were collected using a brush and placed in Petri dishes (9-cm diameter) to create three distinct treatments: i) population on kale, ii) population on broccoli, and iii) population on cabbage. Each dish contained 10 larvae on a leaf disk substrate, with five Petri dishes for each population (5 replicates). Following the transfer of caterpillars, the dishes were sealed with plastic wrap (PVC) to maintain moisture and prevent larvae from escaping. The initial assessment occurred four days post-introduction, considering the leaf mining behavior of first instar larvae. Subsequent evaluations were conducted every three days, with leaf discs replaced until pupae formation. Parameters assessed included leaf consumption (measured with a leaf area meter Laser CID® CI-202 model, Washington, USA), survival rate, and larval stage. Pupae from each treatment were individually collected and housed in ELISA® 96 well plates, sealed with plastic film (PVC), for further evaluation of viability and pupal period until adult emergence.
The newly emerged adults were aspirated from the ELISA® plates, sorted by gender, and then transferred to laying cages. Each treatment had two couples placed in cages, resulting in a total of five replicates per treatment. Within each cage, 8-cm diameter leaf discs were placed on moistened paper for oviposition. The adults were provided with a daily diet of 10% sucrose solution prepared with honey on a sponge attached to the cage's top. Daily records were maintained for the total egg count on the discs and the survival of the adults. Parameters such as male and female longevity, as well as the number of eggs per female, were assessed at this stage. These evaluations were repeated across the F6, F12, and F18 generations of the three DBM populations, encompassing larval, pupal, and adult stages.
The research involved three populations of P. xylostella, which were raised on kale leaves, broccoli, and cabbage to investigate the population growth dynamics of the insects across the P, F6, F12, and F18 generations. The study utilized existing data on survival rates and developmental durations (including egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages), sex ratios, and egg production per female per day.
The biological data acquired enabled the estimation of essential parameters required for constructing fertility life tables (Price, 1984). These parameters include: x, representing the mean age of the female parent (viewed as the emergence of the egg stage); lx, denoting life expectancy at age x, expressed as a female; mx, indicating specific fertility or the number of offspring produced per female at age x resulting in females; and lx.mx, representing the total number of females at age x. The growth parameters derived from the life table were assessed as follows: R0, the net reproductive rate (accounting for the number of females produced by females in a generation); rm, the intrinsic rate of increase in number; λ, the finite rate of increase (indicating how many times the population multiplies in unit time); and T, the average generation time in days. These growth parameters (R0, rm, λ, and T) were computed using the following equations: R0 = ∑ (mx.lx), rm = ln(R0) / T, λ = e^(rm), and T = (∑ mx.lx.x) / (∑ mx.lx).
The dual-choice feeding test was conducted using P. xylostella caterpillars from the P, F6, F12, and F18 generations reared on kale, broccoli, and cabbage. The arenas for the feeding preference study were Petri dishes (15-cm diameter) with filter paper-covered bottoms lightly moistened with distilled water to maintain leaf disc moisture. Each arena contained four equidistantly arranged leaf discs (2-cm diameter) representing two cultivars per dish, with ten first instar caterpillars placed in the center. Five replicates per treatment (comprising three populations and four generations) were set up, with each arena serving as a replicate. Evaluations were conducted 24 hours post caterpillar release, involving the recording of track numbers on each leaf disc. In the multiple-choice test, three leaf discs (2-cm diameter) were placed equidistantly in each arena, with ten first instar caterpillars released in the center. Similar to the dual-choice test, five replicates per treatment were established, with evaluations carried out 24 hours post-release, focusing on track numbers on the leaf discs.
The dual-choice oviposition test was conducted with Diamondback Moth (DBM) adults from the P, F6, F12, and F18 generations. These individuals were offspring of caterpillars raised on kale, broccoli, or cabbage. Transparent plastic containers (13-cm diameter × 9-cm height) were used as cages. Within each cage, two discs (8-cm diameter) from one cultivar and two discs from another cultivar were arranged alternately to present both options simultaneously to the DBM adults. The leaf disc containing the two host plants was placed on a Petri dish covered with moistened filter paper. Two newly emerged couples were then introduced into each cage to mate and lay eggs. The experiment included five replicates per treatment (three populations and four generations), with each cage serving as a replicate. Evaluations were conducted 24 hours post-release of the adults, and the number of eggs on each cultivar's surface was documented.
In the multiple-choice test, an 8-cm diameter leaf disc comprising one-third of each cultivar (kale, broccoli, and cabbage) was positioned in each cage. Subsequently, two newly emerged couples were introduced into the cage to engage in copulation and oviposition. A total of five replicates were established, with each cage being treated as a replicate. Assessments were carried out 24 hours post the adult release, and the quantity of eggs in each cultivar was documented.
The effects of different Brassicaceae cultivars on P. xylostella were assessed through a repeated measures analysis of variance using the PROC MIXED function in SAS Institute software. Each biological characteristic was examined independently, with treatment and time as fixed variables, random variables, and replicates within treatment. A suitable covariance structure was applied for each characteristic as per Littell et al. (2006). Given a significant interaction between cultivars and generations, a separate analysis of variance was conducted for each treatment. Normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions were verified using the Cramer-von Mises criterion and Bartlett’s test. In cases of significant differences among treatments, means were compared using Tukey’s test. All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS 9.1 (SAS Software version 9.0, 2002; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).
The fertility life table data were analyzed following the methodology outlined by Maia et al. (2000) utilizing the SAS GLM software (SAS Institute, 2002). To compare the proportion of surviving adults across treatments, the Kaplan-Meier method PROC LIFETEST was employed. The means and confidence intervals were assessed through the Student t test for paired groups, as generated by PROC LIFETEST (SAS Institute, 2002).
The data collected on the number of fed larvae and eggs laid in dual-choice and multiple-choice tests were analyzed using Proc FREQ in SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, 2002). The analysis of the frequency of dual-choice and multiple-choice was interpreted through the chi-square test (χ2), with a 50:50 ratio as the expected preference indicating no displayed preference by the test subjects. The chi-square test was conducted using SAS software (SAS Institute, 2002) for this purpose.
Significant differences in leaf consumption by DBM were observed among kale, broccoli, and cabbage cultivars (F2, 57 = 8.44, P = 0.0006). Cabbage leaves exhibited lower consumption on average (2.7 cm2) compared to kale (4.0 cm2) and broccoli (4.1 cm2). However, when assessing leaf consumption across generations (P, F6, F12, and F18), no significant differences were found (kale, F3, 16 = 0.31, P = 0.8203; broccoli, F3, 16 = 2.06, P = 0.1458; cabbage, F3, 16 = 0.59, P = 0.6282). Consumption levels varied when caterpillars were reared on kale (3.8 cm2 to 4.8 cm2), broccoli (3.3 cm2 to 5.1 cm2), and cabbage (2.2 cm2 to 3.8 cm2) (Table 1).
Regarding the duration of the larval period, no significant difference was found between cultivars (F2,57 = 0.89, P = 0.4169), with an average change from 6.7 to 7.1 days. In terms of generations, the larval period in kale was notably lower in the P generation (6.0 days) (F3,16 = 13.26, P <0.0001). For broccoli, a significant difference was noted in the larval period of the P generation (5.6 days), which exhibited a shorter period compared to the F18 generation (8.0 days) (F3,16 = 5.40, P = 0.0093). In cabbage, the shortest generation was observed in the P generation (6.0 days), differing from other generations (F3,16 = 39.87, P <0.0001), with the longest period observed in the F18 generation (8.4 days) (Table 1).
During the larval stage, there were no significant differences observed in the survival parameter among cultivars (F2, 57 = 0.17, P = 0.8459) or between the generations studied in kale (F3, 16 = 1.73, P = 0.2006), broccoli (F3, 16 = 0.78, P = 0.5230), and cabbage (F3, 16 = 1.65, P = 0.2185). The percentage of larval survival ranged from 56.0 to 90.0 among the three cultivars as shown in Table 1.
Significant differences were noted in the pupal period among the three cultivars (F2, 57 = 7.28, P = 0.0015). Caterpillars reared on cabbage exhibited a shorter pupal period (3.2 days) compared to those reared on broccoli (3.9 days) and kale (3.6 days). Furthermore, variations were observed between generations reared on kale, with the P generation showing the shortest pupal period (2.4 days) and the F18 generation the longest (3.8 days) (F3, 16 = 4.44, P < 0.0188). Notably, DBM reared on broccoli displayed a shorter pupal period in the F6 generation (3.0 days) than in the P generation (5.6 days) (F3, 16 = 55.87, P < 0.0001; see Table 1).
In the examination of male longevity, no significant differences were noted among the three cultivars (F2, 57 = 0.51, P = 0.6061), with durations ranging from 15.4 to 17.0 days. However, a notable disparity emerged between generations when the caterpillars were raised on kale (F3,16 = 5.23, P = 0.0010), revealing an extended lifespan for males in the P generation (24.7 days) (Table 2). Conversely, no distinctions were evident between generations when the caterpillars were nurtured on broccoli (F3,16 = 0.67, P = 0.5837) and cabbage (F3,16 = 2.01, P = 0.1525).
The longevity of females did not exhibit variances among cultivars (F2, 57 = 2.51, P = 0.5274), with an average spanning from 13.8 to 15.4 days. Nevertheless, a notable distinction emerged between generations when the caterpillars were raised on broccoli and cabbage, as evidenced by the statistical significance (F3,16 = 6.98, P = 0.0032) and (F3,16 = 5.47, P = 0.0088), respectively. Within the broccoli group, variations in female longevity were observed; specifically, longevity was notably shorter in the F12 generation (10.5 days) compared to the P generation (20.8 days). Conversely, in the cabbage group, no significant disparity was noted between the F12 generation (10.5 days) and the P generation (20.8 days) (F3,16 = 5.74, P = 0.0012) (Table 2).
No significant difference was observed in the average number of eggs per female among the cultivars of kale, broccoli, and cabbage (F2, 57 = 0.63, P = 0.5338), with averages of 74.9 and 84.8 eggs. However, a notable disparity was noted across generations. Females reared on kale exhibited the lowest fertility in the P generation (60.8 eggs) but showed a substantial increase in fecundity by the F18 generation (117.2 eggs) (F3, 16 = 9.51; P = 0.0008). Conversely, females reared on cabbage displayed lower fecundity in the P generation (46.0 eggs) but demonstrated a marked increase in egg production by the F18 generation (100.2 eggs) (F3,16 = 4.84, P = 0.0140) as outlined in Table 2.
The net reproductive rate (R0) was notably higher for the caterpillars reared on kale, as they exhibited a greater offspring production per female compared to those reared on broccoli or cabbage across the F6, F12, and F18 generations. Specifically, within the cultivars, the R0 for kale stood at 64.8 females per female, surpassing both broccoli (57.1 females per female) and cabbage (53.0 females per female). Noteworthy variations in R0 among generations were evident, with the F12 generation displaying a significantly higher R0 of 83.3 females per female in contrast to the P generation (50.7 females per female) and the F18 generation (53.9 females per female) (Table 3). This generational disparity was also apparent in broccoli, where the highest R0 was observed in the P generation (90.1) and the lowest in the F18 generation (30.1) (Table 3).
The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and finite rate of increase (λ) were notably higher for caterpillars reared on kale in comparison to those reared on cabbage and broccoli over two generations. Kale sprouts facilitated the production of a higher average number of descendants (0.37 females/female/day) than broccoli (0.33 females/female/day) and cabbage (0.34 females/female/day). The λ values were 1.43 female/female*day for kale, 1.40 females/female*day for broccoli, and 1.39 females/female*day for cabbage. Notably, a significant disparity was observed between the P and F18 generations for both rm and λ parameters in broccoli. The rm for the P generation stood at 0.39 females/female/day, contrasting with 0.27 females/female/day in the F18 generation. Similarly, the λ values were 1.48 female/female*day for the P generation and 1.31 females/female*day for the F18 generation. Furthermore, a significant difference in rm and λ parameters was also noted for larvae reared on cabbage between the P generation (1.32 females/female*day) and subsequent F6, F12, and F18 generations reared on cabbage (Table 3).
The generation time (T) was found to be shorter for Diamondback Moths (DBM) reared on kale compared to those reared on cabbage and broccoli. Specifically, the T values for different cultivars were 11.6 days on kale, 11.9 days on broccoli, and 12.0 days on cabbage. Notably, a significant difference in generation time was observed between the F6 generation (13.1 days) and the F12 generation (10.6 days) for larvae reared on broccoli. Furthermore, DBM exhibited a longer generation time in the P generation (13.4 days) compared to other generations reared on cabbage, as shown in Table 3.
In dual-choice tests, the DBM larvae of the P generation reared on kale exhibited a preference for feeding on broccoli (68.7%) over cabbage (χ22, 3 = 4.08, P = 0.0432). Conversely, DBM larvae reared on broccoli in the same generation showed a preference for cabbage (68.6%) over kale (χ22, 3 = 4.87, P = 0.0273) (Fig 1A). Moving on to the F6 generation, caterpillars reared on cabbage leaves displayed a preference for cabbage (67.6%) when presented with broccoli (χ22, 3 = 4.12, P = 0.0422) (Fig 1B). Similarly, in the F12 generation, insects reared on broccoli leaves favored cabbage (72.0%) over broccoli (χ22, 3 = 5.08, P = 0.0241) (Fig 1C). Furthermore, larvae from the F18 generation, maintained on cabbage leaves, exhibited consistent food substrate preferences, favoring cabbage (69.8%) over broccoli (χ22, 3 = 4.16, P = 0.0412) and kale (74.0%) (χ22, 3 = 6.11, P = 0.0134) (Fig 1D).
In the multiple-choice tests conducted on the P generation of Diamondback Moths (DBM) reared on kale, the results indicated that the highest percentage of caterpillars feeding was observed on kale (46.0%) and broccoli (40.8%), in contrast to feeding on cabbage leaves (13.2%). Similarly, in the same generation, caterpillars reared on broccoli exhibited a higher percentage of feeding on broccoli (53.8%) and kale (41.8%) as opposed to cabbage (4.4%). Notably, DBM reared on cabbage showed a preference for broccoli (52.7%) over cabbage (34.5%). Moving on to the F6 generation, caterpillars raised on cabbage displayed a tendency to feed on cabbage (39.0%) and broccoli (44.0%), rather than on kale (17%).
In the F12 and F18 generations, Diamondback Moths (DBM) did not exhibit a preference for feeding on any specific cultivar, including kale, broccoli, or cabbage.
In the dual-choice test, the DBM adult P generation, which originated from caterpillars reared on broccoli, exhibited a preference for laying eggs on broccoli (68.7%) over cabbage (χ22, 3 = 11.29, P = 0.0008). However, they showed a preference for ovipositing on kale (59.8%) compared to broccoli (χ22, 3 = 5.35, P = 0.0206) (Fig 2A). On the other hand, adults from the F6 generation, reared on kale, demonstrated a preference for laying eggs on cabbage (60.9%) over broccoli (χ22, 3 = 15.53, P <0.0001). Conversely, when bred on broccoli, they displayed a preference for oviposition on kale (60.2%) (χ22, 3 = 8.65, P = 0.0033) or cabbage (59.5%) (χ22, 3 = 8.05, P = 0.0045) (Fig 2B).
In the F12 generation, adults originating from cabbage showed a preference for laying eggs on cabbage (70.3%) (χ22, 3 = 11.81, P = 0.0006) and kale (69.0%) (χ22, 3 = 12.12, P = 0.0005) over broccoli. Conversely, adults from kale exhibited a tendency to oviposit on cabbage (62.1%) (χ22, 3 = 14.21, P = 0.0002) (Fig 2C). Moving to the F18 generation, adults raised on cabbage displayed a strong inclination towards ovipositing on cabbage (71.5%) (χ22, 3 = 11.04, P = 0.0009) rather than broccoli, and also favored cabbage (65.5%) over kale (χ22, 3 = 5.69, P = 0.0170). Diamondback moths reared on kale leaves, however, exhibited a preference for broccoli (54.0%) over cabbage (χ22, 3 = 6.37, P = 0.0116) (Fig 2D).
In multiple-choice tests, the P generation reared on cabbage exhibited the highest oviposition rates on broccoli (40.8%) and kale (33.6%), in contrast to cabbage leaves (25.6%). Subsequently, in the F6 generation, adults derived from caterpillars raised on cabbage displayed a preference for laying eggs on broccoli (42.3%). Conversely, when cultivated on kale in the same generation, adults exhibited a distinct inclination towards ovipositing on kale itself (52.6% of the eggs). Moving forward to the F18 generation, insects raised on cabbage displayed a tendency to lay eggs on cabbage (43.2%), while those originating from broccoli sprouts exhibited a preference for kale (41.7%) and cabbage (34.9%).
Several studies have previously explored the life-history and behavior of the Diamondback Moth (DBM) in various cultivars worldwide; however, this research marks the first instance of comparing different generations of the DBM population in cruciferous plants. The findings indicated that larval survival rates of the pest remained consistent across all Brassicaceae cultivars tested over successive generations, suggesting no significant increase in mortality among the examined cultivars. Nonetheless, certain biological aspects exhibited variations in this study. Notably, during the larval stage, kale and broccoli cultivars were more susceptible to consumption compared to cabbage, with consistently lower leaf consumption observed in cabbage across all generations. This trend aligns with previous findings that reported reduced DBM consumption in Midori cabbage cultivars and hybrid TPC 681 in comparison to cultivated kale (Volpe et al., 2008). The diminished consumption of cabbage leaves could potentially be attributed to the physical characteristics of the plants, such as a waxy leaf surface. Research has indicated that DBM larvae tend to consume less foliage in plants with higher alkane content, which correlates with increased waxiness (Eigenbrode et al., 1991; Ulmer et al., 2002).
In addition to the physical characteristics previously mentioned, Brassicaceae cultivars contain deterrent chemicals, such as ethanol extracts, which can enhance the consumption of P. xylostella. The quantity of sinigrin found in the leaves of each plant species influences the feeding behavior of DBM larvae, as demonstrated in research by Thuler et al. (2007) who noted the absence of sinigrin in six commercial Brassicaceae varieties, including cabbage, developed through genetic modifications to enhance the cultivars. Another study observed that the enhancement of crop plants led to a decrease in glucosinolate levels in cruciferous crops (Bodnaryk, 1997).
Plants belonging to the Brassicaceae family are distinguished by their varying glucosinolate content. These compounds are subject to hydrolysis through an endogenous myrosinase enzyme upon tissue damage, leading to the production of toxic substances for insects, including thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, and nitriles epithionitriles (Halkier & Gershenzon, 2006; Hopkins et al., 2009). The induction of glucosinolates is recognized for its deterrent effect on herbivores, serving a crucial role in protecting plants from further harm (van Dam & Raaijmakers, 2006; Van Dam & Oomen, 2008). Nevertheless, insect populations specializing in glucosinolate-rich plants, like the Diamondback Moth (DBM), may have developed mechanisms to counteract the host's toxicity (Halkier & Gershenzon, 2006).
The larval development period varied among generations, particularly when larvae were reared on kale, broccoli, and cabbage. The initial generation (P) completed its development in fewer days compared to subsequent generations, notably the final generation (F18). This discrepancy implies that the caterpillars may have adjusted to the development stages of non-adapted cultivars, leading to an extended larval period over successive generations. Boiça Junior et al. (2011) observed a lengthening of the larval period in P. xylostella when exposed to certain kale genotypes, indicating genotype-specific effects on development. Similarly, Veiga et al. (2010) noted differences in the larval period of DBM populations reared on kale, with the first generation exhibiting a shorter period (6.8 days) compared to a population reared for 60 generations in the laboratory, which displayed a longer larval period (9.1 days).
In our study, we noted a shorter pupal period for caterpillars raised on cabbage. This reduction in the average pupal period was attributed to compensatory mechanisms in the larval period within the F18 generation of the cultivar, which was comparatively longer. It is evident that variations and compensatory mechanisms in the development period of the Diamondback Moth (DBM) may occur between the larval and pupal stages when different cultivars are provided. Sarfraz et al. (2007) also reported a swifter development of P. xylostella in cultivars of Brassica juncea var. Czern in comparison to B. oleracea var. Red Acre, B. napus var. Conquest, and B. napus var. Liberty.
Throughout adulthood, there has been a consistent average longevity observed among DBM males across different cultivars and over 18 generations. The only sporadic variations were noted between generations of insects reared on kale. Specifically, males reared on the kale cultivar exhibited an average survival period of 24 days up to the P generation, which was approximately 10 days longer than those reared on broccoli and cabbage (refer to Table 2).
In terms of female longevity, a notable shift was observed across generations stemming from broccoli and cabbage. Females raised on both substrates exhibited extended survival in the P generation. Despite this, the increased longevity did not align with the fertility metrics outlined in the study. For instance, while females in the P generation lived longer, those reared on cabbage laid fewer eggs in the self-generation P (46.0 eggs) (refer to Table 2). This disparity noted in the P generation gradually diminished in subsequent generations, indicating that successive generations have proven advantageous for DBM.
The number of eggs laid by females increased across generations in moths reared on kale and cabbage, as indicated in Table 2. Specifically, females deposited 1.95 and 2.17 times more eggs in the F18 generation compared to the P generation. However, this enhanced fertility was not observed when studied up to the third successive generation of DBM. In a separate study, the number of eggs laid by females reared on kale exhibited minimal variation and remained relatively unaffected over three generations (Veiga et al., 2010). It is noted that fecundity in insects of the Lepidoptera order remains unaltered in adulthood (Leather, 1988) since the eggs are already present in the ovarioles upon emergence as adults. Therefore, any changes in oviposition could be attributed to alterations during the larval stage, such as variations in the food substrate. Consequently, the quality of the cultivar (host) during larval development emerges as a crucial factor in maximizing the fecundity potential of females (Awmack & Leather, 2002).
Life table parameters play a crucial role in assessing the success of a species within a specific environment, such as the establishment of pests on various host plants (Birch, 1948). In this study, the population of P. xylostella reared on kale exhibited the highest net reproduction rate (R0) compared to those reared on broccoli and cabbage, indicating that populations on kale produced more offspring per female. The assessment of chemical composition in cultivars becomes essential for this parameter, as highlighted by Luengo (2011), given the significant differences in nutrients and vitamin complexes among kale, broccoli, and cabbage, which directly impact the feeding insects (Panizzi & Parra, 2009).
Variations in the net reproductive rate between the initial and final generations in kale and broccoli were noted, although these differences were not consistently observed in subsequent generations (Table 3). Research has indicated that fluctuating and insufficient protein consumption, along with disparities in protein quality and other nutrient levels, may lead to fluctuations in the growth rate of insects, manifesting across generations within each population (Woods, 1999; Sarfraz et al., 2009).
The R0, rm, and λ are crucial factors influencing the generation of descendants within a specific period, as highlighted by kale and cabbage being the most favorable hosts. When comparing across generations, the P generation in broccoli exhibited higher values for the rm and λ parameters, suggesting a heightened production of offspring per female. Nevertheless, in the F18 generation, an increased production of descendants was observed when insects were reared on kale and cabbage.
The results of the preference Discrete Choice Model (DBM) between cultivars varied. In the double and multiple-choice tests, caterpillars reared on kale and broccoli did not exhibit a preference for their original substrate across generations. Conversely, caterpillars raised on cabbage showed a consistent feeding preference for discs containing cabbage in two out of the four generations studied. This behavior was notably observed in the F6, F12, and F18 generations, indicating a potential period of familiarization or adjustment to the new substrate for feeding and oviposition activities.
While numerous studies have delved into insect food preference tests, the majority of analyses have been limited to a single generation. This study, however, sought to explore differences between generations, revealing variations that do not suggest imaginal conditioning of P. xylostella. Insects raised over multiple generations on a singular substrate are subject to significant selection pressures, potentially leading to the development of behavioral tendencies. Nonetheless, this behavioral manifestation may require several generations to manifest, as noted by Barros (1998).
Analyzing all generations up to the last (F18) confirmed the presence of pre-imaginal conditioning for Diamondback Moth (DBM) on cabbage, supporting the notion of transgenerational learning. This proposition finds validation in the observation that in recent generations (F12 and F18), female moths exhibited a preference for the same substrate on which they were raised. Previous research has linked sinigrin in plants to the oviposition stimulation process in P. xylostella (Spencer et al., 1999). Additionally, structures like trichomes and waxy substances, found in small quantities on cabbage leaves, may also influence oviposition choice by providing lower mechanical protection (Hariprasad & Van Emden, 2010). The preference for oviposition in cabbage by P. xylostella is likely influenced by a combination of chemical and physical factors, with sites offering the most attractive stimuli being favored for egg-laying (Justus et al., 2000).
This study assessed the potential occurrence of conditioning across multiple generations of DBM and enhances comprehension of P. xylostella behavior in Brassicaceae cultivars. It is noteworthy that our investigation represents the initial exploration of pest behavior spanning numerous generations, revealing the intricate and fluctuating nature of insect behavior over time. Nonetheless, further research is imperative to delve deeper into the conditioning approach and gain a more comprehensive understanding of these interactions.
