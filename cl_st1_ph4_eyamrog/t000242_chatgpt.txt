The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a global public health crisis, with risks, severity, and mortality linked to non-communicable chronic conditions like diabetes mellitus. This correlation has raised significant alarm in nations with a high prevalence of diabetes, notably Brazil. This article delves into the diabetes landscape in Brazil, presenting epidemiological statistics and potential explanations for the diabetes-COVID-19 association. It underscores how the dual burden of these conditions in a middle-income country has exacerbated the pandemic's impact. Understanding this relationship and its biological underpinnings is crucial for addressing the current crisis and preparing for future challenges.
On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic. This disease has resulted in over 180 thousand deaths globally, with approximately 4,000 reported in Brazil by the end of April 2020 (https://coronavirus.saude.gov.br/). Fatality rates have shown variability across countries, influenced by factors such as the number of confirmed cases, recorded deaths, the proportion of at-risk individuals in the population (such as older adults and those with chronic diseases), access to healthcare services, availability of accurate diagnostic tests, and resources to manage severe and critical cases (including ICU beds, mechanical ventilators, and trained healthcare professionals).
Numerous studies have contributed significantly to elucidating the clinical profiles of SARS-CoV-2 infection, consistently demonstrating that the existence of chronic morbidities like diabetes mellitus (DM) and its related conditions (obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) serve as significant risk factors for the severity and prognosis of the disease, alongside advanced age. The mounting evidence has sparked considerable concern in nations with a high prevalence of these morbidities, such as Brazil.
This passage presents an overview of the diabetes landscape in Brazil, accompanied by epidemiological statistics and proposed hypotheses elucidating the link between diabetes and COVID-19. Furthermore, it underscores the potential exacerbation of the pandemic situation due to the concurrent burden of these two health conditions in a middle-income nation.
Brazil serves as a quintessential illustration of the concerning landscape of diabetes mellitus in developing nations in the current century, ranking as the fourth country worldwide with the highest diabetic population. As of 2019, approximately 16.8 million individuals between the ages of 20 and 79 were reported to have diabetes mellitus in Brazil, with projections indicating a staggering 55% surge by the year 2045.
In the 1980s, a multicenter prevalence study involving 21,847 Brazilians aged between 30 and 69 years who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test revealed that 7.6% had type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), mirroring the global trend. Alarmingly, nearly half of those with DM were unaware of their condition. A subsequent study in 2014, the Estudo Longitudinal de Saúde do Adulto (ELSA-Brasil—Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health), reported a similar rate of undiagnosed DM among 15,000 participants in a non-representative sample, underscoring the persistent challenge of undetected diabetes in the population.
The nationwide surveillance system known as VIGITEL in Brazil has been instrumental in providing annual epidemiological data on non-communicable chronic diseases (NCCD) in individuals aged 18 and above. In 2016, a self-reported diabetes mellitus (DM) rate of 5.5% was documented, which increased to 8.0% two years later. However, given that previous research has indicated that half of diabetic individuals in Brazil remain undiagnosed, these figures are likely underestimated. Unsurprisingly, the prevalence rates of DM vary not only by age group but also by educational attainment, with rates of 23.1% among those over 65 years and 15.2% among individuals with less than 8 years of schooling.
Another facet of diabetes mellitus (DM) in Brazil pertains to its metabolic regulation. A nationwide cross-sectional study, encompassing 5,750 individuals with type 2 DM receiving care through the public health system from 2006 to 2015, revealed an average glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 8.6% (SD 2.2). Despite recommendations from scientific bodies like the Brazilian Society of Diabetes advocating for HbA1c targets below 7%, only a minority of patients achieve this goal, even when a less stringent target is considered. Merely 48.5% of Brazilian patients maintain HbA1c levels below 8%, indicating poorer glycemic control compared to Europe and the USA. A multicenter study conducted within the private healthcare system of Latin American nations highlighted that around 40% of the 878 Brazilian patients assessed had HbA1c levels exceeding 7%.
In Brazil, Non-Communicable Chronic Diseases (NCCD) are accountable for nearly two-thirds of all causes of death, with 5.2% attributed to Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Additionally, DM serves as a significant risk factor for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), which contributes to 31.3% of mortality rates in Brazil.
The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus, particularly among older adults and those in low socioeconomic strata, coupled with late diagnosis and inadequate glycemic control, significantly contributes to the development of long-term complications such as macroangiopathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened global apprehensions regarding public health systems, further exacerbating the prognosis for diabetic individuals affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Since the initial reports of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, there has been a notable prevalence of diabetic individuals among hospitalized patients and those who have experienced fatal outcomes, underscoring the significance of diabetes mellitus (DM) as a risk factor. Presently, type 2 DM is accompanied by other high-risk conditions including advanced age, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
A study conducted in China involving 1,099 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 revealed that among the 173 patients with severe disease, 23.7% had hypertension, 16.2% had diabetes mellitus, 5.8% had coronary heart disease, and 2.3% had cerebrovascular disease. Similarly, another study focusing on 140 hospitalized patients reported comparable rates, with 30% having hypertension and 12% having diabetes mellitus.
The most comprehensive study conducted in China examined a total of 44,672 cases of COVID-19. The fatality rate stood at 2.3%, varying based on age and the severity of symptoms. Among patients over 80 years old, death occurred in 14.8% (208 out of 1,408), while in the 70-79 age group, it was 8.0% (312 out of 3,918), and in severe cases, it reached 49.0% (1,023 out of 2,087). Of those who succumbed to the virus and had underlying chronic conditions, 10.5% had cardiovascular disease, 7.3% had diabetes mellitus, 6.3% had chronic respiratory disease, 6.0% had hypertension, and 5.6% had cancer. An analysis of 52 critically ill patients further emphasized the significance of age, male gender (67%), and pre-existing chronic conditions (40%) as risk factors. The authors noted that non-survivors at 28 days (n = 32) did not exhibit differences in terms of symptom onset time, symptom type, or radiological changes prior to hospitalization. Non-survivors and survivors differed in age (64.6 versus 51.9 years, respectively) and the prevalence of concurrent chronic diseases (53% versus 20%).
In an analysis of 191 severe cases in China, where 54 individuals died and 137 were discharged, factors associated with mortality were examined. The study revealed a significant association between mortality and various conditions, with the strongest link observed in cases of coronary heart disease (OR 21.4, 95%CI 4.6-98.8). Additionally, hypertension (OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.6-5.9), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.9, 95%CI 1.3-6.1), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR 5.4, 95%CI 1.0-30.4), and multiple organ failure (OR 6.1, 95%CI 3.5-10.8) were identified as risk factors for mortality. Circulating biomarkers such as ferritin, interleukin 6, D-dimer, and troponin were also linked to fatal outcomes. Independent predictors of mortality included older age, cardiovascular disease (CVD), multiple organ failure, and a D-dimer concentration exceeding 1 mcg/mL. Notably, diabetes mellitus and hypertension were not identified as independent predictors, potentially due to their role as mediators of cardiovascular events and mortality, suggesting a possible underestimation of their impact on fatal outcomes.
As the pandemic spread to other continents, data from Europe and the Americas have substantiated the concerning correlation between diabetes mellitus (DM) and the prognosis of COVID-19. In the Lombardy region of Italy, a study involving 1,591 ICU patients affected between February and March 2020 revealed that 68% had at least one comorbidity, with 49% having systemic hypertension, 21% cardiovascular disease (CVD), 17% type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), 8% cancer, and 4% chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
In the United States, data from the Coronavirus Disease 2019–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) revealed that 89.3% of 178 adults had one or more underlying morbidities, with hypertension being the most prevalent at 49.7%, followed by obesity at 48.3%, chronic lung disease at 34.6%, diabetes mellitus (DM) at 28.3%, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) at 27.8%. Among individuals aged 18 to 49 years, obesity was the most common condition, followed by chronic lung disease (primarily asthma) and DM, while those aged 50 to 64 years exhibited hypertension and DM as the most frequent diseases. Additionally, a subsequent report highlighted that individuals over 60 years old with a BMI of 30-34 kg/m2 had twice the likelihood of hospital admission (HR 2.0, p < 0.0001) and critical care (HR 1.8; p = 0.006) compared to those under 60 years with a BMI under 30 kg/m2.
In Brazil, data from the Ministry of Health indicate that diabetes mellitus (DM) and previous cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the most commonly associated comorbidities with mortality in individuals affected by SARS-CoV-2. DM and CVD are often considered interconnected as atherosclerosis is a common feature in the long-term progression of diabetes. Additionally, hyperglycemia may present as an initial symptom during an acute cardiovascular event.
The concern regarding the correlation between cardiometabolic diseases and COVID-19 is not without precedent. Prior studies have enhanced our understanding of the connections between diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) with influenza epidemics such as H1N1 or MERS. This existing knowledge serves as a valuable foundation for researchers, offering insights that can aid in the management of the ongoing pandemic.
Enhancing comprehension of the biological plausibility behind the link between diabetes mellitus (DM) and COVID-19 could elucidate the underlying mechanisms, thereby strengthening potential causal connections and facilitating the development of more efficient prevention strategies to combat viral epidemics.
Ongoing investigations are being conducted to explore the biological plausibility of the link between diabetes mellitus (DM) and the severity of COVID-19; however, clarity on this association is still lacking.
Adequate glycemic control is essential for reducing susceptibility to infections and improving prognosis in individuals with diabetes mellitus. A recent study, which also involved individuals without diabetes mellitus, demonstrated that elevated levels of fasting plasma glucose were associated with unfavorable outcomes and increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. It is imperative to investigate the direct impact of glucose metabolism disturbances on the severity of COVID-19 to further understand its contribution to the disease's progression.
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by a low-grade inflammatory state, while COVID-19 often presents with a high level of systemic inflammation, as evidenced by increased levels of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, dimer-D, and ferritin. This suggests that individuals with DM and its related conditions may have a predisposition to worsened inflammatory responses, potentially exacerbating the progression of COVID-19 in diabetic patients.
In the same context, the association of obesity with COVID-19 could support this hypothesis, given that obesity is also a pro-inflammatory state and a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Excessive adiposity produces cytokines, leading to insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction, which are early events in atherogenesis. The reasons why obesity has been linked to COVID-19 hospitalization and severity, particularly in individuals under 60 years of age, are currently being debated. As mentioned earlier, atherosclerosis is the macrovascular complication of diabetes mellitus, and its presence may help explain the increased severity and mortality of COVID-19. Some studies, including those in Brazil (unpublished data), have identified cardiovascular disease as the most significant predictor of severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent reviews have emphasized the impact of cardiovascular causes of death on hospitalized patients, such as myocarditis, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and systemic thrombosis.
Concerns have been raised regarding the potential negative impact of medications used to manage comorbidities in the context of SARS-Cov-2 infection. It has been established that the pathophysiological pathways of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension can exacerbate the severity of SARS-Cov-2 infection, with certain medications acting on these pathways. Coronaviruses have the ability to attach to target cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in various tissues. Studies have shown an upregulation of ACE2 in individuals with both type 1 and type 2 DM, and some medications, such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazolidinediones, and ibuprofen, can further increase ACE2 expression. Despite these findings, there is currently no evidence suggesting detrimental effects of these medications on the outcomes of diabetic and hypertensive patients with COVID-19. Consequently, reputable scientific organizations like the Brazilian Diabetes Society have not advised discontinuing these drugs in the context of SARS-Cov-2 infection.
As the understanding of the relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and COVID-19 continues to evolve, health professionals have encountered challenges in managing these two morbidities within clinical and public health systems. A comprehensive grasp of the pathophysiological relationship is crucial for devising preventive measures and more effective therapeutic approaches. Identifying gaps in knowledge concerning the severity of DM and SARS-CoV-2 infection is imperative for future research endeavors. Factors such as the type of DM, age, duration of illness, level of glycemic control, presence of complications, and medications being utilized may influence susceptibility and prognosis, underscoring the need for further investigation in this area.
In conclusion, diabetes mellitus in individuals with COVID-19 represents a complex interplay of morbidities with significant prognostic implications. It is imperative to delve into the underlying mechanisms of this association promptly to combat the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic effectively. This understanding is crucial for developing efficient prevention strategies, including vaccination and pharmacological interventions, and for fortifying healthcare systems to tackle future challenges.
