The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being of healthcare professionals, particularly dentists in close contact with infected patients, has raised significant concerns. This critical literature review aimed to assess the potential implications of the pandemic on the mental health of dentists. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases using specific keywords related to psychiatry, anxiety, fear, depression, and mental health in conjunction with COVID-19 and dentistry. Original research articles reporting on the mental health status of dentists during the pandemic were included for analysis. Data extracted from the eligible studies were tabulated using Microsoft Excel 2016 for Windows and presented descriptively. Out of the eleven publications reviewed, all studies followed a cross-sectional design, with the majority utilizing questionnaires developed by the researchers (81.8%) and conducted primarily in Italy (45.5%). The participant numbers varied from 14 to 1,500. The findings highlighted various mental health challenges faced by dentists during the pandemic, including fear of contamination, anxiety, stress, depression, job insecurity, subjective overload, perceived risk, and emotional distress. Overall, it was evident that the COVID-19 crisis had a detrimental impact on the mental well-being of dentists, with a high prevalence of fear, anxiety, and other psychological symptoms observed.
At the close of 2019, within the province of Wuhan, China, the emergence of a novel virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family was identified, akin to the pathogen responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003. This virus swiftly disseminated globally, precipitating an infectious respiratory ailment recognized as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). By March 2020, the World Health Organization acknowledged the gravity of the situation, designating the outbreak as a public health emergency and escalating its classification to a pandemic. Presently, the disease has reached 216 nations, with over 18.5 million confirmed cases and 700,000 fatalities, notably with the Americas reporting nearly 10 million diagnosed cases.
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, spherical, enveloped RNA virus with an approximate size of 30 kilobases (kbp) [5]. It can be transmitted through direct contact, such as coughing, sneezing, and inhalation of droplets, as well as through contact with mucous membranes like the oral, nasal, and ocular areas [6]. Consequently, individuals in close proximity to COVID-19 patients, including healthcare professionals, face an elevated risk of contamination [2,7]. Dentists, in particular, are at a heightened risk of exposure and have the potential to transmit the virus to their family members and other patients due to their close proximity to the oral cavity of patients and direct contact with salivary fluids in enclosed environments [8].
Most individuals infected with the virus exhibit mild symptoms, typically including fever and cough, alongside potential manifestations such as shortness of breath, muscle pain, confusion, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, and vomiting. In severe cases, patients may progress to develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), cardiac arrhythmia, and shock. Advanced age and the presence of underlying health conditions, known as comorbidities, are linked to a poorer prognosis in COVID-19 cases.
Social isolation and distancing measures have been implemented by various governments worldwide to curb the transmission and dissemination of the virus [11]. This has resulted in stringent limitations on dental practices, with dentists being permitted to conduct only emergency procedures in countries like China [2], Italy [12], the United States of America [13], Brazil [14], and the United Kingdom [15]. These restrictions have brought about financial repercussions, feelings of insecurity, and heightened anxiety, consequently elevating the risk of mental health issues [7,16]. Individuals compelled to cease working as a consequence of the pandemic have reported heightened distress and a deterioration in overall health [17].
Furthermore, social networks and various media platforms have played a significant role in disseminating alarming information regarding the increasing number of individuals contracting the virus, potentially leading to adverse effects on the general population. This widespread dissemination of information has resulted in heightened levels of stress, fear of contagion, personal frustration, and challenges in accessing necessary protective gear [18]. Additionally, individuals have been subjected to stigmatization associated with COVID-19 and have expressed concerns regarding the health and safety of both themselves and their loved ones [19].
This critical review seeks to analyze the potential implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of dentists.
This bibliographic search was conducted by analyzing articles indexed until July 2020 in PubMed (U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), and Scopus (Elsevier) databases. The search utilized keywords such as "Psychiatry OR anxiety OR fear OR depression OR psychological distress OR mental health" AND "COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2" AND "dentists OR dental practice." The study adhered to the PRISMA guidelines, which can be accessed at http://prisma-statement.org/.
The study included original research publications focusing on the mental health status of dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic, excluding review and editorial articles. Two researchers (ICCL and LF) independently conducted the analysis of the studies, comparing the information collected and discussing any discrepancies. In instances of disagreement, a third researcher (ALC) made the final decision on whether to include or exclude the article.
The study collected various variables including information about the article such as authors and year of publication, country, study design and research instrument, sample characteristics including sex and age, mental health conditions, COVID-19 status (positive or negative), and risk group classification (yes or no). The main results pertaining to the mental health of dentists were also included. Data organization and tabulation were conducted using Microsoft Excel 2016 software for Windows (Microsoft Press, Redmond, WA, USA), and the findings were descriptively presented.
A total of 88 articles were initially identified and distributed across different databases: 14 in PubMed, 8 in Web of Science, and 66 in Scopus. Following the removal of duplicates, 70 unique studies were retained, with 15 selected based on a review of titles and abstracts. Among these, two systematic review articles were excluded due to their failure to meet the eligibility criteria. Subsequently, all remaining articles underwent a thorough analysis. Upon completion of the full reading process, two additional articles were excluded: one for lacking information on the mental health of dentists and the other for not presenting data specifically gathered from dentists, but rather from health workers in general. Ultimately, a total of 11 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review, as illustrated in Figure 1.
In terms of geographical distribution, the majority of studies were conducted by researchers in Italy (45.5%), closely followed by India (36.4%). Methodologically, all studies employed a cross-sectional design, utilizing questionnaires exclusively (100%), with a notable preference for questionnaires developed by the researchers themselves (81.8%). Sample sizes varied significantly, ranging from 14 to 1500 participants, representing Chinese and Italian populations, respectively. The majority of participants in these studies were male (55.6%) and young adults (55.6%). The research topics covered a range of psychological aspects related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with six studies focusing on fear of dentists, anxiety, concerns, stress, two on depression, job insecurity, subjective overload, and one each on perceived risk and feelings/emotions. Notably, only one study reported dentists diagnosed with COVID-19 (50%), with dentists in the risk group varying from 4.5% in Italy to 28.8% in Poland (Table 1).
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to global changes, including the implementation of social distancing and isolation measures aimed at controlling the spread of the disease. These changes have had a notable impact on the mental health of healthcare professionals, particularly dentists, as they navigate disruptions to their daily routines. This review seeks to shed light on the substantial effects of COVID-19 on the mental well-being of dentists, providing insights into the challenges they face and offering guidance to enhance understanding of the issues affecting this professional group. By doing so, it aims to support the development of strategies to address these challenges during the ongoing pandemic.
Numerous studies have consistently highlighted the prevalence of fear, anxiety, and stress among individuals [8,22-24,26,27]. Specifically, fear has been linked to concerns about potential infection from patients or colleagues, the risk of transmitting the infection to their families, and the potential long-term consequences [7,8,22,25]. Dentists, operating in environments characterized by the high production of aerosols and close proximity to patients and their salivary secretions, face an elevated risk of contamination, thus rationalizing these apprehensions. Factors such as hospitalization, social isolation, the looming threat of infection, and the escalating mortality rates within the country have also contributed to heightened levels of fear [8]. It can be deduced that a lack of understanding regarding the viral transmission dynamics within the population may directly impact these emotional responses.
Two studies (20, 22) utilized the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to assess anxiety levels, both highlighting an increase in anxiety disorders during this period. These findings indicate that the pandemic serves as a significant source of anxiety for dentists and other professionals within the dental team, with symptoms primarily linked to the care routine when attending to patients exhibiting suspicious symptoms (20, 22). The World Health Organization advises that suspected or confirmed cases isolate until recovery or receive a negative COVID-19 diagnosis (3). However, in dental emergency scenarios, dentists must intervene to alleviate or resolve patient issues, potentially necessitating close contact between the professional and patient, thereby increasing the risk of infection.
The significance of the prevalence of generalized anxiety symptoms as reported in studies [20, 29] is noteworthy, given that elevated GAD-7 scores have been linked to diminished productivity in the workplace, heightened inflammatory responses, and subsequently, compromised immune system functioning [20, 29]. Such immunocompromise could potentially lead to a poorer prognosis in individuals with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Furthermore, apart from anxiety, dentists belonging to a high-risk group were identified as experiencing the highest levels of stress [27].
Depressive symptoms have been identified in various studies [7,26]. Younger or less experienced individuals have reported a heightened fear of job loss, which is linked to an increase in depressive symptoms [7]. This suggests that these professionals may be in a less stable and financially insecure job situation. Additionally, knowing multiple individuals who have died from COVID-19 was found to be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms [7]. The loss of close acquaintances can make these professionals more emotionally vulnerable to the situation and more cognizant of the severity of the disease.
In terms of patient management considerations, a significant proportion of dentists (57.8%) expressed a preference for requesting COVID-19 test results from all patients prior to conducting any aerosol-generating treatment procedures [25]. Rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are known to have low sensitivity, coupled with a latency period and variable virus manifestation among different populations, rendering the test results unreliable [30]. Moreover, the cost associated with these tests can render their implementation financially unfeasible. Implementing such a criterion for access to care could potentially deter patients from seeking dental services. Another reported concern was the inability to procure personal protective equipment due to the scarcity of these products in the market [20].
Less common psychological effects reported included job insecurity, subjective overload, perceived risk, and various feelings and emotions. For Italian dentists, perceived job insecurity was found to be linked with depressive symptoms, with this association intensifying in the presence of fear related to COVID-19 infection. Job insecurity is essentially the apprehension of losing or maintaining one's job. The implementation of measures to prevent virus transmission, such as social distancing, isolation, and the restriction of dental activities, not only led to financial losses but also potentially heightened the perception of job insecurity. Professionals with a heightened fear of COVID-19 infection may perceive their jobs to be at a greater risk, as being infected would render them unable to work for a specific period.
Subjective overload varied significantly across different countries - China, India, Israel, Italy, and the United Kingdom, with the highest average value recorded in the United Kingdom, followed by China, Italy, India, and Israel [23]. A comparison of subjective overload and psychological distress correlations between countries revealed that Italian dentists exhibited the highest values compared to their Chinese, Indian, and Israeli counterparts [23]. Subjective overload encompasses perceptions and emotions surrounding individuals' experiences in various aspects of daily life, not limited to the professional realm [32]. Nevertheless, the studies included in the analysis utilized tools that primarily assessed work-related subjective overload [23,27], indicating that Italian dentists faced elevated levels of workplace stress, potentially influenced by the prevailing conditions in the country. This link between subjective overload and psychological distress can be elucidated through Karasek's demand-control-support model [33], which posits that stress arises from the interplay between stressors, an individual's perceived control over these stressors, and the presence of social support. Amid the uncertainties stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, dentists may experience a lack of control, leading to heightened subjective overload [27]. Furthermore, the impact of COVID-19 statistics on subjective overload and psychological distress may vary among individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds and countries [23].
The evaluation of perceived risk among Italian orthodontists concerning COVID-19 indicated that a majority of professionals viewed dental practice as posing a high risk to themselves and their families [26]. In terms of orthodontic care, a larger proportion of professionals perceived it to be of lower risk [26], as Orthodontics is generally considered a specialty with minimal risk of contamination due to its quick procedures, limited aerosol generation, and the fact that most patients fall within the age group least affected by the virus [34]. Nevertheless, orthodontists should remain vigilant about the transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2, screen patients suspected of infection, adhere to official guidelines for virus transmission control, and seek patient cooperation in these efforts.
The study revealed that individuals experienced varying degrees of sadness and anger in response to COVID-19, aligning with previous research on the psychological effects of quarantine during past outbreaks. This underscores the heightened psychological impact on health professionals, who reported increased levels of anger, fear, and sadness. These findings emphasize the necessity of providing psychological support to healthcare workers, including dentists, during pandemics. Implementing initiatives such as economic assistance programs and promoting the use of digital communication tools can aid in mitigating the mental health burden on these professionals, thereby enhancing their overall well-being.
All studies reviewed utilized online questionnaires for data collection [8,20-25,27,28]. The prominence of digital tools in research during the COVID-19 pandemic is attributed to their ability to swiftly gather targeted information. Additional benefits encompass the convenience of responding to surveys via mobile devices, real-time data acquisition, sharing questionnaires through links, and immediate insights into health conditions [36]. Conversely, the utilization of non-validated surveys and convenience sampling can compromise the generalizability of data [37].
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the mental well-being of dentists, leading to a high prevalence of fear, anxiety, and other psychological symptoms. It is crucial to provide support and closely monitor these professionals to mitigate potential traumatic experiences stemming from the ongoing pandemic.
