The history of the Garças Reservoir presents a compelling case study of human-induced impacts stemming from urbanization pressures throughout the 20th century. Situated within the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga, a protected area in São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil, this shallow tropical system has been subject to significant changes. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset spanning from 1997 to 2017, our study assessed the temporal evolution of water quality using a trophic state index (TSI) and examined the efficacy of management interventions in enhancing water quality. Notably, the mechanical removal of macrophytes in 1999 precipitated a rapid transition from a eutrophic-supereutrophic to a hypereutrophic state, accompanied by feedback mechanisms. Subsequent developments, such as a reduction in internal phosphorus loading in 2005 and the implementation of secondary wastewater treatment at the city zoo in 2007, marked the initial stages of water quality enhancement. Key milestones, including the temporary diversion of sewage effluent in 2011 and its eventual cessation in 2014, significantly influenced TSI values, reflecting the impact of sewage effluent control measures on water quality. Over the course of 11 years post-macrophyte removal, the system has shown signs of improved health, underscoring the importance of ongoing efforts to enhance sewage treatment at the city zoo, the sole remaining external phosphorus source to the reservoir since 2014. The Garças Reservoir's history serves as a valuable lesson on the consequences of mismanagement strategies and the susceptibility of tropical shallow systems to eutrophication.
Freshwater systems, despite being crucial natural resources, are facing significant threats globally (Dudgeon et al., 2006; Vörösmarty et al., 2010; Moss, 2010). Eutrophication, one of the most prevalent anthropogenic impacts, poses a widespread challenge by compromising water quality for various purposes, disrupting aquatic biodiversity, and potentially endangering human health (Davidson & Jeppesen, 2013; Cumming et al., 2015).
Urban reservoirs are particularly susceptible to human impacts as they serve as a collection point for materials and pollutants from the surrounding drainage basin, receiving nutrient discharges that contribute to the deterioration of water quality (Branco & Senna, 1996; Figueredo & Giani, 2001; Dong et al., 2008; Fontana et al., 2014; Zorzal-Almeida et al., 2017). Additionally, shallow systems are more prone to eutrophication due to the interactions between water and sediment, as well as feedback mechanisms that heighten the system's resistance to restoration efforts (Søndegaard et al., 2003; Bicudo et al., 2007).
The history of the Garças Reservoir showcases a significant example of human impacts resulting from urbanization pressure throughout the 20th century. Situated within the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga preservation area, amidst the São Paulo Metropolitan Region, this urban system originated as a water supply reservoir constructed in 1894 to address the city's escalating need for drinking water, serving this purpose until 1928. Costa-Böddeker et al. (2012) presented a comprehensive account of the reservoir's eutrophication history spanning approximately 110 years, drawing from a paleolimnological study and land-use records from 1894 to 2005. As outlined by Costa-Böddeker et al. (2012), the reservoir witnessed a significant deterioration in water quality, primarily attributed to the influx of untreated sewage from the city zoo and additional untreated domestic effluent from the São Paulo State Department of Agriculture.
Initiated in 1997, a monthly monitoring program was established to assess the water quality of the Garças Reservoir. Over an 8-year temporal series (1997-2004), two distinct limnological phases were identified: pre and post the mechanical removal of the macrophyte Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms. This removal led to a sudden shift to a hypertrophic state, marked by persistent cyanobacterial blooms (Bicudo et al., 2007) and a reduction in phytoplankton species by an average of 37% (Crossetti et al., 2008). A more recent 20-year study (1997-2017) documented the invasion of the dinoflagellate Ceratium furcoides (Levander) Langhans and highlighted the environmental factors that facilitated its establishment and ecological success (Crossetti et al., 2019).
Long-term monitoring encompasses a multitude of variables, potentially complicating public comprehension and management decision-making processes. To address this challenge, trophic state indexes (TSI) have been refined and enhanced since the 1970s. These indexes focus on assessing aquatic productivity and eutrophication levels, providing accurate health insights into ecosystems. In São Paulo State, Lambarelli (2004) introduced a widely adopted TSI model, which builds upon Carlson's classic TSI (Carlson, 1977) by incorporating adjustments that account for the unique dynamics of tropical reservoirs.
Over the past two decades (1997-2017), the Garças Reservoir has experienced environmental transformations due to various management interventions such as the removal of macrophytes, diversion of sewage, and the establishment of a secondary wastewater treatment facility at the city zoo. Utilizing this extensive dataset, our study aimed to assess the temporal changes in water quality by employing a trophic state index (TSI) and to determine whether the implemented management strategies have had a positive impact on water quality. The TSI tool, widely utilized in monitoring studies, enables the comparison of ecosystem productivity and serves as an initial method to gauge the level of cultural eutrophication, drawing on previous works by Carlson (1977), Salas and Martino (1991), Lamparelli (2004), and Cunha et al. (2013).
The study area, Garças Reservoir (23°38'40.6"S, 46°37'28.0"W), is a shallow tropical system situated within the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga, a protected region of the Atlantic Rain Forest in São Paulo, São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil. Initially formed in 1894 by damming the Campanário creek to address the escalating demand for potable water, the reservoir originated from a larger water supply reservoir known as Campanário Reservoir. By approximately 1917, the Campanário Reservoir underwent division into five smaller water bodies, with Garças Reservoir emerging as the primary system. The onset of eutrophication can be traced back to the discharge of untreated sewage from the city zoo in 1958, followed by additional untreated sewage input from the São Paulo State Department of Agriculture in 1975. This influx of allochthonous nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, spurred extensive macrophyte growth, covering 40-70% of the water surface and fostering a surge in mosquito populations within the reserve. In response, local authorities mandated the mechanical removal of all macrophyte cover, a task completed within two months in September 1999. This intervention precipitated a rapid transition of Garças Reservoir from a eutrophic to a hypereutrophic state, characterized by persistent cyanobacteria blooms. The invasion of Ceratium furcoides in 2014 marked a significant disruption to the prevailing dominance of cyanobacteria blooms, as documented by Crossetti et al. (2019). For a comprehensive understanding of the reservoir's climate, morphometric attributes, and limnological alterations, interested readers are directed to the works of Bicudo et al. (2007) and Crossetti et al. (2019).
Data sampling was conducted monthly over a span of 20 consecutive years (1997-2017), consistently in the morning at the reservoir's deepest location. Water samples were collected using a van Dorn sampler and then transferred to acid-rinsed bottles. Water transparency was assessed with a Secchi disk, total phosphorus (TP) concentration was determined following Valderrama's (1981) method, and chlorophyll-a concentration, adjusted for pheophytin, was measured using 90% ethanol as per the protocol outlined by Sartory and Grobbelaar (1984).
In our data analysis, we employed an adapted version of Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI) as suggested by Lamparelli (2004) specifically for tropical reservoirs, drawing from reservoirs within the same geographical region as our study (CETESB 2014). The TSI incorporates measurements of total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) levels, and Secchi disk depth (SD) to derive the trophic index for each data point. Through this method, we were able to generate a 20-year time-series dataset on the trophic state of the reservoir.
To identify insightful changepoints within the time-series data, we conducted an analysis to detect significant shifts in both mean and variance. This analytical process effectively segmented the data based on alterations in means and variances, with a changepoint representing the boundary between distinct segments (Killick & Eckley, 2014). Utilizing the changepoint package (Killick & Eckley, 2014) and the PELT algorithm (Hinkley, 1970), capable of detecting multiple changepoints, we successfully pinpointed crucial changes in the trophic dynamics of the Garças Reservoir. The analysis was carried out using the R program (R Core Team, 2019).
After identifying critical changepoints within the data, we proceeded to analyze them using a method that involves fitting piecewise terms, or segments, within a regression model known as piecewise or segmented regression. This particular regression technique considers one or more break-points as essential parameters of the model and pinpoints potential time points that exhibit significant changes. The identification of these potential break-points in the model is facilitated by what is referred to as a "nuisance parameter," rendering standard statistical tests inapplicable (Muggeo, 2008). Consequently, traditional p-values cannot be utilized. To address this limitation, we employed the Davies test (Davies, 1977) to assess significant differences between the slopes of each segment. It is important to note that the Davies test does not aim to estimate the break-point but rather tests for a non-zero difference-in-slope parameter within a segmented relationship. To conduct this analysis, we utilized the segmented package (Muggeo, 2008) within the R programming environment (R Core Team, 2019).
The water quality of Garças Reservoir exhibited variability over the study period. Initially, spanning from 1997 to 1999, the system maintained eutrophic and supereutrophic states with Trophic State Index (TSI) values ranging between 59.1 and 67.0 without standard deviation (SD). Subsequently, from 2000 to 2011, the reservoir was classified as hypereutrophic (TSI ≥ 67.0 without SD), and then, from 2011 until the conclusion of the study in 2017, it reverted to a supereutrophic state, with the exception of 2013 as depicted in figure 2. Notably, starting from 2000, the impact of Secchi disk depth on the overall index behavior began to escalate, experiencing a decline only in the final three years of the study (2015-2017) as illustrated in figure 2.
The limnological variables Chl-a, TP, and SD utilized for TSI estimation exhibited significant variability throughout the entire period (Figure 3). Over the course of the study, TP concentrations ranged from 37.77 to 979.68 µg L-¹ (with a mean value of 172.44), Chl-a ranged from 11.77 to 1323.63 µg L-¹ (mean value of 156.60), and SD ranged from 0.05 to 1.7 m (mean value of 0.41) (Table 1). Both Chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus concentrations displayed similar patterns of variation, experiencing a notable increase towards the end of 1999. However, TP exhibited distinct spikes in 1999, 2001, late 2002, and throughout 2003 to 2005, while both variables maintained a consistent relative behavior thereafter. Secchi disk depth witnessed a sharp decline during the winter of 1999, maintaining relatively low values until 2010 when it began to rise once more (Figure 3).
The changepoint analysis revealed a single point dividing the TSI time series into two segments, as indicated by the orange lines in figure 4a, denoting significant mean and variance changes in the TSI values over time. Subsequently, within each segment, we identified a new changepoint to ascertain additional mean changes in the data. Notably, we observed a mean increase from 64 to 71 (figure 4a), succeeded by a mean decrease from 74 to 67 (figure 4b), and ultimately stabilizing at a mean value of 67 (figure 4c). This sequential information proved crucial for the implementation of piecewise regression. The initial mean change transpired in August 1999, serving as a potential breakpoint for the segmented regression analysis. However, the breakpoint identified through regression analysis materialized in October 2001. This delineated a significant TSI increase succeeded by a notable decrease (figure 4b), corroborated by a positive regression coefficient (Time = 0.29) followed by a negative coefficient (U1.Time = -0.34) (table 2). Notably, the P value for the U1.Time term in table 2 is denoted as "not applicable (NA)," attributed to the inapplicability of standard methods, as previously discussed. The significance of the Davies test underscored the robustness of our regression coefficients.
Figure 5 illustrates the synthesis of the TSI inter-annual variation, showcasing the similarity between the trophic state index of 2017 and that of 1997, both hovering near the hypereutrophic threshold. In contrast, the period spanning 2000 to 2010 witnesses a steady increase in TSI, with the hypereutrophic state prevailing. Post-2011, barring 2013, TSI declines towards the supereutrophic state. The most significant TSI shift occurs after phase II (April 1998 to September 1999), followed by notable changes during various events documented in the study (refer to tables 1 and 3). Notably, the impact of the zoo secondary sewage treatment (STS Zoo in figure 5) is evident through a gradual decrease in all variable values (as shown in table 1). The latest timeframe (2014-2017) reveals the lowest TSI, chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus concentrations in the time-series, underscoring a trend towards improved water quality.
The Garças Reservoir, a component of long-term ecological research (LTER), has undergone thorough investigation over the years. Analysis of data spanning two decades reveals a modest enhancement in the overall health of the ecosystem.
The water quality of the system has gradually deteriorated since the construction of the city zoo in 1958 in a headspring area located upstream of the Garças Reservoir, exacerbated by the installation of the Department of Agriculture in 1975, both lacking adequate sanitation and contributing to high sewage loadings. According to Bicudo et al. (2007), this eutrophication resulted in seasonal cyanobacterial blooms, rapid growth of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), and a significant proliferation of mosquitoes. In an attempt to control the mosquito population, most of the macrophytes were mechanically removed during the cyanobacterial bloom period. However, this controversial strategy led to a feedback mechanism in Garças Reservoir, causing internal phosphorus loading and persistent cyanobacterial blooms, ultimately pushing the system into an "irreversible degraded state." The Trophic State Index (TSI) clearly captured this abrupt change, showing a transition to a hypereutrophic state in 1999-2000. Bicudo et al. (2007) provided a detailed analysis of this process, outlining distinct limnological phases (I, II, and III) and discussing the implications of these actions.
The acceleration of eutrophication began in late 1999 through self-eutrophication (internal P loading), marking the initiation of our time series encompassing over 15 years of post-disturbance data. This extensive dataset offers a valuable opportunity to examine the system's response following such a significant event (Turner et al., 2006; Muller et al., 2010) and establish a long-term baseline for detecting changes and measuring ecosystem responses to disturbances (Buma, 2015).
The removal of macrophytes in 1999 resulted in a significant increase in the TSI mean values, leading to a shift towards a more turbid state, elevated phosphorus concentrations, and feedback mechanisms (Bicudo et al., 2007). This impact was observed through a continuous TSI increase until the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2002, as demonstrated by the point break regression (Figure 5). Subsequent years saw a decline in TSI, possibly influenced by various management events in the system's history (Tables 1 and 3). Notably, the initiation of secondary wastewater treatment at the city zoo in October 2007 played a crucial role. Additionally, there appears to have been a reduction in the internal phosphorus loading process since 2005, evident from lower surface P values in the time-series (Figure 3) and a decrease in bottom soluble reactive phosphorus alongside increased bottom oxygen levels (DCB, unpublished data). Consequently, the combination of these factors post-2007 initiated a positive trend in water quality improvement. By 2008, a significant limnological shift was observed, with the dominance of cyanobacteria transitioning from Microcystis aeruginosa (Kützing) Kützing to Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszýnska) Seenayya & Subba Raju (Crossetti et al., 2019).
Water transparency was significantly impacted by the removal of water hyacinth, as noted by Bicudo et al. (2007), and remained a key variable throughout the time-series, offering valuable insights into system equilibrium (Scheffer 1990). The transition from an irreversible turbid phase to clearer waters appears to have initiated around 2011, with notable improvements observed in the last five years (2013 to 2017) as depicted in figures 2-3. The shift from dense cyanobacterial blooms to other phytoplankton species, particularly the invasive Ceratium furcoides, likely played a role in enhancing transparency levels, as highlighted by Crossetti et al. (2019).
In 2011, the Total Suspended Solids Index (TSI) initially transitioned to a supereutrophic state, as depicted in figures 2c and 5a, due to prior interventions and the temporary diversion of sewage effluent from the São Paulo State Department of Agriculture, as outlined in table 3. The significant spike in TSI observed in 2013 can be attributed to the unprecedented drought experienced in the region during the 2013-2014 period in southeastern Brazil, as reported by ANA in 2015. By 2014, the sewage effluent had been deactivated, leading to the system maintaining its supereutrophic status, with all variables indicating an enhancement in the overall health of the system, as detailed in table 1.
The Trophic State Index (TSI) effectively highlighted the susceptibility of this shallow tropical reservoir to mismanagement practices (Bicudo et al., 2007) and underscored the enduring repercussions of self-eutrophication on the restoration process (Jeppensen et al., 2003, 2005). Additionally, the TSI demonstrated a keen responsiveness to significant historical milestones concerning the regulation of sewage discharges.
In summary, 11 years following the lasting effects of macrophyte removal in 1999, the current findings indicate an enhancement in the overall health of the system. The deceleration of the internal phosphorus loading process, coupled with the secondary sewage treatment from the urban zoo and the sewage inactivation by the State Department of Agriculture, has contributed to maintaining the supereutrophic condition. It is crucial to highlight that while the secondary sewage treatment effectively eliminates biodegradable organic matter (whether in solution or suspended) and suspended solids, it does not address dissolved nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Therefore, to sustain the ongoing recovery of the reservoir, it is imperative to enhance the sewage treatment processes at the city zoo, particularly considering that it has been the sole external phosphorus source to the Garças Reservoir since 2014.
The urbanization pressure has led to significant consequences for the Garças Reservoir, offering valuable insights into ineffective management strategies and the eutrophication process in tropical systems. A crucial step in preventing water quality degradation involves controlling external nutrient loading, which encompasses both point and non-point source pollution, as well as effective management planning.
