In this paper, I aim to explore the relationship between the abstract concept of "family" and a comprehensive examination of "kinship" within migratory contexts. Drawing on three cases investigated by my research team, I seek to underscore a critical evaluation of the family's role in migration studies. I aim to illustrate how the term "family" often serves to homogenize differences and functions as a component of systems that may struggle to persist if the concept of kinship were to be rigorously considered.
In this speech, I aim to explore the relationship between the broad concept of "family" and a deeper examination of "kinship" within migratory contexts. Drawing on three cases investigated by my research team, I seek to underscore a critical evaluation of the family's role in migration studies. I aim to illustrate how the term "family" often serves to homogenize differences and functions within systems that may struggle to sustain themselves if the complexities of kinship were to be thoroughly addressed.
The initial step involves defining what is referred to as 'the machinery': this term is utilized as a metaphor to describe the development of theoretical and analytical models of explanation within disciplines such as sociology and anthropology. This metaphor aids in conceptualizing these models as a collection of machines, gears, and devices that collectively form a framework for thinking. It is crucial to recognize and comprehend that these machines are not entities in isolation; rather, they serve as instruments that facilitate our understanding and analysis of the events and processes that capture our attention.
The machinery must undergo continuous adaptation as reality often deviates from our models. This dynamic nature presents various outcomes, with a prevalent occurrence being machinery becoming rigid. In such instances, there is a tendency to impose our models onto reality, transforming the machinery from a reflective tool into an obstacle that obstructs comprehension of phenomena. Consequently, machinery can either facilitate or impede understanding. When hindrance occurs, the intended comprehension is obscured by the machinery, leading to a disconnect between the intended purpose and the actual outcome.
The initial indication of machinery becoming stiff and rusty is its transformation into an object, a phenomenon that could be termed as "objectification." A prime illustration within migration studies is the concept of "ethnicity." Initially utilized to analyze the steadfast presence of difference in situations where a gradual assimilation was anticipated, the machinery that obstructed the comprehension of phenomena (referred to as the machinery of acculturation) eventually became an object itself. Ethnicity, which was once a tool for critical thinking, is now perceived as tangible as any physical object. When machinery transitions into an object, there is a risk of conflating the process with the machinery, leading to further rigidity and hindrance in understanding.
In the context of migration, multiple machines function in a somewhat objectified manner. However, the aim here is not to critique the prevailing hegemonic models. Rather, the focus is on contemplating the role of the "family" within this framework, specifically how the family functions as a component in the machinery of explanations rooted in networks and transnational theory. When viewed as a component, what aspects are overlooked when the family is merely a cog in the machinery? Conversely, if we consider a machinery structured around the concept of kinship, what insights are brought to light?
In the theory of networks (Portes, 1995), the focus shifts from the economism of rational action explanations for migration to emphasizing social relations as the driving force behind displacement. Rather than solely considering average income differences, this perspective highlights the significance of social relationships, with the family being a central element within networks. The family is viewed as a key node in any migratory network, playing a crucial role in connecting individuals. However, the concept of family presented here is a generic and universal one, devoid of any anthropological discourse on kinship. It is this generic family that is seen as integral to articulating migratory networks, with the emphasis placed on understanding the network itself rather than the underlying structures such as family, friendship, or vicinality, which could be categorized under the broader notion of kinship.
Within the realm of transnational machinery (refer to Baubock and Faist, 2010), the focal point lies in the manner and repercussions of migrants leading lives across two or more countries concurrently, entailing a dual engagement with political and sociological ramifications. While the scope is broad and varied, it is evident that in all manifestations of transnationalism, the family assumes a central role as the primary and favored conduit linking these dual affiliations. However, akin to network theories, the family itself functions as a mere cog in the mechanism facilitating connections between two realities, bridging national policies and migrant rights, serving as a narrative link in the reinforcement of national powers, discrimination, and the very construction of the "world-system".
In both instances, the concept of family is contingent, as it can either be deemed irrelevant or presupposed as an underlying model that is uncritically integrated into the system. Evidently, the Western model of family, centered around the nuclear family, consanguinity, and biological ties, serves as the predominant underlying framework. However, when considering kinship as a tool for understanding migration, the definition of "family" becomes crucial rather than contingent. It is essential to recognize that the term "family" is inherently limiting, as it overlooks the diverse range of kinship relationships that exist. The term carries the burden of conforming to Western ideals of functionality, and even the definition of kinship itself requires reevaluation to break free from the confines of traditional anthropological perspectives.
Schneider's critiques have sparked a renewed interest in kinship studies, highlighting the need to recognize a wide range of relationships as kinship ties, including friendships, companionships, and shared experiences, while notably omitting the acknowledgment of same-sex relationships as kinship connections. This focus underscores the fluidity and adaptability of relationships, mirroring the flexibility inherent in kinship structures. This brief divergence prompts reflection on the inadequacy of the term "family" to encapsulate the diverse array of connections that can be classified as kinship bonds.
When considering kinship as a framework to comprehend migration, we uncover the hidden diversity of relationships within the myriad of migrant kinships, a facet often overlooked by current models. It is crucial to note that prevailing models tend to view family as just one component among various sociological connections, yet they often portray a narrow, rigid, and outdated concept of family. This limited perspective inadvertently erases the rich tapestry of diverse kinships among migrants. To illustrate this oversight, let us delve into three examples that showcase the breadth of migrant kinships, highlighting how this variance is disregarded within the existing framework.
Brazilian individuals residing in Portugal continue to represent the most significant migrant group within the nation. Despite facing economic challenges, the rates of return migration, or remigration, remain relatively low, suggesting a strong establishment of the Brazilian community in Portugal (Machado, 2014). Through two distinct fieldwork investigations, I will highlight internal variations within this Brazilian community, revealing the presence of distinct kinship structures that influence diverse approaches to their relationship with the host country.
In the initial case (Machado, 2009), stemming from my doctoral research conducted nearly fifteen years ago, a distinct cohort of Brazilians was examined: a group of predominantly male, single, and young immigrants residing in proximity to restaurant employment opportunities. This collective formed a tight-knit community in Porto in 2000, engaging in social interactions, relationships, and adopting aspects of Portuguese culture. Their lives were intricately woven into the fabric of Portuguese kinship networks, primarily within the lower socioeconomic strata. Consequently, they experienced a unique reality characterized by labor market integration and assimilation into Portuguese social structures. Within this Brazilian enclave in Porto, a noteworthy aspect emerged in their discourse: their relationship with Brazil. Despite various factors, likely linked to their integration into Portuguese social circles, these immigrants did not envision a return to Brazil. While Brazil held significance, it served primarily as a means to reaffirm their Brazilian identity within the internal dynamics of their community in Porto.
The choice not to return was intricately linked to their integration into Portuguese kinship networks, which played a significant role in the collective existence of these Brazilians, encompassing relationships with girlfriends, employers, and customers. It is crucial to emphasize that this integration continuously shaped the experiences of these individuals within the urban setting of Port.
In another case under examination, we shift our focus to Brazilian immigrants in Portugal, this time considering the perspective of their family members who remain in Brazil, particularly in Governador Valadares. For these migrants, their experience differed as they were viewed as "target migrants", with clear objectives to achieve upon migration. These objectives included accumulating a specific sum for constructing homes and establishing businesses to ensure their families' sustenance. The encounters of these immigrants were shaped by a distinct kinship structure prevalent in Governador Valadares. As previously elucidated in my prior work, this kinship structure revolved around the aspiration to form independent family units that also served as hubs for various relationships.
The predominant form of migration observed was that of married men leaving their families in Brazil while they sought work in Portugal, with the intention of eventually returning to reestablish familial ties in Valadares. This migration pattern, centered around kinship processes in Valadares, had significant implications for the lives of Brazilians residing in Portugal. Some notable consequences included a tendency to avoid public displays, increased working hours in pursuit of financial gain, a preference for residing among fellow Valadares migrants, and a heightened propensity to join Brazilian Protestant religious communities within Portugal.
The experience of individuals from Valadares, Portugal, stands in stark contrast to that of Brazilians living in Porto. While the latter group actively sought to emphasize their Brazilian identity to secure employment opportunities in a labor market that valued such cultural distinctiveness, the former group endeavors to conceal any traces of their Brazilian heritage. This strategic concealment serves as a means to safeguard their original migration intentions and avoid potential complications that may arise from being identified as Brazilian in Portugal.
The impact of Brazilian migrations in Portugal is evident in the emergence of distinct realities, a phenomenon largely attributed to the influence of kinship machinery. This difference in realities would likely be less pronounced if other mechanisms were at play. Traditional perspectives such as transnationalism and network theory within the sociology of migrations tend to focus on alternative processes, overlooking the significant role of kinship structures in shaping such divergent outcomes. The kinship orders at play here are instrumental in generating markedly discordant realities, underscoring their pivotal role in shaping the migrant experience.
In her 2014 study, Nadia Kubota delves into the historically tense relationship between immigrants from Okinawa and "traditional" Japan in Campo Grande, Brazil. Coexistence proved challenging, particularly exacerbated by the Second World War, which catalyzed a profound schism between the "defeatist" and "victorist" factions. This conflict, notorious for spawning the Shindo Renmei, a small victorist army seeking retribution against the "defeatist," underscored the deep-seated animosity between the two groups. Campo Grande, akin to numerous other Japanese/Okinawan migration hubs, witnessed a stark divide between the Okinawans/"defeatist" and the Japanese/"victorist."
This division resulted in the formation of two distinct associations, leading to lives lived in parallel. Through an extensive notarial survey, Kubota was able to ascertain that marriage rates between Okinawans and Japanese in Campo Grande have consistently remained minimal, lower than the marriage rates observed between Okinawans and Brazilians, as well as between Japanese and Brazilians. Ethnographic evidence reveals a systematic pattern of non-relationship between Okinawans and Japanese (Naichi), characterized by a reluctance to establish familial ties or produce kinship. Instances of marriage between Japanese and Okinawan individuals are exceedingly rare. This underscores kinship as a form of political expression reflecting colonial relations between Japan and Okinawa, a dynamic that persisted in Brazil for much of the twentieth century.
However, a significant shift occurred towards the end of the twentieth century with the migration of Naichis and Okinawans to Japan, rather than to Okinawa within Japan. This influx of the entire Nikkei population, whether they were descendants of Naichis or Okinawans, or spouses with no direct bloodline, found themselves in a society that was resistant to differences, leading to encounters with intense racism and prejudice. These challenging experiences ultimately served to diminish or mitigate the internal distinctions between Okinawans and Naichis, resulting in the formation of Brazilian communities in Japan that transcended the dividing lines present in Brazil.
In Japan, there are indications of kinship blending that were previously separated in Brazil, resulting in two distinct forms of kinship organizations driven by migration. The new ways of life in Japan have given rise to novel forms of kinship, leading to a notable difference between a family of Okinawan descent in Brazil and one in present-day Japan. Migration has led to the emergence of distinct kinship systems that significantly impact the lives of both migrants to Japan and those who remained in Brazil. Kubota suggests that those who stay in Brazil tend to reorganize their relationships based more on neighborhood ties rather than blood relations, while members of families affected by emigration often come together to form new families. This phenomenon points to the existence of a third kinship system that appears to retain elements of the historical division between Okinawans and Japanese.
What do these three examples reveal about family and kinship within a migratory context? How do they reflect the current prevailing mechanisms? Specifically, what is the central argument in this discourse? Let's delve into the second inquiry concerning the dominant mechanisms. The aim here is not to critique or label them as obsolete, but rather to unveil their operational framework and illustrate how they function with somewhat diluted concepts of family, stemming from broad considerations and diverse objectives. None of these mechanisms seek to elucidate the essence of family itself, but rather focus on other aspects (ranging from the nation-state to a network of migrant social connections). Consequently, in pursuit of their explanatory objectives and in order to illuminate specific issues, these mechanisms inadvertently neglect the intricate workings of the family structure.
Distinguishing between the two Brazilian kinships in Portugal and the three kinships resulting from the Okinawan experience in Brazil and Japan would be incidental to other analytical objectives, rather than manifesting as the daily disparities they generate. The essence of my argument lies in utilizing a kinship-centered framework to illuminate the profound and significant distinctions between these various kinships. In doing so, I advocate for an anthropological perspective on kinship that emphasizes the differences engendered by migrant kinship structures.
The examples provided shed light on the significance of family and migrant kinship in various migrant experiences, emphasizing the complex web of relationships that involve emotional, moral, and financial investments. These kinship ties, which may not be immediately apparent, defy a singular model. For instance, within the context of Portuguese networks or maintaining connections with home networks, the same nationality can result in diverse kinship structures in Portugal. Similarly, the historical process of Okinawans migrating to Brazil and subsequently their descendants moving to Japan decades later has led to the emergence of three distinct kinship systems, each evolving and impacting the lives of these individuals. Therefore, it is imperative to adopt an ethnographic approach to comprehend the diverse notions of family that migration introduces, shapes, and alters over time.
