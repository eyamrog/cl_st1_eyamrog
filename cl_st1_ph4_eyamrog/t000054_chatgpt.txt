In Latin America, the vast biodiversity is linked to the presence of extensive, largely unexplored regions and indigenous communities, some of which remain uncontacted. Amidst the array of preserved life forms, the threat of genetic erosion due to unchecked exploitation is evident, as is the issue of appropriation by institutions and individuals, often at the expense of the communities' ways of life and cultural practices. This article aims to delve into these complexities, drawing on documented insights from various authors. The cases highlighted underscore the potential for the region to harness its biodiversity for sustainable development within a bioeconomy framework. This model envisions a harmonious coexistence of scientific, educational, and production entities, bolstered by government policies that prioritize environmental conservation, respect for indigenous populations, and legal safeguards for heritage protection.
The importance of biodiversity, its conservation, and sustainable utilization are prominent topics in contemporary discussions within the realms of politics, science, and economics. The Rio de Janeiro Summit of 1992 specifically allocated a segment to address the pressing issues concerning the survival of the planet, culminating in the adoption of the Convention on Biological Diversity.
The definition of biodiversity embraced at this event is notably comprehensive, encompassing "the variability of living organisms from any source, including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems" (United Nations 1992:3).
While significant advancements have not been achieved in adhering to the stipulations of the convention, the matter continues to be under scrutiny and is subject to periodic review, given its global significance, particularly for developing nations. It is within these countries that the greatest biodiversity is found, yet they also face the most imminent threats to this diversity. Latin America and the Caribbean are distinguished by their remarkable natural abundance in contrast to other parts of the world, but they are also at high risk of resource depletion and degradation (León and Cárdenas, 2020).
The concept of biodiversity as a set of resources is deemed misleading by Klier (2016) and Martínez et al. (2018), who argue that western policies often frame biodiversity preservation as safeguarding "the other," encompassing animals, plants, and regions that deviate from the conventional norms of a developed society. Consequently, communities and cultural practices linked to biodiversity and its sustainable utilization by these communities are marginalized, while nature is commodified. Conversely, developing nations are compelled to bolster their economies, often necessitating the exploitation of biological diversity that they are also obligated to conserve. The notion of bioeconomy has recently emerged to denote the efficient utilization of biological and natural resources, alongside the repurposing of their byproducts to diminish reliance on fossil fuels and promote decarbonization of the economy (Hodson, Henry, & Trigo, 2019).
This article aims to explore the interplay between Latin American biodiversity and its potential integration into the bioeconomy while respecting the cultural traditions of indigenous communities.
This reflective article delves into the analysis of current information regarding the state of biodiversity in Latin America, exploring its interconnectedness with the cultural practices of indigenous peoples. It also sheds light on various instances of attempts made by institutions and individuals to appropriate these valuable resources. Furthermore, the article emphasizes the necessity of utilizing the resources offered by biodiversity through a model grounded in the principles of the bioeconomy.
The research is situated within the constructivist hermeneutic paradigm and adopts a grounded theory approach. A comprehensive review of relevant literature was conducted to inform the authors' perspectives on the strategic development of the Latin American bioeconomy. This involves advocating for a harmonious collaboration among research, educational, productive, and governmental entities to drive sustainable growth and innovation in the region.
Latin America and the Caribbean boast an exceptional abundance of animal and plant species, with nearly 60% of the world's terrestrial species calling this region home. Furthermore, this area is renowned for its diverse marine and freshwater flora and fauna, as highlighted by the United Nations Environment Programme in 2018.
In the unique context of Latin America, characterized by vast unexplored regions and communities untouched by modernity, the perception of biodiversity is divided into two contrasting perspectives. On one side, the western or usufructuary view regards everything on Earth as a potential resource open to extensive exploitation. Conversely, the traditional or indigenous viewpoint emphasizes reverence for nature, harmonious coexistence with all species, and the rational utilization or even worship of natural resources. Regrettably, as highlighted by Martínez et al. (2018), while the inherent properties of a resource are intrinsic and independent of human influence, it is humanity that assigns market value to it and determines the degree to which it is either exploited or conserved.
From this perspective, the concept of biocoloniality is utilized in the management of biodiversity (Beltrán, 2016). This concept posits that modern science is uniquely equipped to uncover truths and illustrate concepts, stemming from a prevailing cultural rationale that originates from colonial domination. This domination, which modernity has historically exerted over indigenous populations in various spheres such as politics, society, and religion, underscores the power dynamics at play in the management of biodiversity.
As highlighted by the author,
Western thought has historically exhibited a homogenizing and hegemonic inclination, asserting its interpretation as the definitive understanding of the meaning of life and existence. This perspective often overlooks the validity of alternative viewpoints that offer diverse insights into humanity, its existence, and the world it occupies (Beltrán, 2016:216).
This violence is manifested even at an epistemological level, as the differentiation between scientific knowledge and traditional knowledge implies a perceived hierarchy with the former being considered superior to the latter (Beltrán, 2017).
Research has often been utilized as a justification for the exploitation of biodiversity resources by scientific institutions and private enterprises, aiming to incorporate them into contemporary scientific initiatives and, at times, establish monopolies over said resources (Toro, 2007). Consequently, there have been endeavors, varying in degrees of success, to appropriate the natural assets of Latin American biodiversity for commercial purposes.
The Latin American regions with the highest levels of biodiversity are often inhabited by diverse peoples, tribes, and communities whose habits, customs, and cultural practices are intricately linked to the surrounding biodiversity.
The expansion of agriculture, industry, and urbanism into these regions has resulted in the extinction of numerous animal and plant species that remain undiscovered by modern science. However, the focus of this discussion is not on these losses but rather on how the exploitation of biodiversity components has disregarded the traditions of indigenous communities, often from a standpoint of cultural superiority.
Next, three cases will be presented to illustrate how the scientific community in developed countries has appropriated native species, originally tied to ancestral practices of indigenous peoples, thereby stripping them of their cultural significance and relegating them to mere commodities within the market.
In the Amazon basin, shamans utilize a concoction known as ayahuasca to induce a state of ecstasy characterized by visual and auditory hallucinations. Among the various methods of preparation, the most prevalent involves combining two plants, namely Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis.
The consumption of ayahuasca has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, attracting ethno-tourism interest in certain regions and giving rise to spiritual movements centered around its use, such as Santo Daime, União do Vegetal, Barquinha, among others (Domínguez et al., 2016). The cultural significance of the ayahuasca ceremony is profound, traditionally viewed as a purifying ritual for both the body and spirit, facilitating a connection with astral energies. Scientific inquiry from the Western perspective has elucidated the mechanism behind the hallucinogenic effects: Psychotria viridis contains dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a potent hallucinogen; ordinarily, the body inhibits the metabolism of DMT in the gut, but the β-carbolines present in Banisteriopsis caapi counteract this inhibition, allowing DMT to reach the central nervous system (Escobar, 2015). Research has also indicated that the concoction exhibits antidepressant properties (Sanches et al., 2016; Bouso & Sánchez, 2020).
While the medical significance of ayahuasca has only recently come to light, commercial interest in this plant has been present for quite some time. In 1986, Loren Miller, a US citizen and the director of the International Plant Medicine Corporation (IPMC), successfully obtained a plant patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This patent, named De Vine, was based on ayahuasca, a plant Miller had acquired during his expedition to the Amazon jungle in 1981.
The concession sparked a wave of complaints from indigenous communities and triggered an international lawsuit spearheaded by the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA). Following years of legal wrangling, the patent was eventually revoked in 1999. However, this revocation was not a direct result of the indigenous groups' claims but rather due to the fact that a specimen of the plant had been housed in the Chicago Museum prior to the patent request. Surprisingly, in 2001, Miller produced new documentation and successfully regained the patent until its expiration in 2003, albeit with restricted rights limited to the plant's genome and its asexual propagules (Beyer, 2008).
Peyote, a cactus indigenous to the arid regions of Mexico and the southern United States, encompasses two species known as Lophophora williamsii and Lophophora diffusa. The former yields mescaline, while the latter yields pellotine, both alkaloids known for their potent psychotropic properties akin to those of lysergic acid.
The hallucinogenic properties of Lophophora williamsii may have garnered more attention in the Western world than its therapeutic effects on respiratory, rheumatic, and venereal diseases, which have traditionally been recognized by Mexican indigenous communities (Ibarra et al., 2015). Furthermore, this plant species also yields other alkaloids with potential pharmaceutical significance, including anhalidine, lophophorin, and anhalonin (Santos & Camarena, 2019).
Several South American species of the genus Trichocereus also synthesize mescaline, making it not exclusive to Lophophora williamsii (Cassels & Sáez, 2018). However, Lophophora williamsii stands out as the plant uniquely linked to cultural practices of shamanism, divine rites, and dream visions among Mexican communities such as the Tarahumaras, the Coras, and notably the Huicholes (Clavijo, 2018).
Mescaline has garnered attention for its pharmacological potential in treating conditions such as headaches, depression, obsessions, anxiety, and addiction to substances like alcohol. This interest is largely due to the minimal risk of dependency associated with mescaline use, as well as the moderate and non-life-threatening nature of intoxication from this substance (Dinis-Oliveira, Lança & Dias, 2019).
The metabolites derived from Lophophora williamsii, akin to those found in numerous other cacti, present an underexplored potential within the pharmaceutical industry (Das et al., 2020). However, unlike the commercial interest seen in substances like ayahuasca, the compounds from Lophophora williamsii have not garnered similar business attention, potentially attributed to the legal controversies surrounding the latter.
The frog Epipedobates anthonyi, endemic to Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, possesses a potent poison on its skin that has not only bestowed upon it its name but also captivated the scientific community since the 1970s. During this period, the chemist John Daly, affiliated with the US National Institute of Health, gathered skins of this amphibian in Ecuador. It is speculated that these samples might have exited the country through diplomatic channels, as there is no documented evidence indicating that the Ecuadorian Institute of Forestry and Natural Areas (INEFAN, later integrated into the Ministry of Environment) issued a license for this activity (GRAIN 1998). Subsequent laboratory investigations resulted in the synthesis of a non-opioid alkaloid, epibatidine, which has garnered significant interest in the pharmaceutical realm.
Epibatidine's potential as a medicinal substance was limited due to the delicate balance required between its therapeutic benefits and adverse effects. Nonetheless, it played a crucial role as a blueprint for Abbot Laboratories in the development and patenting of ABT-594 in 1995. This derivative exhibited an analgesic potency surpassing that of morphine by 200 times, while also avoiding the hazardous side effects associated with epibatidine (Angerer, 2015).
INEFAN, Ecuador initiated a lawsuit against the patent in 1998, which ultimately yielded no results. The rationale provided was the absence of evidence supporting the traditional medicinal use of frog skin in Ecuadorian folklore; instead, it was noted that the skin was primarily utilized as a hunting poison. Furthermore, it was highlighted that the synthesis of ABT-594 did not directly involve the use of frog skins but rather utilized their structural blueprint as a model (Jurado, 2021). Nevertheless, from a bioethical standpoint, particularly under the principle of utilitarianism or beneficence, one may question why the indigenous communities inhabiting the regions where these amphibians reside did not receive any benefits from such developments (Proto, 2019).
The historical trend of the Western world exploiting Latin American biodiversity for resources is well-established. Centuries of colonialism have relegated Latin America to the role of a mere supplier of raw materials for major industries such as food, mining, textiles, and more recently, chemicals and pharmaceuticals in developed nations.
Meanwhile, these entities solidified their dominance in the production of goods derived from these raw materials, resulting in the current scenario where the likelihood of Latin American industries emerging as competitive forces in global markets, particularly against established entities in Europe, North America, or Asia, is minimal. The prospect of a Latin American entrepreneur attempting to challenge the market presence of corporations like Ford, Toyota, Monsanto, or BASF, even within their own nation, seems improbable. Nevertheless, it is imperative for the region to progress towards economic advancement. The question that arises is: how can this be achieved?
The potential for the Latin American economy to grow lies in a unique space, paradoxically rooted in its rich biodiversity, a resource crucial for conservation. This growth trajectory hinges on the concept of bioeconomy, emphasizing the efficient utilization of biological and natural resources alongside waste recycling. Embracing bioeconomy offers numerous benefits, including decreased reliance on fossil fuels for energy and a consequent reduction in carbon emissions (Hodson, Henry & Trigo, 2019).
The implementation of an economic model founded on the rational utilization of biodiversity could not only enhance the well-being of terrestrial ecosystems but also safeguard life itself. As highlighted by Philp (2015), the existing unsustainable conditions of the current model are incapable of sustaining life in the long run.
An illustrative case highlighting the requirements for fostering the bioeconomy can be observed in Brazil. With 15% of the world's species, Brazil possesses ample land, a favorable climate, low population density, and abundant natural resources. Nevertheless, it also serves as a cautionary tale, showcasing how the focus on exporting raw materials has hindered the country's progress in establishing the necessary infrastructure, policies, and institutions conducive to a bioeconomic approach.
Brazil, along with the entire subcontinent, is faced with the imperative to "run after lost time" as highlighted by Valli, Russo, and Bolzani (2018). This challenge is not unique to Brazil but extends across Latin America. The region enters this race at a disadvantage, as evidenced by the introduction of 1,211 new products in the pharmaceutical market between 1981 and 2014, with 60% of these products derived from natural substances or structures found in nature, as noted by Newman and Cragg (2016).
Latin American biodiversity offers vast opportunities to harness numerous natural resources, many of which remain undiscovered, for utilization in the bioeconomy. This abundance presents a promising avenue for economic growth and innovation. Consider the following two cases as illustrative examples.
The escalating demands for food due to population growth and the breeding of animals for human consumption have prompted the exploration of alternative nutrient sources. Among these alternatives is the utilization of insect-derived flour, with a notable example being the larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.). Originally native to America, this species has now proliferated globally. The conversion of these larvae into flour yields a high protein content, making it a valuable resource for feeding fish (Meitiyani et al., 2020) and birds (Wahid et al., 2021).
Soldier fly larvae are increasingly being utilized as a partial replacement for wheat flour in bakery products, offering nutritional benefits such as higher protein and fiber content compared to traditional flour (González, Garzón & Rosell, 2019). In Ecuador, the inaugural soldier fly meal production facility in Latin America was established in late 2021 by Bioconversión S.A. at the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral campus in Guayaquil (El Universo, 2021).
Acetogenins are natural compounds known for their potent antitumor properties, surpassing the efficacy of certain conventional cancer chemotherapy drugs by several orders of magnitude. These bioactive substances are exclusively found in species belonging to the Annona genus, including custard apple (Annona cherimola Mill.), soursop (Annona muricata L.), and sugar apple (Annona squamosa L.). The phytochemical efficacy of acetogenins has been substantiated through in vitro studies, animal experimentation, and simulations mimicking the human digestive system (Gutiérrez et al., 2020; León, Pájaro & Granados, 2020; Naik, Dessai & Sellappan, 2021; Nayak & Hedge, 2021).
The Annonaceae family comprises approximately 2,500 species that are found growing naturally or cultivated in tropical regions across America, Asia, and Madagascar (González, 2013). However, a significant portion of these species are indigenous to Latin America, particularly Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil. It is worth noting that a majority of the research focusing on the antitumor properties of acetogenins and their pharmacological applications has been conducted in laboratories located in Europe, the United States, and Asia.
Based on these two examples, it is evident that the region is cautiously moving towards adopting an economic model that leverages its biodiversity to create innovative products within the bioeconomy framework. Collaborative efforts across different sectors are essential to establish an education-research-production-policy continuum that guides Latin American nations in this direction (see Figure 1).
In Latin America, biological wealth and cultural heritage are inherently intertwined, as highlighted by Tinoco (2015). It is imperative to legally safeguard both these assets to prevent incidents like those involving ayahuasca and the arrowhead frog from recurring.
Latin America harbors a significant portion of the Earth's biodiversity, a fact intricately tied to the presence of uncharted territories and isolated indigenous communities. These communities, untouched by modern society, uphold traditional values of reverence for nature and a harmonious relationship with the environment. As a result, the region's rich biodiversity is deeply intertwined with diverse cultural practices.
The utilitarian ethos prevalent in Western culture has led to the transformation of various life forms into bio-resources for scientific and industrial purposes, exemplified by instances such as ayahuasca, the poison dart frog, and peyote. This appropriation is not solely driven by economic motives but extends into the realm of epistemology, delineating a divide between scientific knowledge derived from laboratory research and what is often referred to as traditional knowledge.
Latin American countries face a competitive disadvantage in the current scenario, highlighting the need for them to leverage their biodiversity to drive economic development. Several examples demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, emphasizing the importance of aligning the efforts of educational, scientific, and productive institutions with government policies that prioritize ecological preservation, support indigenous communities, and ensure legal protection of this valuable heritage.
