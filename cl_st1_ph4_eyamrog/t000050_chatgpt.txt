To enhance the understanding of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) epidemiology among indigenous populations residing in sylvatic regions, we conducted a study on the sand fly fauna collected from disease transmission areas in the Brazilian Amazon. The datasets presented in this research consist of occurrence data for sand flies obtained from the Suruwaha Indigenous Land in Amazonas (2012-2013) and the Wajãpi Indigenous Land in Amapá (2013-2014). Sand flies were captured using unbaited CDC-like light traps at various locations within each study area and subsequently identified to the species level by taxonomists specializing in Amazonian fauna. A total of 4,646 records were documented, with 1,428 from the Suruwaha and 3,218 from the Wajãpi. These findings are anticipated to enhance our comprehension of ACL transmission dynamics and the distribution of insect vectors within these regions.
Leishmaniases are diseases caused by various species of the protozoan parasite genus Leishmania, transmitted between humans and wild or domestic vertebrate animals through the bites of blood-feeding female sand flies. American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is endemic in Brazil, yet its impact on indigenous populations, particularly those residing in remote areas with limited contact with non-indigenous individuals, remains poorly understood. To investigate the sand fly fauna during ACL outbreaks among the Suruwaha and Wajãpi indigenous groups from 2012 to 2014, fieldwork was conducted to collect and identify potential vectors. Insect identification was performed by experienced taxonomists using keys available in relevant literature.
Our datasets consist of sand fly occurrence data from two distinct regions: (i) the Suruwaha Indigenous Land (SIL) in the southern part of the state of Amazonas, gathered between 2012 and 2013; and (ii) the Wajãpi Indigenous Land (WIL) in the state of Amapá, collected between 2013 and 2014. These datasets serve as the metadata for each sand fly specimen individually collected during the fieldwork, encompassing 41 Darwin Core Standard (DwC) terms for the Suruwaha dataset and 39 for the Wajãpi dataset. All mandatory fields have been meticulously included and subjected to screening in the FIOCRUZ IPT, with metadata fields readily accessible on the online platforms.
The dataset comprises fields detailing taxonomy (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, specificEpithet, verbatimIdentification, infraspecificEpithet, scientificName, scientificNameAuthorship, taxonRank), collection specifics such as collectors (recordedBy: Shimabukuro PHF; Stumpp RGAV; Medeiros MES.; Alves DRC; Moreno ES; Freire M P; Nascimento LOC), collection date, trapping method, trap identification number, and collection site description (verbatimEventDate, eventTime, habitat, samplingProtocol), geolocation data (stateProvince, county, locality, locationRemarks, verbatimLatitude, verbatimLongitude, decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, geodeticDatum), and catalogue reference data (otherCatalogNumbers). This data is accessible through the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr), an online platform that consolidates biodiversity and ecosystem information, serving as the Brazilian Node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a globally recognized repository for biological occurrence data [4]. Our dataset has been submitted to this platform and is publicly available for use by others (fiocruz_suruwaha_01: https://doi.org/10.15468/28xvr7 and fiocruz_wajapi_01: https://doi.org/10.15468/gt29ub).
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) poses a significant public health concern in Brazil, as evidenced by the staggering number of 203,406 cases reported from 2010 to 2020. The North Region, encompassing the Amazon biome, stands out as a hotspot for the disease, contributing to 42% of all cases documented nationwide [6].
Health and disease conditions among indigenous populations in Brazil remain inadequately understood. A significant void exists within government databases concerning morbidity, mortality, disease notification, and other crucial health metrics, hindering the development of fundamental socio-demographic and health indicators. Nonetheless, the limited research available on the public health of indigenous communities in Brazil reveals a distressing reality characterized by marginalization and vulnerability. These factors manifest in a diminished quality of life, challenges in accessing essential services, and subpar health outcomes [7].
Furthermore, the varied transmission patterns of ACL pose significant challenges in terms of disease control and comprehension, particularly within the Brazilian Amazon. This region boasts the highest diversity of Leishmania parasite species, their insect vectors, and vertebrate hosts in the Neotropical area [1].
Our two datasets consist of sand fly occurrence data collected by the authors during the ACL outbreaks in the SIL and WIL regions.
The transmission of ACL south of the Amazon River system remains poorly understood. While it has been commonly believed that human Leishmania infection is rare or non-existent south of the Negro and Amazon Rivers, recent studies have shown that the incidence of leishmaniasis in humans in these areas is comparable to that seen north of these rivers. Guerra et al. (2011) conducted a study on the epidemiology of mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) south of the Amazon River, revealing a high prevalence of this form of the disease and a distribution of Leishmania species similar to what is found north of the Amazon River. However, the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has yet to be identified in this region, and the sources of sylvatic infection and the vectors involved in transmission remain unknown south of the Amazon River system.
The Suruwaha consist of a population of around 170 individuals [14], with their sole interactions with non-indigenous individuals limited to health workers and members of FUNAI (the Fundação Nacional do Índio; the Brazilian government agency tasked with safeguarding indigenous communities). Residing in an extremely isolated region, far removed from urban centers, the Suruwaha engage primarily in agriculture and hunting, with the crafting of utensils also forming a significant part of their daily activities.
Entomological research conducted within the SIL aimed to enhance the comprehension of the transmission dynamics of ACL, prompted by a surge in ACL cases among the Suruwaha between 2010 and 2012. Our investigation revealed a probable correlation between this rise and the community-wide distribution of flashlights in late 2010, a request made by the Suruwaha themselves. This distribution appears to be the primary factor behind the ACL increase, as it prompted a shift in the Suruwaha's hunting practices from strictly diurnal to nocturnal, aligning with the crepuscular and nocturnal biting patterns of the female sand flies responsible for transmitting ACL.
The Serra da Ibiapaba Landscape (SIL) is a highly remote area, prompting our entomological survey to be conducted by multiple teams in order to capitalize on the routine operations carried out by FUNAI. A total of 1,428 sand fly specimens were meticulously identified either to the genus or species level. The survey yielded findings of ten distinct genera and 33 species, with the genus Trichophoromyia emerging as the most prevalent at 57%, closely followed by Psychodopygus at 20% and Nyssomyia at 5%. Noteworthy among the collected species were T. ubiquitalis at 25%, T. octavioi at 9%, and Ps. davisi at 8%.
The Wajãpi, comprising approximately 1,200 individuals and residing in 80 small villages spread across their territory, sustain themselves through a combination of agriculture, fishing, hunting, and gathering, with a practice of periodically relocating their villages to facilitate ecological rejuvenation in previously occupied areas. Access to these villages is facilitated by roads, rivers, streams, and forest trails. The revival of the traditional Wajãpi model of territorial occupation and dispersal has been crucial in maintaining the community's quality of life while ensuring territorial surveillance, thereby upholding the desired abundance pattern. However, over the past decade, the encroachment of large mining corporations and the construction of hydroelectric facilities in the vicinity of the Wajãpi Indigenous Land (WIL) have posed significant threats to their well-being. These threats manifest in the form of forest degradation, environmental pollution, and the community's exposure to heightened social vulnerabilities, coinciding with an upsurge in crop pests and endemic diseases like malaria and leishmaniasis.
Our dataset comprises sand fly records resulting from a project aimed at evaluating the primary risk factors for the disease through an interdisciplinary approach. In 2012, an outbreak of leishmaniasis occurred in the WIL, affecting over 20 individuals across 7 different villages. This outbreak prompted a comprehensive investigation conducted between 2012 and 2015 to comprehend the causal processes within the local epidemiological context and propose preventive and control measures for the disease among the Wajãpi community. The investigation unfolded as a multi-institutional project in collaboration with health-related institutions, including the Distrito Sanitário Especial Indígena (DSEI) Amapá e Norte do Pará, Secretaria Municipal de Saúde de Pedra Branca do Amapari, Coordenadoria de Vigilância em Saúde do Amapá, Laboratório Central de Saúde Pública do Amapá, Instituto René Rachou (Fiocruz-MG), Universidade Federal do Amapá, Universidade de São Paulo, and Universidade Federal do Oeste do Pará. Various teams with diverse expertise were formed, encompassing entomologists, biologists, veterinarians, laboratory technicians, anthropologists, epidemiologists, nurses, and other professionals.
Researchers initially encountered a challenging environmental and intercultural setting, where the mere escalation of conventional health service measures proved inadequate or even contradictory to the health beliefs and practices of the indigenous community. The remote locations of villages posed obstacles to effectively mapping and documenting potential transmission sites. The extended incubation period of ACL, the intricate mobility patterns within Wajãpi territories, and the deficiencies in health services such as insufficiently trained staff, inadequate funding, and infrastructure constraints, hindered the identification of transmission sources using the Ministry of Health's surveillance guidelines, which primarily focus on individual risk factors. This rendered the pursuit of transmission foci a daunting and unproductive endeavor.
The necessity for a more comprehensive and culturally sensitive assessment of the epidemiological context emerged, highlighting the importance of considering ecological, cultural, and ethnic perspectives. This review not only scrutinized the objectives and methodologies involved in delivering services in indigenous health and conducting epidemiological research but also delved into an epistemological reevaluation of comprehending causality in health and disease, emphasizing its interconnectedness with social and ecological dynamics across various scales and dimensions of perception. Consequently, the collection of data on the occurrence of ACL vectors was deemed crucial for the study.
A total of 3,218 specimens were identified to either genus or species level, with the most abundant genera being Trichophoromyia (20%), Nyssomyia (13%), and Psathyromyia (11%). The most abundant species identified were T. brachipyga (14%), followed by Pa. dreisbachi (9%), and Nyssomyia pajoti (6%).
Specimens were georeferenced using a Garmin® 62s GPS device.
The municipality of Tapauá, situated along the banks of the Purus River, is home to a population of 16,876 residents and covers a total area of 84,946 km2 [11]. The primary economic activities in this region revolve around agriculture, including the cultivation of cassava, jute, and beans, as well as extractivism, which involves the harvesting of nuts, rubber, wood, copaiba oil, and andiroba. Over the past decade, livestock has emerged as the predominant product in Tapauá, reflecting a shift in the area's economic landscape.
Situated in the southern expanse of the Amazon rainforest, the Middle Purus region encompasses numerous conservation units and indigenous territories. Some of these territories have received official recognition from the federal government, while others are presently undergoing the process of formal legal demarcation.
As per the SIASI (Sistema de Informação da Atenção à Saúde Indígena) managed by the Secretaria Especial de Saúde Indígena (SESAI), the indigenous community in the Middle Purus region is approximately 8,117 individuals, belonging to 13 distinct ethnic groups residing across 24 demarcated indigenous territories and an additional 6 non-demarcated areas (unidentified and/or delimited). The combined area of the demarcated indigenous lands totals 189,870.964 hectares.
The Suruwaha Indigenous Land (SIL) is situated in the municipality of Tapauá, spanning a total area of 239,070 hectares and positioned between the Riozinho River and the Coxodoá stream, both serving as tributaries of the Cuniuá River, which in turn flows into the Tapauá River that eventually merges with the Purus River [18]. To the west, SIL is bordered by the Deni Indigenous Land, while to the east, it is adjacent to the Hi-Merimã Indigenous Land, inhabited by isolated indigenous communities. The population of SIL comprises 171 individuals who were previously living in isolation and were first contacted by missionaries in the 1980s [14]. The primary productive activities of the Suruwaha people encompass agriculture, hunting, fishing, gathering, and tool making [19]. Among these activities, hunting holds a significant cultural value, with a skilled hunter not only capturing numerous animals but also demonstrating proficiency in hunting tapirs, a highly prized game due to their size and ability to provide sustenance for many individuals [19].
The Wajãpi Indigenous Land (WIL) spans across the basins of the Jari (west), Amapari (east), and Oiapoque (north) rivers. It was officially recognized by the Brazilian government in 1996, covering an area of 6,070 km2. The region consists of dense tropical forest with rugged terrain, forming part of the Tumucumaque Mountains complex. Presently, the Wajãpi population totals approximately 1,221 individuals, residing in over 80 villages [15].
The Wajãpi are structured into autonomous local groups known as "iwanã-ko," each represented by a local group originating from a specific region with multiple villages. However, not all members of an "iwanã-ko" reside in the same region due to inter-group marriages, leading one spouse to relocate to the other's region, often temporarily. These groups occupy three distinct spatial categories: concentrated areas like rural villages, intermittent dispersal/settlements utilized mainly during the dry season for hunting, fishing, and gathering, and "koo kwerã" sites designated as wildlife reserves left undisturbed for wild animals, allowing for hunting. The interplay of social, political, and ecological elements influencing the Wajãpi's movements within their territory appears to correlate with disease distribution patterns in the TIW. The inclination to concentrate families near the Perimetral Norte highway, which traverses the TIW, appears linked to a heightened incidence of infectious diseases.
Sand flies were captured using unbaited CDC-like light traps that were operational from 5:00 pm to 6:00 am. These traps were strategically positioned in locations frequented by the indigenous population, including swiddens, forested areas, hunting grounds, access trails, and residential dwellings.
The insects were preserved in microtubes filled with 70% alcohol and separated from other specimens gathered in the field or examined under a dissecting microscope in the laboratory. Subsequently, the insects were clarified and mounted on slides for species identification, utilizing Galati's (2003) identification key. A subset of the insect samples will be archived in the Coleção de Flebotomíneos at the Instituto René Rachou/FIOCRUZ-Minas (COLFLEB/FIOCRUZ).
The collection licenses and permits obtained for our studies were as follows: in the SIL, we secured the SISBIO collecting license issued by the Sistema de Autorização e Informação em Biodiversidade (IBAMA) (39337-1) and FUNAI (08620.040969/2013-51); while in the WIL, we obtained the SISBIO collecting license (37935-4), FUNAI (08620.030843/2014-59), Ethics Committee approval (CONEP - CAAE: 20188213.9.0000.5091), and IPHAN access to associated traditional knowledge for scientific research purposes (01450.008806/2014-14).
Insects were identified using keys found in the literature [2,3] by seasoned taxonomists. The dataset adheres to the Darwin Core format, with 41 terms for the Suruwaha dataset and 39 for the Wajãpí dataset. All obligatory fields have been included and meticulously screened in the FIOCRUZ IPT, with metadata fields also accessible on the online pages.
The data presented in this study hold significant value as they delineate the distribution of sand flies gathered from various locations within two indigenous territories situated in the Brazilian Amazon. These findings are pertinent not only to academia, government bodies, civil society, and NGOs but also crucial for harmonizing scientific insights with indigenous wisdom. This integration is essential for enhancing and customizing health surveillance initiatives to suit diverse eco-social settings, with the active involvement of indigenous communities who possess intricate knowledge of their lands.
These data can be utilized to tackle challenges in controlling leishmaniases and to enhance the comprehension of the disease's epidemiology. Given that control strategies in Brazil rely on disease surveillance and monitoring within territorial units, encompassing biological and environmental features, our dataset can significantly enrich the existing knowledge base. Our data offer occurrence records from previously unexplored areas that are typically overlooked by the public health system and ACL control programs of the Brazilian government. They can be instrumental in modeling both vector and disease distribution across space and time, while also offering insights into key areas for prioritizing ACL surveillance and control efforts in these regions.
Our dataset comprises an expert-validated list of sand fly species with updated names, serving as a valuable repository of high-quality data on sand flies found in remote regions of the Brazilian Amazon.
