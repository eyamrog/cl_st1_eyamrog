In this text, our objective is to examine the impacts of the reports on the dematerialization of schools authored by Edgard Faure (1973) and Jacques Delors (1998), a process further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Both reports focus on the intersection of education with Information and Communication Technologies, closely intertwined with audiovisual and internet resources. Our working hypothesis posits that the discourses surrounding the learning society, one emphasizing the adoption of innovative teaching methods and the other highlighting the "demmuring" of childhood, converge in facilitating the dematerialization of schools. The pandemic has created a context where deterritorialization has become temporarily inevitable. Our conclusion underscores that in the contemporary urban landscape, shaped by an educational concept where all artifacts are deemed educational, learning serves as the foundation for spaces and environments that are already "demmured" and dematerialized.
Amidst the array of news circulating on social media, a recent publication on Terra's education portal caught our attention. Titled "With the pandemic, digital literacy becomes a step towards the pedagogy of the future," the article emphasizes the necessity for educators from basic education to university levels to be equipped with the skills to utilize the Internet's interactivity, audiovisual resources, and hybrid teaching models mediated by technology. Authored by journalists Ocimara Balmant and Alex Gomes, the piece advocates for teachers to adapt to a new generation of students deeply immersed in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The authors argue that these technologies have evolved into a significant phenomenon, prompting substantial changes in some teacher training programs to address the evolving needs of contemporary society. These compelling assertions not only captivate readers by heralding a new educational era characterized by enhanced interactivity, Internet usage, and audiovisual resources but also aim to usher in a fresh chapter in the educational landscape (Farias, 2020).
Beyond the circulating news on the internet, the concept that the future entails requirements where ICTs will revolutionize teaching and learning is not solely prevalent in media articles. Upon delving deeper into discursive realms, it becomes apparent that this idea is not novel, having been proposed previously as an alternative to traditional education: an education model of the future rooted in continuous and holistic lifelong learning facilitated by technological tools and various spatial dimensions. Referred to as the learning society (Noguera-Ramírez, 2009), this paradigm has shaped the agendas of global entities like the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), significantly influencing the development and execution of public policies across diverse nation-states.
The argument we will present here posits that discussions surrounding the future of education indicate a shift towards the dematerialization of traditional schooling, a concept that has evolved from the 19th to the 20th century with the global expansion of public education systems, culminating in the societal response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the late 2020s. This discourse highlights the growing integration of education with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), envisioning a future where learning becomes increasingly detached from traditional educational institutions. This shift was initially foreshadowed in international reports by Edgar Faure and Jacques Delors, with tangible effects seen in the enactment of Brazil's National Education Guidelines and Basic Law (LDBEN number 9.394/1996) coinciding with Delors' report publication. Furthermore, alternative discourses have emerged, proposing a departure from the emphasis on technological advancements in education towards a focus on reconnecting with nature to enhance the schooling experience, as suggested by Barros (2018) in the publication "Demmuring childhood: school as a meeting place with nature." This discourse will be further explored below, drawing on the insights provided in the aforementioned publication.
The text is divided into five parts. The first part delves into the concept of the learning society, emphasizing the pivotal role of ICT in students' learning processes, positioning them as increasingly prominent figures in alternative pedagogical approaches. Moving on to the second part, an examination of reports by Faure and Delors reveals a forecast for the flexibilization of learning environments beyond traditional educational institutions. The third part explores the influence of these reports on the Brazilian National Education Guidelines and Basic Law (LDBEN 9.394/1996). Transitioning to the fourth part, a discourse on the dematerialization of the school is presented within a parallel framework, touching upon the fading significance of childhood and the concept of the school in the forest. Lastly, the fifth part features an interview with Noah Webster Sobe, Senior Project Officer of Research and Foresight in UNESCO's Education program, discussing the deterritorialization and reterritorialization of schools, alongside their demurring and dematerialization, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has sparked new dialogues regarding learning environments.
In his work "Cosmopolitanism and the Age of School Reform: Science, Education and Making Society by Making the Child" (2008), Thomas Popkewitz delves into the discourses surrounding education in the early twenty-first century through an examination of educational reform literature from the USA and Europe. A recurring theme in these reform agendas is the concept of the "lifelong learner," which builds upon earlier notions in educational discourse dating back to the early twentieth century. This concept emphasizes the cultivation of individuals who possess the capacity to autonomously plan their lives and tackle challenges through engagement with collaborative communities.
The author notes that these objectives are not novel, having been present in educational reform literature from the previous century. The school is envisioned as a facilitator of a universal form of reasoning, shaping individuals into cosmopolitan citizens with a "homeless mind" rooted in local contexts. It is essential for individuals to internalize universal modes of thinking to effectively navigate their lives within their communities. Recent shifts in educational discourse reflect a response to an uncertain future. The contemporary "unfinished cosmopolitan" is characterized as someone who continues to learn throughout their life. This concept aligns with the idea of a "lifelong learner", complemented by the notion of a "reflexive teacher" who consistently engages in self-reflection to enhance their practice and achieve improved outcomes (Popkewitz, 2008).
Popkewitz notes that within contemporary discourse, the expectations surrounding online learning are articulated by authors spanning diverse political orientations. He references Maeroff (2003), the author of "A Classroom of One: How Online Learning is Changing Our Schools and Colleges," who views online learning as a transformative educational opportunity that transcends boundaries, facilitating the eradication of provincialism while realizing the vision of personalized instruction. Additionally, Hargreaves (2003) is cited as a proponent of an alternative political perspective, positing that a learning society fosters the development of a cosmopolitan identity in children, promoting tolerance towards racial and gender differences, a curiosity about other cultures, and a commitment to the inclusion of marginalized groups.
In contemporary discussions surrounding educational reforms, the concept of "lifelong learners" is emphasized, highlighting the importance of individuals being autonomous and actively engaged in their own development within learning communities to better equip themselves for an uncertain future (Popkewitz, 2008). Various discourses from different countries provide examples that support this notion.
According to Jorge Werthein (2000), the former UNESCO representative in Brazil and coordinator of the UNESCO – Mercosul program, information societies have supplanted industrial societies, with information now considered the primary economic asset following market restructuring in the 1980s. Werthein emphasizes that significant transformations in education stem from the adoption of self-learning technologies.
Clara Coutinho and Eliana Lisbôa (2011) from the University of Minho, in their work titled "Society of Information, of Knowledge and of Learning: challenges for education in the twenty-first century" (Sociedade da Informação, do conhecimento e da aprendizagem: desafios para educação no século XXI), emphasize the deterritorialization of time and space barriers in communication among individuals within this evolving social paradigm. They highlight the emergence of learning opportunities that extend beyond the confines of traditional physical school environments.
In the twenty-first century, the primary goal of educational systems is to establish the importance of knowledge building in a society inundated with vast and abundant information. The role of the teacher is no longer confined to being a mere conveyor of knowledge but has evolved into that of a learning mediator. This learning process extends beyond traditional schooling institutions and transcends the physical boundaries of schools, reaching into diverse informal contexts through connections in global networks (Coutinho & Lisbôa, 2011, p. 10).
One notable new possibility is the concept that learning can occur in environments previously not deemed suitable for educational purposes (Coutinho & Lisbôa, 2011). According to Colombian researcher Ernesto Noguera-Ramírez (2009, p. 13), the transition to a knowledge society places the 'educated person' at the core of knowledge. Knowledge is no longer confined to educational institutions but is now the shared responsibility of all individuals. In a learning society, a variety of spaces, including virtual environments, can serve as learning settings, provided individuals possess the ability to self-regulate; in such societies, individuals are tasked with continuously learning throughout their lifetimes.
In examining the emergence of significant themes, it is imperative to consider two pivotal discursive events: the reports authored by Edgard Faure in 1973 and Jacques Delors in 1998 for UNESCO. Subsequently, we will elucidate the integration of their foundational principles within the Brazilian National Education Guidelines and Basic Law of 1996.
The report titled "Learn to be: the education of the future" by the International Commission for the Development of Education for UNESCO, spearheaded by former French minister Edgar Faure in 1973, offered a comprehensive overview of global education at the time and its imperative role in the context of advancing scientific and technological landscapes. Collaboratively authored, the report introduced key concepts like "learn to be," "educational city," and "continuous and permanent education," which would resurface in a subsequent UNESCO report in 1996. This later report, titled "Learning: the treasure within," was orchestrated by another French figure, Jacques Delors, nearly three decades after Faure's seminal work, underscoring the enduring relevance of these foundational ideas in the realm of education.
In Edgard Faure's (1973) report, the epilogue to the second part, titled "In the Manner of a Presage - An Educational City," presents education as an advent, utilizing the term presage. Through this term, the authors lead us through four distinct meanings surrounding the concept of education and what is deemed "educational." Education is portrayed as something external to us, beyond comprehension; as something that is yet to materialize, hence not currently achievable; and ultimately, as an imminent transformation that will enhance current educational practices into a more advanced future. This perpetual anticipation of education, coupled with a transcendental spatiality and ambiance in schooling, mirrors contemporary discussions on educational cities and their spaces envisioned beyond traditional school settings - these too are yet to be realized. Therefore, the education of the future is poised to emerge from the present, offering a potentially improved future for humanity once it comes to fruition.
The report by Faure and collaborators (1973) revolves around the ideas of "educational cities" and "lifelong education". The concept of educational cities envisions societies where educational issues are central to all social institutions, making learning and teaching integral to city life. On the other hand, lifelong education emphasizes learning beyond traditional school cycles, acknowledging that individuals are constantly evolving and never fully developed. It highlights the idea of continuous personal growth and development as an ongoing process rather than a finite achievement.
Twenty-five years after the seminal report led by Edgar Faure, Jacques Delors, a prominent Socialist Party figure and former president of the European Commission (1985-1995), collaborated with other authors on the publication of "Learning: the treasure within" for UNESCO. This report offered a comprehensive analysis of global education, anticipating the challenges of the upcoming century. Similar to its predecessor, the report proposed innovative policies and strategies for the future of education, highlighting the pivotal role of learners and educators in the teaching and learning process.
In the subsequent section of this paper, the foundational principles for education are delineated, conceptualized as the "four pillars of education," drawing upon insights from Faure and colleagues (1973), particularly in light of educational imperatives in the context of globalization and the emergence of novel information and communication technologies. These four pillars are articulated around the concepts of "learning to know," "learning to do," "learning to live together," and "learning to be." The first pillar pertains to acquiring the essential "tools for comprehension" (Delors et al., 1998, p. 90); the second emphasizes the ability to "effectively engage with the world" (Delors et al., 1998, p. 90); the third underscores the capacity to "collaborate and participate with others in various human endeavors" (Delors et al., 1998, p. 90); and the fourth pillar serves as an integrative framework encompassing the preceding three.
Both Faure (1973) and Delors (1998) emphasize the necessity of shifting education away from traditional school settings towards a continuous, ubiquitous learning experience. They advocate for a paradigm where learning is not confined to specific times and places within the school system but rather integrated into everyday life. This shift challenges the notion of learning as a singular, isolated event within the confines of an educational institution, proposing instead that it should be ingrained in the very fabric of individuals' contemporary existence. The concept of redefining time and space in education is pivotal, enabling individuals to navigate their own paths in a rapidly changing world characterized by globalization, reshaping the way people interact with time and space (Delors et al., 1998, p. 104).
We now turn our focus to the National Education Guidelines and Basic Law (LDBEN) no 9.394 of 1996, not merely as a regulatory document for Brazilian education, but as a discursive event that aligns with the findings of Edgar Faure (1973) and Jacques Delors (1998). It is crucial to emphasize the LDBEN's scope, as articulated in Title 1, "Of Education," Article 1, which states: "Education encompasses the formative processes that are developed in familial life, in human coexistence, at work, in educational and research institutions, in social movements, civil society organizations, and cultural expressions" (Brasil, 1996).
The formation of individuals does not solely occur within the confines of a specific institution like a school; rather, it unfolds across various spheres intertwined with human existence, including the family and broader civil society contexts. The LDBEN's framework aligns with the perspectives put forth by Faure (1973) and Delors (1998), emphasizing the decentralization of learning from the traditional school setting to encompass all facets of life. As articulated by Faure et al. (1973), the shift entails a departure from a centralized, hierarchically structured educational system towards a model where diverse entities such as groups, associations, trade unions, local collectivities, and intermediary bodies collectively shoulder educational responsibilities within society.
In Article 1, Item II emphasizes the importance of connecting school education with the world of labor and social practice, aligning with the broader concept of education across all facets of life, particularly with social objectives directed towards the labor sphere. Article 32 of the LDBEN further elaborates on the aims of basic education, specifically in Section III focusing on items I, III, and IV. Item I underscores the significance of basic education in fostering an understanding of natural and social environments, the political system, technology, arts, and societal values, highlighting the necessity for educational efforts to be directed towards comprehending the world, society, and technological advancements. Item III emphasizes the development of learning capabilities to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and skills, as well as the cultivation of attitudes and values essential for personal growth and societal contribution.
The items in question typically allude to the concepts outlined in the reports by Faure (1973) and Delors (1998) concerning an educational approach aimed at fostering the development of learning capacities and competencies within the social context. Likewise, item IV, centered on primary education, underscores the importance of enhancing familial connections, fostering human solidarity, and promoting reciprocal tolerance (Brasil, 1996), echoing the principles of coexistence delineated in the Delors report (1998).
In Section IV of article 32, a notable aspect pertains to secondary schooling, specifically item II. This item emphasizes education as the fundamental groundwork for both employment and civic engagement, enabling individuals to perpetually acquire knowledge, adjust with agility to evolving occupational landscapes, and pursue further advancements (Brasil, 1996). This concept aligns with the assessment put forth by Jacques Delors (1998), as encapsulated in the subsequent quotation:
The concept of whole life education is increasingly emphasized due to the benefits it offers in terms of flexibility, diversity, and accessibility across time and space. The notion of lifelong learning needs to be reexamined and broadened, as it involves not only adapting to changes in professional life but also entails a continuous development of an individual's knowledge, skills, discernment, and ability to take action. This approach should foster self-awareness and an understanding of one's environment, as well as encourage individuals to fulfill their social roles as both workers and citizens (Delors et al., 1998, p. 18).
Hence, the concepts of "lifelong learning," "flexibility," and "accessibility in time and space" serve as foundational principles derived from UNESCO's report, influencing the development of the LDBEN. Delors' report, titled Learning: the treasure within (1998, p. 110), emphasizes the necessity of envisioning innovative ideas regarding work schedules that consider both the individual preferences of workers and the flexibility requirements of enterprises in the future.
In a volatile world where the future is no longer perceived as a predictable outcome of linear and continuous evolution but rather as unpredictable, and where the relevant contents and competencies upon completion of basic education are uncertain, there is a need to cultivate in children the disposition to acquire the necessary aptitudes. The adequacy of schools as institutions for fostering the development of future citizens is no longer assured in their current configuration.
In contemporary discourses disseminated internationally, there is a movement to rectify the errors of Western civilization by advocating for a return to nature as the foundation of children's education. Rather than viewing schools as institutions focused solely on transmitting bookish knowledge and enforcing societal norms, proponents of this movement advocate for schools to be seen as spaces for connecting with nature. This concept is encapsulated in the subtitle of the Brazilian publication "Demmuring Childhood," which saw its second edition in 2018. The publication presents an educational framework centered on the core principle of allowing children the freedom to play in natural environments and shares experiences from schools in Brazil and abroad, both public and private, that have embraced the idea of "demmuring" childhood. This initiative is a collaboration between Instituto Alana and the Child and Nature (Criança e Natureza) project, in partnership with civil society organizations dedicated to education and childhood.
The title of the book appears to draw inspiration from Foucault's work Discipline and Punish (2014), as evidenced by a solitary reference in the text: "some theorists, such as Michael Foucault, have drawn parallels between educational environments and correctional facilities, as well as between asylums and medical institutions, where systems and operations are characterized by mechanisms of regulation and retribution" (Barros, 2018, p. 29).
The text emphasizes the educational value inherent in nature and "natural" spaces. It portrays a child's education as stemming from the freedom to play within such environments. Demmuring Childhood's educational approach does not involve explicit teaching by educators; rather, it highlights how nature itself serves as the teacher, allowing children to educate themselves through peer interaction in natural settings. The publication discusses the Chilean initiative by Fundação Pátio Vivo, where a team comprising architects, landscape designers, and educators views space as a "third teacher" that inspires children's actions and facilitates their learning and development (Barros, 2018, p. 96).
In the context of children learning freely through interaction with their environment and peers, educators take on the role of observers, monitoring the children as they engage in spontaneous play. The pedagogical approach outlined in Demmuring Childhood advocates for the protection of both nature and childhood, aiming to safeguard the "natural child" from the pedagogical pressures imposed by adults. These adults are often entrenched in the "cognitive development paradigm," which confines learning to stationary activities and prioritizes the classroom as the focal point of educational endeavors.
The educational proposal aims to establish credibility through scientifically supported claims, as evidenced by statements such as: "a consistent set of scientific ideas, primarily originating outside Brazil, indicates that one factor is the separation of children from nature" (p.19); "Some studies suggest that children have limited exposure to nature in these environments" (p. 20); "we argue that science supports the advantages of nature contact in the school setting" (p. 80). Additionally, this proposal establishes criteria for distinguishing between typical and atypical child behavior, introducing its own term for identified issues. These encompass the concept of "nature deficit disorder," prevalent in urban settings, manifesting in symptoms like "obesity, hyperactivity, attention deficits, emotional instability, poor motor skills - lack of coordination, agility, and physical prowess - and myopia are among the prominent health issues stemming from this context" (Barros, 2018, p. 16).
In "Schools of the Forest: The Open-Air Model of Children's Education in Europe and in Spain," Ananda Casanova (2019) reconstructs the historical development of this pedagogical approach. Originating in the 1950s in Northern Europe, it has rapidly spread over the past three decades to Spain and various other regions worldwide, including the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, India, Israel, and Latin American countries like Brazil. These alternative educational models, as highlighted by the author, have emerged from individual or collective initiatives and have gained recognition and governmental backing in nations such as Germany, the United Kingdom, and Denmark. While the emphasis on children's engagement with nature is not a recent concept, with roots in the cultural appreciation for outdoor living in Nordic societies, its current global expansion is linked to contemporary challenges. Casanova effectively summarizes the driving forces behind this resurgence in the conclusion of the article.
In light of the challenges posed by modern lifestyles, characterized by imminent threats to biological and cultural diversity, urbanization, and the confinement of childhood, educators are called upon to reassess their role in relation to the world we inhabit and the future generations who will inherit it. The Schools in the Forest movement emerges as a potential response to these pressing issues (Casanova, 2019, p. 66-67).
In the discussion at hand, it is crucial to note that despite originating from differing assessments of modern life and future prospects, both discourses on the learning society and the redefinition of childhood intersect in their critique of the notion that schools, as institutions and physical structures, are the optimal environments for educating the upcoming generations.
A recent interview was conducted in Paris with Noah Webster Sobe, the Senior Project Official in Research and Foresight in Education at UNESCO and a collaborator in the project Futures of Education: Learning to Become. This interview, which echoes Faure's 1972 report "Learning to be" and Delors' 1996 report "Learning, the treasure within" (Vidal & Bontempi Jr, 2020, p. 4), sheds light on UNESCO's additional initiative. It is crucial to closely examine this initiative led by Sobe, who, while acknowledging the significance of the physical school environment in facilitating the interaction between students and teachers in the learning process, also reflects on the idea that:
It is imperative to recognize that the modes of connectivity should be viewed as integral components of an extended right to education. This entails not just having access to the Internet for interactions with teachers and participation in online classes but also ensuring digital connectivity, which is considered indispensable for ongoing learning and is fundamental to exercising the right to information.
Digital exclusion is not simply the absence of access to computers or cellphones; rather, it encompasses the inability to engage in critical thinking, creativity, and the development of innovative and equitable methods for producing and distributing both symbolic and material resources. As highlighted by Schwartz (2000, cited in Fantin & Girardello, 2009, p. 71), digital exclusion goes beyond mere technological access and touches upon the fundamental capacities necessary for active participation in contemporary society.
Sobe acknowledges a significant shift in the traditional school institution due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that the education system we were familiar with has undergone a fundamental transformation. He highlights the emergence of a new educational paradigm for the future. Despite mentioning UNESCO's establishment of the Future of Education International Commission, he argues that the much-debated "future of education" is no longer a distant prospect but a reality of the past. Quoting Vidal & Bontempi Jr (2020), he emphasizes the rapid and unexpected changes that have altered the envisioned futures within a short span of time. This prompts a critical reflection on the implications of these transformations.
The emergence of a new form of education is no longer a distant prospect but a reality of the present day. Digital connectivity, as highlighted by Sobe, is now considered a fundamental aspect of the right to information, serving as a crucial component in the intricate machinery that defines our contemporary way of life. In a time where many social groups find themselves increasingly isolated, the act of teaching and learning has evolved into a dual challenge within educational practices and institutions. Consequently, there are two simultaneous movements occurring within educational establishments. Firstly, there has been a significant investment in the deterritorialization of education, a concept that can also be interpreted as the phenomenon of "demurring childhoods" as described by specialists like Lea Tiriba.
Investing in breaking down the barriers and expanding into spaces beyond the confines of the school is crucial. It is not just classrooms that offer opportunities for learning; rather, all environments can serve as conducive settings for education. This includes areas such as yards, gardens, fields, animal farms, springs, beaches, dunes, and open fields. Everything in the vicinity, from the neighborhood to the city, with its geographic formations, historical landmarks, and picturesque sites like mountains and seas, can be utilized for educational purposes. These spaces not only provide opportunities for free play and relaxation but also serve as environments for storytelling, drawing, painting, and the development of various forms of knowledge. (Barros, 2018, p. 23. Bold added)
Contemporary discourses argue for the revalorization of children's contact with nature and acknowledge the revolutionary impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) on information access. These discourses suggest that schools should not necessarily occupy a central role in the education of new generations, with some even questioning the indispensability of traditional schooling.
In parallel with the deterritorialization and dematerialization of traditional schooling, there has been a noticeable shift towards its reterritorialization within digitally mediated spaces and environments. Residential settings have evolved into multifunctional learning environments, effectively replacing the physical confines of traditional schools. This reterritorialization process has seen the school institution's spatial presence being transposed into the domestic sphere and beyond, aligning with the concept of the educating city. Screens and digital interfaces, particularly through virtual classrooms, now serve as the primary conduits connecting individuals to diverse learning environments, whether local or global. However, the realization of this interconnected digital landscape is contingent upon the infrastructure supporting it, such as fiber optic cables, which are essential for ensuring universal access to this digitally networked world that we inhabit today.
In our conclusion, we emphasize four key aspects.
The first aspect to consider is the dialogue between the reports authored by Edgar Faure (1973), Jacques Delors (1998), and the LDBEN 9.394/1996. Despite the regulatory nature of the law and the recommendatory nature of the two reports, it is evident that these three documents collectively shape a perspective on a learner engaged in continuous learning beyond the confines of traditional educational institutions. These documents articulate notions that characterize the learning society as conceptualized by Noguera-Ramírez (2009), portraying individuals as subjects governed by a lifelong learning experience.
The second aspect, as introduced in the text's Introduction through the Terra platform's education portal, pertains to the ongoing necessity for teachers to adjust to the connectivity of the Internet. This is portrayed as a significant development in the realm of education, almost as if it were a groundbreaking innovation or a forthcoming evolution in educational practices. However, upon analysis, despite the widespread adoption of technological and communication tools such as videos, short films, television, and various other media interfaces, the discourses linking these statements exhibit a consistent pattern and are firmly rooted in established discursive frameworks. While these contemporary approaches may initially seem fresh and inventive, they merely skim the surface, resembling the superficial manifestations of enduring subjective influences that have persisted since the late twentieth century (Noguera-Ramírez, 2009).
The third aspect concerns the impact of the learning society's emergence as discussed in the reports by Edgar Faure and Jacques Delors, in LDBEN 9.394/1996, and in the interview with Noah Webster Sobre, highlighting profound changes in the modern social fabric within the educational realm. Notably, the proliferation of educational spaces has emerged as a contrast to traditional school environments. This shift is closely linked to the deterritorialization/demmuring of school spaces, suggesting that learning can and should occur in diverse settings such as open areas, gardens, parks, forests, and public squares. Furthermore, the most significant transformation involves the intersection of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) with education, a shift further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has led to the rise of remote or online teaching, replacing physical classrooms with virtual ones, even though terms like Google Classroom persist. This shift may signify a definitive departure from conventional notions of learning and teaching environments. It is not suggested that educational institutions will be entirely supplanted by online platforms, nor is there an outright endorsement of online teaching. Rather, it is a contemplation on how the pandemic has hastened a profound rupture in contemporary society, namely the deschooling of society alongside the demmuring and dematerialization of the long-standing educational institution.
The fourth and final aspect pertains to the potential gains and losses associated with abandoning the traditional school model as we knew it before the COVID-19 pandemic. While the concept of a "learning society" holds the promise of personalized learning, where students can engage with new technologies to learn at their own pace, time, and location, tailored to their individual preferences and needs for adapting to a rapidly changing world, there are also drawbacks. A school without a physical location risks losing the essential element of consistent interaction between students and their teachers, who have historically been responsible for their education on a daily basis. This communal living arrangement, facilitated by a specific physical space and time, enabled the development of shared routines, the interpretation of experiences, the understanding of others and the world, and the formation of personal identity.
