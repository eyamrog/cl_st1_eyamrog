The infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) relies on the processing of viral polyproteins, facilitated by the main proteinase (Mpro). The elucidation of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure has enabled the exploration of potential inhibitors. This study seeks to present initial evidence regarding the feasibility of utilizing commercially approved drugs for the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Through an in silico approach, we screened 4,334 compounds to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our findings suggest the potential efficacy of coagulation modifiers in the treatment of COVID-19, attributed to the structural resemblance between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and human coagulation factors such as thrombin and Factor Xa. Further validation through in vitro and in vivo analyses is imperative to substantiate these initial results.
Humanity is currently grappling with the complexities of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection transcends borders and spreads globally. Prior to this outbreak, four human-infecting species of coronavirus (HcoV-229E, HcoV-OC43, HcoV-NL63, and HcoV-HKU1) were recognized as causative agents of colds and pneumonia, with this viral family also being responsible for the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) epidemics. However, the repercussions of the species originating from Wuhan, China have proven to be significantly more devastating.
SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on viral polyprotein processing, a process facilitated by the main proteinase (Mpro), also known as 3CLpro. Given that Mpro is distinct to the virus and absent in host cells, it stands out as a prime target for the development of antivirals against coronavirus infections. The recent elucidation of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro three-dimensional structure has paved the way for exploring potential inhibitors of viral replication. Mpro comprises three domains - I (chymotrypsin), II (picornavirus 3C protease-like), and III (globular cluster involved in protein dimerization). Crystallography structures have pinpointed the region between domains I and II as crucial for inhibiting protein activity, housing the catalytic cysteine 145.
The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was initially reported by Zhang et al. (2). To identify potential antiviral drugs, we curated a selection of existing compounds, including 64 antivirals and 80 protease inhibitors sourced from the DrugBank Database (3). For a comprehensive screening process, a total of 4190 compounds were randomly chosen from the DrugBank database. Subsequently, the crystal protein structure (PDB 6Y2E) underwent energy minimization using the MMTK package within Chimera version 1.14 (4). In silico molecular docking of the ligand candidates was carried out utilizing the PyRx-virtual screening tool, which incorporates AutoDock (5) and AutoDockVina (6) for accurate simulations.
The PyRx virtual screening tool was utilized for docking, following a specific protocol. Initially, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein structure (PDB 6Y2E) underwent a thorough check for missing atoms, bonds, and contacts, along with the removal of water molecules. Energy minimization was carried out using the molecular modeling toolkit (MMTK) package on Chimera version 1.14, employing parameters such as force field: Amber ff14SB, steepest descent steps: 100, steepest descent step size: 0.02 Å, conjugate gradient steps: 10, and conjugate gradient step size: 0.02 Å. This optimized structure served as the receptor for subsequent docking analysis. The minimized structure was then saved as a pdb file and imported into the PyRx software, along with ligands in pdb format. Autodock Tools module was employed to generate pdbqt input files, and the Autodock Vina algorithm was utilized for docking with the selected ligands. In Autodock Vina, the grid box was configured to cover the active site of Mpro, with specific dimensions in Å: centre (x, y, z) = (-16.46, -26.70, 1.58), dimensions (x, y, z) = (23.34, 19.09, 10.98). The docking simulation was executed at an exhaustiveness of eight, and the results were assessed based on the lowest Binding Affinity score (kcal/mol) predicted by the built-in scoring function of the Autodock Vina module.
The analysis revealed 1,321 molecules with scores exceeding 6.5 as Mpro partners, as detailed in the supplementary data table. Given the pressing need for therapeutic solutions for patients, our focus was directed towards the examination of commercially approved drugs. These included Argatroban for blood clotting, Linagliptin for diabetes, Saquinavir as an antiviral, Edoxaban for blood clotting, Apixaban for blood clotting, Cilazapril as an ACE inhibitor, Betrixaban for blood clotting, Alogliptin and Sitagliptin as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, Ramipril as an ACE inhibitor, Lopinavir as an antiviral, Saxagliptin for diabetes, Indinavir as an antiviral, Zofenopril as an ACE inhibitor, Nelfinavir as an antiviral, Quinapril as an ACE inhibitor, and Dihydroergotamine as antimigraine agents.
Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, and Astemizole, an antihistamine, exhibited the highest scores as depicted in Figure 1. The list comprises anticipated antiviral agents along with medications categorized as coagulation modifiers (4) and ACE inhibitors (4).
Lin et al. (7) propose a pathogenic mechanism for the disease based on clinical evidence and studies of other coronavirus strains, delineating the clinical phase into the viraemia phase, acute phase, and recovery. The specific effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system remain ambiguous, with reports of acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, hypotension, tachycardia, and a high prevalence of concomitant cardiovascular disease in infected individuals, particularly those requiring intensive care (8). Additionally, many patients exhibit signs of coagulopathy, often linked to mortality (9). Among coagulation modifiers, Argatroban serves as a direct thrombin inhibitor for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, while Edoxaban, Apixaban, and Betrixaban bind to factor Xa (10, 11). Edoxaban is utilized for stroke and systemic embolism prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, Apixaban for controlling the recurrence of thromboembolic events like stroke in non-valve atrial fibrillation patients, and Betrixaban inhibits free and prothrombinase-bound factor Xa in a concentration-dependent manner, demonstrating greater potency in inhibiting the thrombin-antithrombin complex (13, 14, 15).
The superposition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with factor Xa and thrombin structures reveals rmsd values of 2.57Ᾰ and 2.49Ᾰ, respectively, indicating a significant fold similarity (Fig. 2A-B). Thrombin, a known target of Argabotran, functions as a serine protease(16), while Mpro itself acts as a protease with Leu-Gln↓(Ser,Ala,Gly) as a recognition sequence.(2) This similarity suggests a potential direct perturbation in pro-clotting coagulation by COVID-19 through the Mpro protein. Notably, alterations in pro-clotting factors in COVID-19 patients have been observed, including significantly decreased antithrombin (AT) levels and increased D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB).(17) Furthermore, the progression of disease severity appears to be correlated with rising levels of D-dimer and FDP, potentially indicating the activation of a coagulation system linked to thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (18). Some patients have shown improved prognosis with heparin, an anticoagulant therapy (9), while the risk of developing DIC due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which significantly impacts prognosis, has been previously suggested (19,20) and excessive fibrinolysis activation during cardiopulmonary bypass may also lead to DIC and hemorrhage (22).
The feasibility and robustness of our interactions are enhanced by comparing the docking results of thrombin interaction with Argatroban to the corresponding crystallographic structure deposited under the code 4HFP. Both structures exhibit an rmsd of 0.49Ᾰ, indicating a high degree of similarity between the docking and experimental structures (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the comparison of docking results for factor Xa interaction with Apixaban to the crystallographic structure deposited under the code 2P16 reveals an rmsd of 0.11Ᾰ, further supporting the reliability of our approach (Fig. 2D). Notably, the interaction score for thrombin with Argatroban is 9.6 kcal/mol compared to 8.3 kcal/mol with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, suggesting a stronger affinity of Argatroban to Thrombin. Conversely, Apixaban's interaction with Factor Xa yields a score of 5.1 kcal/mol in contrast to 7.0 kcal/mol with SARS-Cov-2, indicating a higher affinity of Apixaban to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. These findings provide preliminary evidence that Argatroban exhibits greater affinity to Thrombin, while Apixaban shows a tendency towards higher affinity to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
Fold similarity investigations were conducted for ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) with Mpro. The high rmsd values (6.03 Å and 5.57 Å for the ACE receptors structures deposited under the codes 2X92 and 2EWB, respectively) indicate low structural conservation among these proteins. Additionally, the use of ACE inhibitors contributes to the up-regulation of ACE2 expression (23,24). While ACE2 is considered a potential target for the treatment of coronavirus infection, some groups suggest that the use of these inhibitors could result in higher viral loads due to the increased ACE2 expression (25). This potential drawback raises concerns about the use of ACEIs as a treatment for COVID-19.
In conclusion, we demonstrate the potential applicability of certain coagulation compounds, for the first time to our knowledge, in the treatment of COVID-19 infection. We emphasize the structural similarity between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and coagulation factors such as thrombin and Factor Xa. The implications of this resemblance warrant immediate investigation through in vitro methodologies.
