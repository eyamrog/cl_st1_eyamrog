The COVID-19 pandemic, triggered by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has swiftly disseminated globally from Wuhan, China. Since its onset, it has impacted over 2,700,000 individuals and led to nearly 185,000 fatalities across 185 countries, exacerbating challenges in global healthcare systems. As of April 23, 2020, Brazil had reported close to 47,000 confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths.
COVID-19 exacerbates the existing disparities and uncertainties within the realm of science, a phenomenon that extends to its impact on cardiac health. In contrast to previous epidemics instigated by respiratory viruses, COVID-19 poses a unique threat to the heart. This threat is underscored by the fact that a significant proportion of confirmed cases and fatalities involve individuals with pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, and coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the disease is linked to a heightened incidence of cardiac complications, including myocardial injury, cardiogenic shock, Takotsubo syndrome, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, and arrhythmia. Beyond the typical inflammatory responses, endothelial activation, oxidation of low-density lipoproteins, platelet activation, and tissue factor expression triggered by respiratory virus outbreaks like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS, the prognosis for COVID-19 is further complicated by the potentially harmful interactions of treatment medications (chloroquine/azithromycin) that can precipitate malignant arrhythmias in patients with underlying heart conditions.
The challenges posed by COVID-19 are substantial as they affect a wide range of individuals, including patients, healthcare personnel, health systems, and the general population. Consequently, the significance of ensuring the safety of healthcare workers has been underscored like never before.
Working in a hospital during a pandemic of a highly contagious disease, such as COVID-19, serves as a stark reminder for healthcare workers about the critical importance of strictly adhering to all safety protocols within a cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL). This heightened vigilance is essential due to the dual challenges posed by the cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 and the ongoing necessity for interventional procedures among patients with cardiovascular conditions like acute myocardial infarction and advanced structural diseases.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of safety measures for healthcare professionals and patients is heightened. Various safety issues, such as ionizing radiation, equipment concerns, and exposure to chemical and biological agents, can impact both patients and healthcare personnel. It is imperative that all healthcare professionals adhere to local and national guidelines for infection control and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), which should be readily available for all staff members. Furthermore, strict compliance with safety protocols for catheterization procedures is essential, with a focus on prioritizing urgent cases while postponing routine cases if it does not compromise prognosis or the quality of life for patients.
The Brazilian Society of Interventional Cardiology (SBHCI) has issued a position statement outlining various measures to combat COVID-19. These include advocating for the limitation of social exposure, the adoption of stricter personal hygiene practices, home confinement for individuals with mild cases, hospital isolation for severe cases, quarantine for close contacts of suspected cases, prioritizing healthcare resources for urgent cases, and ensuring the protection of healthcare professionals. Specifically concerning cardiac catheterization laboratories (CCL), the SBHCI recommends postponing elective procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, restricting CCL procedures to cardiovascular emergencies, and rescheduling non-emergent cases to the non-infectious stage of the disease. Furthermore, in CCLs with multiple procedure rooms, one room should be designated for treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reassess the general safety protocols, including those related to CCL procedures, and the safety measures for both patients and healthcare personnel. The presence of the infection heightens the necessity for a thorough evaluation of the indications and effectiveness of the procedures being carried out.
A study conducted in China involving 72,314 patients with COVID-19 (comprising 44,672 laboratory-confirmed cases, 16,186 suspected cases, and 10,567 clinically diagnosed cases) identified fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and diarrhea as the most prevalent symptoms. Additionally, other manifestations such as sore throat, chest pain, mental confusion, and lethargy were reported. The researchers emphasized that in 80% of cases, COVID-19 followed a mild course, and highlighted the potential for asymptomatic individuals to harbor the virus. Notably, the authors underscored the significance of distinguishing between dyspnea and fatigue, particularly when these symptoms are present alongside others.
During a respiratory pandemic, it is imperative that patients and their families are adequately informed about the risks of contamination, despite the implementation of additional measures to mitigate these risks. With a significant reduction in the number of elective procedures expected during this period, the duration of hospital stays is anticipated to be minimized to the essential requirements outlined in each protocol agreed upon by consensus. Furthermore, the classification of a procedure as elective necessitates clinical judgment, as delaying it could potentially lead to complications that may heighten the risk of decompensation and adverse events, particularly in high-risk patients with conditions like unstable angina. Consequently, the decision regarding the performance of a procedure should be personalized, taking into account the individual patient's risk profile and a thorough analysis of potential benefits and drawbacks.
Despite the implementation of measures aimed at minimizing exposure, it is crucial to anticipate a shortage of healthcare personnel due to the potential removal of individuals who are infected, exposed, at-risk, or under quarantine. Special consideration should be given to preventing simultaneous exposure of healthcare professionals with similar skill sets to mitigate the risk of simultaneous contamination, particularly in educational settings where staff members often collaborate closely. Furthermore, it is essential to highlight the significance of minimizing traffic within procedure rooms to uphold the minimum safety standards outlined in CCL procedural protocols.
It is important to highlight that individuals suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 should ideally undergo procedures towards the end of the day or in designated CCL rooms specifically allocated for COVID-19 cases, if possible. This recommendation is made due to the necessity for thorough terminal disinfection after the procedures.
Patients who have already been intubated pose a reduced risk of contamination to healthcare personnel due to being on closed-loop ventilation. For individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 requiring orotracheal intubation, this procedure should ideally be conducted prior to their arrival at the Critical Care Unit. Moreover, early intubation should be contemplated for borderline cases to preempt the necessity of urgent interventions and to mitigate staff exposure to potential contamination.
Healthcare personnel exposure and patient benefits must be carefully balanced across all interventional procedures. For instance, in the context of a respiratory epidemic, some authors suggest that fibrinolysis could serve as an alternative for hemodynamically stable patients with COVID-19 and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Nevertheless, it is crucial to meticulously assess the potential length of hospital stay while awaiting coronary angioplasty post-fibrinolysis.
It is important to acknowledge that COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets and contact with surfaces where the virus can remain viable for extended periods, including items like cell phones, keyboards, mice, and door handles. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize the duration of procedures. Additionally, individuals suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 should wear a face mask upon entering the clinical care location and maintain its use throughout the preparation and execution of the procedure.
All personnel in the CCL are required to wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) throughout the entire procedure, which includes FFP2/N95 respirators, goggles, full face shields, disposable caps, gowns, surgical gloves, and shoe covers. This precaution is necessary due to the potential for clinical deterioration in patients and the associated risks during intubation, aspiration, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Furthermore, it is imperative that CCL staff receive thorough education on the correct procedures for donning and doffing PPE, given the high probability of contamination during these processes.
It is important to highlight that myocardial injury has been documented in 7% of COVID-19 patients, potentially manifesting as type 2 myocardial infarction or myocarditis. Therefore, it is crucial to diligently pursue a differential diagnosis prior to any procedure, utilizing imaging modalities like point-of-care echocardiography to aid in this process.
It is essential to highlight that percutaneous coronary intervention should be restricted to the culprit vessel, except in cases where a nonculprit lesion is considered unstable or when multiple culprit lesions are present.
During the pandemic, hospitals are preparing for an anticipated increase in hospitalizations due to COVID-19 infected patients. To ensure that sufficient inpatient beds are available for COVID-19 treatment and to minimize the risk of additional contamination, hospitals are implementing early discharge protocols for stable patients. These patients may then be monitored and followed up through telemedicine services.
Within the CCL, it is imperative that all nonessential equipment is either relocated from the procedure room or adequately shielded with clear drapes prior to the patient's arrival. This precautionary measure should also be extended to the control and post-procedure recovery rooms. Following a procedure involving a patient diagnosed with COVID-19, a comprehensive terminal disinfection process can be effectively carried out using ultraviolet light.
The conventional positive pressure ventilation system within the CCL comprises an air-handling unit responsible for dispersing conditioned air to various functional units such as the procedure, post-procedure, and control rooms. This system, when operating with sufficient air changes, can effectively remove viruses from the environment swiftly. Moreover, studies have indicated that the likelihood of cross-contamination from airborne infections is minimal provided that personnel are equipped with suitable personal protective equipment (PPE). It is recommended that the positive pressure ventilation system be expanded to include the rooms associated with the procedure to enhance overall safety and infection control measures.
It is important to highlight that individuals with COVID-19 frequently experience an inflammatory state that leads to a hypercoagulable condition, necessitating the supplementary administration of heparin.
Figure 1 illustrates the safety recommendations for CCL procedures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular emphasis on those highlighted in bold. These recommendations are crucial for ensuring the safety and well-being of both healthcare providers and patients during these challenging times. It is imperative that healthcare professionals pay special attention to the guidelines outlined in bold to minimize the risk of transmission and ensure the successful execution of CCL procedures in a safe and effective manner.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that all materials utilized for invasive procedures, such as anesthesia equipment, orotracheal intubation tools, mechanical ventilation devices, and personal protective equipment (PPE), undergo a daily inspection. These items must be easily accessible and readily available to ensure swift and efficient use, thereby reducing the burden on healthcare professionals and mitigating the risk of burnout.
The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) should ideally be removed in an anteroom. In cases where an anteroom is not accessible, the doffing of PPE should take place within the procedure room, following the completion of the procedure and after the patient has been relocated, with the exception of respiratory protection PPE, which should be removed outside the procedure room. (Reference 13)
Post-procedure visits should ideally be conducted by a minimal number of professionals. Furthermore, conversations regarding additional management strategies should be transitioned to an online or telephone platform, a practice that should also be adopted for morning CCL rounds. (References: 12-14)
Most sanitizers typically consist of varying concentrations of alcohol and are utilized for the purpose of cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces like floors, walls, ceilings, and countertops, a crucial measure particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, characterized by a single-strand RNA structure, exhibits sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation and heat, rendering it susceptible to inactivation by lipid solvents including ether (75%), ethanol, chlorine-based sanitizers, peroxyacetic acid, and chloroform, with the exception of chlorhexidine.
Terminal disinfection of the procedure room at the conclusion of each procedure is strongly advised amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Items such as disposable personal protective equipment (PPE), sheets, fabric, and sponges that have been contaminated with blood ought to be carefully placed into a designated waste container bearing the biological hazard symbol, and subsequently disposed of in a waste bin specifically labeled as 'COVID-19'.
Figure 2 illustrates the essential safety items required for CCL procedures, with those highlighted in bold indicating the specific components that necessitate heightened vigilance amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, Figure 3 delineates the sequential steps involved in donning and doffing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) tailored for CCL procedures within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A recent case series involving 5700 inpatients with COVID-19 in New York City, United States, revealed a high prevalence of comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular conditions. The median age of the patients was 63 years, with 60.3% being male. The reported comorbidities included arterial hypertension (56.6%), coronary artery disease (11.1%), heart failure (6.9%), obesity (41.7%), and diabetes (33.8%). The in-hospital lethality rate stood at 21%, escalating to 88% among those necessitating mechanical ventilation. The authors also noted that most patients continued their regular medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining conventional treatments for individuals with heart conditions to prevent decompensation during the ongoing pandemic.
The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic are significant, encompassing not only the care of patients with cardiovascular conditions who must maintain their treatments irrespective of their COVID-19 status but also the intricate management of the cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including myocarditis, Takotsubo syndrome, and myocardial injury, which can present similarly to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Furthermore, patients often postpone seeking medical attention at hospitals due to concerns about potential exposure to the virus.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the established standard treatment for conditions like primary angioplasty remains crucial. These procedures should ideally be conducted at hospitals with adequate resources for prompt responses, staffed by specialized professionals who adhere to the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines. The use of fibrinolysis-based strategies should be considered only when primary angioplasty is not feasible.
Interventional cardiology, while typically focusing on more captivating subjects than safety measures, must adapt to the current extraordinary circumstances. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to reassess the various facets of patient and healthcare personnel protection within the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL) and customize them accordingly.
Health systems globally have faced overwhelming challenges for an extended period. Unlike ventilators and hospital wards, healthcare personnel, particularly highly specialized professionals like CCL staff, cannot be rapidly manufactured to meet the escalating demands.
All activities conducted in CCL rooms must undergo restructuring, with the maintenance of registries essential for quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on the treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases. By implementing these measures, we can glean valuable insights from this pandemic, enhancing the field and enriching the expanding pool of knowledge on COVID-19.
