Abstract 
The mining sector generates a substantial quantity of stone waste and tailings, which constitutes an 
environmental risk. The most prevalent method for disposing of this industrial waste is dumping, 
which contributes to soil deterioration and water contamination while acquiring precious land. It 
can be recycled using a number of processes, such as the promising geopolymerization technique, 
which transforms waste into value. This study reviews current developments in the manufacturing 
of mine tailings-based geopolymer composites from industrial waste as a possible sustainable 
building material. This paper also gives in-depth studies on the characteristics and behaviors of mine 
tailings composites used in geopolymer manufacturing, including physical and mechanical 
properties. This review also identifies knowledge gaps that must be filled in order to advance mine 
tailings composites for geopolymers.

1. Introduction 
Mine tailings accumulate in tailings ˑponds ˑand ˑmine ˑwaste ˑlandfills, ˑand ˑthe ˑchallenge ˑof 
ˑsustainable ˑdisposal ˑof ˑthese ˑwastes ˑis ˑbecoming ˑconsiderably ˑmore ˑcritical [1, 2]. ˑThis ˑis

ˑdue ˑto ˑthe ˑmetallurgical ˑand ˑmining ˑsectors' ˑincreasing production volumes, as well as the lack 
of an acceptable means for ˑdisposing ˑof ˑthe ˑwaste ˑcreated by ˑthese ˑindustries, ˑon ˑthe ˑone 
ˑhand. ˑOn ˑthe ˑother ˑhand, ˑit ˑcan ˑbe explained by the increasing stringency of ecological 
regulations in the majority of wealthy countries throughout the world. Lead and mercury, 
ˑradioactive ˑmaterials, ˑand ˑother ˑmine ˑtailings-related ˑtoxins ˑare ˑactively ˑreleased ˑinto ˑthe 
ˑenvironment ˑas ˑa ˑresult ˑof ˑthe ˑbuildup ˑof ˑtailings, ˑbiota, ˑˑpolluting ˑsoils, ˑair , ˑand ˑwater , 
ˑand ˑcausing ˑcancer ˑin ˑhumans . Pollutants ˑfrom ˑfood ˑprocessing ˑand ˑfeed waste ˑharm 
ˑvaluable ˑfarms ˑand ˑnatural ˑecosystems . The ˑfunctioning ˑof ˑtailing ˑdams ˑincreases the 
likelihood of man-made catastrophes occurring [3, 4].  
Furthermore, from the standpoint of rational ˑnatural ˑresource ˑmanagement, ˑmine ˑtailings ˑshould 
ˑbe ˑseen ˑas ˑa ˑmineral ˑsource ˑthat ˑhas been extracted from the ˑearth's ˑsubsurface, ˑtransported, 
ˑand ˑunderutilized. ˑThe ˑtailings ˑcan ˑcomprise ˑtrace ˑamounts ˑof ˑtarget ˑmaterial ˑas ˑwell ˑas 
ˑpreviously ˑunclaimed ˑelements ˑthat ˑcan ˑbe ˑrestored ˑvia ˑmore ˑeffective mining ˑprocedures 
ˑ[5-10], ˑwhich ˑis ˑone ˑreason ˑfor ˑthis ˑviewpoint. ˑThe ˑchemical ˑcomposition ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings, 
ˑon ˑthe ˑother ˑhand, is primarily composed ˑof ˑsilicon, ˑaluminum, ˑand ˑcalcium ˑoxides, ˑwith ˑa 
ˑpercentage ˑranging ˑfrom ˑ60 ˑto ˑ90% ˑ[11]. ˑAs ˑa ˑresult, ˑtailings ˑhave ˑthe ˑpotential ˑto ˑserve 
ˑas ˑan ˑalternative ˑsource for meeting a wide range of construction ˑand ˑindustry ˑrequirements 
[12-14].  
A prospective ˑtrend ˑin ˑmine ˑtailings ˑuse appears to be the use ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings ˑas ˑgeopolymers 
ˑand ˑprecursors ˑof ˑalkali-activated materials ˑor ˑaggregates ˑ[15-17]. ˑMaterials ˑcomposed 
ˑmostly ˑof ˑamorphous ˑsodium ˑaluminum-silicate ˑhydrate ˑare ˑcalled ˑgeopolymers ˑ[18]. They 
are primarily solids formed ˑby ˑthe ˑinteraction of an ˑaluminosilicate ˑpowder ˑand ˑan ˑalkali 
ˑsolution ˑ[19]. ˑAccording ˑto ˑvan Deventer, et al. [18], the geopolymer ˑnetwork ˑis ˑcomposed ˑof 
ˑAlO4 ˑand ˑSiO4 ˑtetrahedra ˑconnected ˑby ˑoxygen ˑatoms ˑ[19]; ˑPositively ˑcharged ˑions ˑ(e.g., 
ˑCa2+, ˑNa+, ˑK+, ˑand ˑLi+) ˑpresent ˑin ˑthe ˑcavity ˑframework ˑbalance the negative charge. It ˑis 
ˑpossible ˑthat ˑusing mine tailings as a geopolymer approach will ˑnot ˑonly ˑslow ˑdown ˑthe 
ˑaccumulation ˑof mine tailings and reduce the level of ecological ˑcontamination, ˑbut ˑit ˑwill ˑalso 
ˑcombine ˑthe ˑbenefits ˑof ˑgeopolymer ˑtechnology ˑassociated ˑwith ˑa ˑreduction ˑin ˑcarbon 
ˑdioxide ˑrelease ˑinto ˑthe ˑenvironment, ˑthe ˑpotential ˑof ˑutilizing ˑother ˑforms ˑof 
ˑaluminosilicate ˑwaste, ˑand ˑthe ˑversatility ˑof ˑgeopolymer ˑcharacteristics ˑas ˑa ˑgeneral-purpose

ˑconstruction ˑadhesion ˑ[20-24]. ˑRecently, ˑthere ˑhas ˑbeen ˑa ˑconsiderable ˑincrease ˑin 
ˑunderstanding ˑamong ˑa ˑdiverse ˑgroup ˑof ˑspecialists ˑin ˑthe ˑmanagement ˑof ˑtails ˑin ˑcommon 
ˑmethods . Over a dozen articles have been published detailing the efforts made to increase our 
understanding of the geopolymerization processes of tails in order to govern the properties of 
geopolymers for applications such as pollutant removal [25-27], sustainable building [28-32], and 
another ˑparticular ˑusage ˑ[12, 29, 30, 33-41]. 
The mine tailings are inhomogeneous and have a complex ˑmineral, ˑaggregate, ˑand ˑchemical 
ˑcomposition ˑ[11]. ˑFurthermore, ˑalthough ˑhaving ˑrelatively ˑlow ˑquantities ˑof ˑvaluable 
ˑcomponents, ˑmine ˑtailings ˑcontain ˑhazardous ˑand ˑtoxic ˑcompounds ˑconnected ˑwith ˑwaste 
ˑproducts ˑor ˑmining ˑactivities ˑ[42-46]. ˑAll ˑof ˑthese ˑfactors ˑmake ˑit ˑmore difficult to manage 
mine tailings directly in order to obtain geopolymers that meet ecological safety criteria ˑin ˑrespect 
ˑof ˑimpurity ˑcontent ˑwhile ˑalso ˑachieving ˑthe ˑessential ˑcomplex ˑfunctional ˑcharacteristics 
ˑfor ˑthe ˑmanufactured ˑproduct [47, 48]. 
As a result, tackling the issues associated with the use of mine tailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑis 
ˑespecially ˑuseful, ˑboth ˑin ˑterms ˑof ˑlimiting ˑthe ˑnegative ˑimpact ˑon ˑthe ˑenvironment ˑand 
ˑthe ˑprospect ˑof ˑgrowing the resource base of fabricated ˑmineral ˑraw ˑmaterials. ˑIt ˑis ˑgreatly 
ˑbeneficial ˑto ˑsolve ˑthe ˑproblems ˑlinked ˑwith ˑthe ˑuse ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer 
ˑcomposites. This review begins ˑwith ˑa ˑdiscussion ˑof ˑsome ˑof ˑthe ˑphysicochemical ˑand 
ˑecological ˑissues ˑsurrounding ˑthe ˑutilization ˑof mine tailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites. ˑMine 
ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑare ˑdiscussed ˑin length in this paper, which is both a 
generalization and a thorough ˑinvestigation ˑof ˑthe ˑlink ˑbetween ˑtheir ˑstructural, ˑmechanical, 
ˑand ˑthermal ˑcapabilities, ˑas ˑwell ˑas ˑtheir ˑdurability ˑand ˑother ˑsubstantial ˑaspects. ˑApart 
ˑfrom ˑthe ˑuseful ˑfeatures ˑof ˑthe ˑformation ˑof ˑthe characteristics ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer 
ˑcomposites, ˑwe ˑdiscuss ˑcomprehensively ˑthe ˑwell-known ˑcases of its utilization in promising 
applications.

2. Physical properties 
2.1. Workability 
Workability ˑof ˑtailing-based ˑcomposite ˑconcrete is the ease of working with ˑthe ˑcomposite 
ˑmaterial based on transportation, compaction, ˑplacement, ˑand ˑfinishing ˑof ˑthe ˑconcrete 
ˑproduct ˑ[2-4, 12, 49]. ˑThis ˑmeans ˑthat ˑthe ˑfresh ˑproperty ˑof ˑtailing-based ˑcomposite 
ˑconcrete ˑcan ˑbe ˑregarded ˑas ˑworkable ˑif ˑit ˑcan ˑbe ˑtransported, ˑplaced, ˑcompacted, ˑand 
ˑfinished ˑwith ˑease ˑand ˑwithout any segregation. Several ˑreports ˑhave ˑshown ˑthat ˑthe ˑflow ˑof 
ˑmortar decreases with an increase in tailing ˑsubstitution ˑlevels since tailings ˑhave ˑa ˑfiner 
ˑparticle ˑsize ˑdistribution, ˑincreasing ˑthe ˑtotal ˑspecific ˑsurface ˑarea ˑof ˑthe ˑfine ˑaggregates 
ˑ[50, 51], ˑwhich ˑis ˑalso ˑapplicable ˑto ˑconcrete. ˑSlump ˑformation ˑdeclines ˑwith ˑincreasing 
ˑtailings ˑsubstitution as fine aggregate, possibly ˑdue ˑto ˑsurface ˑtexture ˑand ˑparticle ˑsize ˑof 
ˑtailings, ˑrequiring ˑmore ˑwater, ˑthereby ˑreducing ˑthe ˑworkability [51, 52]. The workability loss 
of geopolymer composite binders ˑdepends ˑsolely ˑon ˑthe ˑvolume ˑfraction ˑin ˑthe ˑmixtures ˑand 
ˑthe ˑfiber aspect ratio [53]. The report of ˑSavastano Jr, et al. [54] ˑreveals ˑa ˑdecline ˑin ˑthe 
ˑworkability ˑof ˑcement ˑcomposites ˑin ˑthe ˑpresence ˑof ˑeucalyptus ˑpulp, ˑcoir, ˑor ˑeucalyptus 
ˑpulp ˑin ˑcombination ˑwith ˑsisal ˑfibers [13-17]. 
The ˑworkability ˑof ˑalkali-activated ˑtailing ˑpaste ˑis influenced ˑby ˑa ˑcombination ˑof ˑfactors 
like calcination temperature and water-to-tailings ratio. ˑSavastano Jr, et al. [54] ˑreported ˑthat 
ˑsufficient ˑworkability ˑat ˑ800 ˑºC ˑcalcination ˑrequires ˑwater ˑto ˑwaste ˑclay ˑcontaining ˑa 
ˑboron ˑratio ˑof ˑ0.40. ˑFor ˑlower ˑcalcinations ˑof ˑ700 ˑºC, ˑ600 ˑºC, ˑand ˑ500 ˑºC, ˑthe ˑrequired 
ˑwater ˑto ˑwaste ˑclay ˑcontaining ˑboron ˑratios ˑare ˑ0.51, ˑ0.65, ˑand ˑ0.65 to attain sufficient 
ˑworkability ˑvalues. Properties ˑlike ˑthe ˑparticle ˑshape ˑof ˑclay ˑminerals, ˑwhich ˑcause ˑan 
ˑexcessively high water demand ˑdue ˑto the penetration ˑof ˑwater ˑinto ˑthe ˑinterlayers ˑof the clay, 
do not affect ˑthe ˑworkability ˑ[55-58]. 
 
2.2. Water absorption and sorptivity 
The concrete durability around an ˑexposed surface is mainly ˑdetermined ˑby ˑthe ˑability ˑof 
ˑharmful ˑagents ˑto ˑpenetrate ˑthe ˑconcrete. ˑThe ˑsorptivity ˑdepends ˑon ˑthe ˑporosity ˑand

ˑpermeability ˑof ˑthe ˑconcrete ˑand the strength of the capillary. ˑIt ˑis ˑessential ˑto ˑreduce ˑthe 
ˑpenetration ˑof ˑharmful ˑagents’ ˑsorptivity ˑof ˑthe ˑgeopolymer. ˑPortland ˑcement ˑpaste ˑexhibits 
ˑhigher ˑporosity ˑand water absorption capacity than ˑgeopolymer ˑpastes. ˑMost ˑof the time, 
steam-curing affects things like the uniform distribution ˑof ˑhydration ˑproducts ˑand the porosity 
of ˑPortland ˑcement ˑpaste [59-62]. 
Aydın and Kızıltepe [63] ˑreported ˑthat ˑthe ˑsorptivity ˑand ˑwater ˑabsorption ˑcapacity ˑof 
ˑactivated ˑwaste ˑclay ˑcontaining boron mortars declined ˑwith ˑan ˑincrease ˑin ˑSiO2 ˑ/Na2O 
values, and Na2O-containing ˑmortar mixtures exhibited ˑsmaller ˑwater ˑabsorption ˑvalues ˑand 
ˑsorptivity ˑthan ˑthe ˑcontrol mortar [55-59]. The Ms and Na2O ˑcontent ˑof ˑthe ˑactivating ˑsolution 
ˑgreatly ˑaffect ˑthe ˑwater ˑsorptivity ˑmore ˑthan ˑthe ˑtotal ˑabsorption ˑcapacity, ˑwhich ˑconforms 
ˑwith ˑthe report of Bernal, et al. [64]. 
Falah, et al. [65] reported ˑthat ˑwater ˑabsorption ˑcan ˑbe ˑsuppressed ˑby ˑmaximizing ˑthe ˑsodium 
ˑsilicate ˑcontent, ˑthereby ˑenhancing ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength. ˑOf ˑall ˑthe ˑsamples, ˑsubmicron 
ˑalkali-activated mine tailings with a sodium silicate ˑcomposition ˑof ˑ30 ˑwt% ˑand ˑcured ˑfor ˑ28 
ˑdays exhibit the lowest water ˑabsorption, ˑresulting ˑin ˑmaximum ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑof 
ˑabout ˑ27.31 ˑMPa ˑdue ˑto ˑthe ˑhigher ˑreaction ˑrate. ˑAccording ˑto ˑthe ˑauthors, ˑwater 
ˑabsorption ˑincreased from 10% to 17% due to increased ˑpore ˑstructure ˑinfluenced ˑby ˑthe 
ˑcuring ˑconditions. ˑMoreover, ˑthe ˑwater ˑabsorption ˑcapacity ˑof ˑthe ˑsamples ˑdecreased ˑwith 
ˑan ˑincreasing ˑconcentration ˑof ˑNa2SiO3, ˑindicating ˑlower porosity (a denser structure) [66]. 
ˑThe reduction ˑin the water absorption ˑcaused ˑby ˑthe ˑincreasing ˑconcentration ˑof ˑNa2SiO3 
ˑslightly ˑenhanced ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength. ˑThe ˑminimum ˑwater ˑabsorption ˑof ˑthe ˑsamples 
ˑcured ˑfor ˑ28 days at 40 ˑºC and 60 ºC is obtained ˑfrom ˑalkali-activated ˑmine ˑtailings ˑtreated 
ˑwith ˑ30 ˑwt% ˑThe ˑNa2SiO3 ˑcontent ˑis ˑ12.62 ˑand ˑ9.98%, ˑindicating ˑa ˑhigher ˑdegree ˑof ˑa 
ˑreaction than other samples and giving ˑthe ˑhighest ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑof ˑ15.84 ˑand ˑ22 
ˑMPa. ˑMoreover, ˑthe ˑreport ˑof ˑFalah, et al. [67] shows that water absorption increased from 10 
to 14% when the submicron ˑsize ˑof ˑthe ˑmine ˑtailings ˑwas ˑused. ˑThe ˑamount ˑof ˑsubmicron 
ˑmine ˑtailings ˑand ˑNa2SiO3 ˑin ˑthe ˑsample ˑled ˑto ˑa ˑdecrease ˑin the sample's ability to absorb 
water. This ˑis ˑbecause ˑthe ˑsample ˑhas ˑa ˑdense ˑstructure ˑthat ˑdoes ˑnot ˑallow ˑwater ˑto ˑpass 
ˑthrough ˑ[68] [69, 70].

Regardless ˑof ˑtailings ˑsource ˑor ˑmineralogy/composition, ˑgrinding ˑtime ˑis ˑa ˑmajor 
ˑparameter ˑinfluencing the water absorption capacity ˑ[71]. ˑIt ˑhas ˑbeen ˑreported ˑthat ˑthe 
ˑadsorption ˑcapacity ˑof ˑalkali-activated silicate ˑtailings ˑdeclines ˑsignificantly ˑwith ˑincreasing 
ˑtailing ˑtime. ˑThe ˑalkali-activated ˑsilicate ˑrich ˑin ˑepidote ˑwith ˑhigh ˑaluminum ˑand ˑthe 
ˑsilicate ˑrich ˑin ˑtremolite ˑwith ˑhigh magnesium, ˑexhibited ˑabout ˑ20% ˑand ˑ35% ˑwater 
ˑabsorption, respectively, after grinding for one ˑmin. However, when ˑthe ˑgrinding ˑtime ˑwas 
ˑincreased ˑto ˑ16 ˑminutes, ˑthe ˑadsorption ˑcapacity ˑof ˑthe ˑtwo ˑsamples ˑdropped ˑby ˑabout ˑtwo 
ˑtimes. ˑThis ˑis ˑbecause ˑthe ˑmicrostructure of the ˑalkali-activated ˑtailings changed ˑa ˑlot ˑwhen 
ˑthe ˑtime ˑwas ˑincreased [72-76]. 
3. Mechanical properties 
3.1. Mine tailings as aggregates for geopolymer 
Mine ˑtailings, ˑa ˑwaste ˑcomprising finely distributed ˑsilica, might be regarded as aggregates of 
geopolymer and alkali-activated ˑmaterials because ˑof ˑtheir ˑhigh ˑsilica ˑcontent. ˑMine ˑtailings 
ˑrecycling, ˑin ˑconjunction with ˑthe ˑdiminution of the ˑecological ˑburden ˑfrom ˑmine ˑwaste, ˑis 
ˑintended ˑto ˑlower ˑthe ˑcost ˑof ˑgeopolymer ˑconcrete ˑwhile ˑalso ˑprotecting ˑnatural ˑmineral 
ˑsources [60-62, 72-75]. 
Barrie, et al. [77] ˑutilized ˑgold ˑmining ˑtailings ˑas fine aggregates ˑto substitute ˑcement ˑsand ˑin 
ˑa ˑgeopolymer ˑbased on volcanic and ˑhalloysite ˑglass. ˑIt ˑhas ˑbeen ˑestablished ˑthat ˑthe 
ˑincorporation ˑof ˑ12.7% ˑmine ˑtailings into the geopolymer ˑhas ˑno ˑimpact ˑon the mechanical 
characteristics ˑof ˑthe ˑmaterial. ˑWhen ˑthe ˑgeopolymerization ˑprocess ˑwas ˑdone, ˑthe ˑresultant 
ˑspecimens ˑhad ˑgood ˑimmobilization ˑof Zn and Pb, but Cu ˑwas ˑmore ˑmobile ˑbecause ˑof ˑthe 
ˑhigh ˑpH ˑlevel ˑin ˑthe ˑwater. 
A ˑgeopolymer ˑmortar ˑcomprised ˑof ˑmetakaolin and quartz was ˑcreated ˑby ˑsubstituting ˑiron 
ˑmine ˑtailings ˑfor ˑnatural ˑquartz ˑmaterial. As demonstrated ˑin ˑthe ˑprevious ˑexperiment, ˑthe 
ˑintroduction ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings ˑhad ˑno ˑconsiderable influence on ˑthe ˑmechanical ˑproperties ˑof 
ˑthe ˑgeopolymers. ˑIn ˑcontrast ˑto ˑthe ˑreference ˑspecimens ˑ(with ˑquartz ˑaggregate), ˑthe 
ˑspecimens ˑcomprising mine tailings were recognized by increased porosity and water absorption. 
This might have a detrimental impact on the material's durability. A similar ˑinvestigation ˑwas

ˑconducted by Sharath, et al. [78], ˑwho ˑutilized ˑgold ˑmining tailings as ˑfine ˑaggregates ˑto 
ˑsubstitute ˑcement ˑsand ˑin ˑa ˑgeopolymer ˑbased ˑon ˑvolcanic ˑand ˑhalloysite ˑglass. ˑIt ˑhas ˑbeen 
ˑestablished ˑthat ˑthe ˑincorporation ˑof ˑ12.7% ˑmine ˑtailings ˑinto ˑthe ˑgeopolymer ˑhas ˑno 
ˑimpact ˑon ˑthe ˑmechanical characteristics ˑof ˑthe ˑmaterial. ˑWhen ˑthe ˑgeopolymerization 
ˑprocess ˑwas ˑdone, ˑthe ˑresultant ˑspecimens had good immobilization ˑof ˑZn ˑand ˑPb, ˑbut Cu 
was more mobile because of ˑthe ˑhigh ˑpH ˑlevel in the water. ˑPaiva, et al. [79] ˑemployed ˑhigh-
sulfidic mine tailings as a fine aggregate of metakaolin-based geopolymer composite (metakaolin-
geopolymer) ˑor blast furnace slag-based ˑgeopolymer ˑcomposite ˑ(BFS-geopolymer) ˑto ˑcreate ˑa 
ˑfine ˑaggregate ˑof ˑgeopolymers [80-82]. ˑA ˑstronger ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑ(> ˑ20 ˑMPa) and a 
more ˑrapid ˑreactive nature were observed ˑin ˑmetakaolin-based ˑgeopolymers ˑcompared ˑto 
ˑBFS-based ˑgeopolymers. ˑFurthermore, ˑwhen ˑevaluated ˑunder ˑextremely ˑharsh ˑcircumstances 
ˑ(pH ˑ4 ˑand ˑ7 ˑfor ˑ40 ˑdays), ˑthe ˑcompositions ˑcomprising ˑa ˑhigh ˑconcentration ˑof ˑmine 
ˑtailings (50 to 62 weight% of precursor) ˑdisplayed ˑsubstantial ˑchemical ˑresistance. Table 1 
presents a summary ˑof ˑthe ˑimpacts ˑof employing tailings as aggregates in geopolymer mixes [83, 
84].

3.2. Mine tailings as precursors for geopolymer 
A range of chemical properties ˑidentifies ˑthe ˑminerals ˑthat ˑmake ˑup ˑthe ˑcomposition ˑof ˑmine 
ˑtailings, ˑincluding ˑtheir ˑinteraction ˑwith ˑalkalis. ˑThe ˑaluminosilicate ˑframework ˑof ˑthe 
ˑgeopolymer ˑis ˑdefined ˑby ˑthe ˑinteraction ˑof ˑthe ˑprecursor's ˑmineral ˑconstituents ˑin ˑan 
ˑalkali-activated solution, as well as the structure ˑand ˑproperties ˑof ˑthe ˑgeopolymer ˑitself. ˑIn 
ˑgeneral, ˑthe ˑalkaline ˑinteraction ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings ˑis ˑlow, ˑand ˑthis ˑis ˑthe ˑmost ˑsubstantial 
ˑfactor to consider when incorporating mine tailings into geopolymers [88-90]. 
Mine tailings have a high silica content as shown ˑin ˑTable ˑ2, ˑwhich ˑraises ˑthe ˑmolar ˑproportion 
ˑSiO2/Al2O3 ˑin ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer composites, ˑwhich ˑhas ˑa ˑdetrimental ˑimpact ˑon ˑthe 
ˑgeopolymerization ˑprocess. ˑFor ˑthis ˑreason, ˑmetakaolin ˑis ˑthe ˑmost frequently ˑutilized ˑas a 
supplementary source ˑof ˑAl ˑin ˑthe ˑchemical ˑindustry ˑ[28, 91-97] ˑbecause ˑof ˑthe ˑuniformity 
ˑand ˑpurity ˑof ˑits ˑcomposition, as well as its high interaction [28, 76, 80-82, 88-90]. Falayi [98] 
has indicated ˑthat ˑfly ˑash ˑand ˑblast ˑfurnace ˑslag ˑ(BFS) ˑare ˑemployed ˑa ˑbit ˑless ˑfrequently 
ˑthan ˑother ˑsubstances. It has been reported that volcanic glass and waste glass have been utilized,

The ˑstrength ˑand ˑdeformation ˑcharacteristics ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑare 
ˑinfluenced ˑby ˑa ˑvariety ˑof ˑparameters, ˑincluding ˑthe ˑSi/Al ˑproportion, ˑparticle ˑsize, ˑtype ˑof 
ˑalkali-activated, ˑalkali-activated/binder ˑratio, ˑand ˑcuring ˑtechnique. ˑIt ˑis ˑcritical ˑto ˑnote ˑthat 
ˑthe ˑenhanced ˑinteraction ˑof ˑmine tailings in geopolymerization ˑhas ˑan ˑeffect ˑon ˑthe 
ˑmechanical ˑproperties ˑof ˑgeopolymers, ˑwhich ˑis ˑa ˑuseful ˑconsideration ˑin ˑthe ˑusage ˑof 
ˑmine ˑtailings ˑin ˑgeopolymerization. Because of the poor ˑinteraction ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings, ˑextra 
ˑpre-treatment processes are required. Pre-treatment of mine tailings has ˑalso ˑbeen ˑfound ˑto ˑhave

ˑa ˑbeneficial ˑinfluence ˑon ˑits ˑinteraction ˑand ˑeventual ˑgeopolymer ˑdue ˑto ˑthe ˑmicrostructural 
ˑand ˑmineralogical ˑchanges that occur during ˑthese ˑprocesses. ˑMechanical ˑactivation ˑis 
ˑfrequently accomplished in mills, such as planetary mills, roller mills, ball mills, jet mills, and 
agitation mills, among ˑother ˑtypes ˑof equipment [100-107]. Furthermore, mechanical activation 
ˑhas ˑthe potential ˑto ˑsignificantly ˑaffect ˑboth ˑthe ˑchemical ˑand ˑphysical ˑproperties ˑof ˑmine 
ˑtailings; ˑthese ˑeffects ˑboost ˑthe ˑconcentration ˑof ˑaluminosilicate ˑin ˑalkaline ˑsolution, ˑwhich 
ˑfavors ˑthe ˑgeopolymerization ˑreaction. In ˑsome ˑcircumstances, ˑthermal ˑpre-treatment ˑmight 
ˑbe ˑused ˑinstead ˑof ˑmechanical ˑactivation. ˑIts ˑformation ˑis ˑinduced ˑby ˑheating ˑraw ˑmaterial 
to a certain temperature ˑand ˑcreating ˑstructural ˑchanges, ˑthe ˑeffects ˑof ˑwhich ˑrely ˑon a range 
of elements ˑsuch ˑas ˑthe ˑheating ˑrate, ˑholding ˑtemperature ˑand ˑduration, ˑthe environment, ˑand 
ˑthe ˑrate ˑat ˑwhich ˑthe ˑraw ˑmaterial ˑis ˑheated ˑ[108-110]. Mineral changes occur as a 
consequence ˑof ˑthe ˑthermal ˑpre-treatment; ˑin ˑsome ˑcases, ˑthe ˑelevated ˑtemperature ˑmight 
ˑsurpass ˑthe ˑbreakdown ˑtemperature ˑof ˑthe ˑminerals ˑbeing treated. The ˑremoval ˑof ˑdiaspore 
ˑand ˑkaolinite ˑwas ˑobserved ˑby ˑYe, et al. [111] ˑafter ˑcalcining ˑbauxite ˑtailings ˑat ˑ800 ˑºC ˑfor 
ˑ1 ˑhour, ˑwhich ˑincreased ˑthe ˑinteraction ˑof ˑthe ˑmine ˑtailings during geopolymerization. ˑAs 
ˑshown ˑin ˑFig. ˑ2, ˑafter ˑthermal ˑtreatment ˑat ˑalmost ˑ600 ˑ°C, ˑKiventerä, et al. [112] ˑnoted ˑa 
ˑdecrease ˑin ˑthe ˑdolomite ˑpeak ˑshown ˑby ˑgold ˑtailings. ˑWhen heated over 400 ºC, basanite 
transforms into anhydride. On the ˑother ˑhand, ˑthe quartz amount remained ˑstable ˑuntil ˑ650 ˑºC, 
ˑwhen ˑit ˑdeclined ˑslightly [113-117]. 
As ˑindicated ˑin ˑTables ˑ2 ˑand 3 ˑthere ˑare ˑa ˑnumber ˑof ˑfactors ˑthat ˑinfluence ˑthe ˑmechanical 
ˑproperties, ˑcompressive ˑstrength, ˑand ˑflexural ˑstrength ˑof ˑvarious ˑkinds ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings 
ˑused ˑas ˑa ˑgeopolymer ˑsource. ˑThey ˑare ˑcommonly ˑcoupled ˑwith ˑother ˑalumina-silicate 
ˑsource ˑmaterials, such as fly ash, ˑBFS, ˑmetakaolin, ˑand ˑso ˑon, ˑfor ˑthe ˑproduction ˑof 
ˑgeopolymers. ˑAccording ˑto ˑthese ˑtables, ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑand ˑflexural ˑstrengths ˑof ˑall ˑmine 
ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑwere ˑquite ˑdifferent. ˑThis ˑwas ˑmostly ˑbecause ˑthey ˑused 
several types of mine tailings, several types ˑof ˑalumina-silicate ˑresources, ˑseveral ˑtypes ˑof 
ˑalkali-activated, ˑdifferent ˑalkali-activated/binder ˑproportions, ˑdifferent ˑtemperatures, ˑand 
ˑdifferent humidity levels when they made them [113-120]. 
The curing temperature of mine tailings-geopolymer composites ˑhas ˑa ˑsubstantial ˑimpact ˑon ˑthe 
ˑmechanical ˑand ˑmicrostructural ˑcharacteristics ˑof ˑthe ˑpolymers. ˑTian, et al. [121] ˑstudied ˑthe

ˑimpact ˑof ˑcuring ˑtemperature ˑon ˑthe ˑcharacteristics ˑof ˑcopper ˑtailing-based ˑgeopolymers. 
ˑWhen ˑthe ˑcuring temperature was somewhat ˑenhanced ˑ(22–80°C), ˑhomogeneous ˑdissolution 
ˑof ˑaluminosilicate ˑand ˑthe ˑdevelopment ˑof ˑN–A–S–H ˑand ˑC–S–H ˑgels ˑwere ˑencouraged, 
ˑresulting ˑin ˑa ˑbeneficial ˑimpact ˑon ˑcompressive ˑstrength. ˑA ˑrise ˑin ˑthe ˑcuring ˑtemperature 
over 80 ºC, on the other hand, ˑhad ˑthe ˑopposite ˑimpact. ˑThe ˑhigh ˑcuring ˑtemperatures 
ˑ(between ˑ100 ˑand ˑ125 ˑºC) ˑresulted ˑin ˑa ˑlowering ˑof ˑthe ˑamount ˑof ˑalkaline ˑmedium 
ˑpresent, ˑwhich ˑprevented the dissolution ˑof ˑsilica ˑand ˑalumina ˑtypes [118-120, 122]. 
Several ˑresearchers ˑevaluated ˑthe ˑcompressive and flexural strengths ˑof ˑgeopolymers ˑmade 
ˑusing ˑcopper ˑmine ˑtailings ˑas ˑraw ˑmaterial ˑand ˑactivated ˑwith ˑa ˑrange ˑof ˑalkali ˑactivated. 
ˑIn ˑits ˑinvestigation, ˑFalah, et al. [123] discovered that increasing the amount of sodium ˑsilicate 
ˑused, ˑas ˑwell ˑas ˑthe ˑcuring ˑperiod ˑand ˑcuring ˑtemperature, ˑenhanced ˑthe ˑcompressive 
ˑstrength of copper mine tailings-geopolymer composites. ˑThe ˑcopper mine tailings-geopolymer 
ˑcomposites, which had been activated by ˑsodium ˑsilicate ˑsolution, ˑwere ˑbaked ˑin ˑa ˑmoderate-
temperature oven. They also observed that the flexural ˑstrength ˑof ˑcopper ˑmine ˑtailings-
geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑimproved ˑin ˑa ˑway ˑsimilar ˑto ˑthat ˑshown ˑin ˑthe ˑcompressive 
ˑstrength ˑrelates. ˑSimilarly, ˑin ˑthe ˑworks of Ahmari and Zhang [124], Manjarrez, et al. [125] an 
increase ˑin ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑhas ˑbeen ˑseen ˑwith ˑan ˑincrease ˑin ˑthe ˑmolarity ˑof ˑsodium 
ˑhydroxide ˑin ˑthe ˑrelated ˑcopper ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑactivated ˑby ˑsodium 
ˑhydroxide. 
The compressive strength of a ˑcopper ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer composite activated by sodium 
hydroxide ˑimproved ˑwith ˑa ˑboost ˑin forming pressure throughout moulding in the investigation 
of Ahmari and Zhang [126], but only ˑup ˑto ˑa ˑwater ˑcontent ˑof ˑ12% ˑat ˑthe ˑoutset, ˑand ˑthen 
ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑdropped ˑwith a rise ˑin ˑforming ˑpressure ˑas ˑshown ˑin ˑFig. ˑ3 ˑonce 
ˑthe ˑwater ˑcontent ˑwas ˑexceeded. ˑThey ˑalso ˑdiscovered ˑthat ˑafter ˑbeing ˑsubmerged ˑin 
ˑwater, ˑcompressive strength dropped ˑconsiderably. ˑAdditionally, ˑManjarrez and Zhang [127] 
ˑdemonstrated ˑthat ˑa ˑlowering ˑin ˑmoisture ˑcontent ˑbelow ˑ14% ˑresulted ˑin ˑan ˑimprovement 
ˑin ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑof ˑcopper ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑtriggered ˑby 
sodium hydroxide. The rise in curing temperature up to 90 ºC also resulted in an improvement ˑin 
ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑof ˑa ˑcopper ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposite ˑactivated ˑby 
ˑsulfur ˑdioxide ˑ[126, 128, 129].

When ˑfurther ˑalumina-silicate ˑsource ˑmaterials ˑare ˑadded, ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑof 
ˑcopper ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑimproves ˑ[125]. ˑIn ˑaddition, ˑa ˑrise ˑin ˑcopper 
ˑslag ˑconcentrations, ˑa ˑrise ˑin ˑsodium silicate/sodium ˑhydroxide ˑproportions ˑup ˑto ˑ1.0, ˑand 
ˑa ˑrise ˑin ˑthe ˑmolarity ˑof ˑsodium hydroxide solutions up to ˑten ˑmolarity ˑall ˑled ˑto ˑan 
ˑimprovement ˑin ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑof ˑcopper ˑmine ˑtailings-copper ˑslag ˑblended 
ˑgeopolymer ˑ[130, 131]. 
Iron ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑare ˑproduced ˑin ˑa ˑway ˑsimilar ˑto ˑcopper ˑmine 
ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites, ˑwith or without the ˑincorporation ˑof ˑalumina-silicate ˑsource 
ˑcomponents. ˑIn ˑone investigation, the compressive ˑstrength ˑof ˑan ˑiron ˑmine ˑtailings-
geopolymer ˑcomposite ˑactivated ˑby ˑsodium silicate was improved ˑwith ˑa ˑrise ˑin ˑcuring 
ˑtemperature ˑup ˑto ˑ80 ˑºC ˑand ˑa ˑrise ˑin ˑcuring ˑperiod ˑup ˑto ˑ7 ˑdays, ˑafter ˑwhich ˑthe 
ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑdeclined [132-134]. 
The geopolymer ˑconstructed ˑfrom ˑgold mine tailings and ˑdifferent ˑalkali-activated, ˑas ˑwell ˑas 
ˑadditional ˑalumina-silicate ˑcomponents, has been the ˑtopic ˑof ˑa ˑfew ˑstudies ˑto ˑwhich 
ˑresearchers ˑhave ˑgiven ˑspecial ˑattention. Gold mine ˑwaste-geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑwere 
ˑcreated ˑby ˑFalayi [135] ˑutilizing ˑpotassium ˑaluminate, ˑpotassium ˑsilicate, ˑand ˑpotassium 
ˑhydroxide ˑactivators. ˑAccording to its findings, ˑthe ˑmaximum ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑof ˑgold 
ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites was discovered ˑat ˑa ˑpotassium ˑsilicate/potassium 
ˑhydroxide proportion ˑof ˑ1.1. ˑAccording ˑto ˑits ˑfindings, ˑraising ˑthe ˑcuring ˑtemperature ˑfrom 
ˑ65 ˑto ˑ100 ˑºC ˑenhanced ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑof ˑpotassium ˑaluminate ˑand ˑpotassium 
ˑhydroxide-activated ˑgold ˑmine tailings-geopolymer composites [122, 133, 134]. The researchers 
ˑalso ˑdiscovered ˑthat ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength of geopolymer ˑactivated ˑby ˑpotassium 
ˑaluminate ˑand ˑpotassium hydroxide activators ˑis ˑgreater ˑthan ˑthat ˑof ˑgeopolymer ˑactivated 
ˑby ˑpotassium ˑsilicate ˑand ˑpotassium ˑhydroxide ˑactivators, ˑeven ˑwhen ˑthe ˑcuring 
ˑtemperature ˑis ˑraised ˑto up to 100 ºC. 
According to an investigation conducted by Pardavé, et al. [136], ˑwhen ˑthe ˑcuring ˑduration ˑwas 
ˑincreased, ˑthere ˑwas ˑan ˑincrease ˑin ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑof ˑgold ˑmine ˑtailings ˑand 
ˑalumina/kaolin ˑmixed ˑgeopolymer. In addition, ˑthe ˑinvestigation ˑby ˑKiventerä, et al. [137] 
ˑfound ˑthat ˑrising ˑthe ˑslag concentrations and ˑmolarities ˑof ˑsodium ˑhydroxide ˑsolutions

ˑresulted ˑin ˑan ˑimprovement in the compressive ˑstrength ˑof ˑgold ˑmine ˑtailings-slag/metakaolin 
ˑblended ˑgeopolymer ˑas ˑshown ˑin ˑFig. ˑ4 ˑ[137]. ˑ 
Solismaa, et al. [138] ˑdiscovered that incorporating ˑ25% ˑmetakaolin ˑimproved ˑthe ˑcompressive 
ˑstrength ˑof ˑmine tailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑmade ˑwith ˑa ˑsodium ˑhydroxide ˑactivator. 
ˑThey ˑalso ˑfound a significant difference ˑin ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑwhen ˑthe ˑcuring 
ˑtemperature ˑwent ˑup ˑto ˑ65 ˑºC. ˑAt ˑ85 ˑºC, ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength ˑwent ˑdown ˑa ˑlot. 
ˑConcerning ˑthe ˑcompressive and flexural strengths of geopolymer, no set ˑoptimal ˑquartz ˑmine 
ˑtailings ˑquantity ˑhas been seen for any of the curing ˑtimes ˑtested. ˑQuartz ˑmine ˑtailings ˑthat 
ˑcontain ˑ30% ˑor ˑmore ˑquartz ˑshrink ˑwhen ˑthey ˑdry, ˑbut ˑgeopolymer ˑshrinks ˑless ˑand ˑhas 
ˑless ˑporosity ˑwhen ˑthe ˑquartz ˑcontent ˑis ˑmore ˑthan ˑ30%. ˑIn ˑcontrast ˑto ˑother ˑmine 
ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites, ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑstrength of zinc tailings and metakaolin-
geopolymer composites improves with ˑa ˑrise ˑin ˑthe ˑamount ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings ˑpresent ˑ[139, 
140]. ˑJiao, et al. [141], Wei, et al. [142], ˑboth ˑpublished ˑinvestigations ˑon ˑvanadium ˑmine 
ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑincluding fly ash and ˑmetakaolin, ˑrespectively, ˑas ˑadditional ˑraw 
ˑmaterials ˑof ˑalumina-silicate ˑin ˑaddition ˑto ˑvanadium ˑmine ˑtailings [143]. 
Ye, et al. [144] observed an advancement ˑin ˑcompressive strength and flexural strength with an 
addition in time at low-curing ˑtemperature ˑin an ˑunknown ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposite 
ˑcontaining ˑ% ˑslag ˑin ˑan ˑunreported ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposite. ˑThis ˑdemonstrates 
ˑthat ˑthe ˑcompressive ˑand ˑflexural ˑstrengths ˑof ˑconcrete ˑcured ˑat ˑlow ˑtemperatures ˑare ˑless 
ˑthan ˑthose ˑof ˑconcrete ˑcured ˑat ˑa ˑtypical ˑtemperature ˑof ˑ22 ˑºC. ˑOne ˑpossibility ˑfor ˑthe 
ˑpoor ˑcompressive ˑand ˑflexural strengths ˑof ˑsuch ˑgeopolymers ˑmight ˑbe ˑthe ˑsluggish 
ˑgeopolymer ˑreaction ˑoccurring ˑat ˑsuch ˑlow ˑtemperatures. 
It ˑis ˑfeasible ˑto ˑenhance ˑthe ˑmechanical ˑproperties ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer composites 
by introducing reinforcing fibers. By studying a specimen of geopolymer matrix produced from 
non-heated phosphate mine ˑtailings, Haddaji, et al. [145] ˑdemonstrated ˑthat ˑthe ˑincorporation ˑof 
ˑsynthetic ˑfibers ˑ(glass ˑand ˑpolypropylene) ˑpromotes ˑmore ˑenergy ˑabsorption ˑand ˑductile 
ˑfailure ˑas ˑa ˑresult ˑof ˑthe ˑstress ˑredistribution ˑand ˑthe ˑfiber's ˑbridging ˑimpact [47, 48]. ˑThe 
ˑ1% ˑsynthetic fibers produced ˑthe ˑbest ˑmechanical ˑqualities, ˑaccording ˑto ˑthe ˑresearch. ˑWhen 
ˑflexural ˑstrength ˑwas improved relative to the ˑoriginal ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer composite

4. Conclusions 
The key annotations ˑfor ˑthis ˑpaper ˑreview ˑare as follows: 
1. According to the results of the referenced ˑstudy, ˑdehydrated ˑtailings ˑare ˑutilized ˑfor ˑthe 
ˑmanufacturing ˑof ˑgeopolymers more frequently ˑthan ˑother ˑforms ˑof ˑtailings. 
ˑDehydrated ˑtailings ˑare ˑcreated ˑeither ˑby ˑdry ˑtailing ˑoperations ˑor ˑby ˑbasically 
ˑdrying ˑthe ˑmine ˑtailings ˑpaste ˑor ˑslurry ˑand ˑsubsequently ˑgrinding.  
2. When ˑemploying ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer composites, ˑit ˑis ˑcrucial ˑto ˑconsider ˑnot 
ˑonly ˑtheir ˑmineralogical, ˑphysical, ˑand ˑchemical ˑcharacteristics ˑbut ˑalso ˑthe 
ˑpossibility ˑof ˑthe ˑpresence of numerous ˑpollutants, ˑlike ˑprocessing ˑliquids, ˑheavy 
ˑmetals, ˑand ˑother ˑcontaminants ˑin ˑtheir ˑcomposition. ˑHowever, ˑthe ˑconcerns ˑabout 
ˑthe ˑmovement ˑof ˑthese pollutants under ˑthe ˑimpact ˑof ˑleaching ˑand ˑother ˑprocesses, 
ˑin ˑaddition ˑto ˑtheir impact on the attributes of final components ˑderived ˑfrom ˑmine 
ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites, ˑhave ˑreceived ˑcomparatively ˑlittle ˑattention ˑin ˑthe 
ˑscientific ˑliterature. ˑFurthermore, ˑnatural ˑradionuclides ˑcan ˑbe ˑfound ˑin ˑmine ˑtailings 
ˑin ˑamounts that exceed the radiological ˑsafety ˑcriteria, ˑwhich ˑshould ˑbe ˑconsidered 
while employing mine tailings in geopolymers. 
3. Several aspects impact how well mine tailings-geopolymer composites function, and the 
synergistic impact between some of them (like mineralogy, virtuousness, and element 
distribution) must be addressed in order to ˑreap ˑthe ˑgreatest ˑpossible ˑadvantage ˑfrom 
ˑemploying ˑmine ˑtailings. 
4. Mine tailings are often composed of a highly ˑcrystalline ˑmatrix, ˑwhich ˑresults ˑin 
ˑminimal ˑinteraction ˑthroughout geopolymerization and, ˑconsequently, ˑa ˑproduct ˑwith

19 
ˑlow ˑmechanical characteristics. Incorporating ˑextra ˑelements ˑwith ˑincreased 
ˑinteraction ˑinto ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites ˑmay ˑefficiently ˑtune ˑand 
ˑenhance ˑthe ˑcharacteristics ˑof ˑthe ˑgeopolymers. ˑFurthermore, ˑsince ˑthe ˑmajority ˑof 
the additives utilized for this ˑfunction ˑare ˑindustrial ˑby-products, ˑtheir ˑusage ˑhas ˑthe 
ˑadditional ˑbenefit ˑof ˑreducing ˑthe ˑamount ˑof ˑwaste ˑproduced. ˑWhen ˑcompared ˑto 
ˑlow-Ca-comprising ˑadditions, ˑhigh-Ca-comprising ˑelements ˑhave ˑa ˑmore favorable 
impact on ˑthe ˑgeopolymer's ˑoverall ˑstrength ˑand ˑdurability. ˑThis ˑis ˑinduced ˑby ˑthe 
ˑproduction ˑof ˑextra ˑCSH ˑgels, ˑwhich ˑstrengthen ˑthe ˑmatrix ˑas ˑa ˑresult ˑof ˑits ˑco-
existence ˑwith ˑNASH, which improves the matrix density. 
5. Supplemental materials, especially those with a lot of calcium, ˑtend ˑto ˑbe ˑbetter ˑat 
ˑmaking ˑgeopolymer ˑcharacteristics. 
6. The ˑminerals ˑthat ˑform ˑmine ˑtailings ˑare ˑidentified ˑby ˑtheir ˑvarying ˑchemical 
ˑreactivity ˑto ˑalkali. ˑThe ˑinteractions ˑof ˑthe ˑprecursors' ˑmetal ˑcomponents ˑin ˑalkaline 
ˑconditions ˑaffect ˑthe structure and characteristics ˑof ˑthe ˑgeopolymer's ˑaluminosilicate 
ˑframework. ˑMany ˑtimes, ˑthe ˑalkaline ˑreactivity ˑof ˑmine ˑtailings ˑis ˑextremely ˑlow, 
which is the best thing when mine tailings ˑare ˑused ˑto ˑmake ˑgeopolymers. 
 
5. Recommendations 
The following are the main recommendations ˑfor ˑfuture ˑinvestigations: 
1. Incorporating ˑextra ˑelements ˑwith ˑincreased ˑinteraction ˑinto ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer 
ˑcomposites ˑmay ˑefficiently tune and enhance ˑthe ˑcharacteristics ˑof ˑthe ˑgeopolymers. 
ˑTherefore, ˑfurther ˑinvestigation ˑis ˑrecommended in this regard. 
2. When ˑemploying ˑmine ˑtailings-geopolymer ˑcomposites, ˑit ˑis ˑcrucial ˑto ˑconsider ˑnot 
ˑonly ˑtheir ˑmineralogical, ˑphysical, ˑand ˑchemical ˑcharacteristics ˑbut ˑalso ˑthe 
ˑpossibility ˑof ˑthe ˑpresence ˑof ˑnumerous ˑpollutants, ˑlike ˑprocessing ˑliquids, ˑheavy 
ˑmetals, ˑand ˑother ˑcontaminants ˑin ˑtheir ˑcomposition. ˑHowever, ˑthe ˑconcerns ˑabout 
ˑthe ˑmovement ˑof ˑthese ˑpollutants ˑunder ˑthe ˑimpact ˑof ˑleaching ˑand ˑother ˑprocesses,

ˑin ˑaddition ˑto ˑtheir impact on the ˑattributes ˑof ˑfinal ˑcomponents ˑderived ˑfrom ˑmine
