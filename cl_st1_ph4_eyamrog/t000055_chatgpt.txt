The "Coleção de Flebotomíneos" (FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB) housed at Fiocruz Minas is a meticulously curated biological collection comprising approximately 80,000 individual specimens representing 370 species of sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae, Phlebotominae), predominantly from the Americas. These specimens have been gathered over the past 80 years by entomologists dedicated to comprehending and managing the vector-borne disease leishmaniases. Since 2010, the metadata for each biological specimen within FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB, encompassing both current holdings and those deposited in preceding decades, has been digitized. Consequently, our resultant electronic catalog, encompassing records for 72,624 specimens and detailing all available provenance information linked to each, has been made accessible online through the speciesLink network <http://www.splink.org.br/search?collectioncode=FIOCRUZ-COLFLEB&group=animais&lang=pt&action=openform> and the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr) <http://ipt.fiocruz.br/ipt/resource?r=fiocruz_colfleb>.
Biological collections serve as vital repositories of biodiversity, housing specimens and pertinent information crucial for diverse scientific research endeavors. Particularly significant in the realm of medical and veterinary entomology, these collections play a pivotal role in accurate taxonomic identification of insects, essential for comprehending and intervening in the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. The "Coleção de Flebotomíneos" (the "Collection of Phlebotomines" in Portuguese) housed at the Instituto René Rachou, Fiocruz Minas (FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB) in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, stands as a notable biological collection focusing on sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae, Phlebotominae). These minute insects hold significant medical and public health importance as their blood-feeding adult females transmit protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania, the causative agents of leishmaniases, along with other bacterial and viral pathogens affecting both human and non-human vertebrates. The specimens within FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB originate from diverse research projects spanning approximately 80 years across various disease transmission zones and wild habitats devoid of disease records. Typically collected using light traps, these sand flies undergo meticulous identification by expert taxonomists utilizing available keys. These specimens not only facilitate research in taxonomy and systematics but also provide valuable data for ecological niche and species distribution modeling, among other research applications.
The dataset presented in this study comprises the metadata for each sand fly specimen housed at FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB since 1953. It includes 57 fields detailing the taxonomy (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, specificEpithet, infraspecificEpithet, scientificName, scientificNameAuthorship, taxonRank, vernacularName, typestatus), collection specifics such as collectors (recordedBy), collection date, trapping method, trap identification number, collection site description (occurrenceRemarks, eventDate, eventTime, habitat, samplingProtocol, samplingEffort, eventRemarks), geolocation data (country, countryCode, stateProvince, county, Island, waterbody, locality, locationRemarks, decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude, georeferenceRemarks), and catalogue reference data (occurrenceID, catalogNumber, OtherCatalogNumbers). Each physical object in our collections is associated with a paper card containing various fields related to specimen provider, location, and quantity of specimens. Since 2010, a dedicated staff member has been digitizing the information from these cards. The dataset is formatted in Darwin Core [10] and is accessible through the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr), an online platform that serves as the Brazilian Node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) [11]. Our dataset has been submitted to GBIF and is publicly available for use by others at: https://doi.org/10.15468/sxcpfp.
Phlebotomine sand flies are recognized as medically significant insects due to their role in transmitting pathogens between human and non-human animals. There have been approximately 1,000 species of sand flies described, with 530 known to inhabit the Neotropical and Nearctic regions [12].
The collection was established in 1953 under the direction of Professor Amilcar Vianna Martins and Alda Lima Falcão, in conjunction with technician João Evangelista da Silva, who was involved in all fieldwork [13]. Over the following decades, the number of specimens in the collection experienced significant growth, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s. In recent years, the collection has continued to expand, with the inclusion of fossil specimens, voucher specimens from DNA-based barcoding studies, and other epidemiological studies that require fieldwork [7,14].
FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB houses 922 type specimens encompassing 151 species, comprising holotypes, allotypes, paratypes, plesiotypes, cotypes, topotypes, homeotypes, syntypes, and neotypes. The collection also boasts a varied assemblage of fossil species of Neotropical sand flies, currently comprising 47 ambers from the Dominican Republic, preserving 162 sand flies across 9 species. Furthermore, FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB houses a substantial collection of over 700 voucher specimens deposited from ongoing DNA barcoding studies.
Since 2010, the metadata of the biological specimens housed in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB has been undergoing digitization. Among Fiocruz's various biological collections, it stands out for having the most published online data. Our online catalogue is seamlessly integrated into the speciesLink network (http://www.splink.org.br/search?collectioncode=FIOCRUZ-COLFLEB&group=animais&lang=pt&action=openform) and the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr) (http://ipt.fiocruz.br/ipt/resource?r=fiocruz_colfleb).
The adult sand flies housed at FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB were collected through a range of methods, including resting collection from both artificial and natural surfaces utilizing mechanical or manual aspirators ("pooters"), human-landing capture, unbaited and CO2-baited CDC-like light traps, as well as Shannon traps. These methods were employed in various environments, spanning from domestic and peridomestic settings (such as houses and their surroundings in urban, suburban, and rural regions) to the relatively untouched sylvatic and wild areas (like remote forest locations). The specimens in our possession originate from 20 different countries across the Americas, with representation from all 27 states of Brazil.
The live-caught insects are meticulously mounted on glass microscope slides and preserved using either Berlese medium or Canada Balsam, with fossil specimens being stored in plastic vials. Each specimen is carefully labeled with color-coded tags for easy identification and organization.
Insects were identified using keys found in the literature (Galati, 2003; Young and Duncan, 1994) by skilled taxonomists. The dataset is formatted in Darwin Core, comprising 57 terms. All required fields have been included and have undergone screening at the FIOCRUZ IPT. Additionally, metadata fields are accessible on the online pages.
The biological specimens deposited in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB hold significant importance as they provide detailed information on the distribution of sand flies across various regions in Brazil. Spanning from specimens dating back to 1939 to the most recent deposit in 2021, these data offer a comprehensive temporal coverage. This wealth of information is invaluable for a wide range of research applications, including taxonomy, systematics, ecological niche modeling, and various other scientific endeavors. Furthermore, these data can also be utilized in vector control activities, highlighting their practical significance in addressing public health concerns.
