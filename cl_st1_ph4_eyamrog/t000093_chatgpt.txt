The aim of this study is to outline the methodological approach utilized in constructing a comprehensive Brazilian database of Long-Chain Trans Fatty Acids (LCTFs) present within the country.
Methods: This exploratory research, conducted between August 2020 and 2021, relied primarily on publicly accessible data sources. The primary source of information was the database of the Sistema Único de Assistência Social for 2019. Public agencies and managers were consulted and encouraged to share their databases, while researchers and private entities also contributed by providing access to their spreadsheets. The gathered information was organized into separate spreadsheets for each Brazilian state, with Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) not catering to individuals aged 60 and over being excluded from the analysis. To ensure data accuracy, duplicate entries were removed whenever overlaps were identified across different aggregated sources.
Results & Discussion: This concise communication outlines the methodology utilized to map the present state of Brazilian LTCFs. Despite its limitations, this study marks a significant progression in recognizing, describing, and overseeing these services on a national scale. The 2019 SUAS census identified a total of 5769 facilities. Upon excluding establishments not catering to individuals aged 60 or above, the count reduced to 2381 LTCFs. Through the consolidation and refinement of data from various sources, a total of 7029 LTCFs were identified across the country.
Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) cater to older adults by offering a variety of services such as rehabilitation, healthcare, personal assistance, and end-of-life care. For a segment of vulnerable frail older adults, LTCFs represent more than just a place of residence; they serve as the sole option for emotional, physical, and social support.
The maturity, preparedness, and organization of the long-term care (LTC) sector significantly influence both the quality of care provided and the accessibility of essential datasets and information regarding facility characteristics, residents, and staff. This impact is particularly pronounced in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Data from the most recent Brazilian census conducted in 2009 indicates that Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) were found in just 29.9% of the country, amounting to a total of 3548 facilities. Similar to other Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), it is probable that numerous unregistered facilities existed, evading detection by health authorities and social care regulations.
In the Brazilian context, the profile of the Long-Term Care (LTC) sector remains ambiguous. Official databases that could provide accurate data on the total number of facilities, their operational status, infrastructure, services offered, and the demographics of residents are lacking, significantly impeding the sector's organization. Access to such fundamental information is crucial for the development of more targeted public policies aimed at addressing, accommodating, and alleviating pressing challenges like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Established in April 2020 amidst the urgent challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazilian Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs), the National Front to Strengthen LTCF for Older Adults (Frente Nacional de Fortalecimento à ILPI, FN-ILPI) is a collective of volunteers hailing from diverse regions of Brazil and various fields of expertise, encompassing specialists, scholars, managers, and researchers in the realms of aging and public policy for older adults. Within the FN-ILPI, a specific working group has been dedicated to investigating and assessing the state of the LTC sector in Brazil. The primary objective of the research undertaken by this group is to geographically pinpoint the distribution of LTCFs across different Brazilian regions, while also delineating their legal standing, capacity, and occupancy profiles. The purpose of this concise communication is to outline the methodological framework employed in constructing a comprehensive database of LTCFs in Brazil.
This exploratory research was conducted between August 2020 and 2021, relying primarily on publicly accessible data. Ethical approval was waived as no facilities were directly contacted. Figure 1 illustrates the research project flowchart.
The primary source of information for this research was the database of the Unified Social Assistance System (Sistema Único de Assistência Social - SUAS) census - Reception Services for the year 2019, which can be accessed at https://aplicacoes.mds.gov.br/snas/vigilancia/index2.php. Conducted annually by the Special Secretariat for Social Development of the Ministry of Citizenship, the SUAS Census gathers data on the standards of social assistance services, programs, and projects implemented by public social assistance units and organizations listed in the social assistance registry, as well as the functions of the Social Assistance Councils. This survey is completed by government agencies at municipal and state levels, encompassing Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCF) for older adults, shelters, and temporary care services for children, adolescents, and adults.
The working group members were assigned the responsibility of identifying and evaluating additional databases that might hold information on Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCF) in all 27 federal states, encompassing unregistered establishments. Following specific inquiries, the National Council of Public Prosecutors (Conselho Nacional do Ministério Público - CNMP) and the National Council for the Rights of the Elderly (Conselho Nacional dos Direitos da Pessoa Idosa - CNDI) granted access to their LTCF databases to the FN-ILPI in response.
Public agencies and managers were engaged and encouraged to contribute their databases, specifically those affiliated with the State health and social assistance secretariats, health surveillance, older adults’ councils, and State Public Prosecutors. Additionally, researchers and private entities participated by providing access to their spreadsheets for the working group's reference.
Additional searches were conducted on social media platforms and within the roster of establishments qualified for emergency financial aid offered by the federal government to alleviate the repercussions of the COVID-19 crisis within the Long-Term Care (LTC) industry.
The subsequent phase involved the development and preliminary testing of a comprehensive master spreadsheet, outlining the specific data points to be gathered for the current research endeavor. These included the institution's official name, any alternative trading names, the National Legal Entity Registry Number (Cadastro Nacional de Pessoa Jurídica - CNPJ), as well as the National Classification of Economic Activities (Cadastro Nacional de Atividades Econômicas - CNAE). Additionally, the spreadsheet aimed to capture details such as the establishment year, the physical location of the business, and the overarching nature or purpose of the institution under examination.
The data gathered from various sources was organized into separate spreadsheets for each state in Brazil. Long-term care facilities that did not serve individuals aged 60 and above were omitted from the analysis. Instances of duplicate data were removed upon detection of overlaps in the newly aggregated sources. Any missing information was supplemented, where possible, by cross-referencing social media, the CNPJ, and the National Register of Health Establishment websites. Despite efforts, definitive proof of all facilities remaining operational post the COVID-19 outbreak could not be ascertained, leading to the decision not to exclude any LTCFs during this phase of the research.
This brief communication outlines the methodology employed by the FN-ILPI to conduct the initial mapping of the current status of Brazilian LTCFs. Despite its limitations, this study signifies a significant advancement in the identification, characterization, and monitoring of these services on a national scale.
In the 2019 SUAS census, a total of 5769 facilities were identified. Following the exclusion of facilities that did not cater to residents aged 60 or older, the number of Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) decreased to 2381.
The process of consolidating and filtering data from various sources resulted in the identification of 7029 Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) nationwide. Among these, 4232 facilities were located in the Southeast region, 1874 in the South, 493 in the Northeast, 351 in the Midwest, and 79 in the North region of the country.
The absence of dependable data concerning the condition of Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs), their residents, and staff presents a significant global concern, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In countries like Brazil, similar to numerous Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), there is a noticeable deficiency in accessible public databases related to this sector. Despite its critical significance, the task of acquiring a comprehensive national dataset for the LTC sector remains a formidable obstacle.
Based on the 2019 SUAS official data, it was found that there were a total of 2381 LTCFs in the country after excluding facilities that do not cater to residents aged 60 or above. However, this figure does not accurately represent the true number of LTCFs in operation throughout Brazil. While the database does encompass a significant number of LTCFs for older adults, including those that are public, nonprofit, and for-profit, its coverage is deemed inadequate as it fails to account for numerous small, unregistered facilities and privately operated establishments.
In 2010, a study conducted by researchers at the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA) unveiled the initial census of Brazilian Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCF), indicating that approximately 1% of the elderly population in Brazil, equivalent to around 90,000 individuals, were housed in a collective total of 3,548 facilities. The majority of these LTCFs, accounting for 65%, were identified as non-profit philanthropic organizations.
A national survey conducted using the 2014 SUAS database revealed 1450 facilities accommodating approximately 51,000 elderly residents, the majority of whom were classified as frail. Despite national regulations categorizing LTCFs as 'social shelters', the survey indicated that these facilities were expected to offer health care services due to the residents' physical and cognitive vulnerabilities. However, the survey highlighted the poor quality of support provided and a lack of adequate infrastructure for care delivery. A comparison between the 2014 survey data and the SUAS Census of 2019 indicated an estimated increase of around 78,000 residents, yet there was no significant improvement in the conditions of care provided.
The lack of comprehensive long-term care policies in the country has exacerbated the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Inadequate and unreliable national data further hinders the implementation of evidence-based interventions. Despite these obstacles, the efforts of the FN-ILPI have effectively mitigated the impact of the pandemic on Brazilian care facilities, preventing the widespread tragedies witnessed in other nations within the sector.
Constructing a robust database was crucial in formulating a National Policy on Long-Term Care, a task accomplished through the collaborative endeavors of dedicated professionals united by a common objective. Although not without shortcomings, the resultant database stands as a significant stride forward in the identification, description, and surveillance of these services on a national scale.
The survey identified a 105% increase in the number of LTCFs compared to the 2010 census, with growth evident in all regions albeit varying in magnitude. The South region experienced the highest surge at 171%, followed by the Northeast (104%), Southeast (94.4%), Midwest (34.7%), and North region (40.2%). Private institutions showed the most significant increase in LTCFs, underscoring the necessity to expand long-term care services for an aging population. However, the reliance on the private sector highlights a concerning gap between demand and supply in the public sector, indicating a need for further attention and resources.
Some limitations of this study should be acknowledged. Despite consulting a variety of sources at federal, state, and municipal levels, including social media research, it is important to note that certain small and clandestine LTCFs may have been overlooked, especially in remote regions. These smaller, unregistered facilities, which often lack robust social and financial support, have experienced more pronounced impacts from the societal crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
By incorporating a multitude of sources, this survey significantly expands its scope beyond previous endeavors, marking an unparalleled collaborative venture within the country. Moreover, this initiative holds the promise of evolving into the inaugural national dataset for the Brazilian LTC sector.
If even legitimate LTCFs are going undocumented, it raises questions about the prevalence of clandestine facilities. The inclusion of such facilities in research can potentially lead to their regularization and the improvement of care for residents. Future studies should utilize national datasets to update the information collected during the original 2010 census, as there is a pressing need to expand upon the limited existing data. In pursuit of this objective, researchers at FN-ILPI are currently engaged in a research project that employs an updated version of the instrument used by IPEA researchers. Additionally, it is recommended that future research endeavors involve cross-sectoral collaboration, qualitative methodologies, and snowball-type approaches to identify and include a greater number of clandestine and unregistered facilities. These efforts are crucial in developing a more comprehensive and sustainable strategy for the sector, ultimately aiming to better organize the sector and provide care to this vulnerable segment of society.
