This paper explores the advantages of utilizing information and communication technologies (ICT) for conducting contextual target situation analyses from a distance to develop online critical English for Academic Purposes (CEAP) courses. It presents a contextual examination of the publication process in high-impact journals within the field of computer science, with a specific focus on identifying potential barriers that could impact the publication of research papers by Brazilian scholars. The study delves into the beliefs and experiences of Brazilian authors involved in this process through the use of electronic questionnaires and remote interviews. Additionally, an analysis of reviews of research articles was conducted to discern the community's criteria for accepting or rejecting submissions. Leveraging ICT facilitated a comprehensive contextual analysis involving participants from diverse geographical locations. The findings yielded valuable insights into the research and publication practices within the discipline, which can inform the development of tasks aimed at enhancing students' critical academic literacy. For developing countries like Brazil, the integration of ICT in the design of CEAP courses not only saves time and resources but also enables a more tailored and responsive approach to meeting students' contextual needs and preferences.
Education, viewed as a dialogical social practice, is a dynamic and intricate system that arises from the interplay of various factors (Mason, 2008). Society, individuals, institutions, disciplinary content, pedagogical and psychological theories are all simultaneously shaped within the complex interaction of social, historical, cultural, ideological, and financial elements that both influence and are influenced by education. In this light, educational characteristics are unique to specific contextual demands and limitations, continually evolving within a contextually structured, perpetual state of flux.
The emergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) at the turn of the century has brought about significant changes in numerous social systems, including education (Warschauer, 2002). The integration of ICT into teaching and learning processes has had varying impacts on educational systems worldwide, initially leading to chaos and instability. For example, Hara and Kling (2000) examined the effects of ICT on students, highlighting issues such as delayed feedback and technical difficulties as sources of frustration in a web-based distance language course in the United States. In terms of educators, Lam (2000) found that among 10 language teachers surveyed in Canada regarding their use of ICT in classrooms, there was a consensus that institutions rushed to adopt technological innovations without adequately preparing teachers, leading to perceived limitations. From an institutional standpoint, Karagiorgi (2005) documented the challenges faced in implementing ICT in elementary schools in Cyprus.
Nearly two decades have elapsed since the integration of ICT in education, fostering a rich exchange of experiences among educators, researchers, and institutions that has catalyzed educational reorganization and enhancement. Recent literature highlights the transformative potential ushered in by the digital age, particularly in the realm of language teaching and learning. ICT has played a pivotal role in modernizing conventional teaching methodologies and materials, as evidenced by works such as Eckhaus (2018) and Sahraini & Syamsudarni (2018). Within the domain of English for specific purposes (ESP), ICT has notably revolutionized language learning by introducing novel tools and facilitating new forms of communication, enabling students to actively participate in their discourse community during instructional sessions (Bloch, 2012). However, the application of ICT in needs analysis, particularly concerning the target situation, has received comparatively less attention. While technology has been instrumental in exploring linguistic (Ha & Hyland, 2017) and textual aspects (Supatranont, 2012) of specialized discourse, its potential in investigating contextual features of language use in the target situation remains underexplored. This paper advocates for leveraging ICT to delve into the contextual nuances of language use in the target setting, underscoring its benefits in enhancing needs analysis practices.
A three-phase investigation was conducted using various technological tools to collect information on the contextual factors influencing the creation and dissemination of research articles by Brazilian computer science professionals. The goal was to develop an online Critical English for Academic Purposes (CEAP) course tailored for graduate students. This study illustrates how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can enhance remote contextual target situation analysis, broadening the investigative scope while also streamlining course preparation efforts, thereby saving time and resources.
This section delves into the intricacies of language teaching and learning within CEAP courses, aiming to substantiate the necessity of conducting a contextual target situation analysis as part of the needs analysis process, a practice not typically emphasized in EAP/ESP literature. Subsequently, the utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for this purpose is introduced as a viable method to facilitate such investigations during the development of online CEAP courses.
Language teaching and learning, like any other social practice, constitutes a complex system whose outcomes are contingent upon the interplay of various components (Larsen-Freeman, 1997). Elements such as subjects, the target language, language of instruction, students' native language, instructional materials, tasks, assessment tools, language and teaching theories, the target discourse community, institutional and economic constraints, among others, all play crucial roles in the process of language teaching and learning. Furthermore, each of these elements represents a complex system in itself, emerging from the intricate interactions with other components. Languages, for instance, embody the social, cultural, and ideological outcomes of human interactions and artifacts utilized for communication and societal engagement.
English for Specific Purposes (ESP) recognizes the intricate nature of language use, instruction, and acquisition. Central to this approach is the principle of specificity, which pertains to the linguistic, textual, and contextual makeup of discourse within a particular social setting (target situation). Understanding this configuration is crucial for equipping students to effectively participate in such practices through genre utilization (Hyland, 2002). Additionally, specificity entails catering to the requirements of a particular student cohort (present situation) by enhancing their understanding of these genres to a standard acknowledged by the relevant discourse community.
Needs analysis is a crucial process in ESP, where practitioners delve into the specificities of the target and present situation (Songhori, 2008). This process embodies praxis, a fundamental principle of the approach. Kumaravadivelu (2001) refers to it as practicality, highlighting that teachers, when scrutinizing the nuances of the discourse to be taught and the classroom context, adopt a scientific approach. Their theories serve as the foundation for their instructional strategies. Since Swales' pioneering work in 1990, these principles have guided ESP practices in both occupational (EOP - English for Occupational Purposes) and academic (EAP - English for Academic Purposes) domains.
EAP has been effectively integrated into the instruction of academic discourse for both native and non-native students. By focusing on the specialized language required in academic settings, it has become a necessity for scholars to equip themselves for academic communication. However, in certain countries like the U.S., EAP is often viewed as a subordinate service discipline, primarily geared towards preparing students for communication within academia or across various disciplines (Benesch, 2001). To combat this marginalization, Critical EAP (CEAP) seeks to emphasize the intricate nature of language teaching and learning within the university context, highlighting the capacity of EAP pedagogy to enhance students' social consciousness rather than solely honing their linguistic abilities.
CEAP advocates for a third main principle: criticism, emphasizing a greater focus on contextual issues during language classes. This entails addressing injustices and inequalities in both the target language and the current societal context (Benesch, 1996). Through the analysis and reflection of contextual elements that both influence and are influenced by the target language, Benesch (2009) suggests that CEAP can assist students in redefining their understanding of citizenship, personal identities, and critical thinking within the target discourse community. Consequently, students may not only replicate their peers' discourse but also discern areas requiring change, when and how such changes should occur, thereby fostering social progress within the community.
A critical approach to English for Academic Purposes (EAP) necessitates redefining the roles of teachers and students. Rather than being viewed solely as technicians and novices within the discourse community, they are now seen as transformative practitioners (Morgan, 2009) and legitimate members capable of instigating change (Benesch, 1996). Consequently, Critical EAP (CEAP) emerges as a valuable investment in developing nations, particularly in equipping university students with the necessary skills for academic communication and fostering a culture of scientific equity.
ICT, as a pivotal contemporary tool for human interaction, warrants inclusion in CEAP classes due to its transformative impact on social systems, fostering globalization while also exacerbating social and economic disparities. Despite initial challenges, the integration of ICT in education has shown promising outcomes. Consequently, beyond mere discussion, its utilization in language course design, implementation, and analysis is poised to see a rapid upsurge.
In the realm of CEAP pedagogy, technological devices play a crucial role in evaluating students' performance in tasks, tracking their progress over the course of classes, and assessing the effectiveness of the curriculum (Chun, 2009). The integration of new instructional methods such as computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and distance or blended learning stands out as a significant advantage that ICT has brought to the implementation of CEAP courses (Arnó-Macià & Rueda-Ramos, 2011). Furthermore, within the domain of CEAP course design, ICT can be utilized for task development, structuring syllabi, conducting needs analysis, and examining both the current (Vieira & Aranha, 2015a, 2015b; Vieira, 2017; Aranha & Vieira, 2018; Vieira, 2020) and desired target situations (Vieira, 2019b). The subsequent section will delve into the specific application of ICT in the analysis of the target situation.
Target Situation Analysis (TSA) stands as a pivotal investigation within the realm of needs analysis for CEAP course design. It delves into the essential knowledge required by learners to navigate the target situation effectively (Songhori, 2008). TSA serves as a crucial step in ESP/CEAP pedagogy, ensuring specificity by equipping teachers with a deep understanding of language usage within the target discourse community. This understanding enables teachers to effectively translate students' needs into linguistic, literacy, and pedagogical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall learning experience.
Hyland (2007) elucidates that initial studies concentrated on the lexical and syntactic characteristics of specific registers, with subsequent attention shifting towards the rhetorical macro-structure of specialized texts. Presently, there is a heightened focus on exploring distinct discourse communities, aiming to comprehend language use within these communities and delineate the specific target texts essential for learners. This inquiry commonly entails the involvement of proficient community members, the genres they create and engage with, or a combination of both.
In the realm of experienced members, common instruments for data collection include questionnaires, interviews, and field observations, all aimed at pinpointing the genres students may utilize in the target scenario and the necessary skills they need to enhance their English proficiency (Sarmento, 2012). Genre analysis, on the other hand, typically hinges on texts generated and consumed within the community. This analysis can be approached from a textual perspective, where linguistic and rhetorical patterns of the target genre(s) are discerned (Cheng, 2008), or from an intertextual standpoint, seeking to uncover the genre system through which members engage in their activities (Molle & Prior, 2008).
In designing the CEAP course, there is a recognized necessity to expand the scope of Target Situation Analysis (TSA). Given CEAP's emphasis on current contextual issues and target scenarios, TSA should encompass methods for extracting data on the social, political, and ideological aspects within the discourse community, which shape and maintain power dynamics among its members. Benesch (1996) advocates for a critical approach to needs analysis that acknowledges the hierarchical structure of institutions. Within the realm of TSA, a critical viewpoint not only recognizes the socio-cognitive demands associated with English language usage within the target community but also views them as a potential area for reform. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can significantly enhance contextual target situation analysis in this regard.
The utilization of ICT in contextual TSA primarily focuses on data analysis, as many CEAP courses in existing literature are typically implemented at a local level, enabling educators to delve into the discourse community under study. For instance, Dehnad et al. (2010) employed computer software (SPSS) to scrutinize data obtained from a questionnaire distributed to graduate students at a medical and management university. Additionally, interviews were conducted with department heads, students, and a senior university administrator to refine the syllabus of a CEAP course.
In the context of distance education in vast territories like Brazil, traditional locus procedures can prove to be both time-consuming and resource-intensive. This challenge can be effectively addressed by leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for data collection, as advocated in this study. The subsequent sections of this paper will introduce a contextualized Technological Systems Approach (TSA) tailored for the development of an online Continuing Education for Academic Purposes (CEAP) course designed specifically for Brazilian computer science graduate students. Emphasis will be placed on the utilization of ICT tools for data collection, highlighting how they have streamlined the exploration of critical issues in remote learning environments.
In Brazilian universities where Portuguese is the primary language of instruction, the impact of globalization has necessitated students to engage with English, the predominant academic lingua franca (Ferreira & Lousada, 2016). For instance, applicants to computer science graduate programs in many public universities across the country are mandated to demonstrate proficiency in English through a rigorous examination assessing their ability to comprehend academic texts. Subsequently, upon enrollment in these programs, students are expected to publish a minimum of one paper in high-impact journals to fulfill the requirements for their post-graduation degree (Vieira, 2015a). Despite these demands, there is a noticeable scarcity of institutions offering English writing courses aimed at enhancing students' academic literacy (Aranha, 2009). In response to this gap, the proposal of online CEAP courses has emerged as a viable solution to facilitate the development of academic writing skills for these learners.
In 2014, Vieira conducted a comprehensive needs analysis to explore the specific reasons why Brazilian computer science graduates require proficiency in English within the academic setting. The findings revealed that the primary requirement for students was the ability to compose research articles and abstracts. Building upon this discovery, a targeted Textual and Contextual Analysis (TSA) focusing on these genres was recently undertaken. In addition to the forthcoming textual analysis, a contextual examination was carried out to delve into the critical factors that govern the utilization of research articles and abstracts within the academic community. More precisely, the contextual TSA outlined in this study aimed to pinpoint the potential issues that could impact the acceptance of papers authored by Brazilian computer scientists in high-impact journals.
Once both genres circulate in various contexts including production, legitimation, publication, distribution, and preservation (Khosrowjerdi, 2011), the contextual TSA shifts its focus towards the active participation of students in these processes, starting from production and culminating in the publication of research articles. Numerous subjects, institutions, and factors play crucial roles in these processes, involving authors, referees, funding agencies, and more. Therefore, the contextual investigation primarily aims to comprehend the production and publication of research articles in high-impact journals from the perspective of those whom the students aspire to emulate in the future: the authors.
Brazilian experts who have published articles in the highest-ranked journals across seven subfields in computer science, as per the Journal Citation Reports2 (JCR), were invited to participate in this study over a five-year period. Unlike CEAP courses held in English-speaking nations or those where instruction is in English, the focal point here does not stem from local community interactions but rather from a global community involved in the academic publication process within computer science. Conducting an in-person investigation into the contextual aspects of this target situation would be excessively time- and resource-intensive. Therefore, as a practical alternative, ICT was utilized for both remote data collection and analysis. Table 1 outlines the ICT tools employed in each of the three phases of the contextual TSA.
Phase 1 sought to elevate the visibility of the scientists involved in the study. Phase 2 was bifurcated into two distinct parts, each serving a specific purpose: the first part aimed at assessing the participants' capacity to generate research articles suitable for publication in high-impact journals, while the second part delved deeper into the examination of contextual factors identified in the questionnaire. Concluding the inquiry, Phase 3 centered on scrutinizing the feedback provided by reviewers on papers submitted to computer science journals.
Out of the 6,086 research articles published between 2011 and 2016 in the seven journals under investigation, 67 were authored by or in collaboration with 127 Brazilian researchers. Table 2 details the distribution of papers across the journals during the specified timeframe and the corresponding number of Brazilian researchers involved in their production. In cases where author contact information was not readily available within the published articles, the Google web search engine was utilized to locate their profiles within a Brazilian database dedicated to researchers and institutions known as Lattes. Subsequently, an email was dispatched to each author, extending an invitation to participate in the research by completing an online questionnaire hosted on Google Docs, with the questionnaire link included in the email.
Eleven questions were utilized to explore social, academic, and scientific information pertaining to the authors, alongside their perspectives on the impact of contextual factors in the publication process of high-impact journals. A total of thirty-eight authors took part in this phase, constituting 29.92% of the invited experts, a figure surpassing the minimum threshold (10-20%) deemed necessary for a dependable sample size, as outlined by Oliveira and Grácio (2005).
The data analysis in this study was conducted following the methodology outlined by Aaker and Day (1990), which involved both nominal and ordinal analyses of the tabulated data. The nominal analysis focused on identifying personal, academic, and professional features of the subjects, while the ordinal analysis delved into recurring features among the participants. Given that the questionnaire was administered online, data were automatically tabulated, and Microsoft Word and Excel were utilized for data description, analysis, and the creation of tables and charts.
Questionnaires are a common tool utilized for data collection in needs analysis by ESP practitioners (Flowerdew & Peacock, 2001). The integration of ICT enhances the advantages of questionnaires. Online questionnaires, for instance, can be more dynamic by incorporating various stimuli enabled by digital tools, such as charts, figures, and animations. Additionally, distributing questionnaires via email proves beneficial as they can be easily re-sent as needed, response times can be reduced, and participants can conveniently respond at their own pace and convenience. Furthermore, in the current study, the utilization of online questionnaires facilitated the inclusion of participants from remote locations, as illustrated in Figure 1.
The participants in this study included Brazilian computer scientists from four regions of the country as well as researchers who were currently abroad. Given the necessity for Brazilian computer science graduate students to communicate their research findings in English to an international audience, and the fact that the target audience for the online CEAP course under consideration was students from various regions of Brazil, the decision to conduct a global investigation of the target discourse community was a response to this specific context. The diverse backgrounds of the participants resulted in varied experiences with academic publishing, a topic that was thoroughly explored in Phase 2 of the study and will be further elaborated upon in the subsequent discussion.
A subset comprising 29% of the questionnaire respondents consented to partake in the subsequent phase of the study. Subsequently, eleven participants were extended invitations for individual interviews via email, which were carried out through Skype video calls. The interactions were documented using a combination of aTube Catcher for video recording and an audio recorder device as a supplementary tool.
Following the completion of the interviews, transcription was carried out using ELAN, a software designed for audio and video transcription. The data analysis process adhered to a six-step methodology for content analysis as outlined by Huckin (2004). This involved defining the units of analysis and tabulating the data for interpretation. With a substantial amount of transcribed data exceeding eight hours, the utilization of AntCon, a text analysis software, was deemed necessary to streamline and enhance the analytical process.
Each interview was structured into two distinct parts. The initial segment, Part 1, adhered to the Gordon and Dawes (2005) array protocol, delving into the beliefs, strategies, and external behaviors of the participants. This approach aimed to unravel the underlying structure of their experiences in the realm of writing and publishing papers in high-impact journals within the field. The questions posed during this phase were meticulously crafted to explore a range of pertinent issues, shedding light on the intricacies of their processes and decision-making.
The notion of publishable articles in high-impact computer science journals is a crucial aspect of academic research. These journals serve as platforms for disseminating cutting-edge research findings, innovative methodologies, and significant contributions to the field. The standards for publication in such journals are typically rigorous, requiring originality, methodological soundness, and relevance to the broader scientific community. Authors are expected to adhere to specific formatting guidelines, citation styles, and ethical considerations to ensure the quality and integrity of their work. The publication of research in high-impact journals not only enhances the visibility and credibility of the authors but also contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field of computer science. Researchers strive to publish their work in these prestigious outlets to reach a wider audience, receive feedback from peers, and make a lasting impact on the academic community.
(ii) The requisite knowledge and skills essential for the creation of such a paper.
The challenges and constraints encountered by Brazilian computer scientists in the production and publication of research articles, along with potential strategies for addressing these obstacles, are the focal points of this investigation.
(iv) The evidence presented in the papers aligns with the anticipated criteria for publication.
The motivation for publishing in high-impact journals within the field is a crucial aspect that researchers often consider. Researchers are driven by the desire to reach a wider audience, gain recognition within their academic community, and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in their respective fields. Publishing in high-impact journals not only enhances the visibility of their work but also increases their chances of receiving citations, which are important for career progression and funding opportunities. Additionally, the prestige associated with publishing in renowned journals can boost the researcher's reputation and credibility among peers and potential collaborators. Overall, the motivation for publishing in high-impact journals is multifaceted, encompassing both personal and professional aspirations that drive researchers to strive for excellence in their scholarly endeavors.
The questions were structured into an array (Figure 2), adapted from Gordon and Dawes (2015), and filled in with the participants' answers using Microsoft Word. Interviewees were able to access the array through Skype's screen sharing tool, allowing them to actively participate in the data gathering process, as well as follow and correct the researcher's interpretation of their answers. This method adopts a second-person perspective, with the researcher acting as a mediator to help participants access their subjective experiences through questioning (Keranen et al., 2012). Furthermore, it fosters a deeper involvement of both the researcher and participant with the data, as they are jointly responsible for the information presented.
Part 2 of the study involved a standard semi-structured interview format. The participants were provided with data derived from the questionnaire analysis, focusing on contextual factors like sexism, xenophobia, social and academic bias, as identified by the 38 respondents. These factors were believed to potentially impact the publication of academic papers and the characteristics of Brazilian computer scientists who have published in peer-reviewed journals. Subsequently, participants were prompted to offer their interpretations of these findings, as outlined in Vieira (2019b).
The utilization of ICT in Phase 2 proved to be significant in exploring critical issues remotely. Initially, it facilitated the continuation of research practices commonly seen in face-to-face interviews, such as audio and video recording, through the abundance of freely available software online. Additionally, screen sharing with participants in Part 1 played a pivotal role in ensuring a second-person perspective for data collection; this method also proved to be more effective than using a printed version. By displaying the array on the screen, participants could clearly follow the data input by the researcher and provide immediate comments or corrections without the need to erase anything on paper. Consequently, the researcher concluded the interview with the data already tabulated in a digital format, ready for analysis.
In addition to facilitating the researcher's access to participants located in various regions of Brazil and abroad, conducting interviews online also provided the participants with the flexibility to be interviewed at their preferred time and location. These advantages of utilizing ICT in the contextual TSA not only aided in achieving the specificity required by Needs Analysis, as discussed in the preceding subsection, but also ensured adherence to the critical approach advocated by CEAP pedagogy. Engaging with members of a global community allowed the teacher/researcher to observe and identify beliefs, behaviors, accessibilities, constraints, and power dynamics that may be perpetuated by diverse backgrounds within the research field. Figure 3 illustrates participants' self-assessment of their English proficiency for academic writing, their international academic exposure, and their perceptions regarding the impact of contextual factors on the acceptance of Brazilian computer scientists' papers by high-impact journals, categorized by region.
While over 70% of the interviewees expressed confidence in their English proficiency for academic writing and 65% had prior international academic exposure, the participant from northern Brazil reported a poor evaluation of his English writing skills and a lack of international experience. This disparity could stem from various factors, including personal circumstances. One significant aspect to consider is the unequal allocation of educational resources by the government across different regions of Brazil.
The website Terra (n.d.), drawing on data from the National Institute for Educational Studies and Research "Anísio Teixeira" (INEP), revealed that the Amazon, a northern state in Brazil, allocated R$ 3,075.89 annually per student, whereas Santa Catarina, a southern state, invested R$ 6,829.52. Given the complexity of the education system, it is not feasible to assert that students from the North are inherently less prepared for international academic writing compared to their counterparts from the South solely based on the differing levels of public education funding they receive. However, contextual factors such as economic and political conditions must be taken into account in the needs analysis for CEAP courses as they significantly influence educational practices. This paper demonstrates that ICT can assist teachers and course developers in remotely examining how these factors impact specific educational environments.
In this regard, Figure 3 data reveal significant disparities among participants from various countries/regions regarding their perceptions of contextual factors that could impact the publication process of high-impact computer science journals. For instance, 75% of Brazilians in the South viewed co-authoring with a renowned researcher as a significant influence, while half of those in the South and Northeast believed that researchers' academic credentials affect paper acceptance. In the Southeast, interviewees considered four out of five contextual factors as influential in the publication process, contrasting with participants abroad who only acknowledged two factors.
The information gathered was crucial in shaping tasks aimed at enhancing the preparedness of the target audience, consisting of computer science graduate students from various regions in Brazil, to navigate the diverse contextual challenges prevalent in academia. These tasks were designed to equip students with the skills to address and surmount obstacles, as well as to devise innovative solutions that could potentially revolutionize research methodologies and foster community development. Furthermore, the integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the contextually situated Technological Situated Activity (TSA) had a profound impact on praxis. By enabling the exploration of a global community, the teacher/researcher gained valuable insights that informed her instructional strategies. This aspect will be further explored in the subsequent subsection.
At the conclusion of the interview, each participant was requested to provide the teacher/researcher with a review they had received for papers submitted to a high-impact journal in computer science, whether accepted or rejected. A total of 17 texts were sent via email, encompassing 12 distinct publishing experiences. Among these, four reviews advised against acceptance of the paper, while the remaining eight endorsed its acceptance. In order to analyze the data, Huckin's (2004) content analysis methodology was employed, alongside the utilization of AntConc to extract specific information from the texts.
Conducting this phase was only achievable through the utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The essence of research article reviews inherently involves a digital component. In contemporary times, academic publishing procedures are predominantly carried out online, leading to all interactions between editors, authors, referees, and editorial boards occurring through internet platforms. Accessing these materials necessitates researchers to employ ICT, not solely due to the geographical separation of authors, but also because the texts themselves are in digital form.
Access to this material significantly enhanced the research's reliability by providing an additional perspective on the publication process of high-impact journals: that of the referees. Through the analysis of reviews, the study identified the prevalent issues that referees use to either reject or recommend a paper for publication. Table 3 offers a comprehensive summary of how frequently referees criticized or acknowledged the authors' work across the various units of analysis examined.
Referees frequently addressed contextual issues pertaining to the research's execution, including aspects like "originality," "contribution to existing knowledge," and "impact of results," which influenced their decisions to either reject the paper (90%) or recommend its publication (50–63%). Textual concerns regarding the presentation and organization of information, such as the "quality of cited work," "clarity of the methodology," and "accuracy of data analysis," were the second most commonly cited points, with referees either critiquing them (60-63%) or highlighting the authors' commendable efforts (57–60%). Linguistic issues like "syntax," "spelling," and "coherence" were less frequently mentioned, with formatting and publishing-related matters following suit in terms of referee feedback.
This information aided the teacher/researcher in comprehending the hierarchy of relevance of each examined factor (contextual, textual, linguistic, etc.) in relation to the acceptance/rejection of papers by Brazilian computer scientists in high-impact journals. Table 3 illustrates that while proficiency in English writing is considered in referees' evaluations, it does not serve as the sole determinant for recommending publication. Instead, the emphasis lies on the validity and originality of the research, followed by the clarity, organization, and accuracy of information presented in the manuscript. Following the evaluation of the students' current status, the teacher/researcher could strategize an appropriate syllabus and develop effective tasks to meet the students' requirements (cf. Vieira, 2019a).
This study aims to explore the advantages of employing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in conducting a contextual Textual Systemic Analysis (TSA) remotely. Findings indicate that this utilization proves crucial for two primary reasons: firstly, it streamlines data analysis by leveraging various computer applications like Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and AntConc. Secondly, it allows researchers to collect data from a distance while upholding the specificity, praxis, and critical engagement advocated by CEAP pedagogy.
The global investigation of the target discourse community was conducted to cater to the specific requirements of the audience, comprising students from various regions in Brazil who seek to disseminate their research findings to a global audience. The diverse backgrounds of these students have resulted in varied experiences with academic literacy and publishing practices, making it essential to explore these differences remotely. This approach not only broadens the contextual understanding of the target discourse community but also streamlines the course preparation process by saving both time and resources.
In terms of critique, ICT has enabled the exploration of various aspects, including the perceptions and convictions held by participants within this worldwide discourse community regarding research practices and dissemination in the field of computer science. The findings have facilitated the comprehension of the underlying reasons for the identified contextual nuances and their impact on the interaction of Brazilian researchers with their international counterparts.
This investigation, utilizing ICT tools and instruments, provided valuable insights to the teacher/researcher regarding the selection and organization of course content in the syllabus, based on their significance in manuscript analysis by referees. Consequently, it supported the teacher/researcher's praxis by offering pertinent information that was utilized in the planning, organization, and execution of teaching practices (Vieira, 2019a). The utilization of ICT, as demonstrated in this study, enables a more comprehensive contextual exploration of the TSA, extending beyond local boundaries to engage not only a local but also a global community that students must interact with during their academic endeavors.
In Brazil, a vast developing nation in the early stages of internationalizing its universities and lacking sufficient academic writing courses to support students, online EAP/CEAP courses offer a crucial avenue for budding researchers to enhance their academic writing abilities. Nevertheless, crafting such courses poses a significant challenge for educators and curriculum developers, given the diverse social, cultural, ideological, and economic disparities across the country. To uphold the advocated specificity of ESP pedagogy, an in-depth analysis of the present and target situations must delve into contextual factors related to discursive practices within the respective regions of the students. Conducting such on-site investigations can be both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Therefore, remote contextual TSA emerges as the optimal solution to ensure precision, criticality, and practicality in course design that effectively caters to students' needs and desires with minimal investments, made feasible through the utilization of ICT.
It is crucial to acknowledge that while ICT facilitates the enhancement of contextual TSA to engage with a global discourse community, its accessibility may be limited in regions and countries where educators and curriculum developers lack the necessary resources. Regrettably, the pursuit of scientific equity advocated by CEAP is contingent upon various external factors beyond the control of instructors. Nevertheless, it is imperative for ESP educators and professionals to continue exploring avenues to increase access for marginalized groups through language programs. As highlighted by Bazerman et al. (2009, pp. XIV), the advancement of communicative competence for all individuals, along with providing access to influential genres, is fundamentally a question of societal capability and fairness.
