The study titled "Leaf anatomy and photosynthetic parameters of Vellozia squamata Pohl (Velloziaceae) grown under different light intensities along in vitro cultivation" investigates the photosynthetic parameters and leaf anatomy of Vellozia squamata Pohl plants at various stages of in vitro production, with comparisons made to wild plants as a control. The anatomical analysis focused on the middle portion of the leaf, while photosynthetic curves were generated using an infra-red gas analyzer. Results indicated that in vitro plantlets exhibited thinner and less developed leaves compared to wild plants, with acclimatized plants displaying intermediate characteristics. Despite similar physiological patterns, in vitro plantlets were unable to perform net carbon absorption, and young seedlings in the garden exhibited a lower maximal net carbon assimilation rate than wild plants. The findings suggest that light intensity during the in vitro phase should be carefully adjusted to optimize seedling production.
Plants belonging to the genus Vellozia (Velloziaceae) are predominantly found in the African and South American savannahs, particularly in open vegetations like rupestrian fields or Cerrado stricto sensu (Ayensu 1969, Coetzee 1974, Mello-Silva & Menezes 1999, Batista 2016). Known for their remarkable resilience to fire and drought (Owoseye & Sanford 1972), these plants exhibit stems with the capacity to absorb water (Oliveira et al. 2005). Additionally, they are known to produce resins and various secondary metabolites with medicinal properties (Quintao et al. 2013), some of which have shown potential in inhibiting snake venom (Tribuiani et al. 2014). Certain species have also been utilized for ornamental purposes, likely due to their large, showy flowers and distinctive architectural features (Souza 2005). However, the continued extractivism and expansion of crop cultures pose a significant threat to the survival of these plants.
The genus Vellozia's plants are known for producing a significant quantity of small seeds that are dispersed by wind, exhibiting resilience to high temperatures and displaying rapid and high germination rates (Menezes 1977, Oliveira et al. 1991, Garcia & Diniz 2003, Palhares 2004, Garcia et al. 2007, Jacobi & Sarto 2007, Mota & Garcia 2013, Vieira et al. 2017). However, Alves (1994) noted that the growth rate of Vellozia species is notably slow, ranging from approximately 0.5 to 2.0 cm per year, with scarce young plants observed in the field despite their prevalence in the Campo Rupestre. The plants reaching heights of 1.80 to 3.30 m are actually centenarians, indicating that while they inhabit open fields, they are not pioneer species but rather establish themselves later in the ecosystem, classifying them as climax plants (Alves 1994).
Vellozia squamata Pohl, also known as Vellozia flavicans Mart ex Schult (Smith & Ayensu, 1974), is a prevalent species found in the Cerrado region of central Brazil (Flora do Brasil, 2020). Attempts to obtain seedlings from the seeds of this species were unsuccessful, primarily due to a high mortality rate among the young plants (Neto, 2009), a phenomenon observed in other Vellozia species as well (Alves, 1994). Similarly, efforts to produce seedlings through stem cuttings also proved to be unsuccessful (Neto, 2009).
Borges (2015) documented a limited success in the micropropagation of V. sincorana, while Neto (2009) successfully micropropagated V. squamata. A portion of the micropropagated V. squamata specimens were transplanted into gardens and have been thriving for over ten years, growing to approximately 20 cm in height (see figure 5 e, C.E.S. Silveira, unpublished data). This suggests that the in vitro propagation protocol for Vellozia squamata has effectively addressed unidentified factors that typically result in significant seedling loss when propagated through seeds.
The transition from the in vitro phase to the rooting phase has posed a significant challenge in seedling production, as seedlings initially grown heterotrophically under low light intensities must adapt to becoming autotrophic upon transplantation (Kaur, 2015). Neto's protocol (2009) reports a loss of approximately 55% of seedlings during this critical phase, but once successfully navigated, the survival rate increases substantially to around 95%, enabling successful cultivation in greenhouse conditions and eventual outdoor planting. In contrast, the micropropagation protocol for the Cerrado species Jacaranda ulei Bureau & K. Schum. shows a survival rate of approximately 80% during the transition from in vitro to rooting phase (Silveira et al., 2018).
In order to enhance the in vitro protocol, understanding the physiological aspects of wild species and seedlings at various stages is crucial (Kaur, 2015). Among these aspects, leaf photosynthetic curves play a significant role as they indicate the plant's capacity to establish an autotrophic metabolism (Leite et al., 2017).
Numerous studies have delved into the anatomy of Velloziaceae species, with references spanning Ayensu's work in 1968, 1969, and 1974, Menezes in 1977 and 1988, Coetzee in 1974, Ayensu & Skvarla in 1974, Menezes & Semir in 1991, Amaral & Mello-Silva in 2008, and Mello-Silva in 2010, specifically focusing on V. squamata as highlighted by Ayensu in 1974 and Menezes in 1977. However, none of these studies have provided a detailed account of the leaf anatomy of micropropagated plants or their anatomical responses to shading within these species. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of any anatomical reports pertaining to Vellozia species cultivated in vitro. Consequently, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the influence of in vitro micropropagation conditions on the photosynthetic responses and leaf anatomical structure of V. squamata.
Plant material and treatments - The control group comprised five individuals of Vellozia squamata naturally occurring at Parque Ecológico Burle Max, Brasília, DF, Brazil, selected through a convenience sampling method due to their easy accessibility and apparent healthy vigor. For detailed information regarding the climate and soil characteristics, please refer to Bucci et al. (2006). Voucher specimens were duly deposited at the herbarium UB under the reference numbers UB0028356 and UB0028358. Seeds were collected, germinated, and the resulting plantlets were subsequently sectioned and subjected to the micropropagation protocol outlined by Neto (2009). The key features of this protocol in the context of the current study included: a) plantlets cultured in a growth medium (Murashige-Skoog medium supplemented with sucrose and plant growth regulators kinetin, indol-butyric acid, and gibberellin); b) seedlings undergoing acclimatization within a greenhouse environment, housed in pots filled with soil; c) cultivation outdoors, in garden settings. Consequently, the experimental treatments encompassed: a) plantlets growing in a culture medium under photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 32 µmol m-2 s-1, a photoperiod of 12/12 hours, and a controlled temperature of 27 ± 2 °C; b) rooted seedlings within the greenhouse, positioned under partial shade with a maximum PAR of 412 µmol m-2 s-1, as determined by a portable refractometer from Apogee Instruments®; c) plants derived from micropropagation and nurtured in an external garden, within treated and fertilized soil, exposed to the natural environmental conditions of the Cerrado region (characterized by an annual cycle of drought and rainfall). The indigenous wild plants served as the control group for this study.
Leaf anatomy analysis involved transverse sections of the middle third of three fully developed leaves from each experimental group. These fresh sections were preserved in FAA70 under vacuum, dehydrated using an ethanolic series, embedded in Leica® resin, and stained with toluidine blue or safranine plus Astra blue, following the methods outlined by Johansen (1940) and Kraus & Arduin (1997). Subsequently, the slides were sealed with colorless glass varnish as per the protocol described by Paiva et al. (2006).
Light response curves were generated by analyzing two leaves per plant from five plants for each treatment, resulting in a total of 10 measurements. These curves depicted the relationship between light intensity and net carbon absorption (A, µmol CO2 m-2 s-1) and were obtained using a portable infra-red gas analyzer (IRGA) model LI-6400XT by LI-COR Bioscience®. Due to the small size of the leaves from the in vitro plantlets and newly rooted seedlings, adjustments were made to the data based on leaf area to ensure accurate measurements within the leaf chamber of the IRGA.
The IRGA was adjusted to maintain an airflow of 500 µL.s-1 and a reference carbon dioxide level of 400 ppm. The relative air humidity of the reference air was consistent across treatments: control group at 45%, plantlets in vitro at 38%, seedlings in the greenhouse at 36%, and garden conditions at 44%. The air temperatures during measurements were within favorable physiological ranges: control group at 25.5 ± 0.5 °C, in vitro plantlets at 26.0 ± 0.1 °C, seedlings in the greenhouse at 30.4 ± 0.7 °C, and garden conditions at 31.3 ± 1.2 °C. Light intensities ranging from zero to 1,600 µmol m-2 s-1 were pre-selected for the study.
After each change in light intensity, the IRGA was programmed to record the stabilized value. Half of the measurements followed an ascending light intensity curve, while the other half followed a descending curve. Measurements for plants in open conditions (garden and control group - ecological park) were conducted between 09:00 and 10:00 AM during the rainy season. In addition to the A/light curve, gas exchange rates were measured under natural light intensity, approximately 2,200 µmol m-2 s-1.
The transpiration rate was quantified, and water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated as the ratio between the average carbon absorption rate and transpiration rate, following the methodology outlined in Field et al. (1983) and Medrano et al. (2015).
Chlorophyll content was assessed using a chlorophyll meter, specifically the Opti-Sciences CCM-200®, on two leaves per plant from five plants in each experimental group. The device, as per the manufacturer's specifications, does not directly measure chlorophyll content but instead evaluates leaf transmittance of light, presenting the findings in CCI (chlorophyll content index) for comparative purposes across treatments.
Statistical analysis - The light response curves were fitted to the model proposed by Prado & Moraes (1997): Ameas = Amax (1- e-k(PAR-Lcp)), where Ameas represents the carbon assimilation rate under a specific light intensity; Amax denotes the maximum carbon assimilation rate recorded; k is a constant unique to each curve; PAR signifies the given light intensity, and Lcp stands for the light compensation point. Data comparisons were conducted using a Student's T-test and supported by the open-access graph software LibreOffice.
Physiological parameters and light response curves - The physiological parameters are summarized in Table 1, while Figures 1 to 4 depict the light response curves of CO2 absorbance. In both the control group and plants cultivated in the garden, leaves reached approximately 90% of the maximum carbon absorption rate at a light intensity of 900 µmol m-2 s-1. This point was identified as the light saturation point, as most leaves had already reached peak carbon absorption rates. Notably, at light intensities exceeding double this saturation point, the carbon absorption rate remained constant, indicating an absence of photoinhibition (Figures 1, 2, 4). In the open groups, encompassing wild plants and garden plants, carbon absorption rates under natural sunlight (PAR of about 2,000 µmol m-2 s-1) mirrored the maximal rates recorded by the IRGA (maximal PAR of 1,600 µmol m-2 s-1), leading to the grouping of Amax data.
There were distinct variations in the photosynthetic parameters observed among the treatments. Within the in vitro plants, certain leaves exhibited the capacity to assimilate carbon dioxide, particularly evident under light intensities ranging between 100 and 200 µmol m-2 s-1. However, the measurements predominantly reflected respiration values, with the maximum values of A recorded at -0.35± 1.25 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1. As depicted in figure 3, the leaves of the in vitro plantlets displayed a sporadic respiration pattern up to a light intensity of 100 µmol m-2 s-1, beyond which a decline in respiration rates was observed up to 900 µmol m-2 s-1. Subsequently, at light intensities exceeding this threshold, a marginal deterioration in the respiration rate was noted, indicating potential photodamage. Notably, the in vitro plants did not exhibit a discernible light compensation point in this context.
The plants cultivated in the greenhouse were subjected to a peak light intensity of approximately 412 µmol m-2 s-1, slightly below half of the light saturation level observed in the wild (control) plants (see Table 1). Despite exhibiting a lower maximum carbon absorption rate compared to the wild and garden plants, the greenhouse plants displayed a light response curve that conformed to anticipated patterns. Notably, while the light saturation point for these greenhouse plants was around 200 µmol.m-2.s-1, their carbon absorption rate remained consistent even under higher light intensities, indicating an absence of photoinhibition (refer to Figure 2).
The leaf transpiration rates were maintained consistently during the measurements for the light response curves, although they did vary among the experimental groups. The wild plants exhibited the highest transpiration rates, with the in vitro plants following closely behind. The plants cultivated in the greenhouse and garden displayed comparable transpiration rates, both lower than those of the wild plants. Consequently, the instantaneous water use efficiency was greater in the young plants grown in the garden compared to the mature wild plants, as indicated in Table 1.
The chlorophyll content varied among the plants in different growth conditions, with plants in the greenhouse exhibiting slightly higher levels compared to those grown in vitro, yet significantly lower than those in the garden (Table 1). Notably, the garden plants displayed a higher chlorophyll content than the greenhouse plants but lower than the wild plants, with leaves exhibiting a lighter green hue that did not indicate chlorosis, as the color intensity remained consistent (Figure 5). Regarding leaf anatomy, the anatomical analysis revealed the impact of environmental and growth conditions on the structure of V. squamata leaves (Figure 6). Across all leaves, the epidermis appeared as a single layer without trichomes. Leaves from field-grown plants (control group) and those in garden conditions (Figures 6a, f) displayed a smooth abaxial surface and a corrugated adaxial surface. In contrast, leaves from in vitro plantlets and greenhouse-acclimatizing plants (Figures 6d, e) lacked visible epidermal ornamentation.
In both the control group and the garden group, the external periclinal cell wall and cuticle were indistinguishable from each other (Figures 6a, b, f), collectively referred to as the outer layer of epidermal cells. Notably, in plants exposed to abundant sunlight, this outer layer was significantly thicker (Figures 6a-c) compared to those in different growth conditions (Figures 6d-e). However, in plants subjected to greenhouse conditions, the epidermis exhibited an intermediate thickness (Figure 6e).
In terms of stomata disposition, V. squamata leaves exhibited amphistomatic characteristics, with stomata predominantly located in crypts on the abaxial face, extending to approximately a quarter of the leaf thickness (Figure 6a). These attributes were more pronounced in the control group and garden plants. Notably, in vitro plantlets displayed rudimentary stomata without the development of stomatal crypts (Figure 6d). Furthermore, plants undergoing greenhouse cultivation showed smaller and shallower crypts (Figure 6e) compared to field plants (control group) with fully developed stomata (Figure 6a).
The leaf mesophyll of plants in the control group exhibited a dorsiventral structure, consisting of 21-25 parenchyma layers with elongated cells on the adaxial side that gradually decreased in height towards the abaxial side, resulting in a rounded shape (Figure 6a, f). Both in vitro and greenhouse plants also displayed a dorsiventral mesophyll (Figures 6d-e), albeit with a less dense cell arrangement compared to mature control leaves (Figures 6a, f). Furthermore, in all plant types (greenhouse, garden, and control), the mesophyll on each leaf face contained subepidermal fiber fascicles, with a higher abundance observed in control and garden plants (Figures 6a, f). Notably, these fiber fascicles were absent in leaves from in vitro grown plants (Figure 6d).
The parallelodromous leaf veins observed in the control plants, both in the garden and greenhouse settings, exhibited a distinct vascular bundle sheath, as depicted in figures 6a, e-f. Notably, these bundle sheaths displayed extensions on the adaxial side, featuring large colorless palisade cells known as aquiferous cells, as illustrated in figures 6a, e-f. This parenchyma served to connect the bundle sheath to subepidermal fiber fascicles on the adaxial epidermis, as shown in figures 6a, e-f. On the abaxial epidermal surface, the sheath was found to be in direct contact with the epidermis, as depicted in figures 6a, e-f. In contrast, leaves from in vitro plants exhibited bundle sheaths without any extensions, as shown in figure 6d.
The vascular bundles exhibited a high degree of fibrousness, characterized by two phloem strands positioned laterally to the xylem (Figures 6a, e-f). Notably, this characteristic was less prominent in leaves derived from in vitro plants (Figure 6d). The vascular fibres displayed thick lignified cell walls (Figures 6a, e-f) and were found in varying quantities across different plant growth conditions: more abundant in control plants, moderately present in greenhouse plants, and sparsely distributed in in vitro plants (Figures 6a, e-f).
The Vellozia species cultivated in open fields exhibit a robust photodissipating mechanism, crucial for shielding the leaves from the harsh environmental conditions of the Cerrado, characterized by a dry season coupled with intense solar radiation. Tocotrienols, potent antioxidant compounds belonging to the vitamin E complex primarily present in seeds, have been detected in the leaves of V. gigantea (Morales et al., 2014, 2015). Consequently, while these plants effectively dissipate surplus light, they also require substantial light intensities for the complete maturation of their photosynthetic apparatus and leaf architecture.
The impact of light intensity on photosynthetic processes in Vellozia leaves has predominantly been assessed through the electron transport rate. In various Vellozia species, this rate reaches its peak under photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intensities of approximately 2,100 µmol.m-2.s-1, aligning closely with the typical values observed in the Cerrado region, ranging from around 1,800 to 2,200 µmol.m-2.s-1 at midday (Lüttge et al., 2007). By way of comparison, the maximum electron transport rate of Smilax goyazana, a prevalent shrub in the Cerrado, is achieved at roughly half the maximum PAR level of the surrounding environment (Palhares et al., 2011).
The leaves from plants grown under in vitro conditions exhibit typical effects of shading, as evidenced by studies conducted by Barboza et al. (2006), Chaari-Rkhis et al. (2015), and Ziv & Chen (2008), showcasing poorly developed anatomical structures, particularly stomata. Additionally, shaded leaves display certain ultrastructural characteristics such as limited cytoplasmic content, flattened chloroplasts with irregularly arranged internal membrane systems, and a higher proportion of intercellular spaces, as highlighted in research by Wetzstein & Sommer (1982) and Chirinéa et al. (2012). This study further delves into these features, revealing qualitative alterations like the absence of aquiferous cells, subepidermal sclerenchyma fascicles, and stomatal crypts.
The depth of the stomatal crypts varied according to the growth conditions observed in this study. Specifically, the stomatal crypts were found to be deeper in leaves of plants grown in field and garden settings compared to those in greenhouse environments, with plants grown in vitro showing a complete absence of these structures. Interestingly, the presence of stomatal crypts was already evident in the young leaves of field plants, as depicted in figure 6d. This observation challenges the notion that the presence of leaf crypts is solely a genetic trait imposed by V. squamata.
Leaves from in vitro plants of V. squamata exhibited distinct structural variations compared to plants undergoing acclimatization. These differences included the absence of subepidermal fibers, a more delicate dorsiventral mesophyll, an undifferentiated bundle sheath extension, a reduced number of vascular system fibers, and a lack of aquiferous parenchyma. Notably, while aquiferous tissue is retained in leaves from pineapple (Ananas comosus L.) cultivated in vitro as reported by Barboza et al. (2006), the qualitative changes observed in V. squamata, particularly the absence of stomatal crypts and subepidermal fibers, are atypical.
The observed disparities can be attributed directly to the low light levels and potentially the high humidity present in the in vitro environment. Anatomical findings suggest that V. squamata cultivated in vitro necessitates a more extended and meticulously executed acclimatization procedure.
Anatomical immaturity is closely associated with the immaturity of the photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, the in vitro plantlets exhibit an inability to absorb net carbon, coupled with a high leaf transpiration rate, indicating dysfunctional stomata. While a specific light intensity may suffice for the optimal development of leaves in one species, it may prove inadequate for others. For instance, when compared to other Cerrado species grown in vitro, Lippia rotundifolia demonstrates leaf development capable of carbon absorption under a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 78 µmol m-2 s-1 (Hsie et al., 2019), whereas Hanconia speciosa and Hyptis marrubioides exhibit carbon absorption under a PAR of 50 µmol m-2 s-1 (Costa et al., 2014).
In the realm of crop cultures, the production of in vitro seedlings of strawberry (Grout & Millan, 1985) and grape (Amancio et al., 1999) has been studied. It has been observed that growth under a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 90 µmol m-2 s-1 results in the development of leaves capable of photosynthesis, with a light saturation point around 450 µmol m-2 s-1. However, in V. squamata, even under maximal PAR of 412 µmol m-2 s-1, shade effects were still evident. Notably, in the Cerrado species Pouteria gardneriana, significant differences in the structural development of leaves were observed when grown under PAR levels ranging from 75 to 150 µmol m-2 s-1. It is worth mentioning that the authors did not provide data on wild plants as a control in their study (Leite et al., 2017).
The data presented here indicates that chlorophyll formation occurs even under low PAR intensities, although the photosynthetic capacity is contingent upon the development of other elements that necessitate higher light intensities. As noted by Leite et al. (2017), in Pouteria gardneriana, chlorophyll fluorescence remained relatively consistent across plantlets exposed to varying PAR intensities, while the anatomical structure exhibited greater development under higher light levels. In the case of grape leaves, those grown under very low PAR intensities (e.g., 20 µmol m-2 s-1) were observed to release oxygen, suggesting the photosynthetic apparatus's ability to conduct water photolysis, yet they were unable to effectively absorb carbon dioxide (Amancio et al., 1999).
In the current experiment, direct measurement of chlorophyll content was not conducted. However, the comparison revealed that greenhouse plants, partially shaded, exhibited approximately double the chlorophyll content (2.99 CCI) compared to in vitro plantlets (1.37 CCI) but slightly less than half of the chlorophyll content of plants in the open garden (8.70 CCI). Nevertheless, all experimental groups displayed significantly lower chlorophyll levels in comparison to wild plants (24.6 CCI). The increase in Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) intensity from in vitro to garden conditions could potentially account for these observed differences. Yet, the reason behind young garden plants exhibiting a chlorophyll content approximately one third of that in wild plants remains unclear. Notably, the anatomical structure of garden-grown plant leaves closely resembled those in the fields, albeit with a slightly reduced thickness. Consequently, exposure to abundant sunlight led to anatomically mature leaves, yet from a photosynthetic perspective, they displayed characteristics indicative of relative immaturity.
Furthermore, the maximum carbon absorption rate of the plants in the garden exceeded that of the greenhouse plants by approximately 45%, yet fell short by about 70% compared to the wild plants. Despite the presence of statistically significant differences among the experimental groups, certain measurements of the maximum carbon absorption rate of garden plants closely resembled those of greenhouse plants. Locating young Vellozia squamata plants in the field for comparison purposes proved challenging. The distinction between the photosynthetic performance of younger plants as a function of their age or as a consequence of the micropropagation protocol remains unclear. Durkovic et al. (2016) highlighted the potential impact of seedling acquisition methods on leaf development, resulting in leaves with varying photosynthetic parameters.
In terms of leaf transpiration rates, differences were observed between the leaves of plants grown in the garden or inside the greenhouse compared to wild plants, indicating that the age of the plant plays a role in influencing leaf physiological parameters. V. squamata adult wild plants exhibited lower water use efficiency compared to other Cerrado species (Palhares et al., 2010). Younger plants from the garden and greenhouse displayed a reduced carbon assimilation rate but improved water use efficiency. Notably, in vitro plantlets generally exhibited higher transpiration rates. These plantlets typically have underdeveloped epidermis and stomata, leading to weak control over transpiration, which poses a challenge during the transition from in vitro to greenhouse growth (Van Huylenbroeck et al., 1998; Amancio et al., 1999; Kaur, 2015).
According to Van Huylenbroeck et al. (1998) and Kaur (2015), in vitro propagated plants can be categorized into two functional groups based on their transition from in vitro to greenhouse phases: plants with photosynthetically incapable leaves, where the leaves primarily function as storage organs for sprouting, and those with photosynthetically active leaves that exhibit at least partial development. In the latter group, it is commonly observed that during the initial days post-transplantation, there is a distinct acute stress response characterized by high rates of transpiration and respiration, along with a potential decrease in chlorophyll content (known as photobleaching; Van Huylenbroeck et al., 1998; Kaur, 2015).
Following the initial period, not only do the leaves become photosynthetically active, but they also often undergo anatomical changes, such as cellular growth leading to a reduction in stomatal density and the differentiation of hairs (Van Huylenbroeck et al., 1998; Kaur, 2015). However, in both functional groups, the leaves shaded in vitro are unable to tolerate the environmental light intensities. Nonetheless, the newer leaves that develop under these intermediary light conditions tend to exhibit a light compensation point and a light saturation point similar to those of wild plants. Additionally, they demonstrate a more developed photo-dissipating apparatus (Van Huylenbroeck et al., 1998; Kaur, 2015).
The carbon assimilation rates observed in Vellozia squamata are comparatively low when contrasted with other species in the Cerrado (Palhares et al., 2010). Nogueira et al. (2004) suggest that these rates align more closely with those of secondary rather than pioneer plants. Despite the species' significant seed production and high germination rates, the establishment of Vellozia squamata is intricately linked to complex ecological interactions. This underscores the critical importance of conserving this species in its natural habitat, as even the seedlings exhibit notably slow growth rates.
In conclusion, enhancing protocols involves comparing the responses of wild and in vitro plants. The data provided can aid in fine-tuning the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intensity to yield more robust seedlings with potentially increased survival rates during the transition from in vitro to greenhouse environments. Consequently, developing technology for cultivating seedlings of Cerrado species is a multifaceted endeavor crucial for their preservation and cultivation.
