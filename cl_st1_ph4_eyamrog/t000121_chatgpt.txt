This study examined the relationship between meta-concerns and symptoms of anxiety and depression during the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil. A total of 2,042 participants, ranging in age from 18 to 78 years, completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Meta-Worry Questionnaire online. Logistic Regression models were employed to assess the impact of various factors on the manifestation of anxiety and depression symptoms. Findings indicated that being younger, lacking a stable income, experiencing physical illness, and displaying high levels of meta-worries were associated with an increased likelihood of exhibiting symptoms. The study underscores the importance of providing psychological support to address mental health challenges during the COVID-19 crisis, as early indicators of susceptibility to mental health issues were identified in the Brazilian population at the onset of the pandemic.
The International Health Regulations (World Health Organization, 2005, p. 9) define a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as an exceptional event that poses a public health risk to other countries through the international spread of diseases and may necessitate a coordinated international response. Recognized as the highest level of alert by the WHO, PHEICs have been declared only on rare occasions, such as during the H1N1 pandemic (2009), the global spread of the poliovirus (2014), the Ebola outbreaks (2014 and 2018), and the surge in cases of microcephaly and congenital malformations linked to the Zika virus (2016) (Pan-American Health Organization & World Health Organization, 2020).
The world is currently grappling with the sixth Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the emergence of the novel human coronavirus (PAHO & WHO, 2020). Among the seven known human coronaviruses, three have been identified as capable of causing severe respiratory tract infections: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the latest addition, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic (PAHO & WHO, 2020). As of early November 2020, COVID-19 had resulted in over one million deaths (as of 02/11: 1,204,003), prompting countries worldwide to implement isolation and social distancing measures to curb its spread and mitigate its impact, while concurrently exploring effective preventive and therapeutic strategies (Faro et al., 2020; PAHO & WHO, 2020).
Widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, have been linked to psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness. The majority of existing studies have been conducted in China, the initial epicenter of the pandemic at the time of writing, and have primarily focused on anxiety disorders like common mental disorder (CMD) in relation to COVID-19 occurrences across various countries (Huang & Zhao, 2020). Previous research on events akin to COVID-19, such as MERS-COV and SARS-COV, has indicated that measures aimed at isolating and restricting the movement of individuals can significantly impact mental health, leading to adverse psychological outcomes like CMD (Brooks et al., 2020; Jiloha, 2020). Symptoms such as stress, irritability, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, suicide attempts, and self-injurious behaviors are frequently observed in both healthcare professionals and the general population during such stressful situations, where concerns about the uncertain future, fear of contagion and death are prevalent (Brooks et al., 2020; Faro et al., 2020). A study involving 1210 participants revealed that higher levels of anxiety and depression were associated with women, students, individuals exhibiting COVID-19-like symptoms, and those with negative health perceptions, while access to information and engagement in preventive measures like handwashing appeared to mitigate these effects (Wang et al., 2020).
Individuals suspected of having COVID-19 exhibited a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms and a diminished quality of life compared to those not afflicted by the disease (Nguyen et al., 2020). Anxiety, a complex construct, is underpinned by a tripartite framework encompassing worry, fear, and uncertainty, all of which are prevalent in the current global health crisis (Barari et al., 2020; Dong & Bouey, 2020; Faro et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2020). The prevailing circumstances are characterized by pervasive uncertainty surrounding the development of an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19, coupled with apprehensions about the conclusion of the pandemic. Concurrently, individuals grapple with fears of contracting the virus, facing mortality either personally or within their social circles, and enduring the effects of social isolation. Lastly, anxiety is compounded by concerns about the anticipated challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic.
In the realm of worry, metacognitive processes play a crucial role as they contribute to the correction, assessment, and regulation of thoughts, closely linked to the development and persistence of psychological disorders (Dinis & Gouveia, 2011). Elevated levels of worry can potentially trigger various psychiatric symptoms, often associated with prevalent mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, exposure to media information has the potential to evoke both unrealistic optimism and negative thoughts, exacerbating distorted health predictions and heightened worrying (Faro et al., 2020). Research exploring the relationship between worry and mental well-being has consistently demonstrated a correlation between excessive worrying and outcomes related to anxiety and depression (Huang & Zhao, 2020; Topper, Emmelkamp, Watkins, & Ehring, 2017).
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is instilling fear, uncertainty, and concern, necessitating a prompt comprehension of its impact on individuals' health and psychological well-being. Notably, in Brazil, there is a dearth of information regarding the psychological repercussions and mental health of the general populace during the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020 (Duarte, Santo, Lima, Giordani, & Trentini, in press). This knowledge gap is crucial given the unprecedented scale of the current outbreak, underscoring the importance of grasping how this crisis has influenced the mental health of the population at the onset of social distancing and quarantine measures. Insights gleaned from this early period could inform more effective preventive measures and enhance the overall healthcare response throughout the crisis.
This study sought to examine the relationships between meta-worry and symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection took place at the onset of social isolation and quarantine recommendations for suspected and confirmed cases in Brazil in March 2020. Initially, the prevalence of anxious and depressive symptoms was determined, followed by the calculation of the average meta-worry score. Subsequently, a predictive model was employed to assess how meta-worry contributes to the variance in anxiety and depression symptoms within the population.
A total of 2042 Brazilian participants, encompassing both genders and ranging in age from 18 to 78 years, were involved in the late March 2020 study. The majority of the sample hailed from the Northeast region, constituting 80% (n = 1634), with 14.1% (n = 288) residing in the Southeast, and 5.9% (n = 120) located in other parts of the country. Notably, within the Northeast region, 74.6% of individuals (n = 1219) were based in Sergipe. The sampling methodology employed was non-probabilistic, utilizing convenience sampling and online data collection. The sole inclusion criterion stipulated was a minimum age of 18 years.
In the State of Sergipe, which comprises the majority of the sample, the government issued a decree declaring a public health emergency on March 17. In the Southeast region, which accounted for the second largest portion of the sample, the state of São Paulo declared the emergency on March 20, Minas Gerais on March 15, Rio de Janeiro on March 16, and Espírito Santo on March 17. In other regions, the dates for declaring the public health emergency ranged from March 16 to 19.
A sociodemographic questionnaire was employed, encompassing variables such as sex (male or female), age (in years), skin color (white, black, or brown; excluding yellow and indigenous due to their limited representation in the sample), education level (up to high school or higher education), living arrangement (alone or with others), presence of chronic diseases (absent or present), income status (with or without a stable income), self-reported health perception (ill or healthy), as well as details regarding municipality and state of residence.
The levels of worry were evaluated utilizing the Meta-Worry Questionnaire (MWQ) established by Wells (2005). The Portuguese iteration of the MWQ was adapted and validated by Dinis and Gouveia (2011), demonstrating strong internal consistency (α = 0.89). Comprising seven items in a question format, the instrument is divided into two scales that gauge the frequency of metacognitions concerning worry and the intensity of associated beliefs. For the purposes of this study, only the scale focusing on worry frequency was employed, aligning with the aim of conducting a concise mental health screening and necessitating a compact research tool. Responses are recorded on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from “never” (1) to “always” (4). The total score is calculated by summing the responses across all items, with higher scores indicating a heightened likelihood of dysfunctionality. Notably, the instrument exhibited strong internal consistency in this investigation (Cronbach’s alpha [α] = 0.90).
To identify symptoms of anxiety and depression, we utilized the 4-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), Portuguese edition, developed by Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, and Löwe (2009. The initial study demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.75) for this instrument. The PHQ-4 is a concise screening tool that evaluates the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms experienced in the past two weeks. Responses are recorded on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from "never" (1) to "almost every day" (4). The total score is calculated by summing the responses to items related to anxiety symptoms ("feeling nervous, anxious, or very tense" and "not being able to prevent or control worries") and depression symptoms ("feeling down, depressed, or hopeless" and "little interest or pleasure in activities"). A score of three indicates significant signs of anxiety or depression. In our study, we set a cutoff at a score of three to focus on screening for notable symptomatology of anxiety or depressive disorders. The PHQ-4 demonstrated satisfactory reliability in our research (α = 0.84).
Data collection for this study was carried out through invitations distributed via popular social networking platforms, predominantly Facebook and Instagram. Approval for the research was obtained from CONEP, the National Research Ethics Committee, with the assigned approval number intentionally omitted for confidentiality. The online survey targeted a broad demographic, with participants encouraged to share the survey within their social circles. A Free and Informed Consent Form was prominently displayed at the outset of the questionnaire, ensuring that participation was voluntary. The survey was designed to be brief, with an average completion time of 5 minutes as recorded by the data collection platform.
The data adjustment and analysis procedures were conducted using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 23). Descriptive analyses, including absolute and percentage frequency, mean, and standard deviation, were utilized to obtain the final scores of the instruments. Four Binomial Logistic Regression models employing the Backward LR method were employed to assess the impact of independent variables such as sex, skin color, education, living arrangements, chronic illness status, age (categorized into quartiles of up to 24 years, 25-30 years, 31-39 years, and over 39 years), income, health perception, and meta-worry (dichotomized based on the mean into above the mean and up to the mean) on symptoms of anxiety and depression.
The PHQ-4 screening diagnoses were categorized by combining single or simultaneous diagnoses into four groups: anxiety, depression, just one diagnosis, or both. Each group served as a dependent variable (presence or absence of symptoms) in separate logistic regression models. The evaluation of each model included observing the Omnibus test (expected to be statistically significant), Nagelkerke’s R² (higher values indicating better explained variance), the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (expected to be non-significant), and the model's correct predictive capacity (expected around 70%). Multicollinearity assessment was conducted for all models, revealing no issues in their composition or final solution. Notably, Odds Ratio (OR) values below 1 were converted using the formula 1/OR for standardization purposes. Significance was set at p < 0.05 for all binomial and multinomial regression steps.
The sample comprised 75.9% (n = 1549) female participants and 24.1% (n = 493) male, with a median age of 30 years. Among them, 28.5% (n = 582) were aged up to 24 years, 23.6% (n = 482) were between 25 and 30 years old, 23.1% (n = 472) were between 31 and 39 years old, and 24.8% (n = 506) were over 39. In terms of skin color, 45.5% (n = 929) identified as brown, 44.1% (n = 900) as white, and 10.4% as black (n = 212). The majority of participants (87.7%; n = 1790) did not live alone, sharing their residence with a family member or friend. Education-wise, 82.8% (n = 1691) held a higher education degree (completed or in progress), while 17.2% (n = 351) had education up to a secondary level. In relation to income, 72.6% (n = 1483) reported a steady income, with 27.4% (n = 559) stating otherwise. A significant portion perceived themselves as healthy (81.4%; n = 1662), while 18.3% (n = 373) acknowledged suffering from a chronic illness.
On the meta-worry scale, the participants had a mean score of 12.5 (SD = 4.90), with 41% (n = 837) scoring above the mean and 59.0% (n = 1205) scoring values up to the mean. Regarding anxiety or depression symptoms (cutoff at score three), 36.2% (n = 739) exhibited symptoms suggestive of anxiety, 24.8% (n = 506) showed symptoms suggestive of depression, 42.8% (n = 873) displayed symptoms indicative of just one diagnosis (anxiety or depression), and 18.2% (n = 372) exhibited symptoms of both. In the full sample, 57.2% (n = 1169) of the participants did not demonstrate significant symptoms for anxiety and/or depression.
Four binomial logistic regressions were conducted, one for each of the PHQ-4 outcomes and an additional two for the potential combinations of these outcomes. The results of each model, along with their adjustment indicators, are presented in Table 1, demonstrating satisfactory outcomes with high predictive capacity and explained variance. No issues of multicollinearity were detected among the variables in any of the models. In the initial model concerning anxious symptoms, it was observed that individuals aged up to 24 years exhibited 1.6 times higher odds of experiencing symptoms compared to those aged over 39 years (OR = .6; 1/OR = 1.5). Furthermore, individuals without a stable income were more likely to manifest anxious symptoms than those with a steady income (OR = 1.4), and individuals perceiving themselves as unwell had a higher likelihood of displaying anxiety-related symptoms compared to those perceiving themselves as healthy (OR = 2.1). Notably, the meta-worry variable indicated that individuals scoring above the mean had a 12-fold increased chance of experiencing anxious symptoms in contrast to those scoring at or below the mean (OR = 12.0).
In the analysis concerning depressive symptoms (second model), individuals aged up to 24 exhibited a higher likelihood of experiencing symptoms compared to older age groups. Specifically, in comparison to those aged 25-30, they had 1.6 times higher odds (OR = 0.6; 1/OR = 1.6), while in comparison to individuals aged 31-39, their odds were doubled (OR = 0.5; 1/OR = 2), and in comparison to those over 39, their odds were 2.5 times higher (OR = 0.4; 1/OR = 2.5) of displaying depressive symptoms. Participants who perceived themselves as unwell were 2.5 times more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms than those who perceived themselves as healthy (OR = 2.4). Moreover, individuals who reported living alone had approximately 1.5 times higher odds of experiencing depressive symptoms compared to those who did not live alone (OR = 1.4). In terms of meta-worries, individuals scoring above the mean on the scale displayed roughly 6.5 times higher odds of showing symptoms suggestive of depression than those scoring at or below the mean (OR = 6.6).
In the third model, focusing on the outcome of a single diagnosis (anxious or depressive symptoms), individuals aged up to 24 exhibited 1.5 times higher odds of experiencing one of the symptomatologies compared to those aged between 31 and 39 (OR = 0.7; 1/OR = 1.4), and twice the odds compared to those over 39 (OR = 0.5; 1/OR = 2). In terms of income, individuals without a stable income had higher odds of presenting any of the symptom sets compared to those with a stable income (OR = 1.3), as well as those perceiving themselves as unwell in comparison to those perceiving themselves as healthy (OR = 2.4). Moreover, individuals scoring above the mean on the meta-worry scale were approximately 11.5 times more likely to exhibit symptoms indicative of anxiety or depression than those scoring at or below the mean (OR = 11.4).
In the analysis concerning the co-occurrence of symptoms (fourth model), individuals aged up to 24 years exhibited a twofold higher likelihood of experiencing these symptoms compared to both the 31-39 age group and those over 39 years old (OR = 0.5; 1/OR = 2). Factors such as lacking a stable income and self-perception of being unwell were associated with increased odds of presenting anxious and depressive symptoms in contrast to individuals with a stable income (OR = 1.3) and those perceiving themselves as healthy (OR = 2.4). Moreover, participants scoring above the mean on the meta-worry scale were approximately 13 times more likely to exhibit both sets of symptoms compared to those scoring at or below the mean (OR = 12.7).
The current study sought to investigate the relationship between meta-worry and pronounced symptoms of anxiety and/or depression among the Brazilian population at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, all models yielded favorable results, with a relatively high explained variance of approximately 40% and accurate predictions of cases. Consistency in the explanatory variables was also evident, showing minimal variation across outcomes. The analysis revealed that certain fundamental characteristics, such as age, stable income, health perception, and meta-worry, were predictive of a heightened susceptibility to experiencing anxiety and depression symptoms. Interestingly, living alone emerged as a significant explanatory factor solely for depression.
In our analysis of age, we found that younger individuals exhibited a higher likelihood of experiencing symptoms across all measured outcomes. Across all models examined, individuals aged up to 24 years were particularly susceptible to anxious and/or depressive symptoms at the time of data collection. This susceptibility can be attributed to the relative lack of experience younger individuals have with various psychosocial stressors compared to their older counterparts, with some stressors being exacerbated in the current pandemic context. For instance, younger individuals are often at the early stages of their professional careers, still striving for financial stability, which heightens the risk of unstable or irregular income (Huang & Zhao, 2020; Liu, Zhang, Wong, & Hyum, 2020). Notably, a stable income emerged as a consistent variable across all outcomes, except for depression in isolation. These findings were observed within a timeframe of two months following the implementation of quarantine and social distancing measures, during which concerns surrounding unemployment and income instability were prevalent and widely shared in society.
Another crucial variable examined was the perception of health. Findings indicated that individuals who viewed themselves as unwell exhibited a heightened likelihood of experiencing symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Essentially, participants with a preexisting health concern or vulnerability appeared to have approximately double the risk of developing anxiety or depression symptoms. Given the ongoing stress associated with the pandemic's day-to-day challenges - which they had already endured for two months prior to the onset of confinement - those individuals who reported a deteriorated perception of their health may have possessed a distinct vulnerability. A negative perception of health was linked to elevated levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, as observed in other studies (Wang et al., 2020). This association was particularly pronounced when the perception of illness was tied to suspected coronavirus contagion (Nguyen et al., 2020), thereby reinforcing the consistency of this finding with prior research.
The variable of living alone, which may indicate a lack of social support, was found to increase the likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms. Existing literature suggests that individuals living alone are less inclined to share their concerns and anxieties during the pandemic, relying instead on electronic devices for communication (Jacob, Haro, & Koyanagi, 2019; Stahl, Beach, Musa, & Schulz, 2017). Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that individuals in this situation, if affected by COVID-19, may perceive a reduced likelihood of receiving the necessary support to cope with the illness.
The primary explanatory variable in this study was identified as meta-worry, significantly increasing the likelihood of symptoms in both potential outcomes, with nearly 13 times higher chances for the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms concurrently. Meta-worry emerges as a crucial factor in diagnosing anxious symptoms, particularly within the current pandemic context, where various concerns such as fear of contagion, death, or social isolation are prevalent (Liu et al., 2020). Notably, manifestations of anxiety and depression are frequently observed in situations characterized by excessive meta-worrying (Topper et al., 2017), with studies indicating a susceptibility to these conditions among individuals preoccupied with pandemic-related thoughts (Huang & Zhao, 2020). During epidemics, the mental health impact often surpasses the number of individuals directly affected by the disease and can persist beyond the epidemic itself (Shigemura, Ursano, Morganstein, Kurosawa, & Benedek, 2020), underscoring the pressing issue of excessive worrying within the Brazilian context.
The limitations of the present study include the non-randomized sample, which hinders direct generalizability; however, the sample size enhances the reliability of the findings and boosts the chances of replication. The results primarily stem from the Brazilian Northeast and specific demographic groups, namely women with a high level of education. Moreover, while meta-worry serves as a crucial explanatory factor, other potentially significant mediators like anxiety tolerance and coping strategies were not assessed, preventing an exploration of whether these variables could potentially mitigate the likelihood of being part of positive groups despite high levels of worry. Therefore, future research should incorporate these mediators to enhance understanding of meta-worry's predictive role in anxiety and depression. Furthermore, given the various phases of social isolation and the pandemic's repercussions, longitudinal studies are essential to track its impact on individuals' mental health both during and post-pandemic.
In light of the current global crisis, which remains critical and carries uncertain implications, especially within Brazil, there is a pressing need to prioritize the monitoring of mental health among the Brazilian populace. It is imperative that research efforts and interventions targeting the alleviation of psychological distress are integrated into public health policy strategies aimed at combating the COVID-19 pandemic both in the immediate and prolonged periods.
