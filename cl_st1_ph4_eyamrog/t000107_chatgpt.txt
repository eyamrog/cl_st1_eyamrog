This study presents a bibliometric analysis of research conducted on medical translation in Brazil, focusing on master's, doctoral, and post-doctoral studies spanning from 2002 to 2018. The main aim is to identify the subjects addressed, the institutions involved, and the geographical areas where these studies were carried out. The significance of this research lies in its ability to pinpoint regions and academic institutions actively engaged in medical translation research, while also highlighting areas where such studies are lacking. This mapping serves as a valuable resource for scholars interested in this field and can provide insights for the formulation of public policies that promote further research in this domain. Data was gathered from three digital platforms - Domínio Público, Biblioteca Digital de Teses e Dissertações, and Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES - through keyword searches in Portuguese. Out of the 14 studies identified, 28.6% were doctoral dissertations and 71.4% were master's theses, all originating from the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil. The most prevalent topics covered in these studies included cardiology, general biomedicine, anesthesiology, orthopedics, cardiovascular surgery, arterial hypertension, physiology, geriatrics, gerontology, nutrition, and pharmacy.
Research in the field of translation studies encompasses a diverse array of areas, spanning from pure to applied studies. The research landscape within this domain is rich with possibilities, exploring various translation modalities including literary, technical, scientific, and audiovisual translations, among others. Additionally, investigations into translation processes, products, and functions have significantly augmented the existing body of knowledge in this field.
Research indicates that domain knowledge not only influences the translation process but also impacts the final translated text (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1991; Da Silva, 2007). As defined by Scardamalia and Bereiter (1991), domain knowledge encompasses the understanding individuals possess about a specific area or field of interest. In the realm of translation studies, domain knowledge encompasses all the skills, competencies, and knowledge related to the translation process and its potential impact on the final outcome. Translators often encounter texts from diverse fields, with medical texts being a prominent example. In such instances, familiarity with translation techniques and subject matter becomes crucial for both the translation process and the resulting product.
This study, conducted by the MapTrad research group, falls within the Bibliometric Mapping in Translation Studies line of research and draws on the discipline of translation studies. Its primary objective is to map master’s, doctoral, and post-doctoral studies on medical translation in Brazil, aiming to identify the topics covered, the institutions involved, and the geographic regions of such studies. The mapping of translation studies is believed to potentially assist students and researchers interested in medical text translation by aiding in the selection of study centers and research directions, as well as guiding policies towards a more equitable distribution of resources for the advancement of translation studies in Brazil.
The interdisciplinary nature of our research, specifically its intersection with the medical field, underscores the importance of promoting studies like the present one. Hereafter, the medical field will be denoted as domain knowledge. Research indicates that domain knowledge significantly influences both the process and the outcome of translation (Da Silva et al., 2009; Da Silva & Silveira, 2017). Previous efforts have been made to map specific areas within translation domains (Barcelos & Malta, 2020; Esqueda, 2020), aiming to contribute to knowledge dissemination and identify the most and least explored topics. The mapping conducted in this study aims to achieve the same goal by pinpointing the topics that garner the most attention from researchers in the field of translation studies in Brazil and uncover potential knowledge deficiencies.
This article comprises five sections. Section 2 delves into the theoretical framework employed in the study, elucidating the foundational concepts and principles guiding the research. Section 3 focuses on the methodologies employed for information gathering and data collection, outlining the systematic approach adopted to ensure the reliability and validity of the study. Sections 4 and 5 are dedicated to the presentation and discussion of the results obtained from the research. Section 4 provides a comprehensive overview of the findings, while Section 5 delves into a detailed analysis and interpretation of the results, offering insights and implications derived from the study.
Within the realm of Bibliometrics, the monitoring of knowledge domains involves the mapping of emerging discoveries, studied fields, and existing knowledge lacunae. In Brazil, the inception of metric studies pertaining to information, including bibliometrics, can be traced back to the 1970s (Machado, 2007). Initially, these studies were incentivized to facilitate the organization of documents and information, thereby providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific productivity within the country. As time progressed, the term gained traction, with the bibliometric approach evolving into a pivotal indicator of the advancement of academic and technological research in Brazil (Machado, 2007).
Another aspect highlighted by scholars in the field is the capacity of bibliometrics to gauge the productivity of research centers. Establishing measurement metrics and evaluation criteria is crucial in determining priorities concerning the distribution of public resources. Additionally, bibliometrics aids in refining the focus of research in its strictest sense.
Bibliometrics examines the productivity of scientific and technological entities by analyzing bibliographic sources and patents. It involves identifying relationships, organizational patterns, trends, critical points, fads, and counterpoints, among other pertinent information crucial for information management and the dissemination of scientific products (Vasconcelos, 2014, p. 211, translated by us).
Numerous studies have employed bibliometric tools to assess researchers' productivity across various disciplines (Ribeiro, 2017). For instance, the author highlights administration, tourism, and accounting as areas of focus. Notably, bibliometry has even been the subject of its own bibliometric study (Vasconcelos, 2014; Ribeiro, 2017).
Bibliometrics is often justified for its ability to cover extensive periods of production and to highlight and disseminate crucial information across various study areas (Ribeiro, 2017). These attributes also enable the restructuring of fields of activity, whether they are highly visible or less prominent. In the realm of translation studies, for instance, research mapping aids in organizing specialized texts by offering an overview of research focused on translating scientific articles within the medical domain. Mapping also proves beneficial for research funding bodies by furnishing them with data that pinpoint the most and least explored topics. Additionally, bibliometric research plays a role in categorizing academic output based on researchers, geographical regions, and educational institutions, thereby facilitating the identification of scholars interested in medical text translation in our context.
While previous studies have attempted to map research in translation studies in Brazil, there are still notable gaps in the literature. These studies were hindered by technological limitations, lacking access to modern tools like digital repositories. Examples of such studies include Pagano and Vasconcellos (2003) and Alves and Vasconcellos (2016). This paper contributes to the field by introducing a methodology that has the potential to facilitate further research in this area. It addresses these gaps by identifying key topics, trends, research centers, and scholars, while also delving into sources that have been underexplored or overlooked in previous research efforts.
James Stratton Holmes is credited with coining the term translation studies, a pivotal moment in the discipline's history. His publication of a comprehensive mapping of the field between 1972 and 1988 not only organized translation studies but also broadened its horizons. Holmes's map facilitated the discipline's increased autonomy from related fields like linguistics, literary studies, cultural studies, and technical translation, establishing it as a subject of theoretical, descriptive, and applied research. However, due to the dynamic nature of translation interfaces, necessitating approaches like corpus-based or corpus-driven methods, there arose a need to further expand and modify the discipline's map. In Brazil, scholars such as Pagano and Vasconcellos (2003) and Alves and Vasconcellos (2016) have proposed such expansions to accommodate the evolving landscape of translation studies.
Pagano and Vasconcellos (2003) introduced a Brazilian translation studies map based on data from the 1980s and 1990s, sourced from a CD-ROM titled Estudos da Tradução no Brasil (Translation Studies in Brazil) released by the Anpoll Translation Studies working group. This information enabled the authors to identify translation studies conducted by Brazilian universities at the master’s, doctoral, and post-doctoral levels, facilitating a comparison with studies in Holmes’ map branches. Notably, the resulting map from Pagano and Vasconcellos’ (2003) research included the branch of theater (intersemiotic translation), a component absent from Holmes’ 1972-1988 map.
Alves and Vasconcellos (2016) built upon previous bibliometric research, expanding Pagano and Vasconcellos’ (2003) mapping by utilizing internet search engines for enhanced access to scholarly materials. Their study, spanning from 2006 to 2010, employed Portuguese keywords on the Domínio Público website, akin to Pagano and Vasconcellos (2003). A notable divergence between Alves and Vasconcellos’ (2016) and Pagano and Vasconcellos’ (2003) investigations, beyond data sources, was a specific focus on locating translation studies within systemic functional linguistics and corpus linguistics interfaces. In both studies, the reliance on keywords proved inadequate for accurately categorizing the identified works, as titles and keywords often failed to reflect the disciplinary fields to which they belonged. Consequently, a disconnect emerged between the identified works' topics and the search keywords used. This disparity between keywords and research subjects poses a significant challenge in cataloging, identifying theoretical connections, and situating works within their respective disciplinary realms in the realm of translation studies.
The mapping outlined in this paper contributes to the ongoing mapping efforts conducted by the University of Brasilia's research group, MapTrad. This includes mappings such as game translation/localization (Barcelos & Malta, 2020), didactics of translation, translation studies focusing on children and adolescents, Spanish <=> Portuguese translation, and black feminist translated literature.
Following the methodology proposed by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016, which utilized the website www.dominiopublico.gov.br as a data source, this study aimed to systematically map research on medical translation conducted in Brazil. The search for medical translation theses and dissertations completed in Brazilian higher education institutions between 2002 and 2018 was carried out using Portuguese keywords. Initially, the timeframe suggested by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016) spanned from 2006 to 2016, aligning with the enforcement of administrative regulation number 13/2006 by CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel), a Brazilian governmental agency. This regulation mandated that all theses and dissertations completed in Brazil be digitally accessible to the public through the Domínio Público website. However, our searches revealed medical translation studies predating this initial period, prompting us to extend our research timeframe to cover the years 2002 to 2018.
The website www.dominiopublico.gov.br aims to facilitate widespread access to literary, artistic, and scientific works that are either in the public domain or have been authorized for publication. Upon visiting the homepage, users are greeted with a simple search form that allows for filtering by various media types such as image, sound, text, and video. Additional filters on the homepage include options for category, author, title, and language. Furthermore, a dedicated section for dissertations and theses is available, which we utilized for our initial search. Within this section, we specifically selected the "mestrado" (master) filter under the "Nível" (level) category and entered "Tradução" (translation) in the "Palavras-Chave" (keywords) field (refer to Figure 1).
The results retrieved from the website were individually analyzed to identify and select studies pertaining to medical translation. Subsequently, the chosen studies were meticulously organized in an Excel spreadsheet, featuring columns such as year, title, institution, area of knowledge, type of study, and author. The same meticulous process was applied to filter out doctorate-level studies. Upon conducting searches using both the master's and doctorate filters, it became evident that the website www.dominiopublico.gov.br, aimed at providing access to Brazilian research, did not prove to be a reliable source for data collection. This determination was made based on the discovery of works within the study's designated time frame that were absent from the Domínio Público website.
To further validate the portal's reliability, we conducted a search on Google.com using the terms dissertação, mestrado, and tradução médica (thesis, master’s, medical translation). This search yielded around 1,910,000 results for master's theses and 1,080,000 for doctoral dissertations. Some of the results meeting our selection criteria, not initially found on www.dominiopublico.gov.br, were noted and revisited on the Domínio Público website. Specifically, we re-examined hits from the first two pages of the Google search engine, as revisiting all hits meeting our criteria but omitted from the initial Domínio Público search would be excessively time-consuming. This process revealed master's theses and doctoral dissertations completed within our study's timeframe that were absent from the Domínio Público website. This discrepancy prompted an extension of the methodology proposed by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016), which originally focused solely on entering keywords on www.dominiopublico.gov.br.
Two additional websites were incorporated into our study, namely the Biblioteca Digital de Teses e Dissertações (BDTD; Digital Library of Dissertations and Theses) and the Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES (CAPES Dissertations and Theses Catalog). These platforms are dedicated to providing access and enhancing the visibility of Brazilian theses and dissertations. The BDTD website is managed by the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology. Its homepage features a simplified keyword search window with four filter options: todos os campos (all fields), título (title), autor (author), and assunto (topic) (Figure 2), along with an advanced search option that offers a wider range of filters (Figure 3).
The initial search on the BDTD website was conducted using the simplified keyword search window (Figure 2). The keyword "tradução" (translation) was entered into the search window, mirroring the process employed on the Domínio Público website. This initial search yielded 4,849 theses and dissertations, a volume that rendered the individual selection of works unfeasible. Consequently, a more targeted search strategy was adopted. Initially, the keywords "tradução médica" (medical translation) were inputted, followed by the keywords "tradução artigo científico" (scientific article translation). The outcomes of these searches were meticulously scrutinized, and only those that aligned with the inclusion criteria were systematically organized in an Excel spreadsheet.
The Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES (CAPES Catalog) website serves as a repository for theses and dissertations completed in Brazilian higher education institutions, in accordance with the agency's administrative regulation number 13/2006. The homepage features a single search bar for entering keywords and a search button, initially lacking filters. However, upon conducting an initial search, the results page presents various filters for an advanced search. These filters enable users to refine their search by type, year, author, supervisor, evaluation committee, major knowledge area, knowledge area, evaluation area, area of expertise, graduate studies area, institution, and library. Our exploration of the CAPES Catalog began with the keyword "tradução" (translation), yielding numerous irrelevant theses and dissertations. To streamline our search, we utilized the aforementioned filters. Subsequently, we conducted searches using keywords such as "tradução médica" (medical translation) and "tradução de artigos científicos" (translation of scientific articles), adjusting the use of filters based on the system's varying filter options corresponding to the keywords employed.
To further enhance the methodology proposed by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016), we conducted a search using the authors' names, previously identified on DomínioPúblico, BDTD, and Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES, to determine which of these websites hosted the theses and dissertations included in our study. This step was crucial as an additional filter to reduce the likelihood of selecting studies that did not meet the mapping inclusion criteria. Subsequently, to explore the topics addressed in these theses and dissertations, we downloaded the files and scrutinized the abstracts. The findings are detailed in section 4.
The results obtained through the methodology outlined in Section 3 will be presented individually for each website. Subsequently, these results will be aggregated, analyzed, and subsequently discussed in the final section of this paper.
The search conducted using the keyword "tradução" (translation) on the Domínio Público website yielded a total of 218 theses and dissertations. Upon scrutinizing the titles of each of the 218 documents, it was discerned that merely four of them pertained to the realm of medical translation, with no dissertations specifically focusing on this subject. To validate these findings, a thorough examination of all 218 abstracts was carried out. The summarized outcomes are depicted in Figure 4, illustrating that despite the initial search generating 218 outcomes, only a meager four (1.8%) aligned with our predefined selection criteria.
Among the four theses cataloged on the Domínio Público website, two were finalized in 2006 while the remaining two were completed in 2009. Specifically, two of these theses originated from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), one from the São Paulo Catholic University (PUC/SP), and the last one from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). A concise overview of the outcomes can be found in Table 1.
Table 1 illustrates that the four studies were carried out by researchers in related fields. Specifically, two of these studies involved English-Portuguese translations, while the remaining two focused on German-Portuguese translations. Notably, the research conducted at UFRGS comprised the German-Portuguese translations, suggesting a potential influence of German in the southern region of Brazil.
The search was conducted on the BDTD website, utilizing the keyword "tradução," which yielded 4,849 theses and dissertations. Due to the impracticality of manually identifying studies meeting our selection criteria within this vast number, we opted to refine the search using the keywords "tradução médica" (medical translation), resulting in 633 studies retrieved (refer to Figure 5). Out of these, only six studies, comprising three dissertations and three theses, aligned with our selection criteria.
In order to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant studies, we conducted an additional search on the BDTD website utilizing the keywords "tradução artigos científicos" (translation scientific articles). This search yielded a total of 427 studies, from which only three theses aligned with our selection criteria. The outcomes of this search are visually depicted in Figure 6.
Among the studies identified using the keywords "translation scientific articles," all but one had already been located in the prior search utilizing the keywords "medical translation." Consequently, a mere seven studies were retrieved from the BDTD website in total. Details such as the year of publication, title, field of study, affiliated institution, and authorship can be found in Table 2.
Table 2 illustrates that the BDTD website yielded a greater number of theses and dissertations compared to the Domínio Público website. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the study retrieved from the Health Sciences field, as opposed to Language Studies, underscores the interdisciplinary essence of translation studies. This discovery further emphasizes the diverse and interconnected nature of research within the field.
In the Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES website, three searches were conducted using different keywords and filters. The initial search utilized the keyword "tradução" (translation) with filters including arts, human sciences, language studies, translation studies, linguistic studies, letters, classical letters, linguistics, linguistics and literature, medicine, and medicine I, resulting in the retrieval of only one dissertation. The second search employed the keywords "tradução médica" (medical translation) with filters language studies, letters, linguistics, and linguistics and arts, yielding four theses and two dissertations. The final search utilized the keywords "tradução artigos científicos" (translation scientific articles) with filters human sciences, letters, letters and arts, linguistics, and linguistics and literature, resulting in the retrieval of three theses and one dissertation, with the latter already included in the second search. In total, 10 studies met the selection criteria, comprising eight theses and two dissertations, as detailed in Table 3.
The subsequent phase involved comparing the outcomes of the searches carried out on the three websites. This comparative analysis enabled us to determine the specific website from which each thesis and dissertation was or was not obtained. Notably, none of the retrieved theses and dissertations were listed in all three websites, as illustrated in Figure 7. To validate this observation, we conducted an additional search by inputting the titles of the theses and dissertations instead of relying on keywords and filters.
The examination of the spreadsheet containing the gathered data unveiled discrepancies. Specifically, the titles of two theses sourced from the Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES differed from those listed on the BDTD website. It was inferred that the titles on the BDTD site were accurate, aligning with the titles specified in the thesis documents. Furthermore, upon cross-referencing the data inputted in the spreadsheet using authors' names and publication years, it was noted that a thesis title was presented in English on the BDTD platform and in Portuguese on the Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES. The outcomes post-resolution of these inconsistencies are depicted in Figure 8.
Figure 8 reveals a discrepancy from our initial discoveries (refer to Figure 7), indicating that the four theses listed in Domínio Público were also present in both the BDTD and the Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES platforms. Notably, the latter source proves to be the most comprehensive, encompassing all the theses and dissertations identified on Domínio Público and BDTD. Table 4 provides a comprehensive list of the titles of these academic works along with the corresponding websites where they are accessible for retrieval.
Despite employing various keywords and filters in the search queries across the three websites, the theses and dissertations obtained from the BDTD and the Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES exhibited remarkable similarity. The apparent dearth of such academic works on the Domínio Público website hints at a potential deficiency in data input or availability.
Table 5 presents the comprehensive compilation of thesis and dissertation titles from Brazilian higher education institutions, serving as a crucial repository of data for researchers delving into translation studies within the country, particularly those focusing on medical text translation. This compilation not only offers valuable insights for scholars but also serves as a dependable resource for identifying prevalent research themes, potentially shedding light on areas warranting further exploration within the realm of medical translation studies.
Among the 14 studies obtained from the websites Domínio Público, BDTD, and Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES, four were dissertations (28.6%) and 10 were theses (71.4%). The first thesis was finalized in 2002, and the last dissertation was completed in 2016, spanning a 14-year period. For the year 2004, two theses were retrieved, as well as for 2006. In 2009, two theses and one dissertation were found. Singular studies were concluded in the years 2002 (thesis), 2003 (thesis), 2005 (thesis), 2011 (thesis), 2012 (dissertation), 2013 (dissertation), and 2016 (dissertation), as illustrated in Figure 9.
The majority of the studies were conducted at Rio Grande do Sul Federal University, with a total of three theses and one dissertation. São Paulo State University in São José do Rio Preto saw the completion of two theses and one dissertation. Additionally, one thesis and one dissertation were defended at Santa Catarina Federal University. The remaining dissertations were carried out at São Paulo University, Rio de Janeiro Catholic University, São Paulo Catholic University, Rio de Janeiro State University, and São José do Rio Preto Medical School. These details are succinctly presented in Figure 10.
An examination of the data depicted in Figure 10 reveals that all medical translation theses and dissertations identified in this study were conducted in institutions situated in the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that only one dissertation was carried out within a Medical School, as opposed to the Department of Letters and Linguistic Studies in various other universities.
The current study aimed to replicate the methodology outlined by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016) for mapping medical translation studies theses and dissertations written in Portuguese and completed in Brazilian higher education institutions. Alves and Vasconcellos (2016) posited that these academic works should be accessible digitally on www.dominiopublico.gov.br, in accordance with CAPES administrative regulation 13/2006. However, a closer examination of the regulation revealed that it does not specify a particular website but rather mandates that the works be "available to the public through the internet." Furthermore, our investigation uncovered a thesis from 2002, predating the timeframe suggested by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016). Given the advancements in search engine capabilities, we opted to commence our search from 2002 onwards.
The reliability concern associated with the Domínio Público website arose from the discovery of theses and dissertations completed within the study's designated timeframe via a Google search, which were not indexed on the website. It is presumed that the absence of these academic works on www.dominiopublico.gov.br may be attributed to issues concerning the inadequate or irregular updating of information on the platform.
The reliability of the Google search engine was found to be lacking due to the absence of appropriate filters and the influence of user algorithms primarily geared towards commercial interests and driven by paid advertisements. While Google Scholar offers a specialized platform for searching scholarly texts, our analysis did not focus on books and scientific articles retrieved through this tool. Consequently, we turned to two Brazilian websites, www.bdtd.ibict.br/vufind/ (BDTD) and www.catalogodeteses.capes.gov.br/catalogo-teses/ (CAPES), dedicated to cataloging theses and dissertations from Brazilian higher education institutions. CAPES, in particular, boasted a larger collection compared to Domínio Público and BDTD. However, its interface was less user-friendly, with filter options appearing only after entering keywords and varying based on the keywords used. These characteristics of the CAPES website made searches more complex and time-consuming.
In order to address the aforementioned challenges, we modified and enhanced the methodology proposed by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016. Our approach involved conducting searches on the websites Domínio Público, BDTD, and CAPES, utilizing not only keywords but also strings of keywords, a range of filters, and searches based on authors' names. These strategies were instrumental in enabling us to validate all the retrieved information and optimize the results to prevent the duplication or omission of relevant data.
Out of the 14 works retrieved from the aforementioned websites, only one was not available in digital format for consultation (A Tradução de Resumos/Abstracts de Dissertações e de Teses da Área Médica, Patrícia Dias Reis, 2002). Among the remaining 13 studies examined, it was evident that all authors employed corpus linguistics in various ways to conduct their research. This discovery underscores the significance of this methodology in the translation of specialized language texts, particularly in the realm of medical translation. Concerning the types of corpora utilized, four studies employed a comparable corpus to: (1) identify and validate patterns for expressions commonly found in the development and organization of scientific articles, (2) scrutinize the usage of the term "submit," (3) explore specialized collocations in cardiology texts, and (4) analyze lexical bundles within the health sciences domain (medicine, nutrition, and pharmacy). Additionally, five studies utilized a parallel corpus to: (1) create a Portuguese-English glossary in the field of cardiology, (2) examine the occurrence of compounds (Komposita) in German, (3) investigate the retextualization process of abstracts in the biomedical field, (4) explore textual markers that reveal translation difficulties stemming from intercultural issues, and (5) identify potential terms in the biomedical field. Two studies employed both parallel and comparable corpora to develop glossaries. However, the remaining two studies, a dissertation and a thesis, omitted crucial details regarding the type of corpus used in their abstracts, a critical piece of information that should have been included. The dissertation focused on analyzing anatomical language using a corpus, while the thesis aimed to create a collocation glossary for texts related to arterial hypertension.
As previously noted, one of the files required for analysis could not be located. Among the sub-areas of medicine, cardiology and general biomedicine emerged as the most prevalent, serving as the focal points for five studies each. Additionally, the theses and dissertations we examined delved into various other sub-areas such as anesthesiology, orthopedics, cardiovascular surgery, arterial hypertension, physiology, geriatrics, gerontology, nutrition, and pharmacy. These findings are succinctly presented in Figure 11. The predominant language pairs utilized across the studies were Portuguese-English (10 studies) and Portuguese-German (2 studies). Notably, one dissertation explored multilingual translation involving Portuguese, Spanish, and English.
One significant discovery in this study pertains to the limited availability of theses and dissertations within the realm of medical translation in Brazil. Given the substantial contribution of this field to scientific progress, there was an anticipation of it being a fertile ground for translators, leading to an expectation of encountering a more extensive body of research in our investigations than what was actually uncovered.
The current study highlights the lack of standardization in the cataloguing of studies by higher educational institutions on websites, despite the existence of CAPES administrative regulation 13/2006. This research offers two significant contributions to the field of translation studies: firstly, it provides a comprehensive mapping of theses and dissertations conducted in this field in Brazil, and secondly, it emphasizes the necessity for standardization and regular updating of websites hosting Brazilian scholarly works. Addressing this issue would require a revision of CAPES administrative regulation 13/2006, which, in turn, would greatly enhance the effectiveness of future mapping studies and bibliographic reviews across various disciplines.
Another noteworthy finding, which emerged as a by-product of our searches on the Domínio Público, BDTD, and CAPES websites, is the prevalence of research focused on the translation, validation, and cultural adaptation of medical questionnaires. Interestingly, these studies have predominantly been carried out by scholars in the health sciences field rather than by researchers in translation studies. This observation underscores the existing interdisciplinary connection between applied linguistics and health sciences, suggesting a potential for further exploration within the realm of translation studies. To delve deeper into this area, we have gathered quantitative data and are planning future investigations into the involvement of translators in the teams responsible for developing and translating medical questionnaires.
Overall, the mapping presented in this study serves two primary practical purposes: firstly, to assist students and researchers interested in medical translations in selecting study centers and research directions, and secondly, to provide guidance for potential policies regarding the allocation of resources for the advancement of translation studies in Brazil. Despite the limitations inherent in the websites utilized and the intricacies of the searches conducted, which may have resulted in the exclusion of some theses and dissertations completed in Brazil during the specified period, we aim to stimulate further comprehensive research in this domain. Given that medical translation often involves translators assuming the role of authors, with many Brazilian doctors either composing their articles in English or translating their own manuscripts, it is a field where qualitative analysis, grounded in translation studies theories, is not only pertinent but essential. Understanding the field and the specific domain can significantly enhance the organization of research efforts and the utilization of available resources.
