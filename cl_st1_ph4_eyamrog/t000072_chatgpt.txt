Riparian forests have been impacted by forest fragmentation, leading to changes in seed dispersion patterns and alterations in the soil seed bank. This study aims to identify the key species comprising the seed bank in a riparian forest section along the Mogi Guaçu River that extends into a semideciduous forest fragment within the Guarnição da Aeronáutica de Pirassununga. Ten plots measuring 10 x 10 m were delineated, with four soil samples collected per plot using a 25 x 25 cm template. These samples were then placed in a greenhouse for seed germination, with monitoring conducted every 15 days over a six-month period. In total, 494 individuals from 19 families were sampled, representing 30 genera and 40 morphospecies. The diversity and distribution of species within the fragment were found to be uniform, suggesting that it could serve as a viable source of propagules for forest restoration efforts.
When vegetation is situated in proximity to watercourses, it is referred to as riparian forest. This type of forest is characterized as a transitional zone that stretches from the boundaries of watercourses to the periphery of elevated lands. Riparian forests are significantly impacted by the water regime and exhibit a notable diversity of habitats (Naiman et al., 2005).
The fragmentation of forest formations, characterized by isolated patches of forests surrounded by anthropogenically transformed areas, can lead to negative edge effects and species isolation (Cosgrove et al., 2018). This fragmentation can also disrupt the pattern of seed dispersal in a given area, thereby impacting genetic diversity and gene flow (Cordeiro & Howe, 2003; Wang & Smith, 2002). Forest formations like riparian forests along watercourses play a crucial role in maintaining gene flow by connecting fragmented populations (Kageyama & Gandara, 2001). Moreover, these forests contribute to stabilizing watercourse margins, serving as natural filters for nutrients and agrochemicals, while also intercepting solar radiation and providing habitat and sustenance for aquatic and terrestrial fauna (Sabino & Castro, 1990).
The composition of the seed bank may undergo alterations due to the inclusion of seeds from both the fragment's resident individuals and dispersers from external areas (Bossuyht & Honnay, 2008). This reservoir consists of viable, ungerminated seeds that are situated in the soil and have the potential to sprout quickly or remain dormant until favorable conditions for germination emerge (Martins, 2009).
Analysis of the seed bank stock enables the selection of improved strategies for managing native forests or facilitating restoration efforts. Additionally, it serves as a valuable ecological indicator for evaluating and monitoring regeneration within degraded ecosystems (Neto et al., 2010, 2014; Bargoena et al., 2020; Costa et al., 2020).
One of the significant challenges facing conservation efforts today is the preservation of the remaining forest fragments (Loyola, 2014), particularly in Brazil, which boasts one of the planet's richest biodiversities (Forzza et al., 2012). The scarcity of information regarding where conservation efforts should be focused and which restoration strategies should be implemented often hinders biodiversity conservation initiatives. In this context, investigations into the seed bank within these remaining areas can offer crucial insights into their conservation status and guide restoration efforts in the surrounding areas, starting with an identification of the primary plant species present. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to identify the key species comprising the seed bank in a section of riparian forest along the Mogi Guaçu River, adjacent to a fragment of semideciduous forest within the Guarnição da Aeronáutica de Pirassununga (São Paulo State, Brazil).
The study area for this research was a forest fragment situated within the Guarnição da Aeronáutica de Pirassununga (FAYS), positioned at latitude 21°59’39.98” S and longitude 47°20’12.73” W, located in the municipality of Pirassununga in the state of São Paulo, Brazil (see figure 1).
The FAYS area encompasses approximately 2608 hectares (ha) comprising various forest fragments such as lowland, Brazilian savanna (cerrado), semideciduous forest, riparian forest, and plantations of Eucalyptus spp. and Pinus spp. The climate in this region is classified as Cwa (Rolim et al., 2007), characterized by hot and rainy summers, contrasted with dry winters. In 2018, the average temperature was recorded at 21.90°C, with an annual average rainfall of 1291 mm (Universidade de São Paulo, 2020).
The study site represents a riparian forest transitioning into a semideciduous forest, covering an area of around 140 hectares (see Figure 2). Situated at an altitude of 620 meters, it lies to the north of FAYS, in close proximity to the Water Treatment Station, adjacent to the Mogi Guaçu River. This area is part of the Residual Franca/Batatais highlands, characterized by the intrusive Serra Geral formation and featuring Typical Red Dystrophial Latosol soil, which is moderately to prominently clayey, very deep, and exhibits a gently undulating relief (LV11) (Rossi, 2017).
Sampling involved marking five plots measuring 10 × 10 meters each, positioned 5 meters from the Mogi Guaçu River (R), with a minimum separation of 30 meters between them. Additionally, five plots of the same dimensions were situated approximately 30 meters away from the river (I). Plots I and R were sequentially numbered from one to five, with R1 and I1 specifically marked at a distance of 250 meters post the Water Treatment Station to mitigate its impact on the designated areas. To determine the distance from the fragment entrance to the plot beginnings and to ascertain the geographical coordinates of each plot (refer to figure 3), a Global Positioning System (GPS) device of the GARMIN Mark 20x model was utilized.
The methodology employed in this study was derived from an analysis of various articles. It was noted that there was significant variation in sampling methodologies across studies, particularly concerning plot sizes. Nonetheless, a consensus emerged from the reviewed literature, indicating a preference for a quadratic template measuring 25 cm x 25 cm and collecting seeds solely at a depth of 5 cm (Braga et al. 2008; Martins et al. 2008; Martins 2009; Franco et al. 2012; Cerón 2015; Correia & Martins 2015; Kunz & Martins 2016). To enhance seed collection efficiency, we opted to excavate soil at a depth ranging from 0-10 cm, a decision that will be elaborated upon in subsequent sections.
The sampling method employed in the 10 plots was adapted from Braga et al. (2016), involving the collection of four samples per plot using a 25 cm x 25 cm template. These samples were gathered in September 2018 during the transition from the dry season to the rainy season, a time frame chosen for its potential to yield a greater diversity of species for seed bank analysis, as highlighted by Braga et al. (2016).
Following the recommendations of Braga et al. (2016), each sample was excavated to a depth of 10 cm in a two-step process. Initially, the soil from 0-5 cm was removed, referred to as the upper layer, followed by the extraction of soil from 5-10 cm, known as the lower layer. Samples from both depths were carefully placed in separate plastic bags. Subsequently, the collected samples were transferred to plastic trays, with the lower layer placed first, followed by the upper layer, and then subjected to germination under 60% shade with daily irrigation lasting two to three minutes using microsprinklers.
The seedling emergence method (Simpson et al., 1989) was employed for seed bank analysis, with monitoring conducted every 15 days over a period of six months. To ensure accurate identification of individuals, those displaying arbustive and arboreal characteristics were transplanted into tubes for further development. Species identification guides, including Lorenzi (2014) and Brancalion & Nogueira (2016), were utilized for the identification of the seedlings. Exsiccates of the identified seedlings were prepared and subsequently deposited in the herbarium of Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Campus Araras.
Statistical analysis was conducted using the software Past 3.0 (Hammer & Harper, 2006) to observe the total number of species, species diversity measured by the Shannon-Weaver index (H'), and the equality rate determined by Pielou's index (J) (Krebs, 2007). The T test was employed to determine if there were significant differences in the H' values (p < 0.05).
A total of 494 individuals representing 19 botanical families were sampled, spanning across 30 genera and 40 morphospecies (see table 1). Notably, the highest species diversity among the identified individuals at least at the family level was observed in Asteraceae (17.5%), Moraceae (12.5%), Solanaceae (12.5%), and Urticaceae (7.5%). Certain individuals could not be definitively identified at the genus or species level due to their non-reproductive state, with the observed characteristics in the vegetative stage being inconclusive for a secure identification.
Most species within the Asteraceae family exhibit anemocory and herbaceous habits (Silva et al., 2019), alongside possessing numerous adaptive traits that enable their presence in diverse ecosystems (Beretta et al., 2008). The findings presented align with previous research indicating the significant species richness of Asteraceae in semideciduous forest regions (Nóbrega et al., 2009; Franco et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2019). Notably, Asteraceae stands as one of the largest angiosperm families in terms of species count, characterized by anemochoric dispersion and widespread representation across various plant formations globally (Lorenzi, 2014), factors that contribute to its extensive distribution within the study area.
The Moraceae family exhibited the second highest species diversity, comprising five morphospecies and a total of ten individuals, including four Ficus hirsuta Schott, three Ficus guaranitica Chodat, and one Ficus eximia Schott. Two individuals remained unidentified and were labeled as Ficus sp. 1 and Ficus sp. 2. Initially, based on Mendonça-Souza's (2006) studies, they were tentatively identified as Ficus adhatodifolia Schott in Spreng. and Ficus obtusiuscula (Miq.) Miq. However, due to the similarity in vegetative characteristics between the two species, further information on the pseudofruit was deemed necessary for accurate identification. As the seedlings observed were in a vegetative stage, a decision was made to refrain from identifying them at the species level. The genus Ficus boasts the highest number of species within the family, with an estimated 800 species found across tropical and subtropical regions, with limited presence in temperate zones (Pelissari & Romaniuc-Neto 2013). These species play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance in forests, as their pseudofruits, known as syconium, serve as a food source for mammals, birds, and even fish, facilitating widespread seed dispersal (Mendonça-Souza 2006). The pollination of Ficus flowers is orchestrated by wasps through a unique and highly specialized mutualistic relationship (Pelissari & Romaniuc-Neto 2013).
Solanaceae ranks third in species diversity. The individuals identified in this study are zoochoric, with their seeds dispersed by animals post-ingestion (Ruschel et al., 2008). For instance, Solanum lycocarpum A.St-Hil. relies on the guara wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus Illiger, 1815) as its primary disperser (Massara et al., 2012), an endangered mammal (Brazil, 2014). Müller (2016) observed the presence of the guara wolf in the Guarnição da Aeronáutica de Pirassununga areas, potentially serving as the species' disperser in the study area. Approximately 83% of Solanaceae species are animal-dispersed, playing a crucial role in forest community structure (Albuquerque et al., 2006), particularly in colonizing open areas like clearings, pastures, and forest edges as pioneer species requiring direct sunlight for growth (Tabarelli et al., 1999).
Among the families exhibiting the highest species diversity is Urticaceae, which in Brazil is represented by 14 genera and approximately 116 species (Gaglioti et al., 2020). These species are characterized by their rapid growth, short life cycles, and typically attain small to medium sizes (Parrota, 1995). The majority of these species require ample sunlight for their development (Godoi & Tanaki, 2005), making border areas and clearings within forests prime locations for their proliferation. Typically, the soil of primary or secondary tropical forests harbors a significant number of seeds from this family, particularly those of Cecropia spp. (Lobova et al., 2003).
In the current study, a potential new occurrence of Combretum leprosum Mart. in São Paulo State was identified, a species initially documented in the semideciduous forests of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo States (Flora do Brasil 2020 2021). Queiroz et al. (2021) also noted the presence of C. leprosum seedlings in the same study area, providing evidence that supports the potential occurrence of this species in São Paulo State. Ongoing floristic investigations may confirm the presence of mature C. leprosum individuals in the study region, underscoring the significance of seed bank studies as a valuable tool for exploring the local flora.
Among the families with the highest number of individuals sampled, Urticaceae emerges prominently with 220 individuals (44.53%), spread across three species: Cecropia glaziovii Snethl. (127 individuals), Cecropia pachystachia Trécul. (91 individuals), and Urera baccifera (L.) Gaudich. ex Wedd. (two individuals). Following closely is Cannabaceae, which accounted for 97 individuals (19.64%), attributed to Celtis sp. (50 individuals) and Trema micrantha (L.) Blume (47 individuals). Solanaceae ranks third in terms of individual count, with 66 individuals (13.36%), encompassing Solanum americanum Mill. (47 individuals), Solanum lycocarpum A. St-Hil. (nine individuals), Solanum mauritianum Scop. (seven individuals), Capsicum baccatum var. praetermissum (Heiser & P. G. Smith) Hunz. (two individuals), and Nicandra physalodes (L.) Gaertn. (one individual). These findings indicate that the majority of the individuals sampled are pioneer species, suggesting their potential contribution to kickstarting the recovery process in an ecological restoration scenario. By aiding in soil coverage and facilitating the subsequent growth of non-pioneer species, these individuals could play a crucial role in the restoration of the area.
The species documented in the seed bank overlap by 30% (12 species) with the ongoing floristic investigation within the same area as the current study. This correspondence aligns with Marcante et al.'s (2009) assertion that there typically exists significant differentiation between the seed bank's composition and the actual vegetation. Generally, the diversity of vegetation surpasses that of the seed bank, given that certain dispersed seeds may not endure extended periods in the soil while in a dormant state, awaiting ideal conditions for germination (Martins et al., 2015).
In comparison with the study conducted by Neto et al. (2020), the dominant species were found to be quite similar. In the seed bank of a mature semideciduous forest examined by these authors, the species that predominantly emerged were T. micrantha (L.) Blume, Cecropia hololeuca Miq., and Solanum sp. These species are known to persist in the soil for extended periods, necessitating well-lit areas for germination (Martins 2016). They play a crucial role in forest regeneration, being primary in nature and germinating in clearings and edges of fragments (Pereira et al. 2010; Correia & Martins 2015). Additionally, these species are dispersed by animals, particularly birds (Ruschel et al. 2008).
The highest number of pioneer individuals recorded was in plots R, indicating that the largest seed bank in this ecological group was documented at the edge of the fragment, which borders the Mogi Guaçu River. Forest areas adjacent to the watercourse exhibit a greater stratification of vegetation, allowing direct light penetration (Wallace et al. 2018), which supports the germination of species within this ecological group (Pereira et al. 2010; Correia & Martins 2015), thus validating the data obtained. Conversely, in plots I (located farthest from the river), the majority of non-pioneer species were documented. This can be attributed to the fact that areas further from the edge typically possess a more uniform canopy, resulting in shade and increased humidity (Wallace et al. 2018), creating an ideal environment for the development of such species.
Among the species identified in this study, 55% exhibit zoochoric dispersion syndrome, 30% anemochoric, and 12.5% autochoric. Zoochory plays a crucial role in facilitating interactions between fauna and flora, thereby supporting the conservation and functionality of forest fragments (García et al., 2011). Typically, in preserved fragments and extensive tropical forest areas, zoochoric dispersion prevails (Sansevero et al., 2011; Jesus et al., 2012). Given that the study site experiences minimal human disturbance, it can be inferred that it is in a good state of conservation, as over half of the species demonstrate zoochoric dispersion syndrome. Similar findings have been reported in other studies conducted in remnants of semideciduous forests, where a majority of sampled individuals also exhibit animal-mediated dispersion (Silva et al., 2019; Neto et al., 2020).
Among ecological groups, 37.5% of the species were classified as non-pioneers, while 30% were categorized as pioneers. The remaining species were not assigned to an ecological group due to being herbaceous (22.5%), lianas (7.5%), or undetermined (2.5%). Non-pioneer species exhibited the highest diversity, yet the majority of recorded individuals (83.6%) belonged to the pioneer group. Several authors suggest that the seed bank of semideciduous forests predominantly comprises pioneering species in terms of ecological succession, as these species endure extended periods of dormancy in the soil and exhibit high seed production. In contrast, non-pioneer species typically do not establish a presence in the seed bank due to their large size, which hinders penetration through the litter layer and integration with the soil. This lack of incorporation of large seeds into the soil exposes them to potential predator attacks, unlike the smaller seeds of pioneer species that are easily buried and often shielded from predators. A study by Nóbrega et al. (2009) in the riparian forest of the Mogi Guaçu river revealed that 47% of emerging species from the seed bank were pioneers, contrasting with the current study's finding of 30% pioneers. Similarly, other studies in the same phytophysiognomy have also reported a prevalence of pioneer species among emerging plants.
In terms of the phytophysiognomy's species composition, out of the total 29 species identified, eleven have been documented in both semideciduous and riparian forests, seven species exclusively in semideciduous forests, two solely in riparian forests, and nine with no reported occurrences in these habitats, as per Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021). Given that the study area encompasses a riparian forest contiguous to a semideciduous forest fragment, these findings suggest that the fragment's presence likely influences the species diversity within the riparian forest under investigation. It is crucial to note that such data are not consistently included in herbarium specimen labels, and a substantial portion of the information regarding species occurrences in phytophysiognomies, as documented in Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021), may have been derived from this source. This could explain the notable number of species identified in this study that were previously unreported in semideciduous and riparian forests.
In terms of species richness, plots I exhibited a slightly higher average number of species per plot compared to plots R, with values of 12.6 and 11.6, respectively. The diversity indices (H') were notably elevated in plots I, varying between 1.98 and 2.53, whereas in plots R, they fell within the range of 1.74 to 2.02. Similarly, the equitability indices (J) were also more pronounced in plots I, spanning from 0.82 to 0.95, while in plots R, they ranged from 0.70 to 0.90 (see Table 2).
The mean Shannon's index in plots R (1.90) was observed to be lower compared to plots I (2.20), although statistical analysis using a t-test indicated that the difference was not significant (p> 0.05). Both regions exhibited Shannon-Weaver indexes below 3, a threshold identified by Souza et al. (2013) as indicative of low diversity. The consistent forest structure in mature forest areas leads to reduced seed rain, resulting in decreased diversity and density of the seed bank. Consequently, the species comprising the community tend to establish a seedling bank, as highlighted by Souza et al. (2006).
In a study conducted by Neto et al. (2020), the Shannon index was higher during the rainy season, with a value of 2.23, based on samples collected between November and April 2017. Conversely, during the dry season, spanning from May to October 2017, the index was notably lower at 1.57 compared to the current study. In a separate investigation by Piña-Rodrigues & Aoki (2014) focusing on seed deposition in semideciduous forest fragments, it was noted that the highest seed deposition occurred towards the end of the dry season and the onset of the wet season, specifically from September onwards. Despite this, various studies indicate that peak seed deposition typically happens at the transition from the dry to the wet season (Braga et al. 2016), prompting the decision to collect samples in September to capture a broader diversity. Consequently, one of the key factors influencing species density and composition is the fluctuation of climatic conditions (Dalling 2002).
The Pielou index mean values ranged from 0.78 in region R to 0.87 in region I. This indicates that in region I, species are more evenly distributed without ecological dominance, although both regions exhibit high index values, suggesting a good distribution of species. A low Pielou index value typically signifies that a few species dominate the total number of individuals (Pinã-Rodrigues & Aoki, 2014). For instance, in a study conducted on the periphery of a semideciduous forest, the Pielou index was calculated at 0.79, aligning with the findings of the current research (Bargoena et al., 2020).
According to the administration of the Guarnição da Aeronáutica de Pirassununga, specific areas near the Mogi Guaçu River in the Pirassununga Municipality have been identified as requiring restoration (S.M. Barroso, personal communication). In light of this, we conducted a comparison between the species documented in our current study and the List of Species Specified for Ecological Restoration in Various Regions of the State of São Paulo (Barbosa 2017), revealing that 18 of the species identified in our research are recommended for ecological restoration purposes. This suggests that the fragment under study could potentially serve as a valuable source of propagules for rehabilitating degraded areas, either through the identification and marking of seed trees for seed collection and subsequent seedling production, or through the transposition of soil and/or litter (Brancalion et al. 2015).
Hence, the preservation of forest fragments is crucial for species maintenance and subsequent propagation. Even in the absence of human activities targeting the relocation of these propagules to other regions, wildlife itself aids in their dispersal. A study conducted by Neto et al. (2020) examined the seed bank in abandoned eucalyptus areas near conserved fragments and determined that these areas could serve as conducive environments for the natural regeneration of indigenous species, owing to their proximity. Consequently, by conducting a cost-effective evaluation of the soil seed bank, documenting the floral composition, and assessing species density, viable strategies for ecological succession in areas requiring restoration can be delineated (Martins 2001, Brancalion et al. 2015).
This study reveals that there is no significant difference in species diversity at a distance of approximately 30 meters from the watercourse. The distinguishing factor between the border and interior regions lies in the number of individuals and ecological groups present. A delicate ecological balance exists between fauna and flora, with a majority of cataloged species being dispersed by animals. Consequently, the conservation of natural fragments is crucial for preserving plant and animal species, as well as for acquiring propagules necessary for the restoration of degraded areas. The analysis of the seed bank within the study area highlights the potential of the fragment to provide propagules or facilitate litter transposition for ecological restoration, given the acknowledged floristic diversity present.
