ABSTRACT - (Plant community dynamics in an urban forest fragment of the São Paulo Metropolitan Area, Brazil). We 
present a synthesis (2006-2012) of plant community dynamics in an area (1 ha) of the largest remnant of Atlantic Rain Forest 
surrounded by São Paulo city. Plants with ≥ 2.5 cm dbh, including the climbers, were sampled in 10 transects (2 × 50 m), 
and the smaller (> 1 m height, < 2.5 cm dbh) in 10 subtransects (1 × 50 m). We sampled 901 individuals, 125 species (38 
families), 83 classified as late-successional species, 12 threatened with extinction and 56 absent in the area management 
plan, some Endangered (EN) species. The climbers were the most dynamics, they had the largest decrease in basal area; 
and the larger (> 5.0 cm dbh) and shorter (< 2.5 cm dbh) trees had the highest mortality rates of the shrub-tree synusia. Late 
species regeneration was predominant. The studied forest showed progression towards more mature successional stages in 
the monitoring period.
Keywords: climbing plants, demography, permanent plots, secondary forest, understory
RESUMO - (Dinâmica da comunidade vegetal em um fragmento florestal urbano da área metropolitana de São Paulo, 
Brasil). Nós apresentamos uma síntese (2006-2012) da dinâmica da comunidade vegetal em uma área (1 ha) do maior 
remanescente de Mata Atlântica cercado pela cidade de São Paulo. As plantas com dap ≥ 2,5 cm, incluindo as trepadeiras, 
foram amostradas em 10 transectos (2 × 50 m) e as menores (altura > 1 m, dap < 2,5 cm) em 10 subtransectos (1 × 50 m). 
Nós amostramos 901 indivíduos, 125 espécies (38 famílias), 83 classificadas como tardias, 12 ameaçadas e 56 ausentes no 
plano de manejo da área, algumas Em Perigo (EN) de extinção. As trepadeiras foram as mais dinâmicas, com a maior redução 
de área basal; e as árvores maiores (dap > 5,0 cm) e menores (dap < 2,5 cm) tiveram a maior mortalidade da sinúsia arbórea. 
A regeneração de espécies tardias foi a predominante. No período monitorado, a floresta estudada apresentou progressão 
para estádios sucessionais mais maduros.

Introduction
	
Human activities and climate fluctuations have 
been influencing the functioning of ecosystems 
(Holmgren et al. 2001, O’Brien et al. 2012, Seneviratne 
2012), altering their natural regeneration and 
promoting unknown dynamics in plant communities 
(Hubbell & Foster 1992). Forest cycles may be 
shorter, communities may be more dynamic (Körner 
2004, Laurance et al. 2009) and species distributions 
may be changing (Hubbell 2004, Colombo & Joly 
2010, Machado & Oliveira-Filho 2010, Feeley et al. 
2011). The functioning of plant communities need to 
be further studied; this becomes especially important 
when considering the upward trend in the frequency of 
environmental changes (Lavell et al. 2012), the speed 
with which these changes have occurred (Feeley et al. 
2011) and their influence on the remaining ecosystems. 
	
Secondary forests in different regenerative 
processes, like the disturbed forests, are among one of 
the main remaining ecosystems from tropical forests. 
Much of the biodiversity, such as endangered and

rare species, are restricted to fragments of this forest 
(Brown & Lugo 1990, FAO 2010, Farah et al. 2017). 
Different disturbance histories, local conditions, and 
local resources have directed these environments in 
unknown directions, making forecast and diagnosis 
difficult, for management purposes (Chazdon et al. 
2007, Rodrigues et al. 2009, Norden et al. 2009). 
One example is Parque Estadual das Fontes do 
Ipiranga (PEFI), the largest Atlantic Forest remnant 
with completely urbanized surroundings in the 
Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, one of the most 
populous regions in the world (SMA 2008).
	
Subject to numerous disturbances, such as 
fragmentation, isolation, biological invasion, fires, 
pollution, edge effect and heat island (Struffaldi-De-
Vuono 1985, Gomes et al. 2003, SMA 2008), the 
PEFI is an important laboratory for the study of forest 
dynamics, besides the significant climate changes 
seen over the past 85 years (EM-IAG 2017). Studies 
on the plant communities in different parts of PEFI 
showed heterogeneous vegetation cover with patches 
of heavily impacted forest (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, 
Costa & Mantovani 1992, Gomes & Mantovani 2001, 
Pivello & Peccinini 2002, Gomes et al. 2003, Davison 
2009, Eisenlohr et al. 2009, Hirata et al. 2010, Villagra 
& Romaniuc-Neto 2011, Tanus et al. 2012), some in 
evident recovery process and some relatively little 
disturbed (Pivello & Peccinini 2002, Gomes et al. 
2003).
	
Variations in the dynamics of plant communities 
can be evaluated and monitored using permanent 
transects in environments with different historical 
disturbances (Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Oliveira 
2001). Many studies in tropical forests have recorded 
the mortality and recruitment rates of trees in order 
to gather information on the dynamics and structure 
of these communities (Phillips & Gentry 1994, Sheil 
1995a,b, Gomes et al. 2003, Oliveira-Filho et al. 2007, 
Machado & Oliveira-Filho 2010, Laurance et al. 
2014). However, the majority have been done in 
continuous, well-preserved forests and have focused 
on trees (Gomes 1998).
	
In this paper, we decided to evaluate the plant 
community dynamics of different layers and life forms 
over the period of 6.5 years, in an urban forest remnant 
from the PEFI, a protected area surrounded by one of 
the largest urban areas of the world (CONDEPHAAT 
2018). Smaller individuals, such as those found in the 
understory, are representative of forest regeneration 
and may be more sensitive in disturbed environments 
(Gomes et al. 2003, Salles & Schiavini 2007) and more 
dynamic (Condit et al. 1996b, Machado & Oliveira-
Filho 2010, Feeley et al. 2011). Similarly, other 
life forms, such as climbers, can be more dynamic 
when compared to shrubs and trees, as shown by 
ecological studies done with this life form (Wright 
et al. 2004, Phillips et al. 2005, Schnitzer 2005, 
Nepstad et al. 2007, Laurance et al. 2014, Nogueira et 
al. 2014), as we hypothesize to the plant community 
studied. Therefore, we expect smaller individuals 
to have higher mortality and recruitment rates, and 
the climbing plants to have the highest dynamics 
(mortality and recruitment) compared to shrub-tree 
synusia.
	
Differentiated dynamics are also expected in 
relation to successional groups from rainforest 
(Budowski 1965, Swaine et al. 1987, Whitmore 
1989, Gomes et al. 
 2003, Schorn & Galvão 2009) 
such as the PEFI forest, which constitute a mosaic of 
secondary areas at different successional stages (Nastri 
1992, Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Costa & Mantovani 
1992, Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Pivello & Peccinini 
2002, Gomes et al. 2003). Thus, additionally, we 
present the status of successional groups, for which we 
expect differences between mortality and recruitment 
of early and late-successional plants.
Material and methods
Study Area - This study was carried out in Parque 
Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI), 23o38'08"S - 
23o40'18"S and 46o36'48"W - 46o38'00"W), city 
of São Paulo - São Paulo State, Brazil (Fernandes 
2002, CONDEPHAAT 2018). PEFI is located on 
the São Paulo Plateau on crystalline basement rocks 
and sedimentary rocks. Its relief is characterized by 
rounded tops and altitudes ranging from 760 to 837 m. 
The predominant types of soils are Haplic Cambisols 
and Red-Yellow Podzolic Latosol (Oxisol) (SMA 
2008).
	
The PEFI is considered the third-largest state park 
in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region, but it is the largest 
in the metropolis whose surroundings are completely 
urbanized and which contains remnants of the Atlantic 
Rain Forest (SMA 2008). The forest remnants occupy 
approximately 70% of its 495 hectares, according 
to the current limit (CONDEPHAAT 2018), and its 
predominant vegetation is classified as regeneration of 
the Dense Montane Ombrophylous Forest in different 
successional stages (Barros et al. 2002). The remnant 
is a secondary and disturbed forest, in a long recovery 
process (Peccinini & Pivello 2002). The area was

occupied by 12 lots of farmers and ranchers and its 
expropriation began in 1893. Since it is isolated in 
one of the largest metropolitan regions in the world 
it is subject to disturbances such as edge effect, 
biological invasion, pollution, fires and heat island 
effect (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Gomes et al. 2003, 
SMA 2008).
	
Flora has been described in a series of monographs 
by the Botanical Institute (Barros et al. 2002), 
located inside the Park, which has one of the largest 
herbariums in the country. In addition, the park 
has one of the oldest meteorological stations in the 
country and it has carried out measurements without 
interruption since 1932. Comparing the normals 
from 1933-1960 and 1991-2017, it was observed a 
local increase of approximately 1.7 °C in the average 
annual temperature and 320.1 mm increase in the 
average annual rainfall (EM-IAG 2017). The annual 
average temperature is 18.7 °C (1933-2017) with 
average monthly variations varying from 15.3 °C 
(July) to 21.9 °C (February). The average total annual 
precipitation is 1,412.3 mm, more than half of it 
concentrated between December and March (EM-IAG 
2017).
Procedures - Data was collected from 10 transects 
measuring 2 × 50 m (0,1 ha) laid out in the first half of 
2006 (Davison 2009). The permanent transects were 
randomly distributed along a perpendicular 200 m line, 
totaling a sample universe of 1 ha, in a conserved area 
on Botanical Institute, in a recovery process of past 
disturbances, however, that has not been occupied, 
nor the use thereof been changed, for at least 65 years 
(Peccinini & Pivello 2002). The area is located at an 
average altitude of 831 m, on Oxisol soil, and more 
than 100 m away from Cursino Avenue (District of 
Água Funda - São Paulo - SP). In each transect, shrubs, 
trees, vines, palms, tree ferns individuals with a stem 
diameter at breast height (dbh), i.e. 1.30 m from the 
soil, of at least > 2.5 cm were measured and identified, 
the same for the growing roots of hemiepiphytes 
at ≤ 1.30 m from the soil (Gentry’s protocol 1982, 
Phillips & Miller 2002). In 10 subtransects (1 × 50 m), 
all plants with < 2.5 cm dbh and > 1 m height (h) were 
sampled (figure 1).
	
All individuals were marked with numbered 
plastic plates and fixed with galvanized wire around 
the stem leaving room for the plant to grow. The height 
of each individual was estimated using a graduated 
ruler and an electronic measuring tape. The diameter 
at breast height (dbh) of individuals, including all 
branches with a dbh of at least > 2.5 cm, was measured

in late winter, between the second half of August and 
the first half of September 2012, which is the driest 
period of the year. That is, 6.5 years after the first 
measurement that was performed on March 2006 
(Davison 2009).
	
Vegetative or fertile branches were collected, 
when present, from shrubs and trees for herborization 
and identification. Climbers were not botanically 
identified in order to avoid interference from the 
collection of stem on the climbers’ dynamics, a single 
collection could cause the death of the monitored 
individual (Sheil 1995a). This means that only the 
structure and dynamics of this synusia, as a whole, 
were evaluated, without performing floristic study for 
this synusia.
	
Shrubs and trees individuals sampled in 2006 
and those recruited during the study period were 
identified via comparison with herbarium specimens, 
references in the relevant literature and confirmation 
with researchers from the Herbarium of the São 
Paulo Botanical Institute (SP) and from the São Paulo 
Forestry Institute (SPSF). The botanical nomenclature 
from the Brazilian Flora Species List (Flora do Brasil 
2020 under construction 2019) was used, according

to the APG IV system (APG IV 2016). Vouchers have 
been deposited in the Herbarium of the São Paulo 
Botanical Institute (SP, Maria Eneyda, P. K. Fidalgo).
	
The identified individuals were classified into 
two successional groups: Early and Late. This 
classification was based on field observations as 
well as by using some papers that adapted classical 
concepts (Budowski 1965, Denslow 1980, Swaine & 
Whitmore 1988, Whitmore 1989) to Brazilian forests 
(Gandolfi et al. 1995, Ivanauskas et al. 1999, Gandolfi 
2000, Paula et al. 2004, Bernacci et al. 2006, Catharino 
et al. 2006, Guaratini et al. 2008, Ramos et al. 2011).
Data Analysis - Calculations were carried out to 
determine mortality and recruitment for the plant 
community, as well as growth rates and the proportion 
of dead and recruited basal area for the plants with 
> 2.5 cm dbh over the period of 6.5 years (March 
2006 to September 2012). The relative growth and 
the distribution of shrub and tree diameters were 
also evaluated.  For the dynamics of the basal area, 
recruiting was considered as the sum of the relative 
value to the basal area of plants recruited in 2012 
and the relative value to the growth of the remaining 
plants from 2006.
	
Demographic rates were calculated for plants 
with < 2.5 cm dbh (> 1 m height) and > 2.5 cm dbh. 
Three class sizes were also considered for the shrub-
tree synusia: I) < 2.5 cm dbh (> 1 m height), II) 2.5 < 
dbh < 5 cm and III) > 5 cm dbh.
	
Significant differences between rates were 
assessed using the Student’s t-test for normally 
distributed data (means and standard error were 
presented) or the Mann-Whitney test (medians = 
Mdn were presented). One-way Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA) and post-hoc test of Tukey - Kramer were 
used to compare the three tree and shrub size classes. 
The assumptions were checked with the Shapiro-Wilk 
tests and Q-Q plot for normal distribution and Levene’s 
test for homogeneity of variance. The degree of spatial 
dependence of the values was quantified by analysis of 
correlations according to Legendre & Fortin (1989), 
with later adjustment (decrease of two degrees of 
freedom). Mortality (Mr) and recruitment (Rr) rates 
were calculated algebraically and not logarithmically, 
as recommended by Sheil and colleagues (1995):
Mr = {1-[(NO-m)/NO]1/Δt} × 100
Rr = {[(NO + r)/NO]1/Δt-1} × 100
NO = initial number of individuals, m = number of 
deaths in the period between censuses (Δt = t1‑t0), 
r  =  number of individuals recruited, excluding 
recruited dead, between censuses (Gomes et al. 2003).
	
In order to evaluate mortality versus recruitment, 
the proportions of the dead and recruited throughout 
the period (6.5 years) were used. To this end, the 
formulas used were:
Mtotal = (m/NO) × 100
Rtotal = (r/NO) × 100
	
Differences in the distribution of individuals’ 
diameters between 2006 and 2012 were evaluated 
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Based on 
the diameter differences, relative growth rates 
(RGR, Welden et al. 1991) of shrubs and trees were 
determined by:
RGR = {[(dbht / dbht0)1/Δt]-1} × 100
	
Calculations were automated by function 
developed in the R software environment (R Core 
Team 2019). The help page and function script can 
be found at Kondrat (2014).
Results
Composition and Structure in 2012 - A total of 901 
individuals were sampled (survivors from 2006 and 
the dead and recruited during the study period, table 1), 
out of which 708 belong to the shrub-tree synusia, 190 
to the climbers and three to the hemiepiphytes (two 
recruited and one survivor). Of the three ferns, which 
existed in 2006 and were included in the shrub-tree 
group, one survived until 2012. The growth rate for 
the group of all plants and sizes reflected an increase 
in the total number of individuals (lambda > 1, 95% 
CI = 1.003 + 0.003).
	
On the other hand, results showed a decrease in 
the number of individuals (lambda < 1) of the shrub-
tree synusia (95% CI = 0.993 + 0.005) and climbers 
(95% CI = 0.951 + 0.003) with > 2.5 cm dbh (table 1). 
Similarly, all early-successional plants showed a 
decrease in the number of individuals (lambda < 1, 
95% CI = 0.982 + 0.015, table 1).
	
The total number of identified species was 129, 
125 belonging to the shrub-tree synusia (one exotic 
species - Coffea arabica L.), one to the hemiepiphyte 
synusia (Philodendron appendiculatum Nadruz & 
Mayo) and three of the climber synusia which, in 2006, 
had been included in the shrub-tree group (Hippocratea 
volubilis L., Salacia elliptica (Mart.) G. Don and 
Machaerium brasiliense Vogel). A total of 39 families

were identified. Myrtaceae (29 species), Lauraceae 
(15 species), Rubiaceae (10 species) and Fabaceae (8 
species) were the families with the highest number of 
species. With the collection of vegetative and fertile 
material, it was possible to identify 56 species that did 
not appear on the Park Management Plan (table 2).
	
A total of 155 individuals (42 species) sampled in 
the shrub-tree synusia were classified into the early-
successional group and 550 individuals (83 species) 
into the late-successional group (table 1). The two 
ferns and one Myrtaceae with > 2.5 cm dbh (dead and 
without material for identification at the species level) 
were not classified or considered in this count.
	
In 2006 and 2012, 122 and 118 species were identified 
in the shrub-tree synusia, respectively; most species 
(115 species) were present in both surveys (table 2). In 
2012, this synusia was composed of 37 families, but the 
Asteraceae and Clusiaceae families were not present. 
The most abundant species in 2006 and 2012 were (table 
2): Geonoma gamiova Barb.Rodr. (Relative Density - 
RD = 6.06 and 6.82%, respectively for 2006 and 2012), 
Calyptranthes grandifolia O.Berg (RD = 6.06 and 5.74%), 
Cordiera myrciifolia (K.Schum.) C.H. Perss. & Delprete 
(RD = 4.35 and 4.19%), Rudgea jasminoides (Cham.) 
Müll.Arg. (RD = 4.50 and 3.88%) and Pouteria reticulata 
(Engl.) Eyma (RD = 3.88 and 4.34%).
	
The maximum height recorded in the community 
was 18 m for a specimen of Aspidosperma olivaceum 
Müll.Arg (Apocynaceae), the median dbh value for 
shrub-tree synusia was 5 cm and the biggest dbh was 
43.3 cm referring to a specimen of Tapirira guianensis 
Aubl. (Anacardiaceae). The median dbh value for 
the climbers was 4.6 cm and the maximum observed 
value was 22.3 cm. The distribution of diameters 
(dbh) of live plants in 2012 did not differ from that 
in 2006 (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, n1 = 367, n2 = 
385, D = 0.05, p = 0.81, figure 2a). The mean relative 
diameter growth of the plants in the shrub-tree synusia 
was 1.14% year-1 (Mdn = 0.58% year‑1), the minimum 
growth was zero and the maximum 9.05% year-1 in 
regards to a specimen of Cryptocarya mandioccana 
Meisn. (Lauraceae). The diameter growth of plants 
with 2.5 < dbh < 5 cm (Mdn = 0.48% year-1) did not 
differ from that of plants with > 5 cm dbh (Mdn = 
0.7% year-1, Mann-Whitney Test, n1 = 185, n2 = 166, 
z = 1,549, p = 0.12, figure 2b).

In 6.5 years, the increase in the basal area of the 
shrub-tree synusia (> 2.5 cm dbh) was significantly 
higher than the reduction, leading to an increase 
in the total basal area from 24.32 to 27.10 m2 ha-1 
(table 3) and to a significant difference between gain 
(Mdn = 14.71%) and loss (Mdn = 4.95%) of basal 
area (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 11, p = 0.002, lambda 
> 1, 95% CI = 1.015 + 0.007). The basal area of 
climbers decreased from 1.564 m2 ha-1 to 1.559 m2 ha-1 
(table 3) with no significant difference between gain  
(Mdn = 27.48%) and loss (Mdn = 49.87%) in the 
period (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 45, p = 0.734). On 
the other hand, their basal area reduction was greater 
than that of the plants in the shrub-tree community 
(Mann-Whitney Test, U = 12, p = 0.003, lambda < 1, 
95% CI = 0.970 + 0.009).
Plant Dynamics - Concerning the shrub-tree versus 
climbers dynamics, the annual mortality of climbers 
was greater than that of plants in the shrub-tree synusia 
in both classes, < 2.5 cm dbh (Mann-Whitney Test, 
U = 7, p = 0.0004) and > 2.5 cm dbh (Mann-Whitney 
Test, U = 16; p = 0.009; figure 3 and table 4).
	
Likewise, the annual recruitment of climbers in 
the class with < 2.5 cm dbh was also greater than of 
plants in the shrub-tree synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, 
U = 7.5, p = 0.0005, figure 3). However, the annual 
recruitment of climbers in the class with > 2.5 cm dbh 
did not differ from the annual recruitment of shrubs 
and trees in this size class (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 
45, p = 0.73, figure 3).
	
The annual mortality of plants with < 2.5 cm dbh 
did not differ from that of plants with > 2.5 cm dbh in 
the shrub-tree synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 31.5, 
p = 0.171) and in the climbers synusia (Mann-Whitney 
Test, U = 41.5, p = 0.538). However, the annual plant 
recruitment in the smallest class (< 2.5 cm dbh) was 
greater than that of plants with > 2.5 cm dbh both in the 
shrub-trees synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 0, p = 
0.00001) and in the climbers synusia (Mann-Whitney 
Test, U = 8, p = 0.0006, figure 3).
	
The division of the shrub-tree synusia into three 
class sizes showed that the annual mortality rates

were different among the classes (F = 6.30, df = 23, 
p = 0.007, figure 4). Class II (2.5 < dbh < 5 cm) 
had average (+ SE) of 0.65 + 0.25% year-1, lower 
mortality than the Class I ( < 2.5 cm dbh) average of 
2.32 + 0.41% year-1 (p = 0.01, post-hoc test of Tukey - 
Kramer) and lower than the Class III (dbh > 5 cm) 
average of 2.12 + 0.29% year-1 (p = 0.02, post-hoc 
test of Tukey - Kramer). The annual recruitment rates 
also differed in the three studied classes (F = 6.15, 
df = 23, p = 0.008, figure 4). Class I had an average 
(+ SE) of 2.99 + 0.26% year-1, higher than the average 
recruitment of Class II of 1.37 + 0.25% year-1 (p = 0.01,

compared to recruitment (Mdn = 7.14%, Mann-
Whitney Test, U = 28, p = 0.097). Excluding the 
extreme values of an area where there was 100% 
mortality and recruitment, mortality (Mdn = 20%) 
was significantly greater than recruitment (Mdn = 
0%, Mann Whitney Test, U = 18.5, p = 0.05). In this 
period, recruitment of shrubs and trees with < 2.5 cm 
dbh (= 19.65 + 2.03) did not differ from the mortality 
(= 12.96 + 2.22%, t-test, df = 7, t = 2.22, 0.05 < p < 
0.10), despite the trend. However, climbers with < 2.5 
cm dbh showed greater recruitment(Mdn = 100%, 
Mann-Whitney test, U = 17, p = 0.011) than mortality 
(Mdn = 41.67%).
Successional Group Dynamics - Mortality (Mdn = 
9.19%) was greater (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 18, 
p = 0.007) than recruitment (Mdn = 0%) in early-
successional plants with > 2.5 cm dbh during the 
6.5‑year period, and there was no significant difference 
between rates in early-successional plants with 
< 2.5 cm dbh. Late-successional plants with > 2.5 cm 
dbh did not present significant differences (t test, 
t = 1.21, p = 0.24) between mortality (= 7.67 + 1.24%) 
and recruitment (= 5.53 + 1.26%), whereas those with 
< 2.5 cm dbh had higher (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 16, 
p = 0.026) recruitment (Mdn = 20.0%) than mortality 
(Mdn = 7.14%) during the same period.
	
Comparing the dynamics of the two successional 
plant groups with > 2.5 cm dbh showed that the annual 
mortality of early-successional plants did not differ 
from that of late-successional plants (Mann-Whitney 
Test, U = 45, p = 0.73, table 4), whereas the annual 
recruitment of late-successional plants was higher than 
that of early-successional plants (U = 22, p = 0.02, 
figure 5).
	
When the dynamics of both successional plant 
groups with dbh < 2.5 cm were compared, no 
significant differences were found between the annual 
mortality rates of successional groups (Mann-Whitney 
Test, U = 31, p = 0.16). However, annual recruitment 
rate of late-successional plants was higher than that 
of early-successional plants (U = 11.5, p = 0.003, 
figure 5).
Discussion
	
In 2006 and 2012 the most abundant species, 
considering all sampled sizes, were late-successional 
species representative of the main families appearing in 
later successional stages of the Dense Ombrophylous 
Forest (Tabarelli & Mantovani 1999, Catharino 2006, 
Arzolla 2011). Myrtaceae, Lauraceae, Rubiaceae, 
and Fabaceae were the richest families (around 50% 
of the total species found, table 2), the first two with 
the greatest richness which is characteristic of mature 
Dense Montane Ombrophylous Forest (Tabarelli & 
Mantovani 1999, Franco et al. 2007, Arzolla et al. 
2011).
	
In this study, Fabaceae, which is characteristic 
of environments at earlier successional stages and 
seasonal forests, was not among the first three richest 
and most abundant families. This result differed from 
what has been shown in other previous studies done 
in the park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Nastri et al.

Figure 5. Distribution of the annual mortality (M) and recruitment (R) rates of plants with < 2.5 cm dbh (1) and > 2.5 cm dbh (2), classified 
in Early (E) and Late (L) successional categories, in the 10 permanent transects. The letters represent the comparisons of mortality or 
recruitment of size classes between successional categories. Letters that are the same represent medians that are not significantly different 
according to the Mann-Whitney test, at a significance level of 5%.
1992, Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Pivello & Peccinini 
2002, Eisenlohr et al. 2009, Hirata et al. 2010, Tanus 
et al. 2012). Similarly, the family Euphorbiaceae was 
not among the most represented families. The study 
area is in a more mature successional stage, with low 
abundance and richness of early-successional species 
such as those of the genus Machaerium (Fabaceae) 
and Alchornea (Euphorbiaceae) which are common in 
less mature areas of the park. The highest recruitment 
and predominance of late-successional species and 
higher mortality in the early-successional group in 
the area, seem to point to the progression of forest 
regeneration, the same results obtained in an area 
(Gomes et al. 2003) and different from other areas of 
the park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Knobel 1995).
	
Of the 125 species identified in the area from 
the shrub-tree synusia, 12 are listed in the threatened 
categories “Endangered” or “Vulnerable” (Martinelli 
& Moraes 2013, MMA 2014, SMA 2016, IUCN 
2019). Among the Endangered, one species (Eugenia 
pruinosa D.Legrand, Myrtaceae) is among the ten 
most abundant. In the set of species identified, we 
also highlight Gonatogyne brasiliensis (Baill.) Müll.
Arg. (Phyllanthaceae), a rare species with only 52 
records for the State of São Paulo (Arzolla 2011, 
CRIA 2019). This demonstrates the importance of 
remnants of secondary forest, like urban forests in a 
recovery process, as a shelter for rare and endangered 
species (Brown & Lugo 1990, Norden et al. 2009, 
FAO 2010). Comparing the list from this paper and 
that from the Park Management Plan (SMA 2008), we 
observed that 56 species identified in this study are 
not included in the plan, out of which, five are listed 
in some threatened category. These are important 
information to strengthen the protection of forest 
remnants and contribute to the updating information 
of the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga.
	
Despite the existence of other exotic species 
in fragments of the park (SMA 2008, Petri et al. 
2018), just Coffea arabica L. (coffee) was present in 
the sampling units (recruited in 2012, table 2). The 
presence of this species is related to the history of 
the park area, it was previously grown in small farms 
located where the park now stands (SMA 2008). This 
species is dispersed by animals and develops in shaded 
areas, such as the understory studied (Instituto Hórus  
2019). Currently, the species is classified as Non-
Dominant Invader in the study area (Petri et al. 2018) 
and presents intermediate priority for extirpation from 
protected areas (Durigan et al. 2013). Therefore, the 
permanent monitoring of the park fragments will 
contribute to the correct management of this species.
	
As shown in other studies in the park (Struffaldi-
De-Vuono 1985, Nastri et al. 1992, Knobel 1995, 
Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Tanus 2012), the 
community trees are small in relation to others 
tropical forests, what is related to the dynamics 
and growth of plants (Lieberman et al. 1990, 
Condit et al. 1999). A large proportion of the 
specimens showed slow growth (Mdn = 0.58% year-1, 
 = 1.14% year-1), lower than in another patch of the 
same park in recovery process (Mdn = 0.72% year-1,

Kondrat et al.: Forest dynamics in an urban fragment
  13
 = 1.52% year-1, Gomes 1998). There was no relative 
growth difference recorded between the size classes, 
despite the tendency observed in some studies (Swaine 
et al. 1987, Silva et al. 1995, Gomes et al. 2003). 
Growth is related to the prevalence of a continuous 
canopy and the predominance of small clearings in the 
area (Costa & Mantovani 1992, Davinson 2009) with 
abundance of late-successional plants and understory 
individuals, which generally have slower growth 
(Worbes 1989, Welden et al. 1991, Felfilli 1995, 
Condit et al. 1999). Lieberman and colleagues (1990) 
found that many plants had no diameter growth over 
the course of 30 years in Neotropical forests. Growth 
rates are quite variable; this is related to the different 
environmental conditions as well as to the species’ and 
individuals’ life history and phenotypes (Swaine et al. 
1987, Worbes 1989, Sheil 1995a, Silva et al. 1995).
	
The short stature of canopy trees in mountain 
tropical forests is also due to high turnover (Herwitz 
& Young 1994). As expected and shown in other 
studies (Condit et al. 1996b, Machado & Oliveira-
Filho 2010, Feeley et al. 2011, Laurance et al. 2014), 
the smallest plants were the most dynamic, with the 
largest recruitment. However, the larger ones also had 
the highest mortality rates, as observed in another 
area of the park (Gomes et al. 2003). The highest 
mortality rates, quantified in the extreme size classes 
(< 2.5 cm and > 5 cm dbh), may reflect the fragility of 
small plants (Salles & Schiavini 2007), more prone to 
lethal damage (Sheil et al. 2000), and of larger trees, 
as senescent pioneers, in competition with other plants 
in the community (Felfili 1995, Schorn & Galvão 
2009). However, late-successional plants predominate 
the community, and even though early-successional 
plants show an evident decline, it is not correct to 
state that overall mortality is due only to the death of 
this plants, given that the death of  late-successional 
plants also represented a considerable percentage of 
deaths during the study period. 
	
The death of large specimens caused by some 
disturbance in the past, as noted in other areas of the 
park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Gomes & Mantovani 
2001, Peccinini & Pivello 2002, Gomes et al. 2003) 
may have facilitated light reaching the lower layer of 
the forest and promoted higher turnover of smaller 
plants, influencing the establishment of climbers, 
mainly the woody climbers (lianas). The maintenance 
of lianas depends on the availability of large trees in 
the forest (Engel et al. 1998, Phillips et al. 2005, Sfair 
et al. 2013). 
	
Climbers were the most dynamic life form, as was 
also observed by Wright (2004), Phillips et al. (2005) 
and Laurance et al. (2014). Penhalber & Mantovani 
(1997) noticed that plants of that synusia were the 
ones that produced the largest number of propagules 
in the park, which would favor higher recruitment. 
On the other hand, their low seedling establishment, 
especially in more mature forests (Engel 1998, 
Schnitzer 2005), would reduce, in the long term, 
recruitment to classes of larger sizes, as noted herein. 
Although less abundant, climbers had the largest 
decrease in basal area, accounting for 36% of the total 
decrease in the community, unlike plants from the 
shrub-tree synusia which had higher recruitment than 
loss in the basal area during the period. This decrease 
in lianas could be related to the maturing of the area. 
However, only the largest lianas, already established 
(> 2.5 cm dbh), had higher mortality than recruitment 
and a tendency to decrease (lambda < 1).
	
The observed dynamism seems to be associated 
with local conditions and environmental resources. 
The park area has been protected since 1893 and the 
use of the sampled area has not changed for at least 65 
years (Peccinini & Pivello 2002). Variations in water 
availability, temperature (Feeley et al. 2011), light 
and mineral nutrients are correlated with changes in 
the dynamics of plant communities (Laurance et al. 
2009, Machado & Oliveira-Filho 2010).
	
The soil of the park is very acidic and poor 
in nutrients (Struffaldi De Vuono 1985, Gomes & 
Mantovani 2001); however, it is similar to that of other 
forests in Southeastern Brazil (Gomes & Mantovani 
2001). Moraes (2002) in a study of litter production 
and decomposition in the 1990s found no abnormalities 
in a preserved area of the park. An important fact to 
consider is that the park vegetation was exposed to gas 
emissions from a nearby steel mill for about 60 years. 
These gases were responsible for the pollution of the 
forest, death of trees and the degraded state of part 
of the vegetation, according to Struffaldi-De-Vuono 
(1985). Nagaoka & Marcelli (1989) also attributed 
the considerable decrease of lichens in the park to 
this factor. The area is still exposed to air pollution 
from its fully urbanized surroundings. Domingos 
et al. (2002) found some evidence of atmospheric 
pollution in herbaceous bioindicator plants located 
outside the forest. Therefore, specific studies are 
needed in the current decade, considering trees and 
lianas developing in forest soil, to test the cumulative 
and current effects of pollution on plant dynamics.

Another important factor that has a relation with 
local conditions and resources and we suggest for 
research is the climate, associated with the effects 
of urbanization and the formation of heat islands 
(Marengo 2007, Dias et al. 2013). Ecological studies 
have shown an increasing relationship between the 
high mortality of trees and climbers and climate 
extremes (Hubbell & Foster 1992, Condit et al. 
1996a,b, Curran et al. 1999, Nepstad et al. 2007, 
Feeley et al. 2011). Rainfall monitoring in the park 
itself over the course of 85 years (1933-2018) reveals 
irregularities in short periods of time, as in the studied 
period, which had the driest month (July 2008) and 
even the wettest month and the second wettest year 
(January 2010) of the whole historical series (EM-IAG 
2017). Even though lianas have greater competitive 
advantage (Schnitzer 2005), and the smaller shows 
increasing abundance (Laurance et al. 2014), as 
well as observed, they depend on well-developed 
phorophytes to transition to larger size classes and to 
thrive (Phillips et al. 2005, Sfair et al. 2013, Nogueira 
et al. 2014). As shown, the study area presents small 
trees with slow growth, and the larger ones (> 2.5 
cm) presented higher mortality in comparison to the 
recruitment, which is critical for the maintenance 
of the abundance and basal area of the larger lianas 
(Nogueira et al. 2014). 
	
Although the studied area shows progress toward 
a mature stage of regeneration as discussed initially, 
specific studies are needed to directly assess the 
influence of the factors mentioned here on forest 
dynamics. For an isolated forest fragment as the one 
in the present study, within a highly urbanized area, 
without any nearby forest fragments, what is expected 
is an erosion of species in time (Turner et al. 1995, 
Turner 1996). On the other hand, the local history 
(Chazdon et al. 2007, Norden et al. 2009), more 
protective actions in the area in relation to removal 
of flora and fauna specimens, fewer occurrences of 
fire and especially cessation of emissions from the 
neighboring steel mill have favored the regeneration of 
the vegetation cover, as also shown in another area of 
the Park (Gomes et al. 2003). Despite it is isolated and 
has fully urbanized surroundings, the remnant is an 
important source of propagules and shelter of various 
endangered species, besides providing ecosystem 
services. This reinforces the importance of this urban 
forest, in the face of the numerous anthropic pressures. 
The permanent monitoring of the community and of 
existing populations of this and other areas of the 
fragment, including the climbing plants, may explain 
how diversity relates to ecosystem resilience and to 
local factors that can influence forest health.
