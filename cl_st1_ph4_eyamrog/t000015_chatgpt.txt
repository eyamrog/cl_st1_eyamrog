This study, through an analysis of 25,671 journals that are often overlooked in common journal counts, along with Web of Science and Scopus, reveals that scholarly communication is a more globally inclusive effort than commonly acknowledged. These journals, utilizing the open-source publishing platform Open Journal Systems (OJS), have collectively published 5.8 million items and are spread across 136 countries, with a significant majority (79.9%) located in the Global South. Furthermore, a large portion (84.2%) of these journals adhere to the OA diamond model, which entails no charges for readers or authors. A notable aspect is that nearly half of the journals (48.3%) operate in multiple languages, with research being published in a total of 60 languages, with English, Indonesian, Spanish, and Portuguese leading the way. These journals cover a wide range of disciplines, with a distribution of 45.9% in the social sciences, 40.3% in STEM, and 13.8% in the humanities. Despite their diversity in terms of geography, language, and subject area, only a small fraction (1.2%) are indexed in the Web of Science and 5.7% in Scopus. Conversely, 1.0% are listed in Cabells Predatory Reports, and 1.4% appear in Beall’s questionable list. This paper aims to contribute to and contextualize the expanded scale and diversity of scholarly publishing, with the hope that this recognition will enable humanity to fully leverage what is increasingly becoming a global research enterprise.
In 2018, Philip G. Altbach and Hans de Wit, esteemed scholars in higher education at Boston College, published an article titled "Too Much Academic Research Is Being Published" in University World News. Altbach and de Wit highlight the ambiguity surrounding the exact number of scientific journals, with estimates suggesting approximately 30,000 exist. They argue that this abundance signifies a crisis in academic publishing, attributing it to excessive pressure on top-tier journals and the proliferation of predatory publishers disseminating substandard research. Their proposal advocates for measures to curtail the volume of research being published. This article not only challenges prevailing journal estimates but also underscores the importance of acknowledging the research contributions from the Global South. The analysis draws from data sourced from 25,671 journals utilizing the Open Journal Systems (OJS), an open-source editorial management and publishing platform developed by the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) in 2002. As authors of this paper, our affiliation with PKP is disclosed in the Competing Interests statement appended to this article.
Earlier research on Journals Using Open Journal Systems (JUOJS) identified 9,828 journals in 2015 (Alperin, Stranack, Garnett, 2016). A survey involving 2,114 JUOJS staff members revealed that 97.8% of these journals were open access (OA), with 13.6% implementing Article Processing Charges (APC) for OA provision (Alperin, Stranack & Hanson, 2017; also see Edgar & Willinsky, 2010). These findings indicate that 84.2% of JUOJS fall under the category of "OA diamond," meaning they do not charge authors or readers for access. This statistic contrasts with a more recent study, which estimated that 60% of JUOJS are OA diamond journals among a potential range of "at least 17,000, but likely up to 29,000, OA diamond journals" (Bosman et al., 2021, p. 93). In the context of this paper's discussion on indexing, Bosman and colleagues suggest that despite their established presence in academic frameworks, OA diamond journals encounter challenges in being fully integrated into the scholarly publication ecosystem (p. 84).
The challenge of achieving proper integration has a postcolonial background that Altbach delved into in his work "University as Center and Periphery" back in 1981. He highlighted the predicament of "peripheral universities" in the "Third World," characterizing them as primarily knowledge distributors reliant on central institutions for innovation and guidance. These institutions face significant hurdles in developing research capabilities, with limited opportunities for Third World intellectuals to publish their scholarly works, creative writing, and research reports due to the disinterest of publishers in Third World authors. Altbach viewed this as a manifestation of a potent "colonial educational heritage," akin to neocolonialism, which poses formidable challenges for the establishment of fully autonomous and effective publishing ventures within the African continent. He cautioned that universities in these regions not only grapple with the entrenched power dynamics rooted in history and economics but also contend with the industrialized nations' strong inclination to uphold their dominant positions.
The concept of "intellectual imperialism," as articulated by Syed Hussien Alatas from the University of Malaya in the late 1960s, has been widely discussed in academic circles. This phenomenon has led to the development of the "academic dependency" theory, as highlighted by Syed Farid Alatas from the National University of Singapore and the University of Malaya. Alatas emphasizes the various dependencies faced by researchers from the Global South, particularly the pressure to publish in prestigious international journals listed in the Web of Science while also considering local language publications. The Journal of Unconventional Journals and Serials (JUOJS) represents a departure from this recognition dependency, aligning with Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o's call to shift the center of academic discourse away from the West towards a more diverse representation of global cultures. Thiong'o sees this as a crucial aspect of a broader decolonization process, challenging the dominance of Western-centric perspectives in academia.
In the early 2000s, Ezra Ondari-Okemwa, an information science scholar at Machakos University, highlighted the region's deficiencies in technological capabilities to support electronic knowledge transfer and scholarly publishing, alongside the lack of visibility in regional publications (2007). This situation poses a significant challenge for researchers, as articulated by PLOS publisher Alison Muddit, who emphasized the necessity of establishing credibility and visibility within the global research system. Researchers in the Global South are faced with a dilemma, torn between the urge to strengthen local platforms that cater to local needs and the pressure to conform to the established norms dictated by the Global North (2020; also see Alperin and Rozemblum, 2017).
This paper aims to shed light on how editors, publishers, and researchers globally, particularly in the Global South, have utilized an open-source publishing platform to establish a successful scholarly publishing endeavor, contrary to Altbach's skepticism. The scope of this endeavor will be examined across key dimensions of scholarly publishing: (a) geographical location, (b) language, (c) field of study, and (d) indexing. By including marginalized researchers, this paper illustrates how scholarly publishing in the Global South is reshaping the perceived center to encompass a diverse range of perspectives. This diversification is enhancing the scholarly literature in various disciplines, although its full potential for research advancement is just beginning to be acknowledged and harnessed.
The Journal Usage and Open Journal Systems (JUOJS) incorporate an optional PKP Beacon, introduced alongside the software in 2015, which allows PKP to inform OJS users about security patches and software upgrades. The beacon also transmits indexing details about the journal, such as the title, ISSN, number of published items, titles, and abstracts. This study adhered to the standard set by the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ, 2020) for "active" journals, which is defined as publishing a minimum of five items annually. In 2020, the resulting publicly available dataset comprised 25,671 journals, representing 36.5% of the 70,214 OJS beacons operational at that time (Khanna et al., 2021). The growth in OJS-utilizing journals over the past decade has displayed an upward trend (see Figure 1). The journals within the dataset had an average of 38.1 items published in 2020, totaling 996,000 items, with a cumulative publication count of 5.4 million items since their inception. On average, an OJS installation, capable of generating multiple journals, hosts 2.62 active journals.
The country of origin of a journal was determined through a three-step process. Initially, the ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) of the journal was utilized to query the LOC ISSN lookup API for location, resulting in the acquisition of a MARC code. This MARC code was then correlated to a specific country (Raoni, 2021). In cases where MARC codes corresponded to regions or states within a country, manual adjustments were made to accurately reflect the respective countries. Subsequently, the top-level domains extracted from the journal URLs were matched with their corresponding ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. Finally, the IP address of the journal host was geolocated using an updated version of the GeoLite2 Free Geolocation Data on a weekly basis.
The beacon data unveiled JUOJS in 136 countries, with 20 journals lacking a specific country identification. Indonesia emerges as the frontrunner with 11,535 journals, constituting 45.0% of the total, closely trailed by Brazil with 2,653 journals, representing 10.3%. The top ten countries collectively contribute to 74.6% of the total journals. Despite this concentration, the global distribution of these journals is extensive, showcasing pockets of heightened utilization across various regions.
The economic distribution of JUOJS was examined based on the four World Bank income groups (Figure 4). According to gross national income (GNI) per capita, the majority of JUOJS, amounting to 81.1%, are situated in the World Bank's middle-income countries, while only 53 JUOJS (0.2%) are found in the 27 low-income countries. This indicates that 81.6% of the journals originate from countries associated with the Global South based on national income (Haug, 2021). Looking at it from a geopolitical standpoint and utilizing the five United Nations Regional Groups, it is observed that 78.1% of the JUOJS are distributed across three UN regional groups linked with the Global South (Dados & Connell, 2012): Asia-Pacific States (54.7%), Latin American and Caribbean States (21%), and African States (2.4%) (Figure 5).
To ascertain the languages of publication for the JUOJS, we utilized Google’s Compact Language Detector v3 (gcld3) on the 100 most recent articles within the ISSN-verified subset of JUOJS. Gcld3, a freely accessible pre-trained neural classifier, includes a feature for language predictions that triggers when the anticipated language classification surpasses a specified probability threshold. Only dependable language classifications were preserved for each journal. Subsequently, the predominant language classification for each journal was identified as the primary language of publication. In cases where gcld3 identified the article abstracts of a particular journal as being in multiple languages (with a minimum of 5 articles per language), the journal was labeled as multilingual. Furthermore, various heuristic assessments were conducted to confirm the primary language of publication for each journal, such as cross-referencing predicted languages with top-level domains, leading to the manual correction of 478 journals. Notably, two less supported languages, Balochi and Faroese, were not recognized by gcld3 and were instead identified through top-level domain searches.
Language detection software revealed that research articles were being published in 60 different languages by the JUOJS. To validate this finding, a sample journal was manually verified for each language, as detailed in Table 1. The language classifications for all ISSN-verified JUOJS (n = 22,561) were then provided to Google Scholar to enhance the breadth of its journal indexing across various languages. This collaborative effort aimed to expand the accessibility and visibility of research published in diverse linguistic contexts.
Nearly half of the JUOJS published articles are primarily in English (49.7%), with the top ten languages representing 97.0% of the titles (Figure 6). In contrast, Scopus features publications in 40 languages, with English accounting for 92.6% of the documents (rather than journals), followed by 2.8% in Chinese and 1.3% in Spanish (Vera-Baceta, Thelwall & Kousha, 2019).
The significant linguistic diversity observed among JUOJS challenges the prevailing notion that "English is the language of science," as highlighted in a recent headline in Nature (Elnathan, 2021). The dominance of English in academic research and scholarly discourse emerged predominantly in the latter part of the twentieth century, following a period where French and German also held prominence. Historically, medieval Latin was the language of scholarship in the Western world; however, the introduction of knowledge from the Islamic world in Arabic, facilitated by the twelfth-century translation movement, marked a pivotal shift in academic communication (Hunter-Konos, 2015; Willinsky, 2017, pp. 117-152).
In the current landscape, English hegemony is being contested under the banner of "bibliodiversity," a concept championed by Monica Berger of New York City College of Technology, who positions it as central to the decolonization of the Open Access movement in research (2021; Shearer, 2019). A collective "position statement" on this issue of research and language has been released by Federico Navarro, a scholar from La Universidad de O'Higgins in Chile, along with eleven other academics from various regions worldwide. This statement challenges the assumptions surrounding the use of English as a 'lingua franca' in scientific and academic spheres, highlighting its negative impact on knowledge creation. It advocates for the adoption of multiple languages and dialects to foster transnational dialogues in scientific and academic contexts (2022). Similarly, Suresh Canagarajah, based at Penn State, envisions bibliodiversity as a means to gradually dismantle power structures, aiming to decolonize writing and scholarship by creating diverse communicative spaces. This, he believes, will complement ongoing efforts for significant institutional and policy transformations (2022, p. 20). The dedication to such transformative shifts in scholarly communication is evident in the diverse group of endorsers of the 2019 Helsinki Initiative on Multilingualism.
Within the JUOJS, English holds a dominant position in research, yet an intriguing linguistic aspect is that 48.3% of publications are in multiple languages (Figure 7). The interplay among the top four languages is evident in both mono- and multilingual journals (Figure 8). Monolingual English journals, the largest group at 6,651 titles (represented by a single dot in the first column), are followed by Indonesian-English bilingual journals with 4,431 titles, and Portuguese-Spanish-English trilingual journals with 550 titles, showcasing significant bibliodiversity. It is important to consider that the prevalence of English might be inflated, given that titles and abstracts, crucial for language analysis, are often translated from other languages. Moreover, articles occasionally incorporate multiple languages within their text, such as Spanish and Castilian, or Bahasa Indonesia and Javanese.
To evaluate the research coverage of JUOJS, we initially combined the titles and abstracts of the five most recent articles from ISSN-verified journals. These concatenated texts were then fed into a neural field classifier trained on English-language data, as detailed by Weber et al. (2020). Utilizing this classifier necessitated the translation of all titles and abstracts into English, a task accomplished using the Ubiquitous Knowledge Project’s EasyNMT. The classifier generates likelihood distributions across various classes, enabling multidisciplinary classification. However, for simplicity in reporting, each journal was allocated a single field of study label based on the most probable classification according to the Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC). This particular schema was chosen due to the availability of the dataset used for training the neural classifier, which was annotated following ANZSRC guidelines (Weber et al., 2020). ANZSRC fields align with the OECD’s Fields of Science and Technology (FOS) but diverge from the National Science Foundation’s seven research area directorates, particularly in STEM disciplines, notably the pure sciences. To address discrepancies, the classifier assigns fundamental labels like Chemical and Physical Sciences, which are then grouped into broader research fields by the NSF classification system.
The distribution of journals across disciplines indicates that social science research predominates among journals, with the STEM fields, particularly medical and health sciences, as well as engineering and technology, also playing a significant role in terms of journal count (Figure 8). Notably, the presence of STEM fields signifies a degree of cultural diversity beyond the central research hub, as depicted in Figure 9. While social sciences and humanities are often perceived to have local significance best served by on-site researchers, the universality of the sciences allows them to gravitate towards the center. These findings suggest a more dispersed foundation for research within STEM fields, encompassing sciences, technologies, engineering, and mathematics.
Comparing the disciplinary breakdown of JUOJS to the profile found in Scopus, with an overlap of less than 4% between them, reveals a mixed picture. Scopus exhibits a higher proportion of titles in mathematics and medicine and health sciences, whereas JUOJS leans towards education and language, communication, and culture. However, in disciplines like economics, engineering, and computer science, the journal coverage is relatively similar between the two sets. Further citational studies could delve deeper into how journals from these sets draw upon each other in their shared disciplinary interests.
The visibility and circulation of the JUOJS were evaluated by examining their presence in 11 research indexes, directories, and lists. The assessment involved analyzing the Web of Science Citation Reports and Cabells Predatory Reports, leveraging Stanford University Library licensing agreements. Cabells cooperatively included the JUOJS in its database, utilizing our dataset. EBSCOHost, Scopus, OpenAlex, DOAJ, and Beall’s List publicly disclose their journal lists. Bianca Kramer determined the number of JUOJS in ROAD (2022), while SerpApi aided in evaluating Google Scholar’s indexing of JUOJS. Subsequently, we assessed the representation of JUOJS in each index by examining overlap through matched ISSNs, journal URLs, and domain names. The specific matching criteria for each resource are detailed in Table 3.
In 1998, Ann María Cetto and Octavio Alonso-Gamboa from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) highlighted the marginalization of Global South research in major journal indexes (Cetto & Alonso-Gamboa, 1998). Their research revealed that the Web of Science only covered 0.5% of scholarly publications from Latin America and the Caribbean (p. 114). Motivated by this disparity, Cetto and Alonso-Gamboa collaborated with others in the region to establish Latindex in 1997, which currently indexes 24,486 journals. This initiative aimed to address what Cetto described as the perceived "large periphery of the present world system" (1997, p. 40).
Twenty-five years following the Cetto and Alonso-Gamboa investigation, the Web of Science Citation Reports now encompasses a mere 1.2% of the JUOJS as indicated in Table 3. The inclusion of JUOJS in EBSCO and Scopus shows only a slight improvement. Our focus lies in questioning the widespread belief that these three databases represent the entirety of scientific literature, often relied upon by researchers for composing literature reviews and examining scholarly communication patterns, particularly in regions like the Global South (Cortés, Guix & Carbonell, 2021).
Conversely, a new wave of indexes, including Dimensions and OpenAlex, demonstrate significant improvements in coverage. Dimensions encompasses 54.3% of the JUOJS, while OpenAlex covers 63.8%, leveraging automated aggregation from various open resources like Microsoft Academic Graph, Crossref, Unpaywall, DOAJ, ORCID, and PubMed. Notably, Google Scholar indexes 88.3% of the JUOJS, largely attributed to the persistent outreach efforts of its lead engineer, Anurag Acharya, who initiated collaborations with PKP as early as 2004 to enhance the indexing of JUOJS. This underscores the intentional actions required to address the challenges posed by what Cetto referred to as "the large periphery."
Google Scholar data provides additional insights into the JUOJS through article-level citation data, organized by OJS installation domain rather than by journal. As of June 2022, there were 22,679 JUOJS hosted on 8,548 OJS domains, averaging 2.7 journals per domain. Each identified domain was accompanied by the initial search results page, displaying citation counts for approximately the top ten articles by citation (refer to Figure 10). Notably, 34 (0.4%) of the 8,548 journal domains had accumulated over 10,000 citations among their top ten articles. Furthermore, 565 journal domains (6.6%) boasted over 1,000 citations, while 1,015 journal domains (11.9%) had exceeded 500 citations. Conversely, 547 domains (6.4%) did not have any citations on the first page. The mean citation count for the JUOJS' initial Google Scholar search results page stood at 358.8 citations, with a median of 50.0 citations.
In a further preliminary examination of citation practices surrounding JUOJS, the study delved into the most-cited articles in English, Indonesian, and Portuguese to analyze their citations by JUOJS or other publications. The top-cited English article, with a substantial 16,432 citations and published in the Journal of Statistical Software, revealed that 95% of its citations originated from sources outside of JUOJS, indicating the journal's contribution to the broader research landscape. In contrast, the leading Indonesian article, featured in Jurnal Ekonomi dan Pendidikan, and the top-cited Portuguese article, published in Outra Travessia, garnered fewer citations at 1,321 and 1,408 respectively, with a significant portion of these citations stemming from within JUOJS. The Indonesian article saw 73.2% of its citations from JUOJS, while the Portuguese article had 77.7% from the same source, highlighting the journal's prominent role in these languages. Nonetheless, approximately one-fifth of citations for both articles came from sources other than JUOJS, underscoring the need for more comprehensive research on citational dynamics to refine scholarly communication, a focus that will be explored in future studies.
As previously mentioned, Latindex functions as a regional index that aggregates bibliographic information from 17 national resource centers spanning Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Iberian Peninsula. Out of the 24,486 journals listed in Latindex, 4,208 (17.2%) fall under the category of JUOJS. Notably, a significant portion of JUOJS publications within the Iberoamerican region, specifically two-thirds, are included in the Latindex index.
The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is an independent organization that receives support from libraries, publishers, and other entities. It evaluates journals based on a comprehensive assessment of their compliance with scholarly standards. The Directory of Open Access Scholarly Resources is managed by the International Center for the registration of serial publications, overseeing ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) registration and incorporating data from various sources including DOAJ, Latindex, and Scopus. This integration accounts for the larger number of journals indexed by the directory and consequently leads to an increase in the Journal Usage Online Journal System (JUOJS) that it indexes.
The designation by University of Colorado Denver librarian Jeffrey Beall of "potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly OA publisher[s]," for which he initiated a list in 2008, has significantly influenced the perception and evaluation of Global South journals. While we have previously discussed this matter in depth (Khanna & Willinsky, in press), it is important to note that there exist two prominent lists of journals labeled as "predatory." Beall maintained his list publicly until 2017, after which Cabells introduced its subscription service Predatory Reports. Beall's 2017 list includes 366 JUOJS (1.4% of the total), while Cabells' Predatory Report features 237 (1.0%), with an overlap of 82 JUOJS between the two lists.
The significance of this analysis in the context of this study lies in the recent and reiterated claims that "predatory journals pose a global threat" (Oviedo-García, 2021; Bagat, 2021; Shrestha, Timsina, & Subedi, 2021; Grudniewicz et al., 2019; Strong 2019), with some articles erroneously equating predatory practices with Open Access publishing (Krawczyk & Kulczycki, 2021). It is important to clarify that we are equally opposed to deceitful and unethical journals, regardless of their publication origin. However, framing this issue as a worldwide research menace perpetuates the marginalization within the global academic system, a concern highlighted by Cetto (1997) in the previous century, without effectively addressing the core problem. A more constructive approach, which could safeguard global scientific integrity, involves establishing a publishing standard that emphasizes journal transparency, a concept we have initiated preliminary assessments for (Willinsky, 2022).
This paper does not address the exact number of journals worldwide but highlights that the commonly cited estimate of 30,000 falls short. Scholarly publishing operates on a much larger global scale than typically acknowledged, surpassing assessments based on the Web of Science Citation Index and Scopus. Dismissing this global perspective as excessive research or predatory publishing is unscientific. There is a need to recalibrate scholarly communication on a broader yet equally rigorous scale to leverage the growing research enterprise. This expansion goes beyond journal quantities, emphasizing significant bibliodiversity in scholarly communication, evident in publications across 60 languages from 136 countries. It also involves shifts in the economics of scholarly communication, with open-source options challenging corporate publishing dominance. The open-source platform examined in this study promotes an OA diamond model, ensuring equitable access for authors, users, and readers across various academic fields.
This study represents initial efforts in rescaling scholarly communication, yet it raises numerous unanswered questions regarding the operations of JUOJS within the broader research landscape. How do the researchers published in these journals engage with and contribute to the work of others? Mapping citation patterns is essential to understanding how this work interacts within and beyond the scope of these journals, potentially influencing the observed improvements in research circulation and utilization. Case studies are needed to assess JUOJS' impact on policy-making and professional practices, aligning with the 2030 goal outlined by Research4Life. This goal, supported by 160 publisher partners, aims to elevate the profile and backing for the research publishing industry in the Global South, as stated in Our Vision (2022, p. 26).
The global scale of this publishing activity raises a significant issue that resonates with Achille Mbembe's point at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he pays homage to Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o's re-centering project from the previous century, emphasizing that "the decolonizing project is back on the agenda worldwide" (2019, p. 18). Mbembe envisions a transformation where universities become "platforms for the redistribution of different kinds of knowledges" (p. 7). This aligns with our findings, both linguistically and geopolitically, indicating the emergence of a new world of scholarly communication that is more globally expansive, diverse, and inclusive. It is not merely a possibility or an item on the agenda; rather, it is already in progress, poised to benefit all involved.
The authors express their gratitude to Anurag Acharya, Bianca Kramer, Ron Naoko, Kathy Kerns, and Emma Uhl, as well as SerpApi and Cabells, for their valuable contributions in the preparation of this paper.
