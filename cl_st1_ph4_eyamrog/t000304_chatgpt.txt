Outbreaks of novel virus infections among populations consistently pose significant public health challenges (Bonilla-Aldana et al., 2020). The extent of these outbreaks is contingent upon various factors related to the virus, such as its mode of transmission between individuals, its transmissibility rate, the severity of the ensuing illness, and the efficacy of medical interventions or preventive measures in mitigating its impact (e.g., vaccines or treatment medications) (Millán-Oñate et al., 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread to all corners of the globe, resulting in numerous complications and fatalities. It is estimated that 59,884 individuals have succumbed to this disease (Mapa del coronavirus (COVID-19), n.d.), necessitating the implementation of stringent measures such as quarantine (Cuero, 2020). However, quarantine can prove to be a distressing experience for those affected, entailing separation, loss of liberty, uncertainty, and monotony. There have even been reports of suicide attempts and secondary suicides. Therefore, prior to enforcing such measures, it is crucial to carefully consider these potential complications and weigh them against the benefits (Shander et al., 2020).
Several studies have examined the psychological impacts experienced by individuals in quarantine compared to control groups. The prevalent symptoms often observed include stress and trauma, with a notable focus on acute stress disorder. Those subjected to quarantine frequently exhibit heightened levels of exhaustion, detachment, anxiety, decreased performance, and reluctance to engage in work-related activities. Over time, there is a risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression as highlighted by Druss (2020).
The research question that emerges is to ascertain the symptoms of anxiety and depression during the isolation period following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Paraguay.
A cross-sectional study conducted from March 17 to 20, 2020, involved surveying every resident of Paraguay, regardless of gender, aged over 18, who consented to participate by confirming their entry through a provided study link. Surveys were distributed via WhatsApp groups and social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Prior to participation, all individuals were briefed on the study's objectives and the intended utilization of the collected data.
In this study, the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale (EADG) was employed to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms. Each subscale consists of 9 dichotomous response items (Yes/No) and is organized into 4 initial screening items to ascertain the presence of a potential mental disorder. A subsequent set of 5 items is administered if positive responses are obtained from the screening questions (2 or more for anxiety and more than 1 for depression). Typically, the full scale is utilized in research, and in this study, it was applied in its entirety.
Each scale is assigned an independent score, with one point awarded for every affirmative response. Goldberg et al. (1988) suggested cut-off thresholds of ≥ 4 for the anxiety scale and ≥ 2 for the depression scale (Koloski et al., 2008). The questionnaire data was initially stored in a Microsoft Office Excel 2013 © spreadsheet and later transferred to the STATA 14.0 ® statistical software for further analysis. The findings are presented in tables showcasing proportions.
The data collected from the questionnaire was handled with strict adherence to principles of confidentiality, equality, and fairness, in accordance with the Helsinki guidelines. Participants who expressed interest in receiving further guidance regarding their situation were given the option to provide their email address for communication purposes.
A total of 1180 subjects were involved in the study, with specific demographic breakdowns revealing that 34.24% (404) fell within the 20 to 29 age bracket, 51.53% (608) were female, 39.07% (461) were married, 35.51% (419) were enrolled as university students, and 63.73% (752) hailed from rural areas within the country, as outlined in Table 1.
When examining the relationship between anxiety symptoms and demographic characteristics, the data reveals that 55.31% (125) of individuals aged between 40 and 49 exhibited anxious symptoms. Additionally, 50% (304) of women, 49.30% (282) of participants, 51.41% (237) of married individuals, 51.24% (165) of those with secondary education, 51.33% (386) of individuals from rural areas, and 46.73% (200) of individuals from Asunción + Metropolitan area reported experiencing anxiety symptoms. In terms of depressive symptoms and demographic characteristics, the findings indicate that 48.89% (83) of individuals aged 30 to 39 displayed depressive symptoms. Furthermore, 49.48% (283) of men, 45.07% (274) of women, 56.13% (229) of unmarried individuals, 57.28% (240) of university students, and 52.80% (226) of residents in Asunción + Metropolitan Area reported experiencing depressive symptoms (see Table 3).
Psychosocial disorders, such as depression and anxiety, are having an increasingly significant impact on the overall health of the general population.
The study is noteworthy for highlighting an inverse relationship compared to existing literature and prior studies, which have typically indicated a higher frequency of depression cases among females and individuals over the age of 50 (Belló et al., 2005; Gómez-Restrepo et al., 2004; Juanes, n.d.). Conversely, in the context of anxiety, the findings align with prevailing prevalence studies that commonly report higher prevalence rates among women and individuals aged between 40 and 50 years (Balanza Galindo et al., 2009; Generalized Anxiety Disorder, n.d.; Epidemiology of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. | Psiquiatria.com, n.d.).
When examining the "Civil Status" of the population, similar criteria are often found alongside "Marital Satisfaction" in the literature as protective factors against the development of symptoms associated with Anxiety and depression. However, the results indicate a higher prevalence of anxiety in married individuals, which is also reflected in terms of depression. This pattern extends to the concept of general health for both pathologies, as evidenced by studies conducted by Posada-Villa et al. (2006), Simó-Noguera et al. (2015), and Valdez Medina, José Bastidas-González, R. (2017).
Although the general population surpasses school age, it is noteworthy to highlight a study that uncovered a correlation between family dynamics and the prevalence of depression, particularly among schoolchildren. Surprisingly, the study revealed that the most common type of family structure, the functional family, had the highest number of depressed schoolchildren. Additionally, the research identified a link between manifestations of depression and socioeconomic status (Hinostroza-Gastelú, s. f.). The economic criteria associated with educational levels, ranging from primary to university, may indicate a certain level of financial reliance on parents or self-sustenance through work, which is then reinvested in education. Across these various criteria, there is a clear positive association with symptoms of anxiety and depression, with a stronger correlation observed with anxiety, albeit to a lesser extent with depression.
Symptoms commonly associated with depression are consistently prevalent across all age groups, typically ranging between 40% and 50% without dropping below the 40% threshold.
In adolescents, this symptomatology is associated with conflicts in interpersonal relationships with peers and adults, leading to a preference for seeking support from fellow adolescents rather than mental health professionals (Garcia Mantilla et al., 2018). During periods of confinement, this dynamic can pose significant challenges as social distancing restrictions limit interactions with peers, while healthcare facilities prioritize cases related to the pandemic, leaving unclear protocols for mental health support.
Being a female, belonging to the category of "Older Adult," and experiencing illness are associated with higher levels of depression and limitations in performing activities (Gorete Reis et al., 2009). These characteristics are often linked to increased anxious and depressive symptoms in women of this age group. The lack of social interaction and confinement could potentially pose a risk to their overall health and well-being.
One of the primary comorbidities of depression, and to a lesser extent anxious disorders, is the complex network of factors associated with suicide attempts. While no single factor has been identified as the most crucial for the effectiveness of these attempts, tedium, defined as a sense of time devoid of meaning often linked to confinement and social isolation, appears to play a significant role (Minayo et al., 2016). Without adequate attention and support, there is a risk of an increase in suicide attempts, including completed suicides, particularly among populations highlighted in existing research literature. It is imperative to address these factors to prevent further escalation of such behaviors.
Social interaction activities conducted through mobile phone calls have been shown to have an inverse correlation with the risk of social isolation (Martínez Rebollar & Campos Francisco, 2015). Therefore, an intriguing approach within the elderly demographic involves ensuring they are not left in isolation, especially in cases where confinement is necessary due to family members needing to work, such as healthcare personnel. In such situations, maintaining repeated interactions through various social interaction platforms, including voice and video, becomes crucial. The utilization of social networks serves and will continue to serve a vital role in this context, acting as a protective factor against morbid conditions like Depression and Anxiety.
The perception of poor health and poor quality of life is closely linked to factors such as anxiety and depression disorders, social isolation, lack of exercise, and dependence on basic and instrumental activities (Azpiazu Garrido et al., 2002). Symptoms related to anxiety and depression can lead individuals to feel a sense of lacking health or being at risk of losing it, while limitations in mobility and the ability to perform basic and instrumental activities, coupled with the need for emotional support, may be perceived as a state of vulnerability in emotional and behavioral factors crucial for maintaining autonomy in daily life. According to the most recent Basic Health Indicators publication, the general unemployment rate in Paraguay stands at 7.2 for the urban population and 4.5 for the rural population (Indicadores Básicos de Salud, s. f.). Interestingly, the study data indicate a lower prevalence of both pathologies in urban areas, whereas the situation is reversed in rural regions.
The comorbidity of depression and anxiety represents a significant risk factor for the development of suicidal behavior, surpassing the risk posed by these conditions individually or by other diagnoses. This association carries a higher risk compared to factors such as family history of suicidal behavior, absence of children, or being under the age of 35 (Baca García & Aroca, 2014). These specific characteristics necessitate careful consideration during evaluation, containment, and, if necessary, treatment within the realm of mental health. Therefore, the development of detection and treatment protocols in this field, as complementary measures to existing practices for containment, would prove highly beneficial. In Paraguay, the rate of "Death by Suicide" stands at 9.3 in men and 3.2 in women, with both pathologies showing nearly equal prevalence.
One of the study's limitations pertains to the method of data collection, primarily due to the inability to access a substantial sample size, as well as the exclusion of individuals without internet connectivity from completing the survey. In conclusion, a significant portion of the population exhibited symptoms of anxiety or depression, with similar prevalence across genders, but more prominently among older individuals and those residing in rural areas. Implementing psychological support measures during quarantine periods is imperative, given the heightened vulnerability and numerous stressors that contribute to anxiety and depression in a majority of individuals during such times.
