The effectiveness of a country's response to the Covid-19 crisis hinges significantly on the efficient utilization of its health workforce. There are numerous measures that can be taken to ensure that the workforce is adequately equipped to confront the challenges posed by the pandemic. The primary aim of this study was to shed light on the strategies implemented in Brazil concerning the health workforce amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as to scrutinize the interventions by the federal government in crisis management and their repercussions on healthcare professionals. This qualitative research project adopts a documentary approach. It involved the identification of Brazilian federal regulations pertaining to work and health education that were issued during the Covid-19 emergency period, spanning from January 28 to June 2, 2020. Out of a total of 845 documents, 62 were meticulously selected based on predefined criteria and subjected to Thematic Content Analysis. The findings and subsequent discussions were categorized into four main themes: Workforce management, Workforce protection, Workforce training, and Academic-Workforce relationship. The study revealed a lack of federal coordination efforts aimed at governing the health workforce during the pandemic in Brazil. This absence of coordination mechanisms was deemed to have significantly contributed to the ongoing dire epidemiological situation, particularly evident in the high rates of infection and mortality among healthcare professionals due to Covid-19 in Brazil, as well as the failure to effectively contain the spread of the virus within the population.
Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of Sars-CoV-2 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, healthcare systems worldwide, spanning high, lower, and middle-income countries, have faced immense pressure in containing the novel coronavirus. This global health crisis, coupled with an already fragile economic model, has exacerbated existing global disparities, particularly impacting the essential services of the most vulnerable nations, such as those in Latin America. Challenges stemming from inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and the inability to procure necessary equipment have emerged as critical issues. A primary focus for health systems has been to sustain and bolster frontline healthcare workers, who are courageously risking their lives in the fight against the virus.
Government leaders and regulators must play a crucial role in expanding capacity and guaranteeing the optimal utilization of the workforce in safe conditions during the ongoing pandemic. It is essential not only to focus on treating infected individuals and preventing new cases but also to prioritize the availability of an adequate number of healthcare professionals (HCP) and the provision of a secure working environment.
Globally, there have been reports of risks and harm faced by healthcare professionals. In the United States, data from April revealed that 9,282 healthcare professionals had been confirmed with COVID-19 and reported to the CDC, although this figure is likely an underestimate as the status of healthcare personnel was only available for 16% of reported cases nationwide. In Wuhan, 3.5% of patients presenting with severe disease or death were healthcare workers. By April 2020, Brazil had already accounted for over 50% of the deaths of nursing professionals worldwide. By July 2020, there were 173,000 confirmed cases among healthcare professionals, representing approximately 10% of the total cases. Notably, the nursing workforce bore the brunt of the impact, with over 37,680 professionals in the field infected by COVID-19, resulting in 396 deaths by February 9, 2021.
The vulnerability of healthcare workers poses a significant risk to healthcare systems globally, making their protection a paramount challenge and a critical mission for health institutions. Media and scientific reports have highlighted the shortages in personal protective equipment for frontline healthcare workers. Consensus among scientific recommendations emphasizes the prioritization of testing frontline healthcare staff, ensuring conditions for self-isolation, social distancing, and quarantine, and the utilization of training, knowledge, and protocols. Additionally, there is a call for the development of evidence-based interventions tailored to various workplace settings, allowing for careful selection. Addressing mental health concerns among frontline professionals is also crucial, given the high prevalence of reported symptoms such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Effective strategies to support mental well-being should be implemented to safeguard the overall health of these essential workers.
Since late May 2020, three months following the initial reported case of coronavirus in Brazil, an average of over 1000 daily deaths has been documented. Presently, Brazil is witnessing one of the most rapidly escalating coronavirus outbreaks globally, with over 3,950,931 confirmed cases - the second highest worldwide - and exceeding 122,596 fatalities, as per official statistics. Brazil has emerged as a focal point of the COVID-19 pandemic, grappling with what can be described as "a public health catastrophe." The absence of decisive actions by the federal government to spearhead the battle against the pandemic only compounds the challenges faced within the nation, exacerbated by the conditions of a profoundly unequal society with a substantial portion of the population residing in circumstances of extreme vulnerability.
The research centered on the policies enacted by the Brazilian government concerning the health workforce's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The health workforce encompasses individuals involved in activities primarily aimed at improving health, operating across various career stages, organizational settings, and dynamic work environments. This study aimed to underscore the strategies employed in managing Brazil's health workforce and evaluate the federal government's approach to the pandemic and its impact on healthcare professionals.
This study utilized a primarily qualitative approach, specifically focusing on documentary research. Documentary research involves the examination of various sources including statistical tables, newspapers, magazines, reports, and official documents. This method relies on primary sources, which consist of data and information that have not undergone scientific or analytical treatment.
A comprehensive survey was conducted to analyze all federal regulations and legislation enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency in Brazil. The search encompassed documents released between January 28, 2020, and June 2, 2020, sourced from the official websites of The National Council of Health Secretaries (CONASS) and the Presidency of the Republic/General Secretariat, both of which regularly update and provide direct links to publications in the Official Federal Gazette. Inclusion criteria comprised regulations and laws pertaining to the pandemic, Education, and Health at the federal level. A total of 771 COVID-19 related documents were initially identified and cataloged in an ExcelÂ® spreadsheet for streamlined data collection. Following a meticulous review process, 706 duplicates or documents not meeting the specified criteria were excluded, leaving 65 documents for detailed analysis. Through a critical examination, an overview of the federal acts was developed, categorized under predetermined themes such as Workforce Management, Workforce Protection, Teleworking, Workforce-Academia Relationship, and Workforce Training.
Following the initial analysis, the research aimed to enhance its investigation by incorporating documents that specifically addressed the national response to the pandemic within the realms of Education and Health. Consequently, a second phase was initiated to gather directives, encompassing technical notes, dispatches, technical reports, and protocols sourced from the websites of various federal councils such as Pharmacy (CFF), Medicine (CFM), Nursing (COFEN), Dentistry (CFO), alongside entities like the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health (SESAI), the Ministry of Education, the Brazilian Company and Hospital Services (EBSERH), and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES). This phase yielded 74 documents that aligned with the study's inclusion criteria, bringing the total number of documents considered to 139.
After a thorough review and critical assessment of the documents, 77 were deemed ineligible due to not meeting the specified inclusion criteria, leaving a total of 62 documents for detailed analysis. These selected documents were then synthesized and categorized according to the predetermined classifications. The process of document selection adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), as illustrated in Figure 1.
Utilizing the Tableau Public application, information regarding the attributes of the incorporated documents was acquired, encompassing temporal distribution, typology, categorization, and authoring institutions. To assess the documents, the procedures of Thematic Content Analysis were adhered to, offering methodological structure and precision to the investigation. Throughout this analysis, it became apparent that the initial six categories delineated converged into four distinct thematic categories: Workforce Management, Workforce Protection, Workforce Training, and Academia-Workforce Relationship.
The emergence and dissemination of the coronavirus in Brazil necessitated the implementation of new regulations and legislation to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on individuals' lives and work, especially healthcare professionals (HCP) at the forefront of responding to the resulting public health crisis. A comprehensive review of multiple sources yielded a total of 845 records. Among the official documents released during this timeframe, the primary focus of this research, federal governance of the health workforce, was addressed in a limited number (62 documents out of the 845), which were further classified into four distinct categories as outlined in Table 1.
The effectiveness of a country's response to the Covid-19 crisis is heavily reliant on the efficient utilization of its health workforce. There are numerous measures that can be implemented to ensure that the workforce is adequately equipped to handle the challenges posed by the pandemic. As highlighted by Fraher et al., governmental leaders and regulators play a crucial role in expanding capacity and maximizing the utilization of the workforce during such crises. The examination of standards and documents presented in this study sheds light on the approach adopted by the Brazilian federal government in managing the health labor force amidst the ongoing pandemic.
From a bibliometric perspective, the analysis of the temporal distribution of documents revealed a notable increase in publications in March 2020, coinciding with the first recorded death from COVID-19 in the country on the 12th of March. Surprisingly, despite the escalating severity of the pandemic in the subsequent months, there was a significant decline in the number of published documents, contrary to the anticipated and crucial expansion that was needed (see Figure 2). These findings necessitate a deeper examination within the political landscape of the country, particularly considering the transition in leadership within the Ministry of Health. The initial Minister of Health during the pandemic, Dr. Luis Henrique Mandetta, was replaced on April 17 by Dr. Nelson Teich, a physician from the private sector, who held the position for only a month. Subsequently, there has been a trend of replacing career civil servants with military personnel within the health ministry, including the current interim minister. This shift appears to have contributed to a lack of clear regulations in June regarding the guidance for combating COVID-19, highlighting a concerning absence of direction in managing the crisis.
Among the 62 documents scrutinized, 22 were decrees, representing the predominant legislative form utilized for the administration, regulation, and enforcement of laws and regulations, as well as for disseminating general provisions and reporting on the activities of public entities. This prevalence is closely linked to the originating institutions of these documents, primarily the Ministry of Health. Notably, publications from the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health (SESAI) were the most prevalent, accounting for 22.59% of the total documents, followed by regulations issued by the Minister's cabinet within the Ministry of Health and the Secretariat of Primary Health Care (SAPS), constituting 19.35% and 11.29% of the corpus, respectively.
Despite the abundance of regulations governing indigenous health, the efforts to systematize regulations, guidelines, and recommendations for managing and providing specific care in Special Indigenous Health Districts nationwide, the high prevalence of contamination among over 155 indigenous groups underscores the social vulnerability they face and highlights the federal government's failure to safeguard these communities. The significant underreporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths within indigenous populations is apparent, prompting indigenous leaders, with the assistance of social organizations, to establish a separate registration system in parallel to the government's. While the Ministry of Health has officially recorded 20,723 cases and 348 deaths among indigenous individuals, the parallel survey has documented more than 29,381 infections and 775 fatalities.
In examining the various categories, it is evident that over half of the documents focused on aspects concerning Workforce Protection (64.29%). Themes associated with Workforce Management and the Academia-Workforce Relationship were less prevalent, accounting for only 14.29% of the analyzed documents. The category of Workforce Training was the least emphasized, with only 7.14% of the documents addressing this aspect.
Few regulations have been published to manage and increase the number of professionals in services combating the pandemic. Specific notices have been issued regarding the hiring of additional professionals in university hospitals, which represent only a small fraction of health services. The longstanding issue of doctor shortages in the public health system, particularly in remote and impoverished regions, persists. Globally, investment in the health workforce is lower than commonly assumed, undermining workforce sustainability and health systems. To address the chronic lack of doctors in underserved areas, the Brazilian government initiated the More Doctors Program (PMM) in 2013. This program offered over 16,000 vacancies, predominantly filled by foreign professionals, including 12,000 Cuban physicians through an international cooperation agreement between Brazil and Cuba facilitated by PAHO. Despite positive assessments of the PMM, the Cuban government terminated the cooperation in November 2018 following disparaging remarks by President-elect Bolsonaro regarding Cuban doctors' training and performance. In response to the pandemic urgency, state governments advocated for the rehiring of these doctors, with some being reinstated, although the Doctors Council did not concur. COFEN, however, authorized the professional registration of nursing graduates awaiting graduation to expedite their entry into the workforce. The lack of robust workforce planning and resilience actions in Brazil has led to the critical situation of confronting a pandemic without addressing pre-existing medical assistance needs.
Analysis of the document content unveiled various strategies aimed at safeguarding the well-being of healthcare personnel. Among the most prevalent measures were the temporary removal of individuals from high-risk groups for Covid-19 (including those aged 60 and above, individuals with underlying health conditions, and pregnant women), the utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE), the option for remote work, and the dissemination of guidelines for infection prevention and pandemic management. Additionally, suggestions were made for alterations in work protocols, particularly in areas that produce aerosols or heighten the vulnerability of specific populations, such as dental procedures and healthcare worker interactions with indigenous communities.
Among the strategies aimed at preventing infections and controlling the pandemic, emphasis is placed on managing the care environment and regulating user movement between services through disinfection of surfaces and instruments, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, patient mask-wearing, environmental ventilation, interpersonal spacing barriers, shift rotations to reduce space occupancy, proper waste management, and the display of informative posters in healthcare facilities. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) considerations were delineated in documents from two perspectives: outlining specifications for commercial availability and establishing usage protocols. Despite the incorporation of such recommendations in various documents, guidelines for the adequate provision of PPE by service management were scarce, indicating that protective measures were primarily geared towards sustaining healthcare services and managing the pandemic rather than ensuring the effective safeguarding of workers' health and well-being.
In terms of the workforce and working conditions of healthcare professionals (HCP), it is evident that they are exposed to potential sources of virus transmission, disease spread, stress, and various risk factors. To ensure a workplace environment that minimizes virus spread, it is crucial to establish clear and robust strategies to combat the ongoing pandemic. However, the findings of this study reveal inconsistent and disjointed recommendations across different sectors of the Ministry of Health and other relevant institutions. This observation is further supported by the lack of emphasis on essential preventive, diagnostic, and follow-up measures specifically tailored for HCP, as well as the transparent monitoring of infected personnel and fatalities. Additionally, there is a notable absence of initiatives addressing mental health and labor rights within this context.
A report by Filho et al. (26) highlights the limited discourse surrounding the working conditions of professionals caring for individuals with Covid-19 in Brazil. While there is a prevalence of protocols and recommendations for basic personal protective measures, these measures are deemed insufficient in curbing the virus's transmission. Concerns have been raised by professionals and unions regarding substandard working conditions, inadequate hygiene practices, long and arduous work hours, lack of training, and inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE). An online survey involving 1,456 public healthcare professionals in Brazil (17) further revealed a lack of safeguarding measures for health workers. The study concluded that these professionals are in a state of extreme vulnerability, attributed to the scarcity of PPE, inadequate information dissemination, and a lack of governmental support. More than half of the respondents expressed a sense of abandonment by the government, with a higher percentage disapproving of the federal government's support (67%) compared to that of state governments (51%).
These conditions have also been reported in other low and middle-income countries, underscoring the challenges faced by health services in meeting the escalating demands of COVID-19 and the imperative to contemplate the repercussions of the pandemic. With workers overwhelmed, there are limited resources to sustain the workforce and a failure to safeguard the well-being of healthcare professionals (HCP) (Griffin, 2020). Amnesty International (2020) reports that despite the pivotal role played by healthcare and essential service workers during the pandemic, they have encountered significant obstacles in carrying out their duties, with governments worldwide failing to adequately protect them. Instead, many have been exposed, silenced, and targeted: as of June 2020, at least 3,000 health workers had succumbed to COVID-19 in 79 countries, while numerous others have toiled in hazardous and unjust conditions. These workers have faced repercussions from authorities and employers for voicing safety concerns, including arrests and terminations, and have even been subjected to violence and discrimination by the public.
In Brazil, the accurate determination of the total number of Healthcare Professionals (HCP) affected by and succumbing to Covid-19 remains elusive due to the lack of transparency in data publication. Official epidemiological reports from the federal government present significantly lower figures of infected healthcare workers compared to those documented by professional bodies like COFEN (Federal Nursing Council), which has instituted a digital Observation Platform for the daily surveillance of contamination and mortality cases among nursing professionals. Advocating for enhanced transparency, the Ministry of Health is urged to gather and disclose occupation-specific data, encompassing health and essential worker categories affected by COVID-19, along with the corresponding fatality rates, as recommended by Amnesty International. This information should be categorized based on prohibited discriminatory factors, such as gender, race, and workplace, to ensure comprehensive protection measures in the future.
Teleworking, also known as remote work, emerged as a proposed strategy to address the challenges posed by the pandemic. It can be viewed as an alternative means of accessing healthcare services while prioritizing the safety of healthcare providers through the practice of social distancing, as well as safeguarding the well-being of patients within the healthcare system. While the concept of teleworking existed prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, specific guidelines tailored to the current crisis were introduced by the Ministry of Health and professional bodies representing healthcare professionals like Nursing, Pharmacy, Medicine, and Dentistry. The Ministry of Health further implemented regulations pertaining to telemedicine, allowing for remote interactions on a temporary basis. Telemedicine services encompass a range of activities including pre-clinical care, support for healthcare consultations, ongoing monitoring, diagnostic procedures, and the electronic prescription of medications utilizing information and communication technologies.
Published documents pertaining to pandemic management in Brazil typically offer guidelines for organizing various services, including Primary Health Care, medication dispensing, hospital, and dental services, along with protocols serving as directives for work teams, managers, and healthcare professionals. Nevertheless, only a limited number of these documents advocate or mandate workforce training through specialized programs. The persistent lack of investment in healthcare professional (HCP) education and training in certain regions, coupled with a disconnect between educational strategies and the actual healthcare system and population requirements, has led to ongoing shortages and diminished resilience within the workforce.
A technical note from the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) mandates that all health professionals undergo training in the proper use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), with health services responsible for ensuring this training and appropriate PPE usage. The Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health (SESAI) within the Ministry of Health specifically recommends in its technical notes that health professionals participate in training courses on the subject offered by public institutions, outlining the specific courses that professionals should complete. The World Health Organization (WHO) has long advocated for enhancing the capacity of the national health workforce in emergency and disaster risk management to bolster resilience and healthcare response capabilities, a recommendation predating the current pandemic. The WHO advises health systems to leverage the skills of the national health workforce in risk assessment, prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery, emphasizing the need for resources, training, and equipment for health professionals involved in emergency operations at local, national, and international levels. Despite Brazil's lack of systematic preparation for large-scale emergencies, the Unified Health System (SUS) has made significant investments in "continuing education," exemplified by the Open University of SUS (UNA-SUS), a network of public higher education institutions offering extensive e-learning and blended courses.
The inconsistency in professional practice guidelines during the pandemic is a notable issue. The official federal government stance has been consistently ambiguous, often disregarding scientific evidence. A prime illustration is the persistent endorsement of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment, despite studies refuting its efficacy. Even as late as September 2020, the government continued to advocate for its use. The Ministry of Health's protocol, in place since June 2020, further promotes the drug's prescription. Additionally, official communications have steered practices away from scientific foundations, including downplaying the importance of social distancing and manipulating epidemiological data. This environment is compounded by a lack of structured training for professionals dealing with the pandemic, exacerbated by the dissemination of misinformation by the government itself.
The absence of regulations, technical notes, or guidelines from the Department of Labour Management and Health Education of the Ministry of Health (MS), the secretariat responsible for coordinating professional education actions for the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), is notable. There is no explicit mention in any Ministry of Health document regarding the necessity for training or qualification of SUS workers as a collective entity. Additionally, the Ministry's website does not emphasize any initiatives to provide online courses through institutions funded by the Ministry itself, such as UNA-SUS. While various institutions and projects supported by the Ministry have independently developed and offered numerous online courses on Covid-19, there lacks a cohesive strategy for this provision and a lack of overarching guidance for the entire SUS workforce or specific professional groups. This deficiency may elucidate why only 14.2% of health professionals surveyed in an online study feel adequately equipped to handle Covid-19, with the majority (64.97%) expressing inadequacy in their preparedness. Merely 21.91%, predominantly doctors, reported receiving formal training in this regard.
In the realm of academic work relations, a significant development was the suspension of face-to-face classes across the educational sector. The Ministry of Education implemented directives that mandated the transition from traditional classroom settings to digital platforms for instruction, spanning various educational levels such as technical and professional education. Initially intended for a 30-day period, this shift was later extended for another 30 days and ultimately prolonged until December 31, 2020.
In response to the escalating need for additional healthcare professionals to address the rising number of infected and hospitalized individuals, the Ministry of Health initiated the public initiative "Brazil Counts On Me" (Brasil Conta Comigo). This program targets final-year students in Medicine, Nursing, Physiotherapy, and Pharmacy, urging them to contribute to the front line services in managing the pandemic. Prior to their involvement, students are required to complete a brief preparatory online course through UNA-SUS. However, the public call lacks a mandate for an engagement agreement contract among the intern, health service, and educational institution. Furthermore, there is no evaluation of the alignment between the internship activities and the curriculum of the respective undergraduate programs. The initiative solely mandates that health unit managers, where students are placed, nominate healthcare professionals to supervise the interns. Unfortunately, interns are devoid of health insurance or employment security, and there is a lack of clarity regarding the specific activities they may or may not engage in during their internship.
The implementation of such measures elicited responses from key professional bodies like CFM, COFEN, and the Brazilian Nursing Association (ABEn), emphasizing the necessity for caution regarding the risks associated with students engaging in professional services during the pandemic. ABEn and COFEN voiced their disapproval of the "Brazil Counts On Me" Program, citing concerns about the overwhelming demand on healthcare professionals and the consequent impracticality of supervising students. Additionally, the scarcity of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) was highlighted as a factor endangering the students' well-being. COFEN justified its stance by underscoring that Nursing professionals constitute over 60% of the healthcare workforce and are currently grappling with physical and mental fatigue due to the unprecedented demands brought about by the pandemic. Consequently, expecting nursing professionals to oversee trainees was deemed inappropriate.
Conversely, numerous societal discussions suggest that the pandemic presents a significant opportunity for students to enhance their competencies, thereby improving their knowledge and skills essential for meeting the requirements outlined in the National Curriculum Guidelines for undergraduate health courses. Nonetheless, it is crucial to prioritize the safety of service users, professionals, and students, while also ensuring the quality of healthcare services for the population. The stances of ABEn and COFEN mirror those of the American Association of Medical Schools, which has discouraged student involvement in addressing the pandemic.
At the international level, the early entry of students in the health field into the job market has sparked discussions. Some countries prohibit healthcare students from interacting with COVID-19 patients, while others enlist final-year students for hospital positions and expedite undergraduate course completion to bolster the active workforce. Recent international publications suggest that nursing and medical students, as well as interns, find themselves torn between the rewarding prospects of contributing to and learning from the pandemic and the fear of contracting the disease, transmitting it to family members, or inadvertently harming patients. These conflicting emotions result in moral distress among students. Contemplating the challenging decisions faced by students prompts consideration of alternative, safer ways for them to contribute, such as engaging in health promotion and education initiatives within communities or crafting and sharing educational materials on social media.
In the realm of fostering research on COVID-19 and educating postgraduate professionals in health-related fields, CNPq and CAPES, Brazilian agencies dedicated to promoting and supporting research and postgraduate studies, have recently issued public calls. These calls are designed to enhance knowledge, train human resources, develop products, and formulate, implement, and evaluate public initiatives aimed at enhancing the capacity to address the pandemic. Despite these efforts, the education system and overall support for scientific endeavors face ongoing challenges, including budget reductions and a lack of strategic planning for the sector both during and after the pandemic.
The lack of coordination among authorities, coupled with a series of errors made by the federal government, appears to be linked to the rising number of Covid-19 related deaths in Brazil, including those of healthcare professionals. Managing the pandemic in the country has necessitated ingenuity and the capacity to rally healthcare professionals and institutions independently, surpassing official directives and protocols, as a means to revolutionize the work processes of healthcare professionals and foster an interprofessional environment. Analysis of recent legislation reveals a glaring absence of dedicated leadership in formulating comprehensive policies and strategies to address the pervasive fragmentation across all governmental bodies in Brazil. Establishing a pandemic task force committed to developing a long-term, science-based strategic approach could enhance collaboration and delineate regional priorities effectively. A cohesive, inclusive approach involving all stakeholders grappling with the Covid-19 crisis is imperative to delineate priorities, particularly in the face of the multifaceted challenges characterizing the Brazilian context.
The lack of a cohesive federal policy to coordinate efforts in governing the health workforce during the pandemic in Brazil has been highlighted. The opposition from Federal Councils of health professions to federal regulations further solidifies this observation. This absence significantly contributes to the dire epidemiological situation, impacting both the general population and the infection and mortality rates among healthcare professionals due to Covid-19. The regulations that have been published are criticized for being fragmented, superficial, repetitive, and inadequate in addressing the necessary measures to optimize the workforce's response to the pandemic, as well as safeguarding their well-being in terms of working conditions, physical and mental health, and labor rights, including the recognition of Covid-19 as an occupational disease.
These findings, coupled with the lack of transparency surrounding the illness and deaths of healthcare workers, highlight a significant level of negligence towards professionals in the field and, consequently, the general population. This disregard is further underscored by recent actions taken by the federal government, widely publicized in the media: the presidential veto of laws that aimed to provide compensation to disabled professionals who contracted SARS-CoV-2 while on duty; vetoes on proposals outlining measures to combat the spread of the virus among indigenous, quilombola, and traditional communities; and the rejection of bills mandating mask-wearing in various settings such as churches, stores, schools, and prisons. By July 2020, with the country having already recorded nearly 100,000 Covid-19 related deaths, the federal government had only utilized 29% of the allocated financial resources for pandemic response, and the Ministry of Health was operating without a designated Minister. In this scenario, the efforts of states, municipalities, and professional health councils have taken on a crucial role in addressing some of the gaps left by the federal government, albeit without being able to fully replace its strategic management of the Covid-19 crisis.
The conclusions of this research must be viewed within the backdrop of the profound Brazilian political crisis, which exacerbates the health crisis stemming from the pandemic, and vice versa. With the official tally of 3 million infected and 122 thousand Brazilians lost to Covid-19, these findings underscore a pressing call for the prompt mobilization of a national response commensurate with the magnitude of the ongoing calamity, aimed at alleviating its lasting impacts on Brazilian society and its healthcare professionals. This imperative falls squarely on the shoulders of the Brazilian State as an obligation and on its populace and workforce as a fundamental right.
