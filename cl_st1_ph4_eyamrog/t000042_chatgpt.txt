Drawing on Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe's concept of necropolitics, this research article delves into the governmental responses to the initial year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and India, two middle-income nations rarely juxtaposed. The narrative unfolds the roles of President Jair Bolsonaro and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in exacerbating the pandemic. Bolsonaro, in defiance of medical counsel, trivialized COVID-19 as a mere "little flu," while Modi opted for a formal endorsement of social distancing and a nationwide lockdown. Despite the contrasting approaches of Brazil and India towards COVID-19, marginalized populations in both nations remained largely invisible. The article posits that the divergent responses of India and Brazil to the COVID-19 crisis were not fundamentally different but rather varied in intensity, reflecting a necropolitical stance that deemed certain citizens expendable: in Brazil, targeting blacks and Indigenous people from the Amazon, and in India, focusing on the substantial Muslim minority, marginalized Hindu castes, and migrant laborers. While deaths from COVID-19 garnered significant global media coverage, the fatalities of marginalized individuals in Brazil and India were inadequately acknowledged, perpetuating the notion that developing countries are inherently incapable of safeguarding their populations effectively.
The governmental responses to COVID-19 in several developing countries are analyzed through the lens of Achille Mbembe's concept of “Necropolitics.” This perspective reveals that neoliberal governments, during the pandemic, adopted an Orwellian version of sovereignty that involved the management of life and death, resulting in the spread of disease, increased mortality rates, and higher infection rates among marginalized populations. Utilizing sources such as newspaper articles, internet documents, contemporary publications, and public health information from Brazil and India, this article aims to delineate and compare the necropolitical dynamics in both nations. The authors argue that the governmental responses in Brazil and India during the initial year of the pandemic (approximately February 2020 to March 2021) constituted a regulated form of necropolitics that fluctuated based on political contexts and mortality statistics, ultimately normalizing mortality within public discourse. Both Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made decisions during the pandemic that determined who would live and who would die, framing high mortality rates as incidental rather than a state responsibility. Despite differences in their approaches—such as Bolsonaro downplaying the virus as “a little flu” and Modi advocating for a European-style lockdown—both strategies resulted in a catastrophic public health crisis. Additionally, the two leaders exhibited other notable similarities.
By the conclusion of 2020, Brazil and India had respectively recorded the second and third highest number of coronavirus-related fatalities globally. These nations were under the governance of right-wing authoritarian populist leaders: Bolsonaro, who assumed office as the President of Brazil in 2019, and Modi, representing the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and re-elected as the Prime Minister of India for a second term in 2019. Bolsonaro, in a significant address on March 24, 2020, dismissed Brazil's susceptibility to the virus. Concurrently, Modi imposed restrictions on the media for their perceived negativity towards the pandemic, while the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), seemingly to align with the Prime Minister's stance, pledged a July 2020 deadline for a coronavirus vaccine. In both nations, a stark contrast emerged between the pandemic's ground realities and the narratives propagated by their leaders. The predominant political figure during the pandemic in Brazil and India has been a charismatic president who often viewed mainstream scientists as adversaries.
The impact of COVID-19 in Brazil and India must be contextualized within the historical backdrop of racism and discrimination, factors that have long plagued these nations even before the rise of their authoritarian governments. In Brazil, marginalized groups such as Blacks, mixed-race individuals, and indigenous Amazonian communities, constituting a significant portion of the population, bore a disproportionate burden of the pandemic. Similarly, in India, despite constitutional provisions against religious and caste-based discrimination, the Muslim minority, Dalits, and migrant workers faced social exclusion and bore the brunt of the stringent lockdown measures. The initial wave of COVID-19 in both countries aligns with one of the phases outlined in Charles Rosenberg's "epidemic drama" model, where communities seek rational explanations to regain a sense of control and minimize their vulnerability. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to scapegoating minority groups for the spread of the contagion.
On February 26, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in São Paulo when a 61-year-old man returned from Italy. Subsequently, more cases were confirmed by the end of the month. On March 7, despite the risks involved, Bolsonaro visited the US to meet with President Trump in Palm Beach, Florida. Following this meeting, over twenty members of his delegation tested positive for COVID-19, yet Bolsonaro did not opt for self-isolation. By late March, all 27 Brazilian states had reported cases, with 2,000 individuals testing positive and the country recording 80 deaths. On March 18, ABRASCO, the Brazilian Association of Collective Health, called for assistance for favelas, including requests for waivers on utility bills, food distribution, hygiene kits, and the implementation of a Test, Trace, and Isolate (TTI) program. Despite these calls for action, Bolsonaro downplayed the severity of the pandemic, dismissing medical advice, mocking the use of masks, and urging people to return to work. He prioritized economic concerns, arguing that lockdowns were more detrimental than the virus itself due to resulting unemployment, food shortages, domestic violence, and suicide. In April, as the WHO reported over a million global cases of COVID-19, Bolsonaro advocated for a "vertical" quarantine strategy, isolating only high-risk groups. This approach was criticized by health authorities, professional organizations, and former Ministers of Health as a dangerous form of "medical populism," undermining established scientific knowledge and politicizing the health crisis to maintain authoritarian control.
Meanwhile, João Doria, the governor of São Paulo, a prosperous state, and a businessman eyeing a potential candidacy in the upcoming October 2022 presidential election, where Bolsonaro is seeking a second term, actively advocated for mask-wearing, implemented restrictions, and called for cooperation with federal authorities. Doria's actions drew sharp criticism from Bolsonaro. Concurrently, official campaigns promoting anti-communism and xenophobia were launched, contributing to a rise in hate crimes against Asian Brazilians, a group that includes a significant number of migrants from Japan and China in Latin America. China faced accusations of deliberately spreading the pandemic, despite research indicating that the majority of COVID-19 cases among Brazilians had actually originated in Italy.
By April 11, 2020, Brazil had reported 20,700 cases of COVID-19, with the death toll reaching 1,124. Following alarming images in newspapers depicting overwhelmed hospitals and mass graves, Bolsonaro distanced himself from exacerbating the crisis by stating he was "not a gravedigger." Additionally, he actively promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (referred to as HCQ) as a means to combat the virus. Bolsonaro's fixation on these drugs appeared to be primarily politically motivated, reflecting his admiration for Trump and exploiting the notion of a supposed silver bullet against malaria for political gain rather than a genuine health initiative. Bolsonaro asserted that HCQ rendered social restrictions unnecessary and would ultimately lead Brazil to herd immunity. Brazilian scientists who voiced doubts about HCQ faced backlash, including defamatory articles on social media, legal investigations, and even death threats. Bolsonaro's championing of HCQ played a pivotal role in garnering support from the country's business community, which opposed a nationwide lockdown, as well as from right-wing evangelicals, constituting a significant portion of Brazil's population, who sought to conduct religious services without hindrance from restrictions.
Two Ministers of Health, Luiz Henriquez Mandetta and Nelson Teich, were compelled to resign from their positions on April 16 and May 15, 2020, respectively. Both advocated for further studies before endorsing the use of HCQ as a pandemic-fighting tool. Following Teich's departure, President Bolsonaro appointed Army General Eduardo Pazuello, lacking healthcare experience, as the new Minister of Health, staffing the Ministry with military personnel who executed his directives without question. As Pazuello assumed office, Brazil's confirmed COVID-19 cases surpassed one million, ranking the country second only to the US in total case numbers. Contrary to WHO recommendations, Pazuello disregarded tracing policies, opting to test only hospitalized patients and promoting HCQ as the primary treatment. He and Bolsonaro pressured ANVISA, the independent Health Regulatory Agency, to approve chloroquine imports from India for COVID-19 treatment and directed the army laboratory to manufacture over a million chloroquine tablets within weeks. Bolsonaro also attempted to conceal information on coronavirus-related deaths by reporting only new daily case numbers, omitting fatality figures.
On June 6, the Supreme Court successfully compelled the government to publish more precise figures on the incidence of coronavirus infections, hospitalizations, and fatalities. However, under-reporting remained a constant problem due to extremely low testing rates. Bolsonaro's ability to conceal deaths was particularly effective in the Amazon region, in defiance of the Supreme Court's order to protect over 300 indigenous communities comprising approximately 900,000 individuals. His prior actions in dismantling environmental legislation had facilitated the exploitation of indigenous lands, enabling farmers, land leasers, and miners to introduce the virus to indigenous populations. This reflected a racist mindset within the government that viewed Amazon natives as hindrances to capitalist progress. Despite this, starting from March 2020, indigenous people in the Amazon chose to isolate themselves in an effort to reduce their coronavirus mortality rate, which was 32% higher than that of the general population.
In early August, as Brazil surpassed three million infections and 100,000 deaths, ABRASCO, Oxfam Brazil Office, and leaders of the National Health System (known as SUS in Portuguese) accused the government of criminal actions and introduced the term "necropolitics." Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, the concept of necropolitics had been employed in studies highlighting police brutality in favelas and the disproportionate incarceration of Afro-Brazilians in the context of the so-called "war on drugs." Under the Bolsonaro administration, a selective approach was taken in determining who bore the brunt of the pandemic's consequences, effectively compelling the country's impoverished population to make a stark choice between facing hunger (if adhering to isolation measures) or risking exposure to contamination (if continuing to work without adequate protection).
Towards the end of 2020, numerous Brazilian scientists harbored optimism that vaccines would serve as a definitive solution to halt the COVID-19 pandemic. Within the country, two vaccines gained prominence: CoronaVac, manufactured in China in collaboration with Butantan (an institute affiliated with São Paulo's government under Doria's administration), and AstraZeneca, developed in partnership with Fiocruz, a federal institution located in Rio de Janeiro. Initially, Bolsonaro exhibited reluctance towards vaccines, particularly Doria's "Chinese" vaccine; subsequently, his stance became ambivalent, and he continued to boast about not receiving the vaccine himself. Despite his hesitant involvement in the COVAX Facility— an initiative spearheaded by the WHO to secure vaccines for developing nations—Bolsonaro opposed a joint proposal from India and South Africa presented to the World Trade Organization, seeking to eliminate patent restrictions on coronavirus vaccines.
Meanwhile, vaccination presented a political opportunity for Doria, who pledged to distribute vaccines not only within São Paulo but across the entire nation. The significance of vaccines was underscored in January 2021 as the repercussions of Brazilians disregarding social distancing during New Year celebrations became evident. This was particularly poignant as a new variant of COVID-19 emerged in Manaus, the largest city in the Amazon region, where approximately 40% of the population lacks access to piped water and faces shortages in medical facilities. Even proponents of herd immunity were alarmed by the outbreak. Epidemiologists calculated that following the city's initial outbreak in March 2020, the infection rate in Manaus had soared to as high as 76%. Assuming prior infection conferred immunity, experts believed a sudden surge was improbable. However, the new variant not only proved to be more transmissible but also capable of infecting individuals who had previously recovered from other strains. By the end of February 2021, cases of the new variant had been documented in 21 out of Brazil's 26 states.
In March 2021, Bolsonaro and Doria initiated vaccination programs, with Bolsonaro's replacement of Pazuello with Marcelo Queiroga seen as a superficial attempt to appease critics. Queiroga, a private-sector physician, pledged to accelerate vaccination efforts but failed to advocate for mask-wearing, ultimately providing a shield for Bolsonaro's controversial statements and unsuccessful attempts to undermine vaccination campaigns. Despite their efforts, accusations of necropolitical policies and corruption in vaccine procurement persisted against the government. The British Medical Journal published an article accusing the government of "crimes against humanity" due to the alleged "massive and systematic use of pressure to manipulate public behavior in accordance with a predetermined agenda."
The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare significant structural vulnerabilities within India's healthcare and social welfare systems, highlighting the nation's shortcomings in achieving universal health coverage and safeguarding its impoverished populations. With the identification of the initial coronavirus case on January 31—a student from India residing in Wuhan who had returned to Kerala—there was a surge in racial violence targeting migrants from Northeast India, a region bordering China. These individuals were unfairly blamed as carriers of the virus in major urban centers like New Delhi, Pune, Mumbai, and Hyderabad. This outbreak of the novel coronavirus exacerbated existing prejudices, fueling both Sinophobia and Islamophobia within the country.
The emergence of the novel coronavirus was preceded by communal unrest stemming from the announcement of the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act in January 2020, which was perceived as discriminatory against Muslims. Subsequently, in March 2020, an outbreak of the coronavirus occurred at a gathering of the Islamic congregation Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi, leading to unfounded allegations that the congregation was the epicenter of numerous coronavirus cases and deaths throughout India. False information spread through social media, suggesting that Muslims intentionally contaminated food and water with the virus. The Modi administration's condemnation of this communal hatred was delayed. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated social taboos such as untouchability, which are deeply ingrained in the caste system. The concepts of purity and pollution, central to the caste-based stratification of Indian society into Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Sudras, and Dalits, who occupy the lowest rung of the caste hierarchy and are marginalized due to their occupation in menial tasks like sanitation, cremation, and carcass removal. Among the victims of the pandemic's initial wave, Dalits were disproportionately affected. This period in India witnessed the intersection of necropolitics, characterized by the denial of human rights to the Muslim minority and Dalits, the devaluation of menial labor, and animosity towards migrant workers.
Initially, Modi and many Indian authorities perceived COVID-19 as a great equalizer due to its capacity to infect individuals regardless of their religion, race, or nationality. However, public health campaigns promoting social distancing, home quarantine, and hand hygiene failed to acknowledge how caste disparities influenced access to adequate housing and clean water. Effective home quarantine necessitated a well-ventilated space for isolation, yet 17% of Dalit households lacked proper ventilation, and approximately 71% of Dalits could not afford regular hand-washing with soap. Consequently, existing inequalities exacerbated differential exposure to the pandemic among different social groups in India.
Modi's approach to social disparities and stigmatization during the implementation of social distancing and quarantine measures was notably lacking. In March 2020, when the virus had already spread to thirteen states, Modi introduced a nationwide lockdown reminiscent of European models. The government mandated home-quarantine for incoming travelers, enforced a three-week national lockdown, and halted inter-state transportation. While this move was praised internationally, it still faced criticism. Despite the lesser emphasis on the lives-versus-livelihoods debate compared to Brazil, Modi's lockdown was problematic. It was sudden, poorly planned, lacked adequate testing, failed to provide sufficient shelter for migrant workers, and relied on HCQ for healthcare workers. Additionally, the historical tension between state and central government authorities during epidemics worsened, leading to accusations of authoritarianism against Modi.
Stringent measures implemented to control the spread of COVID-19 in India came at a significant human cost. The closure of businesses and construction sites in cities left over 100 million migrant laborers vulnerable, many of whom lacked a social safety net and were unable to afford food without pay. Consequently, numerous laborers embarked on grueling journeys back to their hometowns on foot, facing police brutality along the way. Despite a federal order to seal state borders in late March, except for Uttar Pradesh, migrants were left stranded. Prime Minister Modi's speeches in March portrayed these workers as "reckless" and "virus spreaders," further exacerbating their plight. It was not until May 2020 that the government arranged for the repatriation of migrant workers via the state-owned railway network, albeit without adequate virus-control measures. The lack of testing and social distancing on these trains facilitated the spread of the virus to rural areas. The challenges faced in transporting these workers were often disregarded, with some authorities even viewing the conditions as a means to develop herd immunity. Despite India having the highest number of COVID-19 cases globally by September 2020, the government began easing restrictions on inter-state travel in June. By the end of 2020, the Indian government claimed victory over the virus, despite ongoing challenges and the country's high case numbers.
In late 2020, similar to the situation in Manaus, Indian officials speculated by mid-October 2020 that India's cities were nearing herd immunity and anticipated a decline in the number of cases. However, by the first half of February 2021, although the number of new cases had decreased, it was not yet under control, signaling an impending second wave. Expectations regarding the effectiveness of a national immunization campaign were based on the assumption that herd immunity had been achieved, with over 70% of the population believed to have acquired some level of protection from prior infections, leading to the belief that a large portion of the population did not require vaccination. By January 3, 2021, two vaccines, Covaxin by Bharat Biotech and Covishield by Serum Institute of India in collaboration with AstraZeneca and Oxford University, had received approval. However, the national vaccination program faced various ethical, legal, and transparency issues, contributing to vaccine hesitancy and criticism. Covaxin's approval was based solely on Phase-I clinical trial data, and the vaccination rate remained slow due to competition between state governments and private hospitals for limited resources such as vaccines, ventilators, oxygen cylinders, and hospital beds. The government's sudden shift from prioritizing individuals over 50 for vaccination to including all adults over 18 without consulting states further complicated the situation. By mid-May 2021, only 13% of the population had been vaccinated, while most non-pharmacological interventions had been abandoned.
In April 2021, the government permitted "super-spreader" events like the Kumbh Mela, a significant Hindu festival along the Ganges, without implementing adequate mitigation measures. The shortcomings in government policy became apparent by May 2021 when a second wave, driven by the more virulent Delta variant, emerged, rendering "herd immunity" relatively ineffective. The Delta variant proliferated rapidly, leading to a daily average of 325,000 new cases. During this period, the country accounted for over 40% of global new cases. In early June 2021, Modi shifted blame to former Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, removing him from the Cabinet. Modi also attributed responsibility for the second wave to state governments rather than his federal administration, aiming to portray the tragedy as a consequence of mismanagement by lower authorities rather than his policies. Subsequently, as COVID-19 mortality rates decreased, media coverage of the crisis waned.
Although Modi and Bolsonaro held differing views on lockdowns, both relied on radical assumptions regarding herd immunity that dehumanized significant portions of their populations. The concept of herd immunity, as implemented, carried troubling necropolitical implications, suggesting that the deaths of many "expendable" individuals were not only necessary but also acceptable. Among the marginalized communities affected were Amazonian Indigenous groups and impoverished Afro-Brazilians in Brazil, as well as the Muslim minority, Dalits, and migrant workers in India. The governments of Brazil and India opted for vaccines as a quick solution without addressing the underlying issues of poor living conditions, revealing an initially concealed necropolitical stance. Unfortunately, as case numbers decreased, this stance became normalized. Consequently, it is evident that the political responses to the COVID-19 crisis only served to worsen and further obscure the ongoing historical realities of racism and discrimination.
The necropolitical strategies employed by Bolsonaro and Modi can be succinctly characterized by their endorsement of an extreme interpretation of herd immunity, the deliberate withholding of information regarding the ill, and the clandestine enforcement of measures that effectively heighten the mortality rates among marginalized communities. These approaches endured through subsequent phases characterized by decreases in death tolls, largely due to the fragmented opposition from civil society, the media, and other stakeholders. Many center and right-wing politicians, even those privately critical of governmental decisions, found it politically unfeasible to attribute the unnecessarily high mortality rates to official necropolitics. Accusing the ruling elite of complicity in deeming certain societal segments expendable was deemed too risky. Instead, these politicians opted for the term "mismanagement," a less confrontational critique that allowed the perpetuation of necropolitical norms in a more subdued and regulated manner.
