Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, numerous scientific reports have highlighted the oral cavity as a potential route of infection, emphasizing the implications for dental practices and the utility of saliva in diagnosing COVID-19. In this review, we aim to examine the existing literature concerning the role of salivary glands and saliva in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while also providing a concise discussion on oral manifestations associated with the disease.
The initial documentation of human coronavirus dates back to 1965 [1], with a prevailing belief that these viruses had the potential to trigger a significant disease outbreak [2]. Notably, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have been responsible for outbreaks such as SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 [3]. The first instance of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), attributed to SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan city, China [4]. Despite ongoing discussions regarding the origins of the COVID-19-causing virus, reports indicate that it was not deliberately engineered [4,5].
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible among individuals through close contact with infected patients, resulting in its rapid global dissemination by infected travelers originating from China. Additionally, a significant number of undocumented infections have been identified, contributing to the swift spread of COVID-19. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern due to its devastating impact, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives worldwide. As per the latest data provided by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (coronavirus.jhu.edu/), the global tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases stood at 5,432,512 with 345,375 fatalities as of May 25.
Numerous published reports have highlighted the oral cavity as a primary route of infection [8], emphasizing the implications for dental practice [9] and the potential utility of saliva in diagnosing COVID-19 [10,11]. A recent communication proposed that hyposalivation may increase the susceptibility of patients to contracting the coronavirus disease [12], with taste loss being a reported symptom in COVID-19-positive individuals [13]. In this review, we aim to critically examine the existing literature concerning the role of salivary glands and saliva in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while also briefly discussing oral manifestations.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a crucial receptor for cell entry and replication. Furthermore, it relies on the cellular transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for spike protein priming, and inhibiting TMPRSS2 could potentially offer some protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the viral spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 seems to rely on sialic acid-rich proteins and gangliosides GM1 for its function. Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids containing sialic acid that are predominantly found in mammalian tissues, with the highest concentration in the brain. Specifically, gangliosides GM1 are known for their role as a crucial component of membrane rafts, which are involved in various cellular processes, including pathogen entry.
The major (submandibular, parotid, and sublingual) and minor salivary glands play a crucial role in secreting saliva within the oral cavity. Saliva serves various functions such as lubrication, aiding in digestion, and providing immunity. This biofluid is composed of water, ions, and various protein groups, notably mucins, which are glycosylated proteins with a high sialic acid content. Additionally, saliva is known to contain a plethora of disease biomarkers that can be identified and utilized for diagnostic purposes.
The presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in the oral epithelium [8], as well as in coughed-out material [10,21] and swabs of human saliva [22], underscoring the significance of saliva in diagnostic approaches. It is important to acknowledge that certain studies did not delve into the origin of the virus [10,21]. In a particular investigation, saliva was directly collected from the submandibular duct, which drains saliva from the bilateral submandibular and sublingual glands, after lifting the tongue of each patient [23]. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 expression was detected in 12.90% of COVID-19 patients in this study [23]. Furthermore, Chen and colleagues' research revealed a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 expression in critically ill patients (3 out of 4), indicating potential viral invasion due to elevated viral loads or compromised salivary glands in the advanced stages of the disease [23]. Examination of ACE2 in human organs demonstrated a notable ACE2 expression in minor salivary glands [24]. Apart from the abundant sialic acids in salivary mucin, the presence of gangliosides GM1 [25] and TMPRSS2 [26] in salivary glands was also observed. Collectively, existing literature suggests the susceptibility of salivary glands to SARS-CoV-2 infection [23]. However, based on the current body of evidence, it is premature to speculate on their role as reservoirs for the virus.
The secretion of salivary glands is influenced by various factors such as temperature, circadian rhythm, intensity, type of taste, and chemosensory, masticatory, or tactile stimulation [20]. Hyposalivation, characterized by a decrease in unstimulated salivary flow rate, is frequently observed in patients, often attributed to medication usage and psychological factors [27].
Dry mouth has been observed in a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients, as indicated in recent research [23]. A recent communication has highlighted hyposalivation as a factor that may increase the susceptibility of patients to contracting COVID-19, potentially due to a reduction in the presence of antiviral proteins in saliva [12]. Notably, severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection are more prevalent in individuals aged over 50 and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular issues, and neurological diseases [28-30]. Age-related reduction in salivary flow, not solely attributed to medication use in older adults, is a known phenomenon [31]. Additionally, diabetes and medications for systemic conditions have been linked to hyposalivation [32,33]. It is important to consider that infectious and inflammatory processes can also contribute to hyposalivation, suggesting the possibility of qualitative and quantitative disruptions in saliva secretion due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the salivary gland.
Taste disorders have been documented across a range of clinical conditions [34]. Amblygeustia, characterized by reduced taste sensitivity, has been observed in a significant portion of COVID-19 cases [23]. A study involving individuals presenting with influenza-like symptoms who were tested for COVID-19 revealed that 68% (40 out of 59) reported a loss of smell and 71% (42 out of 59) reported a loss of taste among those who tested positive for COVID-19, indicating the importance of considering chemosensory dysfunction in symptom screening [13].
Low salivary flow rates and disruptions in salivary biomarkers have been proposed as potential causes of xerostomia, a condition often linked to taste-related complaints. Additionally, oral neuropathy or interruptions in neurological transduction due to changes in salivary composition can lead to sensory issues and taste dysfunction. It is important to also consider the possibility of taste changes resulting from the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on sensory neurons or other elements of the peripheral gustatory system.
The oral cavity can serve as a window to underlying diseases, with manifestations such as oral ulcerations, gingival bleeding, glossitis, oral pain, or halitosis being common indicators [39]. Viral infections typically present as either ulceration or blistering of oral tissues [40,41]. A case report has even suggested that recurrent oral ulcers could potentially serve as an initial symptom of COVID-19 [42]. Furthermore, a report detailing three cases highlighted that pain and intraoral manifestations like oral ulcers or blisters were often observed before patients sought medical attention for COVID-19 [43]. Consequently, it has been recommended to conduct thorough intraoral examinations in individuals suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection [43]. Given the novelty of these oral findings in the literature, their prevalence may vary significantly among COVID-19 patients, potentially influenced by associated systemic diseases and/or poor oral health. Considering the potential immunocompromised status of patients, it is plausible that the oral manifestations could also be linked to other viruses or bacteria.
Research on Sars-CoV-2 infection highlights its impact on oral health, necessitating further studies to elucidate the precise involvement of salivary glands and saliva in individuals afflicted with COVID-19.
