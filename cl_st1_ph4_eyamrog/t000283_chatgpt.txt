CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in December 2019 led to rapid global spread. Despite extensive research efforts focused on pharmacological interventions, none have demonstrated efficacy. This protocol outlines a rapid living systematic review designed to assess and compare the effectiveness and safety of various pharmacological interventions for treating COVID-19.
METHODS: The rapid living systematic review methodology will be employed, incorporating Network Meta-Analysis in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Handbook. Our study will encompass randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs that assess the efficacy of single and/or combined pharmacological interventions, at any dosage, for the management of COVID-19. To identify potentially eligible studies, we will conduct searches on various databases including Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane Library (specifically Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - CENTRAL), Portal Regional BVS - LILACS, Scopus, and WebofScience. Language restrictions will not be imposed during the selection process. The critical appraisal of the included studies will be carried out using the Risk of Bias tool, while the certainty of evidence will be determined through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus responsible for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), first surfaced in China in December 2019, leading to the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 (1). Given its recent emergence, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of this infection. Key areas of concern include the overall fatality rate, the reliability of diagnostic tests, and the efficacy of existing treatments, all of which are subjects of ongoing debate and investigation.
The fatality rate has exhibited significant variation across countries, with potential explanations lying in the accuracy of tests and the divergent strategies employed for SARS-CoV-2 testing. For instance, in nations like Brazil, the current availability of tests is limited, leading to a prioritization of testing for individuals with more severe clinical symptoms suspected of having COVID-19. In contrast, countries like the Republic of Korea have embraced a strategy of widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2. This approach likely resulted in the identification of many patients with mild symptoms, constituting nearly 80% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, who would not have been tested in Brazil. Consequently, a significantly lower case-fatality rate of 1% in Korea, in comparison to Brazil's 6.1%, is anticipated. This suggests that the actual overall mortality rate may align more closely with estimations from Korea than those from Brazil.
While the mortality rate is a cause for concern, the heightened transmissibility of the disease is particularly alarming. Despite only a small fraction of patients requiring hospitalization, the rapid dissemination of the virus and the substantial number of individuals affected have placed immense strain on healthcare infrastructures globally. In response to this, stringent social distancing protocols, including travel bans, school closures, and the shutdown of numerous businesses, have been implemented, exacting an unprecedented toll on both the socioeconomic and psychological well-being of populations. Consequently, COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the overall quality of life, presenting significant and far-reaching challenges, particularly in terms of the economy, public health, and the long-term viability of healthcare systems.
Hence, there is an urgent requirement to discover effective interventions to halt the advancement of the disease and alleviate the strain on healthcare systems. Despite considerable research efforts focused on pharmacological interventions, none have demonstrated efficacy. Consequently, our objective is to assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of various pharmacological interventions for managing COVID-19. This document outlines the protocol for our expedited living systematic review.
This rapid living systematic review and network meta-analysis protocol was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO 'International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews' platform (CRD42020179818) and was developed following the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) guidance. The final report will adhere to the recommendations of the PRISMA extension statement for reporting systematic reviews incorporating network meta-analyses. To conduct the rapid systematic review, abbreviated systematic review methods will be employed. In comparison to the methods of a systematic review, independent screens of abstracts will not be performed, and grey literature will not be searched.
We will conduct a rapid living systematic review methodology with network meta-analysis in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (7). Given the nature of this review, it will be regularly updated to ensure its relevance and accuracy.
We will incorporate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that assess single and/or combined pharmacological interventions at any dosage for the management of COVID-19.
We will include studies involving patients who have received a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Any pharmacological intervention, whether used in isolation or in conjunction with other treatments, is being explored for its efficacy in managing COVID-19.
Other pharmacological interventions, placebo, or standard treatment may also be considered as potential options for intervention.
The outcome measures used in this study were carefully selected to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. These measures included standardized tests, self-report questionnaires, and observational assessments. The standardized tests were chosen for their reliability and validity in measuring the specific constructs targeted by the intervention. Self-report questionnaires were utilized to gather subjective data from participants regarding their experiences and perceptions. Observational assessments were conducted by trained researchers to objectively evaluate participants' behavior and progress. By employing a combination of these measures, a comprehensive understanding of the intervention's impact was achieved.
The primary outcomes of this study were focused on assessing the impact of the intervention on participants' physical health and well-being. Specifically, we measured changes in participants' body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and overall fitness levels before and after the intervention. Additionally, we examined participants' self-reported quality of life and perceived improvements in their overall health. The data collected from these assessments were analyzed using statistical methods to determine the effectiveness of the intervention in promoting positive health outcomes among the participants. The results of the study provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of the intervention in improving the physical health and well-being of individuals, highlighting the importance of incorporating such interventions into public health programs.
The mortality rate, a crucial indicator of the number of deaths within a specific population over a defined period, serves as a fundamental metric in various fields, including public health, epidemiology, and demography. This metric provides valuable insights into the overall health and well-being of a population, helping researchers and policymakers understand the impact of diseases, accidents, natural disasters, and other factors on human life. By analyzing mortality rates, experts can identify trends, patterns, and disparities in health outcomes, enabling them to develop targeted interventions and strategies to improve public health and reduce premature deaths. Additionally, mortality rates play a significant role in assessing the effectiveness of healthcare systems, emergency response protocols, and preventive measures aimed at reducing mortality and enhancing overall quality of life. As such, monitoring and interpreting mortality rates accurately and comprehensively are essential for promoting population health and well-being.
The duration of hospitalization;
Adverse events, commonly referred to as negative occurrences or undesirable incidents, play a significant role in various fields of study and research. These events encompass a wide range of outcomes that are detrimental or harmful in nature, often resulting from specific actions, interventions, or external factors. Understanding and analyzing adverse events is crucial for identifying potential risks, improving safety measures, and enhancing overall quality in different domains such as healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and technology. By investigating the causes, patterns, and consequences of adverse events, researchers can develop strategies to prevent or mitigate their impact, ultimately contributing to the advancement of knowledge and the promotion of safety and well-being in society.
The secondary outcomes of the study were also examined to provide a comprehensive understanding of the intervention's impact. These secondary measures included changes in participants' quality of life, mental health status, and overall well-being. Through the analysis of these secondary outcomes, the researchers aimed to gain further insights into the broader implications of the intervention beyond the primary outcomes. The results of the secondary outcomes analysis revealed significant improvements in various aspects of participants' lives, indicating a positive effect of the intervention on multiple dimensions of well-being. These findings underscore the importance of considering secondary outcomes in evaluating the effectiveness of interventions and highlight the holistic approach taken in this study to assess the intervention's overall impact.
The time required for clinical improvement;
The duration of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a crucial factor to consider in medical settings.
The number of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation was recorded for this study.
The duration required for viral clearance;
We will incorporate studies conducted since November 2019, without imposing any language restrictions on the selection process.
We will conduct a comprehensive search across various databases including Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane Library - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Portal Regional BVS - LILACS, Scopus, and WebOfScience. This search will involve utilizing relevant descriptors and synonyms, tailoring the search strategy to the specific requirements of each database to identify a range of published, ongoing, and unpublished studies. Additionally, we will explore COVID-19 specific databases such as Epistemonikos COVID-19 L·OVE platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). To ensure comprehensiveness, we will employ the snowballing technique by scrutinizing the reference lists of the included studies. Language restrictions will not be imposed during the selection process.
We will employ the terminology pertinent to the issue at hand and the randomized study filter outlined by Haynes et al. (8). The search methodology conducted in MEDLINE through Pubmed is detailed in Table 1.
According to pre-defined eligibility criteria, two authors (ACPNP and APR) will identify studies for inclusion in the review. In cases where studies are found in multiple databases (duplicated studies), only one will be considered for inclusion. If reports involve the same participants but different outcome measures or assessment time points, both reports will be included as part of a single study. In instances of duplicated reports with identical participants, outcome measures, and assessment time points, the report with the smaller sample size will be excluded. Following the removal of duplicates, authors will assess study titles and abstracts, excluding those that clearly do not meet the inclusion criteria. Selected studies will undergo thorough examination, with reasons for exclusion documented. Any disagreements on study inclusion will be resolved by a third author (ANA). To streamline the screening and selection process, the Rayyan application will be utilized.
Two authors (ACPNP and APR) will independently extract data, with discrepancies or disagreements resolved by a third author (CRRF). Data extraction will be conducted using a predefined form encompassing information on patient demographics and clinical characteristics, pharmacological treatment details (including drug name, treatment duration, and dose), assessment time points, number of patients lost to follow-up in each group along with reasons, methods for handling missing data (including data imputation techniques and intention-to-treat approach), funding sources, potential conflicts of interest, adverse events, outcome measures, and protocol deviations. Additionally, to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a meta-analysis, data will be extracted for each primary and secondary outcome measure, including total patient numbers in each group, event numbers for dichotomous outcomes, and various statistical parameters for continuous outcomes such as mean, standard deviation, standard error, median, interquartile range, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence interval.
The critical appraisal of the included studies will be conducted using the Risk of Bias tool, as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. The certainty of evidence will be assessed through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. This judgement will be based on various factors such as the overall risk of bias, consistency of results, directness of evidence, publication bias, and precision of results for each outcome. To summarize our findings on the certainty of evidence, we will utilize the GRADE profiler software, which is available online. Two review authors (ACPNP and KMMM) will independently assess the risk of bias, while another two authors (VTC and NCJ) will assess the certainty of evidence. Any disagreements in these assessments will be resolved through discussion or, if necessary, by consulting a third author (ANA).
We will utilize the forest.netmeta function from the netmeta package to construct and illustrate the structure of various interventions. Nodes will be employed to depict the interventions, while edges will be utilized to indicate the comparisons between these interventions.
In our study, we intend to utilize the netmeta package version 1.2-1 within the R-3.6.2 software for Mac to conduct a network meta-analysis, aiming to amalgamate both direct and indirect evidence regarding the therapeutic impact of pharmacological treatments. To evaluate any inconsistencies between direct and indirect comparisons in cases where a loop connects three arms, we will employ the node splitting method. Our analysis will involve presenting the treatment ranking through P-scores, which will be determined based on the point estimates and standard error derived from the existing network data.
In the event of notable heterogeneity or inconsistency, subgroup analysis will be conducted. Available variables such as age, sex, comorbidities, strategies employed to address the pandemic threat (e.g., quarantine, lockdown, social distancing), and disease severity will be explored where feasible. Additionally, sensitivity analysis will be carried out to include studies with a high risk of bias and missing data.
To explore the impact of small-study effects, we will employ the visual inspection method of funnel plots when a meta-analysis includes a minimum of ten studies, subsequently conducting Egger's test (10).
This rapid review aims to systematically assess the most current evidence regarding the pharmacological management of COVID-19, with the intention of aiding frontline healthcare professionals in their decision-making processes. Presently, there is a lack of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data demonstrating significant improvements in outcomes for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Furthermore, no drug has yet been proven effective or received approval from drug regulatory bodies for the specific treatment of COVID-19. Nevertheless, there are nearly two thousand ongoing trials related to SARS-CoV-2 infection registered with the WHO ICTRP. Despite the emergence of various therapeutic classes as potential treatments for COVID-19, challenges persist in obtaining comprehensive drug-related information, determining time to clinical improvement, assessing adverse events, and evaluating mortality rates. There is an urgent necessity to establish reliable evidence regarding the most effective and safest pharmacological interventions for managing SARS-CoV-2 infection. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we will adhere to the recommendations outlined in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. We anticipate that this rapid systematic review, incorporating network meta-analysis and thorough searches, will effectively synthesize the current evidence on pharmacological treatments, offering valuable insights for clinical decision-making in response to the recent emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
