In March 2020, the rapid surge in COVID-19 cases overwhelmed the Italian healthcare system, leading to the country being identified as the epicenter of the pandemic.
Methods: This study offers a narrative review that draws upon a comprehensive analysis of manuscripts, official documents, and newspaper articles pertaining to the impact of COVID-19 in Italy.
Results: This section presents an overview of the epidemic's characteristics, potential factors contributing to its exacerbation, and the strategies implemented in various regions of Italy.
Conclusions: During the initial phases of an epidemic, making informed decisions is crucial in curtailing the number of cases. The implementation of medical assistance for patients and the enforcement of social isolation measures stand out as the most suitable strategies presently accessible to mitigate the transmission and fatality rates associated with COVID-19.
In March 2020, the epidemic stemming from the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) escalated into a global pandemic, with Italy emerging at the forefront in terms of COVID-19 cases and fatalities. This development prompts a crucial inquiry: what transpired in Italy, the initial Western nation to be struck by COVID-19, that led it to become the epicenter of the pandemic? Of particular relevance to us is the question of what insights can be gleaned from the Italian ordeal to mitigate the pandemic's impact in Brazil. In this context, we offer a narrative review of articles released between February and April 2020 in scientific publications, institutional platforms, and the media at large, focusing on the COVID-19 crisis in Italy.
In March, the media and social platforms widely disseminated distressing visuals depicting overwhelmed Italian hospitals, including packed emergency rooms, patients lying on stretchers in hallways, surgical facilities repurposed as intensive care units (ICUs), healthcare workers falling ill (and succumbing), and hospital beds being occupied by 50-70% of COVID-19 patients. The shortage of essential medical equipment forced physicians into the difficult predicament of determining respirator allocation based on survival probabilities.
Italy boasts one of the world's leading public health systems, rendering it simplistic to attribute the observed chaos within the system solely to a shortage of health services. The abrupt surge of COVID-19 patients requiring ICU beds highlights the unlikelihood of any health system being adequately equipped to handle such a sudden and overwhelming influx.
As of May 17, Italy ranked third in terms of COVID-19 deaths, with a total of 31,763 fatalities, trailing behind the United States of America (85,860) and the United Kingdom (34,466). Despite the limitations inherent in current lethality statistics, which are based on the number of patients with positive molecular tests, predominantly comprising inpatients with more severe illness, the alarming nature of the Italian figures cannot be overlooked. One commonly cited explanation for this elevated lethality rate is Italy's status as one of the countries with the highest proportion of elderly individuals globally, with approximately 23% of the population aged over 65. Advanced age has been identified as a significant risk factor associated with increased mortality from SARS-CoV-2.
Nursing homes catering to elderly individuals in Italy have emerged as high-risk environments due to the advanced age and multiple comorbidities of their residents, resulting in a significant number of COVID-19 related fatalities. For instance, the province of Bergamo reported over 600 deaths within a span of 20 days, representing a substantial portion of the available 6,400 beds, with 40% of staff either on sick leave or in isolation. While not all fatalities can be definitively linked to COVID-19 due to diagnostic limitations, the sheer volume of deaths coupled with staff illnesses strongly suggests a correlation. On March 8, a decree was issued by Lombardy's political leaders urging nursing homes to admit patients with milder COVID-19 symptoms to free up hospital and ICU space, despite the lack of scientific backing. While most facilities declined this directive out of concern for virus transmission among residents, some complied. The repercussions of this decision are now being scrutinized in the Italian media, necessitating a thorough evaluation of its actual impact. Nonetheless, it remains imperative to shield older adults, particularly the frail and institutionalized, from harm by minimizing contact with external sources, including their own families, to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
The advanced age of a significant portion of the Italian population could contribute to the high number of deaths, yet it does not offer a complete rationale. Delays in political measures aimed at containing the epidemic's spread throughout the country were evident. In a study featured in the Harvard Business Review, Pisano et al. conducted an in-depth examination of the political response to the crisis in Italy, underscoring the critical role of prompt decision-making and effective interventions based on available data. The authors stressed that the efficacy of such actions is directly proportional to the immediacy of decision-making, suggesting that politicians must be prepared for the possibility that their proactive measures, while potentially preventing an outbreak, could later be deemed excessive or unnecessary.
The delay in implementing social isolation measures and movement restrictions, coupled with a public event in late February where politicians in Milan exchanged handshakes to signify that the economy should not be halted due to the epidemic, contributed to the dissemination of misinformation regarding the risks associated with virus transmission. Concurrently, public gatherings in Lombardy during the same month brought together large crowds. Events such as agricultural fairs in Bergamo and Brescia, a soccer match between Atalanta (Bergamo) and Valencia (Spain) for the Champions League held in Milan, and the prevalent issue of environmental pollution in this heavily industrialized region were all suggested as potential factors contributing to the high concentration of COVID-19 cases in Lombardy, which accounted for half of the total Italian cases.
In the study conducted by Pisano et al. (9), a comparison was made between Lombardy and Veneto, two of Italy's wealthiest regions. Despite their similar socioeconomic profiles, the rapid surge in COVID-19 cases witnessed in Lombardy was not mirrored in Veneto. The authors attributed this discrepancy to the differing approaches in managing suspected cases of COVID-19. While both regions implemented the social distancing measures mandated by the Italian government, Veneto's strategies were more comprehensive. These included testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, isolating positive cases and their households (with testing of neighbors), and safeguarding healthcare workers and other frontline professionals. Veneto also prioritized home care for mild cases or early-stage patients, thereby alleviating the strain on hospitals—a contrast to Lombardy's situation where high hospitalization rates led to increased risks of nosocomial transmission among patients and healthcare staff.
The decentralization of the Italian health system hindered the adoption of uniform measures nationwide. Gradual implementation of restrictive measures, such as the progressive closure of cities and regions, yielded questionable results in effectively controlling the virus spread. The central government's decision to close northern Italy led to many individuals from southern Italy, residing in the affected areas, returning to their hometowns, inadvertently carrying the virus to other regions. Pisano et al. (9) highlighted that Italy's response to the virus was reactive rather than proactive, allowing for its rapid dissemination instead of containment.
In Italy, hospitals receive approximately 45% of health system funding, a figure exceeding the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 38%. Giuseppe Ippolito, the Scientific Director of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani in Rome, highlights the prevailing emphasis on superior hospital care over primary care across the nation. In times of pandemics like the current one, there arises a crucial necessity for community-focused healthcare and readiness for potential future epidemics, all of which can be effectively managed through a centralized system coordinating necessary actions. Ippolito emphasizes the essentiality of a centralized health model for infectious disease management, stating, "A centralized health model is needed for the management of infectious diseases. Without such a system we will not be able to get out of this."
As of May 17, Italy had reported 223,885 cases of COVID-19. Despite the initial surge in deaths, with nearly 1,000 fatalities in a single day, the numbers began to decline, with daily deaths dropping to less than 200. Similarly, ICU admissions also decreased. The implementation of restrictive measures, albeit delayed, potentially averted an estimated 38,000 Italian deaths, as suggested by projections from the Imperial College, with a range of 13,000 to 84,000 lives potentially saved.
In Brazil, we are currently experiencing an upward trend in the pandemic curve, marked by a rapid increase in cases and subsequent rise in fatalities. Major metropolitan areas like Manaus, Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo are facing a critical situation with a significant portion of ICU beds already occupied. The conflicting messages from political figures, delayed and inconsistent implementation of containment measures, and inadequate healthcare system readiness have collectively contributed to our country becoming the fourth highest in confirmed COVID-19 cases as of May 17, 2020, surpassing both Italy and Spain. To date, Brazil has reported 233,142 cases and 15,633 deaths. Regrettably, Brazil has not learned from the mistakes made by Italy in managing the pandemic.
In light of the current lack of proven effective treatments or a preventive vaccine, it is imperative that we provide supportive care to patients and implement non-pharmacological interventions. Given the circumstances, the most effective approach for individuals to help curb the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is to minimize contact with others. By adhering to this practice, we can facilitate the readiness of the healthcare system, thereby enhancing our prospects of accessing appropriate medical attention and overcoming the challenges posed by this novel virus.
