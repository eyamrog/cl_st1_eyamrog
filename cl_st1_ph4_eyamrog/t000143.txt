Abstract 
Objective: This research analyzed the joint spatial distribution and explored possible 
associations between epidemiological aspects and feminicide rates, in the municipalities 
of the State of Sergipe located into northeastern Brazilian. Methodology: An 
exploratory ecological study investigated the global spatial autocorrelation of 
epidemiological aspects with feminicide rates from municipalities of the State of 
Sergipe – Brazil (n= 75), in the 2013-2017 period, using the “global” and “local” Moran 
statistic method and a multiple spatial regression, having as variables of exposure the 
socioeconomic status, the demographic status, the services and health status, feminicide 
rates. The software used was Stata 11.0, SPSS 18.0 and GeoDa 0.95-i. Results:  The 
spatial distribution of the femicide rates was not random and showed high spatial 
autocorrelation and predominance of significant spatial groupings of municipalities with 
the highest mortality rates due to feminicide in the central region of Sergipe State. In the 
multiple regression, the percentage of women heads of families and the Municipal 
Human Development Index were positively associated with the rates of femicide in 
Sergipe's municipalities in the studied period (p <0.05). The opposite situation occurred 
between the GINI Index and the rates of femicide. Conclusions: This is the first study 
that analyze the factors associated with the spatial clusters of feminicide rates in a 
geographical space where there is a predominance of patriarchal culture. There was an 
increase in femicide in locations where there is lowest social inequality, greater human 
development and greater authority exercised by women in the family environment.

Resumo 
 
Objetivo: Esta pesquisa analisou a distribuição espacial conjunta e explorou possíveis 
associações entre aspectos epidemiológicos e taxas de feminicídio, nos municípios do 
Estado de Sergipe, localizados no nordeste brasileiro. Metodologia: Um estudo 
ecológico exploratório investigou a autocorrelação espacial global de aspectos 
epidemiológicos com taxas de feminicídio em municípios do Estado de Sergipe - Brasil 
(n = 75), no período 2013-2017, utilizando a estatística de Moran “global” e “local” e 
uma regressão espacial múltipla, tendo como variáveis a condição socioeconômica, a 
situação demográfica, os serviços e estado de saúde, taxas de feminicídio. Os softwares 
utilizados foram Stata 11.0, SPSS 18.0 e GeoDa 0.95-i. Resultados: A distribuição 
espacial das taxas de feminicídio não foi aleatória e apresentou elevada autocorrelação 
espacial e predomínio de agrupamentos espaciais significativos de municípios com as 
maiores taxas de mortalidade por feminicídio na região central do Estado de Sergipe. Na 
regressão múltipla, o percentual de mulheres chefes de família e o Índice de 
Desenvolvimento Humano Municipal associaram-se positivamente às taxas de 
feminicídio nos municípios sergipanos no período estudado (p <0,05). Situação oposta 
ocorreu entre o Índice GINI e as taxas de feminicídio. Conclusões: Este é o primeiro 
estudo que analisa os fatores associados aos clusters espaciais das taxas de feminicídio 
em um espaço geográfico onde há predomínio da cultura patriarcal. Houve aumento do 
feminicídio em localidades onde há menor desigualdade social, maior desenvolvimento 
humano e maior autoridade exercida pelas mulheres no ambiente familiar.

Femicide is rooted in gender inequality and contributes to perpetuate the 
subordinate position of women in society at a legal, social and economic level, being 
considered a serious public health problem already described by the World Health 
Organization over 30 years ago 1,2. 
Brazil ranks 5th on the world scale of femicide, preceded only by El Salvador, 
Colombia, Guatemala and Russia 3. The Map of Violence in Brazil (2015) already 
illustrated rising rates of female deaths from aggression in the 1980-2013 period and 
rising mortality rates in the period ranging from 2.3/100,000 - 4.8/100,000 women, 
respectively 4. This trend has remained over time, as described in the latest edition of 
the Atlas of Violence in Brazil in 2019, which shows upward results in 2017, about 13 
murders deaths by aggression per day - making a total of 4,936 women murdered by 
aggression in this year, the highest recorded since 2007 5. There was an increase of 
30.7% in the number of women murdered by aggression during the years 2007-2017, 
with an increase of 6.3% between 2016-2017. The northeastern region of the country 
stood out for presenting expressive rates of women murdered by aggression in 2017: 
Rio Grande do Norte (67.4), followed by Ceará (64.0), Pernambuco (62.3), Sergipe 
(58, 9), Bahia (55.3), Alagoas (53.9), Paraíba (33.9), Maranhão (31.9) and Piauí (20.9) 
5. Among Brazilian states, Sergipe draws attention for presenting the highest increase in 
the rate of femicide per 100 thousand women (163.9%) between the years 2017 and 
2018 5. 
It is clear that despite the promulgation of what is known as the “Maria da 
Penha Law” which aimed to create mechanisms to curb domestic and family violence 
against women, female mortality from aggression in Brazil has increased more than 
twice in the last 30 years (Maria da Penha Law, Law n. 11.340, August 7th, 2006; 
Meneghel et al., 2013). It is not known for sure whether the increase in police records of

femicide reflects an increase in the number of cases, or a decrease in underreporting, 
since the “Maria da Penha Law” is relatively new, so that there may be an ongoing 
learning process by the judicial authorities 5. On the other hand, this can had happened 
because this device often left room for reprisals that often culminated in femicide 8,9. In 
order to change this sad Brazilian reality, another important law called the “Femicide 
Law” was implemented with the purpose of being even more rigorous in coercing 
aggressors and making this phenomenon still visible. With the amendment of article 121 
of the Brazilian Penal Code, femicide becomes qualified in the list of heinous crimes 
(Femicide Law, Law n. 13.104, March 9th, 2015; Teles, 2018). 
Studies have shown an increase in femicides in capitals and large Brazilian 
cities, in the three-year periods of 2007-2009 and 2011-2013, mainly among young, 
poor, black, single and low-educated women 3. Paradoxically, some studies on femicide 
have pointed out that poor women are more affected, since they observed a positive 
association between poverty and female deaths 12,13. The contexts of women's homicides 
are diverse and obey distinct social dynamics and peculiarities to the geographic context 
of origin, in which the gender marker is always present 3. 
In addition, northeastern society, especially that of the state of Sergipe, 
culturally preserves provincial habits and traditions in a peculiar way, whose 
valorization of families with surnames, titles and economic possessions is an indelible 
mark in the history of the patriarchy present in the Northeast of Brazil 14,15. In this sense, 
it is important to highlight that there is evidence that points to an increase in this type of 
violence in places where patriarchal culture is still perpetuated 16, being justified by the 
fact that in more conservative communities, gender norms are more rigid and women 
remain submissive, strictly fulfilling and supporting for long periods the roles assigned 
to them by the culture 3.

Materials and methods 
This exploratory ecological study, approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
Federal University of Sergipe (CAEE 17504319.0.0000.5546), included secondary data 
from the Sergipe population, which is freely available in Brazilian databases. 
Sergipe is the smallest Brazilian state and sixth least populous in the country, 
has a geographical area of 21,926.908 km² and a population of 2,068,017 people, being 
divided into 8 territories (Agreste Central, Alto Sertão, Baixo São Francisco, Centro 
Sul, Grande Aracaju, Leste, Médio Sertão, Sul) and 75 municipalities, whose greatest 
distance from the capital of the state is around 200 km.17.  Sergipe is 20th in the national 
ranking of the Human Development Index and 4th in the ranking in this category among 
the states of the Northeast. Its capital, Aracaju is a true social and economic oasis of 
opportunities for other municipalities in the state, it concentrates the best development 
rates and indicators in Sergipe and thus offers the best job and service opportunities; 
aspects that have attracted to the capital the population residing in the interior of the 
state 17. Since more than half of the municipalities of Sergipe's State have a low Human 
development index and high social vulnerability index 18. 
The geographic and spatial data of each municipality in Sergipe, considering its 
latitude, longitude, perimeter, area and location were obtained from the website of the 
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics 17. 
The dependent variable of this study was determined from the female mortality 
rates due to aggression, calculated according to each municipality in Sergipe, in the 
period from 2013 to 2017. The coefficients were grouped into five years to decrease the 
temporal and geographic oscillations common in events of small magnitude. Gross 
mortality data due to aggression of women were retrieved from the Brazilian Ministry 
of Health's Mortality Information System and causes of death were be considered

according to the categories of the 10th edition of the International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD-10) in the range of X85 to Y09 19. The data of the total resident 
population in each municipality in the state of Sergipe in the period corresponding to the 
study were based on the 2010 population census and estimates for the inter-census years 
that were obtained on the website of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics 
17. Femicide rates were calculated by dividing the data on mortality from aggression by 
women in each of the Sergipe’s municipalities by the data on the total female population 
residing in the same place. 
The independent variables selected for this study were collected in several 
national databases in the studied period (2013-2017), being estimated the averages of 
the data available for each of these variables. These variables are described in detail 
below: 
Socioeconomic status: Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), Income 
Concentration Index (GINI Index), average household income per capita, percentage of 
the population with less than ½ minimum wage, percentage unemployed and percentage 
of female heads of household were recovered from the Brazilian Institute of Geography 
and Statistic website 20; and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was obtained from the 
Institute of Applied Economic Research18. 
Demographic status:  percentage of civil and/or religious marriage, percentage 
of Catholics, percentage of Evangelicals, percentage of the population without religion, 
percentage of the urban population, percentage of the rural population were recovered 
from IBGE website 20. 
Services and health status: percentage of population covered by the Unified 
Health System, mortality rate from Human Immunodeficiency Virus, maternal mortality

rate, cervical cancer mortality rate that were retrieved from the Health Information 
System websites of the Brazilian Ministry of Health 19. 
Univariate exploratory analysis of spatial data was performed to investigate 
global spatial autocorrelation of femicide rates in Sergipe's municipalities using the 
Moran I index, under the assumptions of normality and randomization 21. The 
distribution of Moran index values varies between -1,0 and +1,0 and tests whether 
connected areas present greater similarity in relation to the studied indicator, than would 
be expected in a random pattern. Thus, spatial autocorrelation measures the number of 
nearby objects compared to other nearby objects using the Moran I index, which can be 
classified as positive, negative and without spatial autocorrelation. 
The variables in this study were grouped into three blocks to jointly assess the 
indicators associated with femicide by Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), where the 
direction and magnitude of the associations between the independent variables were 
assessed using a correlation matrix: 1) socioeconomic status; 2) demographic status and 
3) services and health status. For this analysis, all variables were standardized with a 
mean of zero (0.0) and standard deviation equal to one (1.0), due to their different 
dimensions, which could impair their inclusion and interpretation in the model. 
Multiple spatial regression was performed in the last analysis phase. The quality 
of the fit of the spatial regression model is similar to the traditional linear regression 
model, verified by the residual analysis and also based on the Moran I index 22. The 
following criteria were used to include or remove variables from the model: 1) Selection 
of the variable with the highest statistical correlation; 2) Inclusion of variables that, 
when analyzed together, obtained a higher F in the simple regression analysis; This 
inclusion does not prevent variables from the same block from being included as 
“adjustment variables”, regardless of their association. 3) Inclusion of variables that,

once in partial correlation, controlled by modeled variables, showed significant 
correlation with the dependent variable. The final model exclusion criteria for the 
variables were the value of p ≥0,05. The software used was Stata 11.0, SPSS 18.0 and 
GeoDa 0.95-i.

Results 
A standardized average mortality rate of 26,80 death/100,000 women in 
Sergipe's municipalities. The spatial distribution of femicide rates are illustrated in 
Figure 1. It is observed that the highest rates occurred in Sergipe's territories that 
correspond to the Grande Aracaju (45.54 death/100,000 women), Sul (32.97 
death/100,000 women), Agreste Central (32.44 death/100,000 women), Médio Sertão 
(27.37 death/100,000 women), Centro Sul (26.39 death/100,000 women), Baixo São 
Francisco (17.59 death/100,000 women), Alto Sertão (16.79 death/100,000 women) and 
Leste (16,04 death/100,000 women), successively. Among the 75 municipalities in the 
state of Sergipe, its capital Aracaju is in 37th position in the ranking of femicide. 
There was not a random distribution of this rate with positive spatial 
autocorrelation (I=0,0993881; p-valor = 0,001 for 999 permutations). It is possible to 
observe the occurrence of spatial autocorrelations of the "high-high" type, indicating a 
grouping of municipalities in Sergipe with the highest mortality rates due to feminicide 
located in the central region of Sergipe (Areia Branca, Malhador, Santa Rosa de Lima, 
Ribeirópolis) and the "low-low" type, considered the group with the lowest rate, 
represented by the municipalities of Nossa Senhora de Lourdes, Propriá, São Francisco 
and Japaratuba (Fig. 2). It was also observed the occurrence of spatial autocorrelations 
of the "low-high" type, in the municipality of Maruim, meaning that the municipality or 
the spatial group presents low values regarding the rates of femicide, but high rates in 
the surrounding municipalities (Fig. 2). An inverse condition was observed in the 
municipalities of Lagarto, Aquidabã and Carmópolis, where spatial autocorrelations of 
the “high-low” type occurred, a scenario in which these municipalities present high 
rates of femicide, but their surrounding municipalities have low rates (Fig. 2).

Moran Local's Statistics I (Fig. 3) is also of great importance for the analysis, 
since it shows the degree of significance of certain groups. According to the Local 
Space Association Indicator (LISA), the municipalities with the highest rates of 
femicide are Santa Rosa de Lima and Aquidabã. The analysis identified significant 
LISA sector clusters. The significance of this indicator in the period considered implies 
the existence of positive multidirectional externalities of the rates of femicide in the 
municipalities of the State of Sergipe. 
In the bivariate analysis (table 1), the percentage unemployed and the percentage 
of women heads of families (matriarchy had a statistically significant positive 
correlation with the rates of femicide (p< 0,01 and p < 0,05, respectively). There were 
also negative significant correlations between the proportion of the population with less 
than ½ minimum wage and feminicide rates (p < 0.05). 
Table 2 illustrates the results of the final spatial regression analysis model. The 
percentage of women heads of families (matriarchy) and the Municipal Human 
Development Index (MHDI) were positively associated with the rates of femicide in 
Sergipe's municipalities in the period between 2013 and 2017 (p <0.05). The opposite 
situation occurred between the Income Concentration Index (GINI Index) and the rates 
of femicide in these municipalities in the period studied.

Discussion 
This study has some limitations inherent to the methodology used. The 
possibility of ecological fallacy cannot be excluded, since an association observed 
between aggregates does not necessarily mean that the same association occurs in an 
individual level 23. The low construct validity is another possibility that cannot be ruled 
out, since not all explanatory outcomes of the variables may have been included in the 
methodology used 24. In order to reduce some of these limitations, this study worked 
with variables available in several national databases and may present differences in 
quality inherent to the use of indirect estimates 25. 
The results of the present study show a very uneven distribution of the rates 
of femicide per 100 thousand women in the Sergipe’s municipalities in the period 
studies, whose rates standardized ranged between 11.74 death/100,000 women and 
87.80 death/100,000 women (Figure 1). In order to adjust the differences in the 
distribution by sex of the population and, consequently, a possible confounding effect of 
the latter on the rates of feminicide in the municipalities of Sergipe, the direct method of 
standardization of these rates was employed 26, since there is a possibility of an increase 
or reduction of the female population to the detriment of the male population in some 
municipalities. In addition, the selection of women's deaths from aggression with a 
feminicide proxy variable could overestimate this phenomenon. However, a percentage 
of underreporting deaths of 24% in the Northeast region of Brazil should be expected 
2,17,27, which could compensate for underreporting or even the ill-defined diagnosis of 
the cause of death due to female aggression. 
There was a predominance of significant spatial groupings of femicide rates 
in the central Sergipe region (Fig. 2), which was confirmed by LISA (Fig. 3). Studies 
also show the possibility of some peculiar context in the central region of Sergipe,

despite not having found spatial dependence on the rates of femicide in the Sergipe’s 
municipalities in 2017 28, despite the findings of Grana 29 and Meneghel & Portella 30 
suggest that the incidence of femicide is higher in urban agglomerations and cities with 
a higher population density. It is known that the scenarios of feminicides are diverse and 
present peculiar geographical contexts that are associated with the female gender 30. 
There is an increase in femicide in places where there is a predominance of patriarchal 
culture, an indelible mark of Sergipe society 14,31,32. This fact could be observed in the 
groupings of municipalities in Sergipe that presented spatial autocorrelations of the 
"high-high" type. This is because in these agglomerations there is intense livestock 
activity, with an appreciation of male gender roles, in which the courage, strength and 
virility of men are considered essential to work with cattle, usually extending to gender 
relations and daily life. Similar conditions were found in other regions of Brazil that 
also have this economic matrix and still maintain strong traditional patriarchal values 
and the submission of women to men 33. 
In multiple spatial regression, the Municipal Human Development Index 
(MHDI) was directly associated with the rates of femicide. This fact makes evident the 
contradiction between the increase in femicide in places with higher human 
development rates 30,34. Contrasting results of other studies, which describe an inverse 
relationship between the occurrence of feminicide with economic development and the 
quality of life of the population, respectively 35.  
The income concentration, estimated from the GINI index, showed an 
inverse association with the femicide rates in the final spatial model. Suggesting that in 
the places with the lowest social inequality are found the highest rates of femicide.  This 
result is contradicting the findings of Leite et.al. (2017) 35 that they reported the 
presence of a direct relationship between social inequality and the rates of femicide. On

the other hand, in this same study, it is reported in a peculiar some regionals exceptions 
about the trends of social inequity found as in Espírito Santo State, which it presented 
better inequality and high indicators of the female mortality rates due to aggression 
compared to others Brazilian States analyzed 35. Being extremely important to highlight 
in this moment that although lost socioeconomic issues linked to femicide, the factors 
that permeate violence in general go beyond poverty and social inequality. This is 
reinforcing the multifactorial nature of violence against women, resulting from the 
interaction of individual, relational, social, cultural and environmental  factors 35,36. 
The matriarchy was positively associated with the rates of femicide in 
Sergipe's municipalities in the period studied. Suggesting that the change in traditional 
gender roles is a potential generator of conflicts for challenging the patriarchal thinking 
of society 2,3. Thus, the achievement of women's socioeconomic autonomy in patriarchal 
societies is able to tension traditional gender patterns, increasing the risk of feminicide 
37,38. 
In this context, it is clear that despite the socioeconomic condition being 
closely related to feminicide, this phenomenon has multifactorial characteristics that 
result from the interaction between individual, relational, social, cultural and 
environmental conditions 1. Feminicide has its roots in gender inequality, presenting 
diverse contexts that obey distinct social dynamics and peculiar to the geographic 
context of origin. 
This is the first study that analyzed the factors associated with spatial clusters 
of femicide in a geographic space where there is a predominance of patriarchal culture. 
Although public policies to combat femicide have already completed more than a 
decade in Brazil, this study shows a very uneven distribution of rates of femicide that 
showed a direct association with human development and matriarchy, and an inverse

association with concentration of income. These findings reinforce the fact that of 
violence against women as a multifactorial phenomenon, resulting from the interaction 
of individual, relational, social, cultural, and environmental factors. Making it 
imperative to carry out further studies to unravel the possible factors that predispose as 
high rates of femicides in in the municipalities of the State of Sergipe. It is suggested
