Abstract 19 Herein, we describe the detection of a SARS-CoV-2 genome through metatranscriptome next- 20 generation sequencing directly from the nasopharyngeal swab of a suspected case of local 21 transmission of Covid-19, in Brazil. Depletion of human ribosomal RNA and use of an optimized 22 in-house developed bioinformatics strategy contributed to successful detection of the virus. 23
24 Main text 25 COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was firstly 26 recognized as an atypical pneumonia in China, in December 2019. By early-April 2020, the 27 disease had already spread globally to more than 150 countries, with over 1,000,000 confirmed 28 cases according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (1). The first confirmed imported case 29 in South America was in February 26, 2020, from a traveler returning from Northern Italy to the 30 city of São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil (2). Soon after, first suspected cases of local 31 transmission within the country were reported, including in the Bahia state, in early March 2020. 32 Ascertaining the roles of different diagnostic technologies during an ongoing epidemic of 33 viral infection is challenging, and recent studies have already reported sensitivity issues when 34 using real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) for diagnosing COVID-19 (3,4). Possible 35 interfering factors in RT-qPCR may arise from high viral recombination of coronaviruses (5) and 36 varying viral loads in the natural course of disease (6), but this still needs further studies in the 37 COVID-19 diagnostics context (7). Therefore, developing new protocols for untargeted clinical 38 metagenomics may provide valuable diagnostic tools for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and other 39 pathogens in a current global scenario of emerging viral infections. Other studies have recently 40 reported on metagenome-based strategies for next-generation sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and 41 varying results were reached, when comparing amplicon-based sequencing or direct 42 3
metatranscriptome sequencing. Also, metagenome sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage 43 specimens rendered better results when compared to nasal swabs (5,8). 44 In this study, we successfully detected a SARS-CoV-2 genome directly from a 45 nasopharyngeal swab specimen of a suspected case of local transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil, 46 using a metatranscriptomics approach. On March 03, 2020, a female patient presented to a public 47 hospital, in Feira de Santana-Bahia, Brazil, complaining of sore-throat and mild-dyspnea. Due to 48 self-reported close contact with a returning traveler from Italy who had a confirmed COVID-19 49 diagnosis, specific diagnostic investigation was warranted, and a nasopharyngeal swab sample 50 was immediately collected. Viral RNA extraction and RT-qPCR amplification were carried out 51 following a protocol validated in our group at the Institute of Health Sciences, Federal University 52 of Bahia, Salvador-BA, Brazil, according to a Promega application report (Promega Application 53 Report, 2020; https://www.promega.com.br/applications/virus-detection-assay-coronavirus- 54 detection-covid-19-sars-cov-2/). In brief, 200 µL of samples stored in transport medium 55 (Leibovitz`s L15) were submitted in triplicate to RNA extraction in the Maxwell 16 instrument, 56 following the Maxwell® 16 Viral Total Nucleic Acid System protocol (Promega). Detection of 57 SARS-CoV-2 viral genome by RT-qPCR was done according to the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus 58 protocol (9), using the GoTaq® Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR System (Promega) and primers/ probe 59 targeting the nucleocapsid (N) encoding region. A moderately high viral load was detected in the 60 nasopharyngeal swab sample, with a cycle threshold (Ct) of 21, which is similar to the highest 61 values reported for the first days since symptoms onset in eighteen Chinese patients (6). 62 In parallel, the extracted RNA (ca. 14 ng/µL) was submitted to metatranscriptome next- 63 generation sequencing in the Ion S5 platform (ThermoFisher) using an Ion 540™ chip and the 64 Ion Total RNA-Seq kit v2, as per the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher). One sample was 65 previously processed with the Low Input RiboMinus™ Eukaryote System v2 (ThermoFisher), for 66 depletion of human ribosomal RNA from total RNA (Fig. 1). Sequence reads were pre-processed 67 4
by quality filtering (Phred >20), presence of ambiguous bases (>1% sequence with Ns), and size 68 (reads >= 30 nt); all reads deriving from human transcripts were also discarded: 77.29% in the 69 rRNA depleted library and 84.49% in the whole RNA library. The remaining sequence reads (size 70 range: 30 - 358 nt) were then used for contig assembly (see detailed pipeline in Fig. 1). 71 Sequencing data is available at NCBI’s SRA database under accession number PRJNA613951. 72 Overall, depletion of human rRNA rendered significantly higher numbers of contigs (n = 73 51; N50 = 180 nt) confidentially aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome (Figure 1b), yielding a 74 genome coverage of 29.9% for contigs and 59.9% for total reads, which is higher than the 75 coverage reported for nasopharyngeal swabs in recent studies (8). SNP analysis using Atlas 2 76 (https://sourceforge.net/p/atlas2/wiki/Atlas-SNP/) indicated that mutations accumulate mainly in 4 77 ORFs (ORF1a, M, ORF8 and N) in addition to 3’UTR, in a similar profile observed for strains 78 derived from Brazilian patients present in NexStrain platform (https://nextstrain.org/). 79 Our results confirm that direct metatranscritptome sequencing from nasopharyngeal 80 swabs can be used as an additional strategy in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, besides 81 providing information on possible nucleotide mutations that could interfere with sensitivity of 82 diagnostics based on RT-qPCR (4). Noteworthy, handling of the sample and preparation of the 83 sequencing library, particularly regarding depletion of ribosomal RNA, may significantly impact 84 metatranscriptomic results. 85 References 86 1.

Identification of SARS-Cov-2 through nasopharyngeal swab metatranscriptomics. 117 A) Left panel: extraction of RNA from nasopharyngeal swab was performed according to a 118 protocol validated in our laboratory (COVID-19 Extraction and Amplification with Maxwell® 16 119 Viral Total Nucleic Acid and GoTaq® Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR; Application Report, Promega 120 6
2020). Total RNA sequencing after rRNA depletion followed the protocol of the Ion Total RNA- 121 Seq kit v2, in the Ion S5 platform. Depletion of human ribosomal RNA was done with the Low 122 Input RiboMinus™ Eukaryote System v2 kit. Right panel: raw reads were submitted to quality filter 123 where reads larger than 30nt with Phred quality > 20 were aligned into human reference genome. 124 Unaligned reads were used to perform contig assemblage. Assembled contigs were compared to 125 NCBI databases using Blast software. Contigs that presented sequence similarity to SARS-Cov2- 126 2 with e-value lower than 1e-5 were considered as from viral origin. Viral contigs were further 127 submitted to contig extension using SPAdes and ‘trusted contigs’ option that was followed by 128 cap3 tool to remove sequence redundancy. B) SARS-Cov-2 coverage profile of reads and 129 assembled contigs. Reads were normalized by number of reads from each library. Contigs in red 130 indicate high quality contigs larger than 400nt with coverage of reads in both libraries. 131 7
