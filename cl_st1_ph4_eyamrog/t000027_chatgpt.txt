The mining sector produces a significant amount of stone waste and tailings, posing environmental hazards. The predominant disposal method, dumping, leads to soil degradation, water pollution, and the loss of valuable land. However, these industrial byproducts can be repurposed through various techniques, with geopolymerization showing promise in converting waste into a valuable resource. This research delves into the current advancements in creating geopolymer composites from mine tailings, aiming to establish them as sustainable construction materials. The study provides a detailed analysis of the properties and behaviors of these composites, encompassing their physical and mechanical characteristics. Furthermore, it highlights the existing knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to propel the use of mine tailings composites in geopolymer production.
Mine tailings accumulate in tailings ponds and mine waste landfills, presenting a pressing challenge in terms of sustainable waste disposal [1, 2]. This issue is exacerbated by the escalating production volumes within the metallurgical and mining sectors, coupled with the absence of viable disposal methods for the waste generated by these industries. Furthermore, the tightening ecological regulations in numerous affluent nations worldwide contribute to the urgency of this matter. The accumulation of mine tailings leads to the active release of lead, mercury, radioactive materials, and other hazardous substances into the environment, contaminating biota, soils, air, and water, ultimately posing a significant risk of cancer in humans. Additionally, pollutants stemming from food processing and feed waste can detrimentally impact valuable farmlands and natural ecosystems. The operation of tailing dams further heightens the potential for man-made disasters to occur [3, 4].
From the perspective of rational natural resource management, mine tailings should be regarded as a mineral resource that has been extracted from the earth's subsurface, transported, and underutilized. These tailings may contain trace amounts of target materials and previously unclaimed elements that could be recovered through more efficient mining techniques, as supported by existing literature [5-10]. The chemical composition of mine tailings typically consists of silicon, aluminum, and calcium oxides, making up around 60 to 90% of their content [11]. Consequently, these tailings hold promise as an alternative source to fulfill a variety of construction and industrial needs [12-14].
A prospective trend in mine tailings utilization involves their use as geopolymers and precursors of alkali-activated materials or aggregates. Geopolymers, predominantly consisting of amorphous sodium aluminum-silicate hydrate, are solid materials formed through the interaction of an aluminosilicate powder and an alkali solution. As described by van Deventer et al., the geopolymer network comprises AlO4 and SiO4 tetrahedra connected by oxygen atoms, with positively charged ions (e.g., Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Li+) balancing the negative charge within the framework. Utilizing mine tailings in a geopolymer approach could potentially mitigate the accumulation of mine tailings, reduce ecological contamination, and harness the advantages of geopolymer technology, including decreased carbon dioxide emissions, the ability to utilize other forms of aluminosilicate waste, and the versatile characteristics of geopolymers for general-purpose construction adhesion. Recent research efforts have focused on enhancing our understanding of geopolymerization processes in mine tailings, with numerous publications detailing applications such as pollutant removal, sustainable building practices, and other specific uses, reflecting a growing interest among specialists in tailings management.
The mine tailings exhibit an inhomogeneous nature, characterized by a complex mineral, aggregate, and chemical composition [11]. Despite containing relatively low quantities of valuable components, these tailings are laden with hazardous and toxic compounds associated with waste products or mining operations [42-46]. These factors collectively pose challenges in directly managing mine tailings to produce geopolymers that adhere to ecological safety standards concerning impurity levels, while also meeting the intricate functional requirements of the final product [47, 48].
Addressing the challenges associated with the utilization of mine tailings-geopolymer composites holds significant value, not only in terms of mitigating environmental repercussions but also in expanding the pool of available mineral resources. This review delves into the physicochemical and ecological concerns intertwined with the application of mine tailings-geopolymer composites, offering a comprehensive examination of their structural, mechanical, and thermal properties, as well as their durability and other pertinent attributes. Furthermore, it explores the promising applications of these composites, shedding light on their potential benefits beyond their intrinsic characteristics.
The workability of tailing-based composite concrete refers to the ease of handling the material during transportation, compaction, placement, and finishing of the concrete product [2-4, 12, 49]. A composite material is considered workable if it can be easily transported, placed, compacted, and finished without any segregation issues. Studies have indicated that the flow of mortar decreases as tailing substitution levels increase, attributed to the finer particle size distribution of tailings leading to a higher total specific surface area of the fine aggregates [50, 51]. This phenomenon also affects concrete, with slump formation decreasing as tailings are substituted for fine aggregate, potentially due to the surface texture and particle size of tailings necessitating more water, consequently reducing workability [51, 52]. The loss of workability in geopolymer composite binders is influenced by the volume fraction in the mixtures and the aspect ratio of fibers [53]. Savastano Jr, et al. [54] reported a decrease in the workability of cement composites when eucalyptus pulp, coir, or a combination of eucalyptus pulp and sisal fibers were present [13-17].
The workability of alkali-activated tailing paste is influenced by various factors, including calcination temperature and the water-to-tailings ratio. According to Savastano Jr, et al. [54], achieving adequate workability at a calcination temperature of 800 ºC necessitates a water to waste clay ratio with a boron content of 0.40. Conversely, for lower calcination temperatures of 700 ºC, 600 ºC, and 500 ºC, the required water to waste clay ratios with boron content are 0.51, 0.65, and 0.65, respectively, to achieve satisfactory workability values. Factors such as the particle shape of clay minerals, which can lead to a high water demand due to water penetration into the interlayers of the clay, do not significantly impact workability [55-58].
The durability of concrete near an exposed surface is primarily influenced by the penetration of harmful agents. Sorptivity, which is dependent on the porosity, permeability of the concrete, and capillary strength, plays a crucial role in this regard. To enhance the durability of geopolymer, it is imperative to minimize the sorptivity of harmful agents. Geopolymer pastes generally display lower porosity and water absorption capabilities compared to Portland cement paste. Steam-curing often impacts factors such as the even distribution of hydration products and the porosity of Portland cement paste.
Aydın and Kızıltepe (63) found that the sorptivity and water absorption capacity of activated waste clay containing boron mortars decreased as the SiO2/Na2O values increased, with Na2O-containing mortar mixtures showing lower water absorption values and sorptivity compared to the control mortar (55-59). The Ms and Na2O content of the activating solution significantly influence water sorptivity more than the total absorption capacity, aligning with the findings of Bernal et al. (64).
Falah, et al. [65] found that water absorption could be minimized by increasing the sodium silicate content, consequently boosting compressive strength. Among all samples, submicron alkali-activated mine tailings with a 30 wt% sodium silicate composition, cured for 28 days, displayed the least water absorption, resulting in a peak compressive strength of approximately 27.31 MPa due to accelerated reaction rates. The researchers noted that water absorption rose from 10% to 17% due to changes in pore structure influenced by curing conditions. Furthermore, the water absorption capacity decreased with higher Na2SiO3 concentrations, indicating reduced porosity and a denser structure [66]. The decline in water absorption due to increased Na2SiO3 concentration marginally improved compressive strength. The lowest water absorption was observed in samples cured for 28 days at 40 ºC and 60 ºC, treated with 30 wt% Na2SiO3, showing 12.62% and 9.98% water absorption, respectively, signifying a more extensive reaction and yielding the highest compressive strength of 15.84 and 22 MPa. Additionally, Falah, et al. [67], noted that water absorption increased from 10% to 14% when submicron mine tailings were utilized, with the quantity of submicron mine tailings and Na2SiO3 leading to decreased water absorption due to the dense structure hindering water permeation [68] [69, 70].
Irrespective of the source of tailings or their mineralogy/composition, grinding time emerges as a crucial parameter that significantly impacts water absorption capacity [71]. Studies have indicated a notable decrease in the adsorption capacity of alkali-activated silicate tailings with prolonged grinding time. For instance, alkali-activated silicate rich in epidote, characterized by high aluminum content, and silicate rich in tremolite, with elevated magnesium levels, displayed approximately 20% and 35% water absorption, respectively, after one minute of grinding. However, with an increase in grinding time to 16 minutes, the adsorption capacity of these samples decreased by approximately two-fold. This decline can be attributed to substantial alterations in the microstructure of alkali-activated tailings as the grinding time was extended [72-76].
Mine tailings, a waste material consisting of finely distributed silica, can be considered as aggregates of geopolymer and alkali-activated materials due to their significant silica content. The recycling of mine tailings, coupled with the reduction of environmental impact caused by mine waste, aims to decrease the expenses associated with geopolymer concrete production while simultaneously preserving natural mineral resources [60-62, 72-75].
Barrie, et al. [77] employed gold mining tailings as fine aggregates to replace cement sand in a geopolymer composed of volcanic and halloysite glass. Their study revealed that introducing 12.7% mine tailings into the geopolymer did not affect its mechanical properties. Following the geopolymerization process, the produced specimens exhibited effective immobilization of Zn and Pb, although Cu showed higher mobility due to the elevated pH level in the water.
A geopolymer mortar composed of metakaolin and quartz was developed by replacing natural quartz material with iron mine tailings. Previous experiments showed that the addition of mine tailings did not significantly affect the mechanical properties of the geopolymers. However, specimens containing mine tailings exhibited higher porosity and water absorption compared to reference specimens with quartz aggregate, potentially compromising the material's durability. Sharath et al. (78) conducted a similar study using gold mining tailings as fine aggregates in a geopolymer based on volcanic and halloysite glass, finding that incorporating 12.7% mine tailings had no impact on the material's mechanical characteristics. The geopolymerization process resulted in specimens effectively immobilizing Zn and Pb, but Cu showed higher mobility due to elevated water pH levels. Paiva et al. (79) utilized high-sulfidic mine tailings as fine aggregates in metakaolin-based geopolymer composites and blast furnace slag-based geopolymer composites, observing that metakaolin-based geopolymers exhibited higher compressive strength (>20 MPa) and faster reactivity compared to BFS-based geopolymers. Moreover, compositions with a high concentration of mine tailings (50 to 62 weight% of precursor) displayed significant chemical resistance when subjected to harsh conditions (pH 4 and 7 for 40 days). Table 1 summarizes the effects of using tailings as aggregates in geopolymer mixes (83, 84).
The minerals comprising mine tailings exhibit various chemical properties, notably their interaction with alkalis. The aluminosilicate framework of geopolymer is shaped by how the precursor minerals interact within an alkali-activated solution, alongside the inherent structure and characteristics of the geopolymer. Typically, the alkaline reactivity of mine tailings is minimal, a crucial aspect to bear in mind when integrating them into geopolymers [88-90].
Mine tailings exhibit a high silica content, as evidenced in Table 2, leading to an increased molar proportion of SiO2/Al2O3 in mine tailings-geopolymer composites, thereby adversely affecting the geopolymerization process. Consequently, metakaolin emerges as a commonly employed supplementary source of Al within the chemical industry due to its composition's uniformity, purity, and high reactivity. Studies by Falayi [98] suggest that fly ash and blast furnace slag (BFS) are utilized to a slightly lesser extent compared to other materials. Additionally, volcanic glass, waste glass, aluminum oxide, aluminum sludge, calcined halloysite, and low-calcium slag have been reported as alternative materials for geopolymer production [25, 99]. Figure 1 illustrates potential sources of geopolymer precursors that can be combined with mine tailings to create mine tailings-geopolymer composites.
The strength and deformation characteristics of mine tailings-geopolymer composites are influenced by various parameters, including the Si/Al proportion, particle size, type of alkali-activated, alkali-activated/binder ratio, and curing technique. It is crucial to highlight that the improved interaction of mine tailings in geopolymerization significantly impacts the mechanical properties of geopolymers, a key consideration in utilizing mine tailings in geopolymerization. Due to the subpar interaction of mine tailings, additional pre-treatment processes become necessary. Pre-treating mine tailings has been shown to positively affect its interaction and eventual geopolymer due to the microstructural and mineralogical changes that occur during these processes. Mechanical activation is commonly achieved using various mills like planetary mills, roller mills, ball mills, jet mills, and agitation mills, among others. Mechanical activation can substantially alter both the chemical and physical properties of mine tailings, enhancing the concentration of aluminosilicate in alkaline solution, thereby promoting the geopolymerization reaction. In certain cases, thermal pre-treatment may be employed instead of mechanical activation, involving heating the raw material to a specific temperature to induce structural changes, with the effects dependent on factors like heating rate, holding temperature and duration, environment, and heating rate. Mineral transformations occur as a result of thermal pre-treatment, with instances where the elevated temperature surpasses the breakdown temperature of the minerals being treated. For example, Ye, et al. observed the removal of diaspore and kaolinite by calcining bauxite tailings at 800 ºC for 1 hour, enhancing the interaction of mine tailings during geopolymerization. Kiventerä, et al. noted a decrease in the dolomite peak in gold tailings after thermal treatment at nearly 600 °C, while basanite transformed into anhydride above 400 ºC, and the quartz content remained stable until 650 ºC before slightly decreasing.
Tables 2 and 3 highlight the multitude of factors that impact the mechanical properties, compressive strength, and flexural strength of various mine tailings utilized as a geopolymer source. These mine tailings are typically combined with other alumina-silicate source materials like fly ash, BFS, and metakaolin to create geopolymers. The data presented in these tables reveal significant variations in compressive and flexural strengths across different mine tailings-geopolymer composites. This disparity can be attributed to the diverse types of mine tailings, alumina-silicate resources, alkali-activated materials, alkali-activated/binder ratios, temperatures, and humidity levels employed during their production [113-120].
The curing temperature of mine tailings-geopolymer composites significantly influences the mechanical and microstructural properties of the polymers. Tian, et al. [121] investigated the effects of curing temperature on copper tailing-based geopolymers. An increase in curing temperature (22–80°C) promoted the homogeneous dissolution of aluminosilicate, facilitating the formation of N–A–S–H and C–S–H gels, ultimately enhancing compressive strength. Conversely, temperatures exceeding 80 ºC had a detrimental effect. Elevated curing temperatures (100-125 ºC) led to a reduction in the alkaline medium, hindering the dissolution of silica and alumina species [118-120, 122].
Several researchers have examined the compressive and flexural strengths of geopolymers produced from copper mine tailings as the primary material and activated with various alkali activators. Falah et al. (123) conducted a study revealing that augmenting the quantity of sodium silicate, along with extending the curing period and elevating the curing temperature, resulted in an enhancement of the compressive strength in copper mine tailings-geopolymer composites. These composites, activated using a sodium silicate solution, were subjected to baking in a moderate-temperature oven. Furthermore, they noted a similar improvement in flexural strength in copper mine tailings-geopolymer composites, mirroring the trends observed in compressive strength. Similarly, Ahmari and Zhang (124) and Manjarrez et al. (125) reported an increase in compressive strength with a rise in the molarity of sodium hydroxide in copper mine tailings-geopolymer composites activated by sodium hydroxide.
The compressive strength of a copper mine tailings-geopolymer composite activated by sodium hydroxide was found to increase with an increase in forming pressure during molding, as investigated by Ahmari and Zhang [126]. However, this improvement was observed only up to a water content of 12% initially, beyond which the compressive strength decreased with further increases in forming pressure, as depicted in Fig. 3. It was also noted that the compressive strength significantly decreased after immersion in water. Furthermore, Manjarrez and Zhang [127] demonstrated that reducing the moisture content below 14% led to enhanced compressive strength in copper mine tailings-geopolymer composites activated by sodium hydroxide. Moreover, an increase in curing temperature up to 90 ºC was shown to improve the compressive strength of a copper mine tailings-geopolymer composite activated by sulfur dioxide [126, 128, 129].
The addition of further alumina-silicate source materials has been shown to enhance the compressive strength of copper mine tailings-geopolymer composites [125]. Moreover, increasing copper slag concentrations, elevating sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide ratios up to 1.0, and raising the molarity of sodium hydroxide solutions up to ten molarity have all been linked to improvements in the compressive strength of copper mine tailings-copper slag blended geopolymer [130, 131].
Iron mine tailings-geopolymer composites are manufactured similarly to copper mine tailings-geopolymer composites, either with or without the addition of alumina-silicate source components. In a particular study, the compressive strength of an iron mine tailings-geopolymer composite activated by sodium silicate exhibited enhancement with increasing curing temperature up to 80 ºC and curing period up to 7 days. However, beyond this point, there was a subsequent decline in compressive strength [132-134].
The utilization of gold mine tailings in geopolymer construction, combined with various alkali-activated alumina-silicate components, has garnered significant attention in recent research. Falayi [135] successfully developed gold mine waste-geopolymer composites using potassium aluminate, potassium silicate, and potassium hydroxide activators. Their study revealed that the optimal compressive strength of these composites was achieved at a potassium silicate/potassium hydroxide ratio of 1.1. Furthermore, increasing the curing temperature from 65 to 100 ºC was found to enhance the compressive strength of geopolymer composites activated by potassium aluminate and potassium hydroxide [122, 133, 134]. Interestingly, it was observed that geopolymer activated by potassium aluminate and potassium hydroxide exhibited higher compressive strength compared to those activated by potassium silicate and potassium hydroxide, even at elevated curing temperatures of up to 100 ºC.
In a study conducted by Pardavé, et al. [136], it was observed that an extension in the curing duration led to a corresponding enhancement in the compressive strength of gold mine tailings and alumina/kaolin mixed geopolymer. Furthermore, research by Kiventerä, et al. [137] indicated that increasing the slag concentrations and molarities of sodium hydroxide solutions resulted in a notable improvement in the compressive strength of gold mine tailings-slag/metakaolin blended geopolymer, as illustrated in Figure 4 [137].
Solismaa, et al. [138] discovered that the inclusion of 25% metakaolin enhanced the compressive strength of mine tailings-geopolymer composites activated with sodium hydroxide. They observed a notable increase in compressive strength at a curing temperature of 65 ºC, whereas a significant decrease was noted at 85 ºC. Optimal quartz mine tailings quantity for compressive and flexural strengths of geopolymers has not been definitively established across various curing times. Quartz mine tailings with 30% or more quartz exhibit shrinkage upon drying, while geopolymers display reduced shrinkage and porosity when quartz content exceeds 30%. In contrast to other mine tailings-geopolymer composites, the compressive strength of zinc tailings and metakaolin-geopolymer composites improves with higher mine tailings content [139, 140]. Jiao, et al. [141] and Wei, et al. [142] conducted studies on vanadium mine tailings-geopolymer incorporating fly ash and metakaolin, respectively, as additional alumina-silicate raw materials alongside vanadium mine tailings [143].
Ye, et al. [144] noted an increase in compressive strength and flexural strength over time at low-curing temperatures in an undisclosed mine tailings-geopolymer composite with a percentage of slag in an unmentioned mine tailings-geopolymer composite. This suggests that the compressive and flexural strengths of concrete cured at lower temperatures are inferior to those cured at the standard temperature of 22 ºC. One potential explanation for the lower compressive and flexural strengths in these geopolymers could be attributed to the sluggish geopolymer reaction that occurs at such reduced temperatures.
The mechanical properties of mine tailings-geopolymer composites can be significantly improved through the addition of reinforcing fibers. In a study conducted by Haddaji et al. [145], it was found that incorporating synthetic fibers such as glass and polypropylene into a geopolymer matrix made from non-heated phosphate mine tailings resulted in enhanced energy absorption and ductile failure. This improvement was attributed to stress redistribution and the bridging impact of the fibers. The research indicated that the inclusion of 1% synthetic fibers led to the best mechanical properties. Specifically, the flexural strength of the composite matrix saw a remarkable increase of 277% with polypropylene fibers and 27% with glass fibers compared to the original mine tailings-geopolymer composite.
The critical annotations for this paper review are outlined below:
Based on the findings of the study cited, it is evident that dehydrated tailings are commonly employed in the production of geopolymers compared to other types of tailings. Dehydrated tailings are typically generated through dry tailing processes or by drying out the mine tailings paste or slurry followed by grinding.
When utilizing mine tailings-geopolymer composites, it is essential to not only assess their mineralogical, physical, and chemical properties but also to acknowledge the potential presence of various pollutants such as processing liquids, heavy metals, and other contaminants within their composition. Nevertheless, the movement of these pollutants due to leaching and other processes, as well as their impact on the characteristics of final products derived from mine tailings-geopolymer composites, have been relatively underexplored in scientific literature. Additionally, the presence of natural radionuclides in mine tailings exceeding radiological safety standards must be taken into account when incorporating mine tailings into geopolymers.
Several factors influence the performance of mine tailings-geopolymer composites, and it is crucial to consider the synergistic effects among them, such as mineralogy, purity, and elemental distribution, to maximize the benefits of utilizing mine tailings.
Mine tailings typically consist of a highly crystalline matrix, leading to limited interaction during geopolymerization and resulting in a final product with poor mechanical properties. To address this issue, incorporating additional elements with enhanced interaction into mine tailings-geopolymer composites can effectively adjust and improve the properties of the geopolymers. Moreover, since most of these additives are industrial by-products, their utilization also helps in reducing waste generation. In comparison to low-calcium additives, high-calcium elements have a more positive influence on the overall strength and durability of the geopolymer. This is attributed to the formation of additional CSH gels, which reinforce the matrix by co-existing with NASH and enhancing the matrix density.
Supplementary materials, particularly those rich in calcium, have been observed to enhance the geopolymer properties significantly.
The minerals present in mine tailings are distinguished by their diverse chemical reactivity towards alkali. The interactions of the metal components of these precursors under alkaline conditions significantly influence the structure and properties of the aluminosilicate framework of geopolymers. Often, the alkaline reactivity of mine tailings is notably minimal, which is advantageous when utilizing them in the production of geopolymers.
The following section outlines key recommendations for future research endeavors:
Enhancing the characteristics of geopolymers can be achieved by incorporating additional elements that promote increased interaction within mine tailings-geopolymer composites. Consequently, further research is advised to explore the potential benefits of this approach.
When utilizing mine tailings-geopolymer composites, it is essential to not only assess their mineralogical, physical, and chemical properties but also to acknowledge the potential presence of various pollutants such as processing liquids, heavy metals, and other contaminants within their composition. Nevertheless, the movement of these pollutants due to leaching and other processes, as well as their impact on the properties of final components derived from mine tailings-geopolymer composites, have been relatively underexplored in scientific literature. Additionally, the presence of natural radionuclides in mine tailings exceeding radiological safety standards must be taken into account when incorporating mine tailings into geopolymers.
