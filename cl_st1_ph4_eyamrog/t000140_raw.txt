Abstract
In the context of the significant court battles that are being fought over the potential copyright
infringement involved in distributing the articles and excerpts assigned to students in university
courses, this study analyzes 3,391 course syllabuses (2015-2020) from nine provinces and 34
universities across Canada. It identifies the types and proportions of required readings among
academic and non-academic sources. Academic readings are assigned on 26.6 percent of the
syllabuses, compared to 8.3 percent of syllabuses for media articles and trade book chapters.
Among the assigned readings, journal articles lead the list (with 54.3% of all readings),
compared to scholarly book chapters (33.5%), media articles (6.0%), and trade book chapters
(6.3%). The social sciences lead in the assignment of journal articles and the humanities in
trade book chapters, while science was least likely to have assigned readings of any type. The
study also found that textbooks are required on a majority of syllabuses (66.0%), with only minor
differences in this proportion across science, social sciences, and humanities. The data enable
a further analysis at the page level of what the average student is asked to read annually, which,
at the Access Copyright current tariff of $14.31 (approved by the Canadian Copyright Board),
amounts to a $0.021 per page. This rate is applied in a proposed new “three-step syllabus rule”
that avoids double-charging students for academic materials (90.1% of readings by pages),
while fairly compensating professional authors and their publishers (9.9%), with the data
analyzed here suggesting a $1.40 annual charge per student for their assigned readings.

What Should Students Pay for University Course Readings?
An Empirical, Economic, and Legal Analysis
While university textbooks represent a well-ordered publishing industry that structures
the instructional design of many post-secondary courses, many instructors, particularly in the
social sciences and the humanities have for decades opted instead to assign their students a
ragtag collection of articles, chapters, and excerpts, drawn from original scholarly and trade
sources. These collections form, as Ehren Helmut Pflugfelder colorfully puts it, “an object from
the underworld, from the abyss beneath the post-historical university” (2012, p. 249). As such,
they have been attracting copyright infringement suits since the proliferation of copy-shops in
the 1980s that made this teaching strategy a practical reality, most notably with the early Basic
Books v. Kinko's Graphics (1991) in the United States.
By the second decade of the twenty-first century, however, as surelock-bound paper
coursepacks continued to be sold to students, scholarly publishing had largely moved to
cloud-based online access through institutional licensing to university libraries, and with a small
but growing proportion of open access materials. This digital transformation of scholarly
publishing has only heightened distinctions between scholarly publishing – rooted in the
sponsored economy of academic life – and trade publishing as a commercial enterprise
(Willinsky, 2017). A prime example of this difference in historical terms is how scholarly authors
are paid by universities supported, in part, by student tuition, with their scholarly publishing
qualifying them for employment and advancement. In trade publishing, authors largely finance
themselves through publishing by the sale of their books and the placement of their work in
media outlets. What has happened in the digital era is that scholarly journals have gone online,
along with many scholarly books, with libraries purchasing institutional licenses to these works
that could serve a university’s entire community in a way that a single copy of a journal or a
book could not. In addition, a growing, if still small, proportion of journals and books are
published or made available through repositories on an open access basis. This has resulted in
close to a third of the research journal literature being made freely available by 2017, with a

much smaller but also growing segment of scholarly books following that trend (Piwowar et al.,
2018).1
These developments introduced a financial conflict into the distribution of course
readings. A 2013 study, conducted by one of the authors of this paper, for example, determined
that 45.1 percent of the readings purchased by students in 110 Stanford University and Queen’s
University course-packs had been freely available to them from their respective libraries and
through open access (Evans and Willinsky, 2013). In 2017, a study of 12 University of Toronto
course pointed to the “double-charging” of students as “55 percent of the assigned readings
were already licensed by the library and were fully available in electronic form” (Cancilla,
Glushko, Orfano & Slaght, 2017). The students are paying a royalty fee for course readings that
the library had already purchased a campus-wide license for with the student’s tuition fees. Our
study provides a further, large-scale update on this issue, involving 3,391 Canadian university
syllabuses from 34 institutions, demonstrating the extent of the double-charging, which may
apply to over 90 percent of the assigned readings. By distinguishing between academic and
trade publications, the study proposes a fair resolution for all parties through a “three-step
syllabus rule.” In this regard, the study also intends to inform current lawsuits in Canada and the
United States concerned with universities’ handling of course readings.
In 2013, Access Copyright sued York University for failing to pay the Copyright Board of
Canada approved tariff covering the millions of copies associated with York from 2011 to 2013.2
Access Copyright is a not-for-profit collective that represents 11,000 Canadian writers, visual
artists, and publishers. It strikes agreements with organizations, such as universities and
provincial ministries of education, to cover royalty payments for course materials. The Copyright
Board of Canada has approved an Interim Rate for an annual Access Copyright tariff of $14.31
per university student (ACT, 2019). Yet with much unsettled in applying fair dealing to education,
a quarter of Canada’s 96 universities are not paying Access Copyright’s tariff (Access Copyright,
2020a). In the face of the 2013 Access Copyright lawsuit, York claimed its employees followed
2 Michael Geist: “For many years, the universities effectively funded Access Copyright’s litigation and
Copyright Board costs, with the collective setting aside millions to pay for legal and lobbying fees”
(2014a). In the United States, a parallel case can be found in Cambridge University Press v. Patton which
also appears to be working its way through the courts. Cambridge, SAGE, and Oxford University Press
initially filed the suit against Georgia State University in 2008, holding that the library’s electronic reserves
of 6,700 course readings infringed their copyright, with the library offering a fair use defense of its
e-reserves program (Hafner, 2008). The court decisions have gone back and forth in this case, with the
latest ruling, sending it back to be heard again by the District Court for a third review in 2018.
1 This is to leave aside a ghost library such as Sci-Hub that has illegally assembled and offers freely up a
large proportion of this work (Bonhanon, 2018).

the university’s guidelines on the “fair dealing” exception in Canada’s Copyright Act. York’s
3
guidelines advise that “a single copy of a short excerpt from a copyright-protected work may be
provided or communicated to each student enrolled in a class or course” (“Fair Dealing,” 2012).
In 2017, the federal court ruled against York, holding that “the Interim Tariff is mandatory” and
“the York Fair Dealing Guidelines are not fair” for, among other reasons, its “material negative
impacts on the market” (CCLA, 2017, 13, 356, 353). In 2020, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled
that “the tariff is not mandatory,” as the Copyright Board of Canada tariff-setting process is only
intended to protect the public from excessive pricing (YU, 2020, 206). The appeal court also
upheld the earlier decision that “York’s Guidelines did not ensure that copying… was necessarily
fair dealing” (311). At this point, the Supreme Court of Canada has agreed to hear the case.
In 2019, when Canada’s Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology
issued its Statutory Review of the Copyright Act Report, it included a recommendation that in
part inspired this study, namely that the committee “resume its review of the implementation of
educational fair dealing in the Canadian educational sector within three years, based on new
and authoritative information as well as new legal developments” (Ruimy, 2019). This study
seeks to provide new and authoritative information on this area of educational fair dealing that
bear on past court rulings and might inform future ones, as well as the Copyright Act. It
examines how old and new distinctions between scholarly and trade publishing might
reasonably figure in calculating what is owed to whom as a result of student engagement with
both types of literature in their university courses.
Method
Sample
Using web-scraping strategies that attempted to target course syllabuses at Canadian
universities, we collected 5,898 documents from nine of Canada’s ten provinces (Table 1). Of
these, 3,916 proved to be unique syllabuses for the period 2015-2020. We eliminated 525 of the
syllabuses that referred to assigned readings but did not identify them (as they were to be found
in a coursepack or on a website). This left 3,391 syllabuses, of which 2,800 listed readings
and/or textbooks, and 591 of them having no required or assigned items, although these
courses sometimes listed optional and recommended materials for the students.
3 In 2012, Canada amended the Copyright Act so that copying for the purpose of “education” (as well as
research, private study, parody or satire, as well as criticism, review, and news) is “fair dealing” and as
such, “does not infringe copyright” (Copyright Act, 2020).

These syllabuses come from 34 of Canada’s 96 universities located in nine of Canada’s
ten provinces (minus Prince Edward Island). The distribution of syllabuses among institutions
ran from a high of 386 syllabuses (11.4% of total) collected from Western University to the two
(0.1%) collected from Kwantlen Polytechnic University, with a mean of 99.7 syllabuses per
university. Of the 3,391 syllabuses, 86.3 percent (2,926) are in English and 13.7 percent (465)
are in French. Courses in science accounted for 42.6 percent (1,443) of the syllabuses, the
social sciences 37.1 percent (1,258), and the humanities 20.3 percent (690). No distinction is
made between graduate and undergraduate course syllabuses as the Access Copyright tariff
applies to all university students. While we were unable to locate a reliable source of information
on how many courses are taught in Canada annually, if Canada’s roughly 1.3 million full-time
university students may be assumed to be taking 8.2 courses a year (see below fn 6) in classes
averaging 25 students across the country, then this sample of 3,391 syllabuses amounts to less
than 0.9 percent of the courses offered annually 2015-2020 (Postsecondary enrollments, 2018).

Categorizing the Readings
This study involved a manual counting of the “assigned” or “required” course readings on the
syllabuses (leaving aside “optional” or “supplementary” readings). A group of 17 undergraduate
students, a number of whom were competent in French, were trained to categorize the assigned
readings on the syllabuses (as distinct from textbooks and assigned whole books) into four
types of readings (see students’ training materials):
(a) Journal articles identified by the name of the publication and the inclusion of volume
and number in the syllabus bibliography entry for it.
(b) Academic book chapters identified by the academic nature of the book title, a list of
leading academic publishers, and any university press.
(c) Media articles identified by the non-academic publication’s title, if not already known
media outlet, with a screen-full used for the “page count.”
(d) Trade book chapters and book excerpts, which were identified by the non-academic
nature of the title and publisher, in contrast to the academic publishers.
In addition, students were asked to identify textbooks, for which training was also provided.
Textbooks that were assigned to students, as well as whole trade books generally, are not
considered as “assigned readings” for the purposes of this study, because students purchase
them separately, compensating the authors and publishers directly rather than through an
Access Copyright tariff as with readings.
Before proceeding, the students had to score 80 percent or better on a test set of
syllabuses, based on the lead researcher’s scoring of reading types. Once underway, students
were asked to cross-check a small sample (5-20) of each others’ scored syllabuses, with
discrepancies resolved by a third student (who had demonstrated relatively consistent scores in
cross-checking), with the lead researcher stepping in as needed. When other scoring
discrepancies were discovered, a few of the more proficient students were entrusted with
re-analysis. In addition, the students recorded page counts on a sample of readings that
provided page-number information (Table 2). The page counts were totaled and divided by the
number of readings sampled to come up with an average pages-per-reading for each reading
type.

Syllabus Analysis
Assigned Readings
A little more than a quarter of the syllabuses, at 27.2 percent (923), assigned readings to the
students as part of their coursework (Table 3a). Paying for the right to use these readings is
what is at issue in the court case introduced earlier. Among the four different types of readings
used in this analysis, the journal article forms the largest group. There were 7,961 articles
assigned on 707 syllabuses (20.8% of all syllabuses), with an average of 11.3 articles assigned
on syllabuses with research articles (Table 3b). This represents a commendable pedagogical
effort to engage students in the primary work of leading scholars in a fifth of the courses
sampled in our study. Scholarly book chapters (4,906) appeared on just about as many
syllabuses, at 702 (20.7%), as journal articles, though in smaller clusters, with 7.0 scholarly
book chapters on average appearing on the syllabuses with such chapters.

The non-academic readings were less prevalent. The 873 media pieces, for example,
appeared on 194 syllabuses (5.7% of all syllabuses) in clusters of 4.5 items on average, while
918 trade book chapters were found distributed across 148 (4.4%) the syllabuses in clusters of
6.2 chapters per syllabus with a trade book chapter. There is considerable mixing of reading
types as can be seen by comparing the number of syllabuses with readings (923) to the number
of syllabuses for each type, which suggest more than one reading type on the majority of the
syllabuses with readings.
In terms of the distribution of reading types across the three academic areas we
considered, syllabuses in the social sciences assigned the most journal articles (5,264) on more
syllabuses (457; 36.3%), followed by the humanities, with 1,656 journal articles assigned on 165
syllabuses (23.9%), with than science far behind with only 1,041 such readings assigned on 86

syllabuses (5.9%) (Table 4). The social sciences also assigned a greater number of scholarly
book chapters, as well as media articles than the other two areas, in relative and absolute
terms. On the other hand, the humanities syllabuses lead in trade-book chapters, with 570 on
64 syllabuses (9.3%).

discussion. Consideration might also be given to the pedagogical implications of the relative
rarity of assigning journal articles in science, in which students are not as frequently engaging
directly with recent research as in the social sciences and the humanities.
Textbooks
Although textbooks are not the focus of this analysis, it is still worth noting that the majority of
courses had an assigned textbook, amounting to 66.0 percent (2,238 syllabuses) of our sample
(Table 5). This is more than twice as many syllabuses as had assigned readings (923
syllabuses; 27.2%) (Table 3.a). The textbooks were assigned in relatively similar proportions
across the three subject areas, 69.3 percent of the science syllabuses requiring a textbook, and
60.0 percent of the social sciences syllabuses, and with 70.0 percent of the humanities
syllabuses. Given the frequency with which courses rely on textbooks, it is worth noting that the
steady price increases for textbooks over the last few decades have levelled off in the last few
years, some of this as a result of open textbook initiatives (e.g., Open Stax, Flatearth), which
represent another of the digital transformations specific to academic publishing (Fox, 2020;
Jhangiani, 2018).

(10.6 percent of all syllabuses) asking students to purchase a textbook while also listing at least
one type of required reading. Similar to a textbook, when a complete trade book (such as a
novel, play, or nonfiction work) was assigned on a syllabus to students, rather than chapters or
excerpts from such books, the book was not part of our calculations. This is because when
10

students purchase a trade book, the publishers and authors are compensated by that
transaction and need not figure in tariff calculations for assigned readings.
Calculating Costs
To arrive at a rough estimate of the costs involved for the course readings on this set of
syllabuses, the average page count for each reading type was calculated (Table 6). This
suggests that students were assigned 82.6 pages per syllabus on average for all of the
readings. With students taking an average of 8.2 courses a year, the 82.6 pages per syllabus
4
amounts to 677.6 pages of assigned readings a year. If one then takes the Access Copyright
5
annual tariff that was approved by the Copyright Board of Canada, at $14.31 per student, the
677.6 pages a year works out to a payment of $0.021 per page for the assigned readings
across all types.6

6 The Copyright Board’s rate is based, Ariel Katz has cautioned us, on very few data points (personal
correspondence, April 25, 2021). It works out to $0.021/page, compared to Access Copyright’s posted
rate of $0.15 per page for course materials (Educators FAQ, 2020). Also note that in this paper, we are
utilizing one decimal place throughout for making calculations (leading to $0.021/page), up to the point of
proposed tariff rate for students, at which point we shift to using standard financial notation of $1.40
5 An average load of 8.2 courses is based on the StatsCan calculation of the “average time to obtain an
undergraduate degree,” which is 4.49 years or  8.9 courses/year (Student pathways, 2019). With no
comparable figure for graduate students, their load was treated as half that of undergrads and, using the
ratio of undergraduate to graduate students, the average was 8.2 courses for Candian university students
in 2018/2019 (Postsecondary, 2020).
4 This averaging assumes equal class sizes, which can lead to overcounting readings, if large classes
favor textbooks over readings, which seems a reasonable assumption.

Note
a Weighted average used for “pages per item” for “all readings.”
A page rate of $0.021 can be neatly distributed among authors, publishers and Access
Copyright at $0.007 per page for each of the three parties. This $0.007 per page corresponds to
what authors receive for a typical paperback sale in a bookstore. It also matches Access
7
Copyright’s 35 percent charge for “administrative holdback” (Publisher Distribution Guidelines,
2020). It somewhat undercuts the publishers’ more typical 60/40 split with authors under Access
Copyright, although none of these calculations is above criticism (Geist, 2008).
Discussion
In determining a fair price to charge for the use of published materials assigned in Canadian
university courses, a number of considerations need to be taken into account. From our
perspective, the first of these is that the journal articles and scholarly book chapters – which
account for 90.1 percent of the pages assigned to students (Table 6) – form a distinctive
scholarly publishing economy that has operated at a remove from that of trade publishing for
centuries. We believe that distinctions between scholarly and trade publishing warrant an
alternative approach to the handling of university course readings that we wish to illustrate using
the data assembled here. This bears on the 2020 Federal Court of Appeal ruling on York v.
Access Copyright, which noted that “York did not justify [its claim to ‘fair dealing’] beyond
invoking education as an allowable purpose” (YU, 2020, 258). We want to provide a more
thorough justification for limiting and tailoring the claims of fair dealing for university course
readings based on the distinctions between the scholarly and trade publishing economies. We
recognize that this will call for an agreement over conventions and standards for the assignment
of reading types, based in part on distinguishing between academic and professional
authorship. To that end, we are proposing a “three-step syllabus rule” for dealing fairly with the
readings assigned to students in university courses. The technical aspects of the three

8 This rule is a syllabus-specific variation on the 3-step test in the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works, which is defined as the following: “It shall be a matter for legislation in the
countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of such works in certain special cases, provided that
such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably
prejudice the legitimate interests of the author” (1979, Article 9.2). The syllabus rule was first introduced
by Willinsky in a SLAW.ca column (2020).
7 The author rate of $0.007/page rate was ascertained by assembling the list prices and page counts for
ten current trade and mass paperbacks (fiction and nonfiction) in Canada, and applying the typical 10
percent royalty rate; see data files for this study (Burgess and De Rosa, 2017).

proposed steps are described in the appendix, with a summary here:
1.
Check library holdings and open access. A university’s syllabuses would be
analyzed by an artificial intelligence system to determine which assigned
readings are accessible to students through institutional licenses and open
access. The materials the university does not yet license would be treated as
acquisition recommendations. The continuing consideration given to acquiring
assigned academic resources valued by instructors leads to the second step.
The non-academic readings for which the university does not hold an institutional
license would go to the third step for processing.
2.
Limit fair dealing: The second step applies to the scholarly readings that are not
(yet) available to students through Step 1. For these materials, an innovative and
limited appeal is made to the fair dealing exception of the Copyright Act. What
9
makes this use of scholarly materials fair is that any “substantial adverse effect“
experienced by publishers is neutralized by the authors’ substantial reputational
benefits of having their work assigned in university classes. This highly desirable
“exploitation” for authors cumulatively leads to “financial” gains in career
development, outweighing any royalty payments, leading to further sales for the
publishers.
Even if, as is likely, authors have given up their copyright in the
10
work, the Copyright Act still recognizes their moral rights, which relate, in a highly
relevant way in this case, to the protection of their “honour or reputation” (28.2,
1).
This appeal to fair dealing, which only applies to the academic readings not
11
covered in the first step of this approach, is further strengthened by the final step.
11 “An assignment of copyright in a work does not by that act alone constitute a waiver of any moral rights”
(Copyright Act, 14.1(3)).
10 In 2013, the Canadian Association of University Teachers set aside concerns with royalties to join with
Canadian Federation of Students in objecting to the Access Copyright Post-Secondary Educational
Institution Tariff, 2014-2016 (CAUT, 2013).
9 Among the factors that help determine fair dealing is “the effect of the dealing on the work,” to cite the
influential 2004 Supreme Court judgement CCH v. Law Society on this matter, with that effect not leading
to “a substantial adverse effect, financial or otherwise, on the exploitation... of the existing work” to use
the language of the Copyright Act of Canada (29.21, 1.d): “The following factors help determine whether a
dealing is fair: the purpose of the dealing, the character of the dealing, the amount of the dealing, the
nature of the work, available alternatives to the dealing, and the effect of the dealing on the work.” CCH
Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada, 2004 SCC 13 (CanLII), [2004] 1 SCR 339.

3.
Deal fairly with professional writers: The third step applies to media articles and
trade book chapters (including poetry) that are not licensed by the institution.
These are largely the work of professional writers and their publishers, and to
whom, we hold, royalties should be paid. After all, university faculty assign these
works because they are essential to achieving their own and their institution’s
instructional goals. If academic authors benefit from the reputational gain, then
professional authors are not less deserving of recognition, rather than being
subject to a fair-dealing blanket exception for this million-student market in
Canada (with more on the financial and existential “substantial adverse effect”
below).
Following this three-step approach to paying royalties, we recommend that Access
Copyright’s approved tariff of $14.31 per student be applied on a prorated basis to cover only
the media articles and trade book chapters of professional writers (as per step #3 above). The
professional writings assigned to students amounts to 15.4 pages per syllabus on average
(Table 7). At the current Access Copyright rate of $0.021 per page, this works out to $0.171 a
syllabus for students’ use of professional writings in media pieces and trade book chapters. With
students carrying an average load of 8.2 courses a year, this $0.171 per syllabus amounts to an
annual charge of $1.40 per student, based on our sample of 3,391 syllabuses (2015 to 2020).

classes that is comparable to the rate that they earn from bookstores sales.

made for charging a higher fee to social sciences and humanities majors, whose courses assign
far more media pieces and trade book chapters than science courses, as well as for billing
students by the readings assigned in the courses they take. At this point, however, what is at
issue is a general tariff payable to Access Copyright among all students, for which $1.40 a
student appears warranted by our syllabus analysis, while avoiding the risk of double-charging
students for access to academic works. In total, Canada’s roughly 1.2 million full-time university
students or their institutions will be asked, under this scheme, to pay $1,769,888  annually to
Access Copyright for the readings assigned to them.13
If it seems that such amounts are de minimis in a legal sense, and thus not worth
pursuing, we side with the “many poets” in Eli MacLaren’s study of Canadian poet’s income
(which found royalty payments amounted to two percent of their income) who nonetheless
“described the validation that even a little money brings with it” (2017, p. 20). Our three-step
syllabus rule provides for validation of poets, as well as the recognition of academics.
While
14
there is room for this annual fee of $1.40 per student to grow over time, it stands in contrast to
the $26.00 per student that Access Copyright is currently requesting, as we write, from the
Canadian Copyright Board (Copyright Board, 2017).
Conclusion
This analysis of Canadian university syllabuses reveals the proportion of assigned readings that
fall into different publication types, with those from academic sources dominating the syllabuses.
While the analysis of the syllabuses does not, by any means, dictate the policy terms of a fair
and reasonable strategy for compensating the producers of the materials used in these courses,
the analysis does provide a means of assessing a policy’s outcomes, which is what we have
done here with our proposed three-step syllabus rule. The rule would eliminate the
double-charging of students for materials already available to them, in the first instance, while
recognizing the differences in economies between scholarly and trade publishing in the
university context. The preponderance of scholarly readings assigned in these courses adds
14 While MacLaren rightly holds that state sponsorship, such as the Canada Council, is key to “the
economics of poetry,” the validation signalling offered by the three-step syllabus rule’s royalty payments to
professional writers and their publishers should not undermine that poetic economy (2017, p. 10). Nor
should as large a share of the rule’s royalty payments end up going to the United States as has been the
case in other Access Copyright agreements (Geist, 2014b). This is because the proportion of Canadian
professional writers, including poets, can be expected to be much higher than when the research
literature is included in the agreement, very little of which is published in Canada.
13 This amount can be compared, for example, to $14.7 million distributed through the Public Lending
Right to close to 20,000 Canadian authors in 2019-2020. (Public Lending Right, 2020).

Appendix
How the Open Syllabus Project Makes the Proposed Three-Step Syllabus Rule Feasible
To determine the royalty costs for readings assigned in university courses under what we are
proposing as a “three-step syllabus rule” (3SSR), the institution would establish an account with
Open Syllabus (OS) and submit to OS the coming semester’s syllabuses.
OS uses artificial
15
intelligence and external databases to identify the works assigned to students on the institution’s
course syllabuses, including textbooks, monographs, and scholarly articles, as well as
non-traditional teaching materials such as newspaper and magazine pieces, blogs, television
programs, and YouTube videos. By following the three steps set out below, OS provides an
automated and increasingly accurate approach to avoiding double-charging students for items
already licensed, as well as for open access items, while providing faculty and administrators
with legal assurances in their use of materials, as well as a list of hyperlinks to appropriate
copies.
Step 1
(a) Instructors would make their syllabuses available to their institution’s OS account
through a URL, PDF, Word or Google document, or a course management system.
(b) OS would sort through assigned readings in syllabuses and...
(i)
Send academic publications (journal articles or scholarly publishers book
chapters) to Step 1(c);
(ii)
Send media items and trade book chapters to Step 3;
(iii)
Send problematic syllabus items back to instructors for clarification (which would
be used to update OS).
(c) For academic publications, OS would...
(i)
Check library’s catalogue for a digital edition with an institutional license;
(ii)
Check for an open access version through Unpaywall, DOAJ, DOAB, etc.
(d) OS would then…
(i)
Produce for instructors a list of links for items found in Step 1(c);
(ii)
Send to Step 2 those academic items that are not (yet) found in Step 1(b).
Step 2
(a) OS turns the academic items not found in Step 1(c) into a list of purchase
recommendations for the library (with frequency of appearance and repeated use).
(b) These items can be used under "fair dealing” in Canada (or "fair use" in the U.S.; see
preprint), the list can be monitored to establish that the library is acting in good faith.
15 The Open Syllabus Explorer has collected 355,032 syllabuses from Canadian colleges and universities
for the years 2013 to 2017, for which it reports the most popular readings but does not make the
underlying syllabuses available (Karaganis and McClure, 2016).

Step 3
(a) OS calculates royalty payments for media items and trade book chapters based on
approved rates.
(b) OS generates and submits invoices on behalf of collective management organization
whether at the level of (i) institution, (ii) division, or (iii) syllabus.
