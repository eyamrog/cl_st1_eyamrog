Palm seeds are renowned for their dormancy and thick endocarp, which can impede germination and embryo growth, but water treatments have been shown to hasten the germination process. Moreover, ex-situ conservation efforts can lead to a decline in seed viability over time. Despite this, there is a lack of data on seed dormancy and storage for many native palm species in Brazil. In this study, we examined the impact of water treatments and one-year storage on the germination of Copernicia alba Morong, a palm tree native to the Brazilian Pantanal wetland. Fresh and stored pyrenes were subjected to water immersion at room temperature for varying durations (24, 48, and 72 hours) and in hot water (~75°C for 5 and 10 minutes). While fresh pyrenes exhibited up to 84% germination in the control group, reaching 100% after 48 and 72 hours of water immersion, one-year storage led to a nearly 50% reduction in germination. However, water immersion did slightly enhance the germination of stored pyrenes. Conversely, hot water treatments decreased germination rates for both fresh and stored pyrenes. The seeds of C. alba demonstrate orthodox seed storage behavior. Overall, water treatments at room temperature were found to enhance pyrene germination, while long-term storage and hot-water treatments were shown to potentially hinder germination success.
Palm seeds often exhibit morphophysiological dormancy attributed to underdeveloped embryos (Baskin & Baskin, 2014) and a thick endocarp that hinders germination and embryo growth (Pérez, 2009; Ribeiro et al., 2011; Oliveira et al., 2013; Carvalho et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2015; Soares et al., 2021). Water treatments have been shown to expedite the germination process of palm seeds by enhancing oxygen absorption and alleviating mechanical constraints of the surrounding tissues (e.g., Bovi, 1990; Martin et al., 1996; Ferreira & Gentil, 2006; Fava & Albuquerque, 2011; Rubio Neto et al., 2012; Pinto et al., 2012; Goudel et al., 2013; Ferreira et al., 2021). Conversely, hot-water treatments (~75°C) have been experimented with for the germination of tropical palm seeds but may not effectively break dormancy (Martin et al., 1996; Rodrigues-Junior et al., 2016).
Research findings have consistently demonstrated that ex-situ conservation of palm seeds is linked to a decline in seed viability over time, as evidenced by various studies (Broschat 1994, Orozco-Segovia et al. 2003, Nascimento et al. 2010, Jacob & Decruse 2015, Oliveira et al. 2015, Felix et al. 2017, Beltrame et al. 2018, Bastos et al. 2021). The viability of tropical palm seeds during storage is influenced by a range of external factors such as temperature and duration, as well as intrinsic factors including seed moisture content, maturation, and desiccation sensitivity (recalcitrance) (Roberts 1973, Orozco-Segovia et al. 2003, Baskin & Baskin, 2014, Sano et al. 2015). Recalcitrant seeds, intolerant to water loss typically below a threshold of <12%, exhibit rapid deterioration in laboratory storage conditions (Hong & Ellis 1996) and display limited potential for forming soil seed banks (Oliveira et al. 2015). Conversely, orthodox seed storage behavior can be sustained ex situ over extended periods in appropriate environments (Hong & Ellis 1996). The longevity of stored palm seeds varies across species, with optimal ex-situ conservation conditions often involving reduced metabolic activity at relatively low levels of environmental humidity and temperatures (Pivetta et al. 2011). Recommended laboratory temperatures ranging from 18 to 23°C have been suggested for most palm seeds (Broschat 1994) and have been tested on select tropical species like the macaw palm (Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. Mart.) from the Cerrado savannas (Ribeiro et al. 2012) and Copernicia alba Morong from Brazilian wetlands (Masetto et al. 2012).
Understanding seed biology, encompassing dormancy, germination, and storage, is fundamental for enhancing seed conservation practices (Ellis et al., 2007; Hay & Probert, 2013; Costa et al., 2017) and supporting restoration initiatives (Merritt & Dixon, 2011; León-Lobos et al., 2012; Kildisheva et al., 2016; Vittis et al., 2020). To ensure the safe conservation of species' seeds, it is imperative to evaluate germination requirements and determine the seed storage behavior category to identify the optimal storage conditions and duration for successful preservation (Hong & Ellis, 1996; Teixido et al., 2017). Regrettably, there is a lack of data on seed dormancy, longevity, and storage behavior for numerous wild native species in Brazil (Ribeiro et al., 2016), with studies predominantly focusing on a limited number of palm species (Jagannathan, 2021).
Copernicia alba Morong, a palm tree belonging to the Arecaceae family, is indigenous to tropical and subtropical ecosystems in South America, specifically found in the Chacos of Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and the Pantanal in Brazil (Lorenzi et al., 2004). Commonly referred to as "carandá" or caranday palm, this species often forms monodominant populations in the Pantanal wetland, an area prone to periodic flooding followed by dry spells (Pott & Pott, 1994). These regions can experience flooding for up to eight months annually (Pott & Pott, 1994; Nunes-da-Cunha & Junk, 2011, Figure 1 a). In its natural habitat, C. alba displays early successional traits, can withstand fires, and its fruits serve as a food source for various wildlife species like macaws, parrots, and fish (Pott & Pott, 1994). The economic significance of C. alba lies in its durable wood and its utility in rural constructions such as corrals and fences (Lorenzi et al., 2004; Pivetta et al., 2011).
Previous studies have indicated that this palm species may exhibit dormancy, and treatments involving water immersion have been shown to enhance germination (Fava & Albuquerque, 2011; Masetto et al., 2012). However, knowledge regarding seed storage behavior remains limited (although see Masetto et al., 2012). Various species, including palm species that are prevalent in wetlands ecosystems, may employ fruit/seed dispersal and germination strategies that are linked to water pulses (Orozco-Segovia et al., 2003; Fabri, 2018; Pires et al., 2018; Bao et al., 2018; Oliveira et al., 2019; Elias & Vieira, 2020). Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the impact of pretreatment through water immersion (at temperatures of approximately 25 and 75°C) and one year of storage on the germination of C. alba seeds. The study aimed to address the following inquiries: i) do these seeds exhibit dormancy?; ii) what is the influence of water pretreatments on the germination of caranday pyrenes?; iii) how can the germination behavior be classified after one year of storage?; and iv) do water immersion pretreatments enhance or diminish the germination of stored seeds? Given that the thick endocarp may impede germination, it is anticipated that water immersion treatments will enhance germination. However, it is also expected that seed viability may decrease following the extended storage period.
Seed collection and processing - Fresh, mature, black fruits were harvested directly from 15 matrices of Copernicia alba Morong within a natural population along the Carandazal trail in the Miranda subregion of the Pantanal wetland, situated in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil (GPS coordinates 19º48’30.1’’S and 57º10’13.5’’W) in July 2011. The criterion for fruit harvesting was the black exocarp indicating maturation. Harvesting procedures involved cutting the outer branches and dislodging fresh fruit bunches with a tree pruner, allowing the fruits to fall freely onto plastic wrap placed on the ground. Subsequently, the fruits were transported to the Seed Laboratory at Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, for further experimentation. The exocarp and mesocarp of the fruits were manually removed through friction, and the pyrenes were carefully inspected for fungal infection and insect damage. All seeds were combined into a single lot. The mature fruit, characterized by a dry, fibrous drupe with an ovoid shape and black color, comprised an exocarp, a fibrous mesocarp, and a stony endocarp enclosing the seeds, known as pyrenes measuring 1-2 cm in length. Due to the presence of a rigid endocarp surrounding the seeds, the entire pyrenes were utilized as germination units in the study. The initial moisture content of the pyrenes was determined by fresh-weighing two samples of 15 pyrenes each, followed by re-weighing the samples after oven-drying at 105 ± 3°C for 24 hours, in accordance with Brazilian seed testing regulations (Brasil 2009). Following processing and initial moisture assessment, a subset of cleaned pyrenes was placed in a paper bag and stored in a dry cold room at 19°C (45 ± 5% relative humidity) for one year to assess viability through a germination test post-storage period.
Freshly harvested pyrenes were utilized to investigate the impact of soaking them in water as opposed to the control group (untreated/non-soaked pyrenes) in a laboratory setting. The pyrenes underwent various pretreatments, including immersion in water at room temperature (~25°C) for durations of 24h, 48h, and 72h, as well as in hot water at 75°C for 5 min and 10 min. To facilitate these treatments, plastic trays measuring 20 x 30 x 9 cm were employed to ensure the seeds remained submerged in water under constant fluorescent light for the specified durations, with daily water replenishment.
Following water immersion treatments (at room temperature and hot water), germination trials were conducted. Seeds were placed in rolls of germitest® paper that had been pre-moistened with distilled water at 2.5 times the weight of the dry paper (Brasil, 2009). All rolls of both pretreated and untreated pyrenes were stored in plastic bags to prevent water loss and were placed in an incubator set to a 12-hour photoperiod of fluorescent light (4 x 20 W) and alternating temperatures of 20-30°C, which were determined to be the optimal germination conditions for C. alba (Fava & Albuquerque, 2011). The rolls were rotated within the incubators four times per week. Germination checks were conducted daily for a period of up to 45 days, with the criterion for germination being the protrusion of the cotyledonary petiole by at least 2 mm (Janick & Paull, 2008; Baskin & Baskin, 2014).
After one year of storage, the viability of stored pyrenes was evaluated through a germination test to determine their seed storage behavior. Seed-bearing species are typically classified into three categories according to Roberts (1973) and Ellis et al. (1990): orthodox or desiccation-tolerant (seeds can be preserved ex-situ over the long term using standard genebank procedures); recalcitrant or desiccation intolerant (seeds can withstand short-term storage under specific, controlled conditions); and intermediate or partly desiccation-tolerant (seeds can be stored in the medium term).
Before conducting the experiments, two replicates of 15 stored pyrenes were utilized to determine the water content, as outlined in Brasil (2009) (refer to the seed collection and processing subsection). Subsequently, pretreatments involving soaking the pyrenes in water (refer to the Germination of pretreated pyrenes section) were administered to the stored pyrenes prior to conducting germination tests, in comparison to a control group consisting of untreated/non-soaked stored pyrenes, all within controlled laboratory conditions. Following these pretreatments, the stored pyrenes (both pretreated and untreated) were subjected to germination on rolls of germitest® paper, following the procedures detailed earlier.
At the conclusion of all germination trials, we evaluated the germination percentage (G%) and mean germination time (MGT) by tracking the daily germination of pyrenes, as outlined by Labouriau (1983) and Ranal & Santana (2006). Furthermore, we computed the germination speed index following the methodology proposed by Maguire (1962). Pyrenes that did not germinate were categorized as either dormant or dead; however, we did not conduct a tetrazolium test to determine the viability of these seeds. It is important to note that any seeds classified as dormant or dead were excluded from the dataset for analysis.
A completely randomized factorial experimental design was employed, incorporating two storage conditions (non-stored and stored pyrenes) and six pretreatments (control; approximately 25°C for 24h, 48h, and 72h; and immersion in hot water at 75°C for 5 and 10 minutes). Each treatment and control group consisted of four replicates, each containing 25 pyrenes, totaling 100 individual pyrenes per group.
Data analysis involved the evaluation of germination variables (G%, MGT, and speed index) through analysis of variance with permutations (10,000 iterations) using the lmPerm package (Wheeler & Torchiano, 2016) within the R statistical software (R Core Team, 2020). The models assessed variable values in relation to water immersion treatments (control, soaking in water for 24, 48, and 72 hours, hot water for 5 and 10 minutes), storage period (freshly harvested and stored pyrenes), and their interaction, as detailed in Supplementary material table S1. Subsequent Tukey HSD tests were conducted to address multiple comparisons across all treatment combinations.
Copernicia alba Morong seeds exhibited no signs of dormancy in the tested treatments, with freshly harvested pyrenes showing a high germination rate of 84% (Figure 2a). This aligns with findings by Masetto et al. (2012) who observed similar results for the same species collected in the Pantanal. In contrast to our study, Masetto et al. (2012) and Fava & Albuquerque (2011) reported seed dormancy in this species. It is suggested that genetic factors may influence seed germination by impacting seed viability and quality within the same species from different regions (Soler-Guilhen et al. 2020). The initial moisture content of the pyrenes was approximately 10%, consistent with findings of 10% (Fabri 2018) and 16.6% (Masetto et al. 2012) for the same species. Both studies collected fruits from natural Pantanal wetland populations in Mato Grosso do Sul State. The impermeable thick endocarp of C. alba did not hinder water penetration, allowing seeds to germinate. In contrast, seeds enclosed by a stony endocarp, as seen in Butia capitata Mart.Becc. (Soares et al. 2021), Syagrus romanzoffiana (Cham.) Glassman. (Oliveira et al. 2015) from the Brazilian Cerrado, and Bactris maraja Mart from the Amazon Forest (Rodrigues et al. 2014), may delay germination for months or years. The absence of seed dormancy in C. alba facilitates recruitment in Pantanal wetlands, where seeds/pyrenes can withstand flooding conditions, leading to rapid seedling emergence post-flooding (Bao et al. 2018). While many palm seeds may exhibit morphophysiological dormancy due to underdeveloped embryos or mechanical constraints from a thick endocarp (Pérez 2009, Baskin & Baskin 2014), pyrenes of our study species readily germinate under laboratory conditions.
The storage period had a detrimental effect on the germination performance of the study species, with the germination percentage of stored pyrenes decreasing to ≤50% (Figure 2b). Germination times ranged from 18 to 33 days in freshly harvested pyrenes, while stored pyrenes took around 18 days to germinate (Figure 2c, d). The speed index exhibited similar trends to the germination percentage (Figure 2e, f), serving as a valuable tool for assessing the rate of germinated seeds or emerged seedlings per day, and as a metric for seedling vigor (Maguire 1962, Ranal & Santana 2006). The initial water content of the stored pyrenes decreased to 7% after one year of storage. Despite the reduction in germination capacity over time, the study revealed that stored seeds of Copernicia alba Morong species from the Pantanal wetland remained relatively viable and germinable for at least one year. However, the findings underscored the limitations of relying solely on germination studies to assess viability. Viability tests such as tetrazolium and X-ray tests, commonly used in conservation programs (Terry et al. 2003, Gosling 2004, Riebkes et al. 2015), could have been employed to determine whether the non-germinated stored seeds remained viable or entered a secondary dormancy state (Schlindwein et al. 2019). Future research should incorporate these methods to evaluate viability and explore different storage conditions to enhance the germinability of the study species' seeds.
Regarding seed storage behavior, the seeds of C. alba Morong may be categorized as desiccation-tolerant (orthodox) due to their low water content, ranging from 10 to 7%, and the moderate germination percentages maintained after storage. According to Hong & Ellis (1996), seeds are considered orthodox if they can withstand desiccation with ≤12% moisture content and remain viable for 12 months of subsequent storage. However, it is suggested that further investigations into seed survival in various storage conditions, such as lower temperatures (-20°C), should be conducted to determine if the seeds exhibit intermediate rather than orthodox behavior. Recent studies have shown that certain tropical species within the Arecaceae family display desiccation tolerance post-storage. For instance, the seed of Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart. in Cerrado ecosystems has been identified as desiccation-tolerant and can be stored for over a year under low temperatures (10°C). The conservation of seeds ex-situ is a global concern, yet the longevity patterns of most tropical palm trees remain a subject of investigation. The natural habitats of the study species are prone to prolonged droughts during pluriannual dry spells in the Pantanal, such as those observed in 2020, highlighting the potential critical role of desiccation tolerance in sustaining the species through dry periods. Nonetheless, methods for low-temperature conservation and in vitro culture propagation of C. alba seeds remain unexplored.
Water treatments had a positive impact on germination overall. Freshly harvested pyrenes achieved 100% germination after being immersed in water for 48 and 72 hours (Figure 2a). Stored pyrenes showed a 32% germination rate after 24 hours of soaking, but this increased to approximately 50% after 48 and 72 hours (Figure 2b). The water treatments for 48 and 72 hours also reduced the mean germination time (MGT) of freshly harvested pyrenes to around 20 days compared to the control group's 25 days (Figure 2c), resulting in faster germination. In contrast, there was no significant change in the mean germination time of stored pyrenes across treatments (Figure 2d). Therefore, immersing pyrenes in water for two to three days enhances the germination of freshly harvested C. alba pyrenes, potentially accelerating germination and seedling growth for nursery production. The number of germinated seeds per day also increased with water immersion, as evidenced by the speed index after 48 and 72 hours, particularly for freshly harvested pyrenes (Figure 2e). Water immersion pretreatments have similarly been shown to boost the germination of Butia capitata (Mart.) Becc. pyrenes from the Cerrado and seeds of Copernicia prunifera (Mill.) H.E. Moore (carnauba) from the Brazilian Northeast region, both of which exhibit flood-tolerant seedlings. These species thrive in flooded environments, suggesting that enhancing germination ability through water immersion could improve their competitive performance following flooding events in their natural habitats.
Contrarily, hot water treatments had a detrimental impact on the germination process. The germination percentage (G%) of freshly harvested pyrenes of C. alba decreased to 62% and 50% after 5 and 10 minutes of exposure, respectively (Figure 2a, b). These treatments also led to a reduction in the germination percentage of stored pyrenes to 21% for 5 minutes and 16% for 10 minutes of exposure (Figure 2b). Furthermore, the 5-minute hot water treatment extended the mean germination time of freshly harvested pyrenes to 30 days (Figure 2c), with no discernible effect on MGT after storage (Figure 2d). Similarly, hot water treatments compromised the germination of Euterpe oleracea Mart. (Arecaceae) seeds from the Amazon rainforest as reported by Bovi & Cardoso in 1976. Heat shock, in the same vein, failed to break the seed dormancy of A. aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart. (macaw palm) but resulted in high seed deterioration rates according to Rodrigues-Junior et al. in 2016.
Further investigation into the tolerance of C. alba seeds/pyrenes to prolonged water immersion is necessary to determine if the increased germination rates are maintained over time. Rapid and robust germination following flooding events could play a crucial role in the species' ability to dominate its habitat, particularly in the Pantanal wetlands where most seeds are recruited towards the conclusion of the seasonal flooding period (Bao et al., 2018).
Our research sheds light on key considerations for studies involving water immersion to expedite seed/pyrene germination and the ex-situ conservation of a tropical palm species. The findings indicate that water imbibition of seeds enclosed by a thick endocarp was not impeded, thereby facilitating seed germination. Copernicia alba Morong seeds did not exhibit dormancy, showcasing a high germination capacity in the control group. Pyrenes stored for one year at 19°C under a relative humidity of 45% experienced a decrease in water content from 10% (initial) to 7%, resulting in a nearly 50% reduction in germination rates. Consequently, we propose that our study species be classified as orthodox. Immersion in water for 48 and 72 hours enhanced the germination rate and time of both freshly harvested and stored seeds; however, hot treatments diminished germination capacity and delayed germination time.
