This study aims to assess national variations in depression prevalence across different socio-demographic groups, health behaviors, and macro-regions of Brazil between 2013 and 2019. Data were sourced from two nationwide surveys, PNS 2013 and 2019, encompassing 60,202 and 88,531 participants aged 18 years and older, respectively. Depression levels were gauged using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and calculations were population-weighted. Analyses were adjusted for demographic shifts. Findings revealed a 36.7% surge in depression prevalence in Brazil over the six-year span, escalating from 7.9% in 2013 to 10.8% in 2019. Notably, the rise was more pronounced among young adults aged 18 to 24 who were unemployed, with a nearly three-fold absolute difference increase in depression prevalence (3.7 in 2013 to 10.3 in 2019), marking a surge of 178.4%. Urban residents experienced a greater uptick in depression prevalence (39.8%) compared to their rural counterparts (20.2%) during the same period. The prevalence of depression also rose between 2013 and 2019 for individuals engaging in poor health behaviors such as heavy drinking, smoking, and lack of physical activity, across both genders. Our results underscore a significant uptick in depression prevalence, particularly among younger unemployed men, potentially linked to the economic downturn experienced by the country during this period.
Depression stands as a significant global public health concern, as evidenced by data from the Global Burden of Disease Study highlighting it as one of the top three causes of years lived with disability (YLD), particularly affecting women. Despite this recognition, studies examining global trends in depression have yielded conflicting results. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that the worldwide number of individuals grappling with depression surpassed 300 million in 2015, marking an 18.4% surge from 2005. Conversely, a meta-analysis of 116 epidemiological studies revealed a consistent prevalence of major depression at 4.4% between 1990 and 2010, with a notable increase in psychological distress observed in 8 out of 11 GHQ studies. These findings underscore the variability in empirical evidence concerning mental health outcomes, specifically depression, where cultural disparities across nations and variations in depression definitions and assessments can skew disorder prevalence rates. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses focusing on temporal shifts in depression incidence and prevalence within the general populace have pointed towards a prevailing uptrend in depression prevalence over time, a phenomenon seemingly not solely attributable to study design discrepancies or publication biases.
There is now substantial evidence indicating that social, economic, and environmental disparities, such as rapid urbanization, significantly affect the quality of life, health behaviors, and access to healthcare services among populations, thereby influencing the prevalence of chronic diseases, including mental health disorders. Various studies have demonstrated the profound impact of financial crises on the mental well-being of communities. Globally, periods of severe economic downturns resulting in unemployment, financial hardships, and poverty have been linked to a surge in mental health disorders within the population, particularly escalating levels of depression and suicide rates. Notably, two meta-analyses have underscored that individuals facing unemployment are at a heightened risk for mental health issues compared to the general populace.
Throughout the initial decade of the 21st century, the Brazilian economy experienced significant growth, propelling the nation to the position of the sixth-largest economy globally. However, starting from 2013, Brazil has encountered a period of decline and economic recession marked by consecutive financial crises, escalating unemployment rates, precarious employment conditions, and a surge in poverty levels. Furthermore, young individuals have encountered substantial challenges in securing employment opportunities. These circumstances potentially contribute to a decline in the mental well-being of the Brazilian populace, leading to heightened rates of depression within the general population, particularly among the more vulnerable segments.
Data obtained from the 2013 National Health Survey, a population-based study conducted among Brazilian individuals aged 18 and above, revealed a prevalence rate of 4.1% for major depression, 7.9% for depression, and 21.0% for depressed mood as evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). These rates were notably higher among women, individuals aged between 40-59 years and those aged 70 years or older, individuals with lower educational attainment, and those residing in urban areas. Alarmingly, approximately 80% of individuals diagnosed with depression did not receive any form of treatment, with only 14% receiving treatment solely through medication.
The 2019 edition of the National Health Survey provides a unique opportunity to assess temporal shifts in various health issues within the Brazilian population. This study seeks to analyze alterations in the overall prevalence of depression and investigate potential variations across different socioeconomic and demographic groups, health behaviors, and macro-regions of the country between 2013 and 2019.
We utilized two cross-sectional population-based datasets obtained from the National Health Survey (PNS) conducted in Brazil in 2013 and 2019. The PNS is a household-based nationwide survey administered by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) during the specified years.
Both surveys are representative samples of the Brazilian population, providing estimates for urban and rural areas, the country's five macro-regions, Federative Units, state capitals, and metropolitan regions. The surveys employed a household-based approach with stratified sampling and a three-stage design. Initially, primary sampling units (PSUs) were randomly chosen from the master sample, which encompasses major surveys conducted by IBGE. Subsequently, households were randomly selected within each PSU, followed by the selection of an adult resident (18 years or older in the 2013 edition and 15 years or older in the 2019 edition) with equal probability among all adult residents in the household. Weighting factors were computed for each sampling unit, accounting for selection probabilities and non-response rates. For the chosen resident, the weight was determined by considering the household weight, resident selection probability, non-response adjustment by sex, and calibration for the total population by sex and age groups, estimated using the weight of all residents aged 18 and above.
The age group of the household residents selected for PNS 2019 has undergone a change, now encompassing individuals aged 15 years or older to ensure the provision of accurate data for monitoring the indicators outlined by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the indicators utilized in publications by IBGE and the Ministry of Health pertain to the population aged 18 years or older. Consequently, in alignment with this criterion and to facilitate comparisons between the two editions of the PNS, this study exclusively utilizes data concerning individuals aged 18 years or older.
In the Population and Housing Census of 2013, a comprehensive survey was conducted, encompassing 69,954 occupied households and 60,202 individuals who were interviewed, yielding a response rate of 86.1%. In the subsequent Population and Housing Census of 2019, out of a total of 108,525 households visited, interviews were successfully carried out in 94,114 households, resulting in a loss rate of 13.2%. The sample specifically targeted households with at least one resident aged 18 or older, ultimately reaching a total of 88,531 individuals for data collection and analysis.
The PNS 2013 and PNS 2019 surveys received approval from the National Commission of Ethics in Research (CONEP) of the National Health Council – CNS, under Regulation No. 328.159 in June 2013 and No. 3.529.376 in August 2019, respectively. In both instances, all participants provided their informed consent by signing an agreement. The evaluation of depression was carried out using standardized instruments and protocols.
Depression was evaluated in both editions of the PNS using the Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9, which assesses the frequency of depressive symptoms experienced in the two weeks leading up to data collection. This instrument had previously undergone validation in Brazil, demonstrating good validity in diagnosing major depression at cut-offs of > 9 and > 10. The severity of depression was characterized based on the PHQ-9 score, following the guidelines set forth by Kroenke et al., which categorize depression severity into none (1–4 points), mild (5–9), moderate (10–14), moderately severe (15–19), and severe (20–27 points). In this study, depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of 10 or higher, which is recognized as the optimal cutoff point for identifying clinically significant depressive symptoms.
In both surveys, socio-demographic variables were evaluated, encompassing sex (male and female); age groups (18-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70 years or older), race/skin color (white, black, and others: yellow, brown, and indigenous); educational attainment (uneducated or incomplete primary school; complete primary school or incomplete high school; complete high school or incomplete college/university; complete college/university); marital status (married or cohabiting with a partner vs. single); and employment status (working / not working). Geographical regions were delineated by macro-regions of residence (North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, and South), and distinctions between urban and rural living areas were made.
Health behaviors examined in this study included current tobacco use (yes, no), excessive alcohol consumption (defined as consuming 15 or more alcoholic drinks weekly for men and 8 or more for women, with a drink being equivalent to a can of beer, a glass of wine, or a shot of distilled liquor), and leisure physical activity. Physical activity was assessed by the frequency of exercise or sports participation in the past 3 months, with individuals engaging in any activity at least once a week classified as active. The data analysis...
The prevalence of depression was analyzed based on socio-demographic characteristics and geographical location. Estimates were calculated for both the PNS 2013 and PNS 2019, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals using the t distribution due to the substantial number of primary sampling units (PSU). The change in prevalence between the two surveys was represented as the relative difference in percentage between 2013 and 2019, determined through Gaussian generalized linear models. The prevalence in 2013 served as the baseline without the intercept, with coefficients and standard errors of the interaction term between the group variable and the survey indicator for the 2019 survey used to estimate absolute differences. These absolute differences were then utilized to calculate relative changes and their respective confidence intervals. The datasets from both surveys were combined and an indicator variable was generated to identify their respective survey iterations. Post-stratification was subsequently conducted to adjust the weights accordingly.
All statistical analyses were conducted by applying survey-specific weighting factors to adjust the study samples to reflect the demographic-geographic distribution of the Brazilian population. To determine the prevalence of depression based on the associated factors for each year, as well as to assess the variations between surveys and establish confidence intervals, we utilized R version 4.0.5 with the survey package version 4.0.
The demographic features of the PNS 2013 and PNS 2019 samples are presented in Table 1. Generally, the sample characteristics of both PNS 2013 and PNS 2019 exhibited minimal variation in relation to the included variables, with the exception of a noticeable shift towards an older age distribution and a rise in higher levels of education.
Table 2 illustrates the prevalence of depression based on socio-demographic characteristics and health behaviors within the general population in 2013 and 2019. The data reveals a notable 36.7% rise in depression prevalence from 2013 (7.9%) to 2019 (10.8%), with the most substantial increase observed among individuals aged 18-24, females, urban residents, and those residing in the Southeast region. A clear sex disparity in depression prevalence was evident, with women exhibiting higher rates in both time frames. The surge in prevalence among women from 2013 (10.7%) to 2019 (15.0%) surpassed that seen in men (4.7% vs. 6.1%). Notably, women consistently displayed significantly higher prevalence rates compared to men across all age groups and at both time points.
While the prevalence of depression increased across all age groups, the rise was particularly pronounced among younger individuals, notably those aged 18 to 24 years, where the prevalence nearly doubled from 5.6% in 2013 to 11.1% in 2019. This trend was mirrored in both women (8.3% to 15.6%) and men (2.9% to 6.6%) within this age bracket. In contrast, individuals aged 70 years or older saw a relatively stable prevalence rate across the entire population, with a marginal increase from 10.2% to 11.1%. Notably, this increase was observed among women but not among men in this age group.
Residents of urban areas in the country exhibited a notable increase of 39.8% in the prevalence of depression, rising from 8.1% in 2013 to 11.3% in 2019, surpassing the 20.2% relative increase observed in rural areas during the same period (from 6.4% to 7.7%). Analysis of the country's macro-regions revealed absolute differences in depression prevalence between 2013 and 2019 consistent with the national average of 2-3 percentage points (Table 2). Gender-stratified data indicated that among women, the prevalence of depression showed persistent differences of 4-5 percentage points across regions, with the exception of the Southern region where the increase was less than one percentage point (13.4% in 2013 to 14.3% in 2019). Notably, in 2013, the prevalence of depression among women in the Southern region exceeded that of the rest of the country and remained relatively stable over the six-year period (Table 3).
No significant variations were observed in the prevalence of depression between 2013 and 2019 across other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics within the categories under investigation. The changes noted generally reflected a difference of approximately 3 percentage points between the years 2013 and 2019 for the overall population. Specifically, there was an alteration of about 4-5 percentage points for women and 1.5 percentage points for men, as detailed in Tables 2 and 3.
In the group of men aged 18 to 24, there was a notable nearly three-fold absolute increase in the prevalence of depression among those who were not employed, with rates rising from 3.7% in 2013 to 10.3% in 2019. This marked a substantial 178.4% increase compared to their employed counterparts, whose rates stood at 2.6% and 4.9% respectively, reflecting a relative increase of 90.5% as illustrated in Table 4 and Figure 1.
In the general population, an increase in the prevalence of depression across all three categories is evident, correlating with a general prevalence increase of approximately three percentage points. Individuals who reported heavy drinking, lack of physical activity, and smoking exhibited higher rates of depression in both 2013 and 2019 compared to those without these health risk behaviors. The prevalence of depression among smokers rose from 10.8% in 2013 to 14.7% in 2019, indicating a relative difference of 35.9%. Notably, a relative increase of 40.5% was observed among individuals not engaging in physical activities at least once a week, surpassing differences noted in other health risk behavior categories.
When stratified by sex (Table 3), it was observed that among women who reported heavy drinking, there was a more pronounced variation in the prevalence of depression from 2013 to 2019 compared to those who did not report this drinking pattern during those years. Specifically, women who reported smoking in 2013 exhibited a higher prevalence of depression in both 2013 (17.7% among smokers vs. 9.9% among nonsmokers) and 2019 (23.1% among smokers and 14.1% among nonsmokers), indicating a relative increase of 30.4% among smokers over the six-year period. In contrast, among men, smoking was associated with a higher prevalence of depression in both 2013 and 2019, with a substantial relative increase of 41.9%, surpassing the general variation among men. In terms of physical activity, women who did not engage in physical activity in 2019 exhibited a higher prevalence of depression compared to those who did, consistent with the findings from 2013, showing a relative increase of 46.5%. Conversely, among men, those who did not participate in physical activity experienced a relative increase of 25.2% in the prevalence of depression from 2013 to 2019, moving from 5.9% to 7.3% (Table 3).
This study represents the inaugural attempt to juxtapose the prevalence of depression within the Brazilian populace across two discrete timeframes. The findings elucidate a notable escalation in depression rates from 2013 to 2019, surging from 7.9% to 10.8%, predominantly observed among women and the younger demographic. Notably, the shift in depression prevalence was not uniform across all age brackets, with a more pronounced uptick among individuals aged 18 to 24 years. This spike among the youth cohort was particularly pronounced in those not engaged in employment, particularly evident among young males.
The current findings diverge from the initial meta-analysis and the Global Burden of Disease Study, which reported no changes in depression prevalence over time. A study in Chile comparing major depression rates in 2003 and 2010 found no significant difference (20.5% vs. 18.4%). Conversely, research on the impact of financial crises and recessions on depression prevalence in various countries aligns with our results. In Spain, a study during the 2007 economic crisis revealed a substantial increase in mood disorders, major depression (19.4% rise), and dysthymia (10.8%). Greece saw major depression rates surge from 3.3% in 2008 to 8.2% in 2011 due to the 2008 economic crisis. A study in England from 1991 to 2010 showed a rise in common mental disorders post-2008 recession. Specific subgroups, particularly young men, faced heightened vulnerability to economic hardships, job loss, and disillusionment. Women, already at higher risk for depression, were also significantly impacted by economic downturns. However, none of these studies reported as substantial an increase in depression prevalence as our study. Our research revealed a 178% rise in depression among unemployed men aged 18 to 24 and an 89.8% increase in women of the same age and employment status, unprecedented in existing literature. Brazil's economic growth until 2014 was followed by a severe crisis, escalating unemployment and diminishing living standards, particularly affecting those entering the job market. Lacking effective social protection mechanisms, vulnerable groups likely bore the brunt of the economic downturn in Brazil.
The current study revealed that residents in urban areas of the country exhibited a higher prevalence of depression in both 2013 and 2019, with a more significant increase in depression prevalence over the six-year period (39.8%) compared to residents in rural areas (20.2%). This trend was consistent for both men and women. While no other study specifically examined the mental health trends in Brazil concerning urban versus rural living, prior research on the prevalence of common mental disorders and depression in urban and rural settings has yielded inconclusive results, with some studies indicating an association and others not. Studies from various countries support our findings, indicating that residing in densely populated urban regions is linked to a heightened risk of depression. Some studies exploring depression trends over time have noted a rise in depression prevalence in urban areas compared to rural regions, coinciding with rapid urbanization processes. Conversely, other studies have not observed such a trend. A recent study in Peru assessing depression prevalence trends between 2014 and 2018 found no significant differences in depression prevalence between urban and rural areas during that period.
The current study revealed an escalation in the prevalence of depression from 2013 to 2019 among individuals exhibiting the poorest categories of the three health behaviors scrutinized - heavy drinking, smoking, and physical inactivity - for both genders, mirroring trends observed in the general population. Notably, when segregated by gender, the disparities in depression prevalence were more pronounced among women engaging in excessive alcohol consumption compared to men with similar habits. The correlation between health risk behaviors and depressive symptoms is extensively documented in the literature, yet few studies have explored the impact of these behaviors on changes in depression prevalence over time. The findings align with a study based on the U.S. National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) from 1997 to 2016, indicating a stronger link between psychological distress and smoking and physical inactivity, while heavy alcohol consumption exhibited a weaker association. Another investigation in the U.S. population spanning 1991-2002 examined shifts in major depression prevalence and their connection to substance abuse, particularly alcohol. The study highlighted a consistent rise in depression prevalence linked to substance use disorders solely among black men aged 18-29. Furthermore, the current results are consistent with longitudinal studies demonstrating that women classified in a high-risk drinking category at baseline face an elevated risk of developing depression disorder at follow-up.
A notable strength of this study lies in its pioneering assessment of the prevalence trend of depression using data from two nationally representative surveys. This approach enabled the examination of changes in depression rates across various sociodemographic factors, regions of residence, and health behaviors. Furthermore, both surveys employed the standardized PHQ-9 questionnaire, a widely recognized tool in national and international research, to evaluate depression based on globally accepted criteria. This standardized assessment method not only enhances the reliability of the study's findings but also facilitates comparisons with results from other international studies.
Several limitations must be considered in this study. Firstly, the presence of depression was evaluated using the PHQ-9 with a cut-off of 10 to diagnose depression, with pooled estimates for this cut-off indicating a sensitivity of 0.77 and specificity of 0.85, suggesting the possibility of random misclassification. This could have potentially weakened the observed associations. Secondly, more severe cases of depression may have been underestimated due to selection bias (non-response), information bias, and the exclusion of institutionalized individuals in both surveys. A third limitation arises from the different code schemes used for identifying primary sample units (PSU) across surveys, potentially leading to overlapping of PSU in both samples and unaccounted variability. Consequently, the confidence intervals for differences in prevalence between 2013 and 2019 may be slightly underestimated, increasing the likelihood of a type I error. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting confidence limits close to the null hypothesis.
In conclusion, our study reveals a notable escalation in the incidence of depression over the six-year timeframe encompassing the two surveys. Particularly noteworthy is the observation that younger, unemployed men exhibited the most pronounced fluctuations in depression prevalence, prompting a deeper exploration rooted in existing literature and the prevailing socioeconomic landscape of the country during this period. This subgroup likely represents one of the most vulnerable demographics today, underscoring the imperative of addressing their mental health needs. Despite the typical trend of economic downturns resulting in diminished healthcare resources, it is crucial to uphold or even augment resources allocated to mental health services to facilitate swifter and more effective outcomes, benefiting both economic recuperation and the mental well-being of the populace.
