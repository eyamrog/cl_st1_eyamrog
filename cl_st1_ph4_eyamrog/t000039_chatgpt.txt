Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a process that involves the electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen, a clean and renewable energy source. The predominant commercial electrolyte utilized in PEMWE is the Nafion membrane, known for its high cost and challenging recyclability. By incorporating cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as a partial substitute for Nafion, composite membranes can be developed with enhanced electrical, mechanical, and biodegradability characteristics. This study aims to investigate the fabrication of nanocomposites (Nafion-CNC) to create high-performance electrolytes suitable for PEMWE applications. The impact of CNC addition to Nafion was assessed by producing Nafion membranes with two types of CNCs: one derived from enzymatic hydrolysis and the other from acid hydrolysis (commercially available). Both types of CNCs exhibited similar effects on Nafion's properties. The inclusion of both commercial and enzymatic CNCs resulted in an increase in the modulus of elasticity (10% and 40% respectively) and maximum stress (10% and 13% respectively) in the samples. Although the nanocomposites displayed lower initial thermal degradation temperatures, they maintained sufficient stability (Tonset > 170°C) for PEMWE applications, where the standard operating temperature is below 100°C. Additionally, there was a notable improvement in humidification capacity and conductivity. The composite membranes were successfully tested in PEMWE, confirming their practicality and effectiveness.
In recent decades, the necessity for environmental conservation has become more pronounced, leading to a heightened exploration for eco-friendly materials derived from renewable sources. Research focused on creating novel materials has underscored the significance of utilizing agro-industrial waste as a primary ingredient for generating products with enhanced value. The utilization of such residues not only proves to be economically feasible but also serves to mitigate environmental concerns associated with their disposal.
Among the various agricultural sectors, sugarcane stands out not only for its significant production volume but also for its substantial waste generation capacity. Presently, Brazil leads as the world's largest producer of sugarcane, yielding between 650 and 700 million tons annually, followed by India (340 million) and China (115 million). Sugarcane bagasse, a byproduct of alcohol and sugar production, has found utility in the production of second-generation ethanol (2G) and shows promise for yielding higher value-added products like nanocellulose. Recent research has delved into the extraction of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) within the biorefinery framework, recognizing that lignocellulosic materials such as sugarcane biomass can be harnessed for a range of applications including soluble sugars, micro and nanofibers, biofuels, and various other bio-based products.
Sugarcane straw, a byproduct of sugarcane production, comprises dried leaves and green tops left in the field for soil protection or collected for bioenergy production. The chemical and morphological characteristics of straw fibers closely resemble those of bagasse, suggesting their viability as a raw material for nanocellulose production. Despite this potential, there is a notable absence of research exploring the utilization of sugarcane straw for nanocellulose extraction in existing literature.
Various studies have explored the extraction of nanocellulose from sugarcane bagasse through different methods. These approaches typically involve chemical processes 3,13–19, mechanical techniques 20,21, or a combination of methods like mechanical and enzymatic approaches 22–24. Nanocellulose exhibits notable properties such as high strength and stiffness, low density, excellent chemical modification capabilities, and biodegradability 24,25. Its versatile nature allows for applications in various fields including the manufacturing of nanocomposites, packaging, cosmetics, medical and pharmaceutical products, electronic devices 24,26, and more recently, in the development of nanocomposites based on Nafion and CNCs for potential use in fuel cells 27,28.
The abundance of hydroxyl groups on nanocellulose surfaces contributes to its high water absorption capacity, ease of functionalization, and ability to form hydrogen bonds with polar polymeric substrates. Nanocellulose has been extensively studied for applications requiring these characteristics, such as photonic films, electrolytic membranes, fuel cells, and related systems. For instance, Jiang et al. explored film production using bacterial cellulose (BC) and Nafion, noting increased ionic conductivity and thermal stability below 100°C. Similarly, Gadim et al. enhanced mechanical properties and ionic conductivity of Nafion membranes by incorporating bacterial cellulose. Hasani-Sadrabad et al. successfully integrated CNCs into Nafion membranes to optimize fuel cell performance, with electrochemical impedance analysis indicating a positive impact on protonic conductivity with the addition of 5% (m/m) of CNCs.
However, previous studies have primarily focused on developing Nafion and nanocellulose membranes for use in fuel cells. Nevertheless, the characteristics exhibited by these nanocomposites show potential for integration into alternative devices, including proton-exchange membrane electrolyzer cells (PEMECs).
Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cells (PEMECs) are electrochemical devices designed for water electrolysis to produce hydrogen. These innovative devices hold the promise of transforming the energy sector by offering a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. PEMECs operate by utilizing water and electric current to generate hydrogen, all while avoiding the release of greenhouse gases. Moreover, they boast a commendable efficiency level, as evidenced by various studies (27, 32, 33).
The fundamental configuration of a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer Cell (PEMEC) consists of two porous electrodes, the composition of which varies based on the specific cell type, separated by an electrolyte and linked through an external circuit. Nafion stands out as the most frequently utilized membrane due to its notable characteristics such as high proton conductivity exceeding 100 mS cm-1, robust mechanical properties, and chemical durability. Nonetheless, Nafion's drawbacks include its costly nature, challenges in recycling post-use, reliance on adequate humidification for optimal proton conductivity, and compromised mechanical integrity at temperatures surpassing 100°C.
In light of the aforementioned points, it is evident that there is significant potential for exploring the properties of nanocomposite electrolytes that are based on Nafion-CNCs for potential application in PEMEC. Furthermore, there is a viable option to utilize CNCs derived from agro-industrial residues and manufactured through environmentally friendly processes like enzymatic hydrolysis.
Nafion solution D1021, a 10 wt% dispersion in water, was provided by Dupont. The freeze-dried Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were procured from the Process Development Center at the University of Maine (USA), while the graphite oxide dispersion (4 mg/mL, dispersed in water) was sourced from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals and solvents used in the study were of laboratory grade.
In the development of electrolyte membranes, cellulose nanocrystals derived from sugarcane production residues were utilized through an enzymatic route. The production protocol for CNCs was established based on the findings from the initial phase of the study (section 3.1). The chosen method involved enzymatic hydrolysis over a 72-hour period using treated fibers from sugarcane straw. This particular protocol emerged as one of the most favorable approaches investigated, demonstrating a superior balance of properties concerning aspect ratio, crystalline index, and thermal stability.
To explore the characteristics exhibited by membranes fabricated using chemically and morphologically diverse nanoparticles, membranes incorporating cellulose nanocrystals sourced from the University of Maine were synthesized. The commercial CNC obtained from the manufacturer reportedly contains 0.94% (m/m) of sulphur, with diameters ranging from 5 to 20 nm and lengths between 150 and 200 nm. Additionally, the CNC is noted to possess a density of 1.5 g cm-3 and a hydrophilic surface, as per the manufacturer's specifications.
Polymeric membranes, consisting of 100% Nafion, and Nafion nanocomposites incorporating CNCs (enzymatic or commercial), were fabricated using the mold evaporation forming technique (casting). These membranes were created from a 10% (m/m) Nafion solution in water (D1021, DuPont). Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Aldrich, PA) served as the solvent for preparing the polymeric films.
The production of Nafion membranes through casting has been extensively researched, highlighting the necessity of employing high boiling point solvents like dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). These solvents facilitate material processing at elevated temperatures, inducing a plasticizing effect that enables the creation of films possessing properties akin to those of commercial membranes. Furthermore, cellulose nanocrystals exhibit significant dispersal capabilities in organic solvent blends with high dielectric constants, such as DMSO.
To replace water as a solvent in commercial Nafion, evaporation was employed followed by resolubilization of the polymer in DMSO, necessitated by the requirement for a high boiling point solvent. The process involved maintaining the Nafion solution at 80 ºC in a beaker on a magnetic stirrer until a viscous residue was obtained, which was then redissolved in DMSO to yield a 10% (m/m) Nafion solution. This solution underwent magnetic agitation for 24 hours. Subsequently, the solution was utilized in the production of Nafion polymeric films without the inclusion of nanocharges (Ncast) and nanocomposite membranes comprising Nafion with 10% (m/m) of commercial CNC (N/CNC_C) and enzymatic CNC (N/CNC_ENZ).
The aim of this study was to partially replace nafion with a biodegradable material, leading to the selection of samples with high concentrations of CNCs. Membranes were fabricated with varying CNC concentrations (10%, 15%, 25%, 50% m/m). Nevertheless, samples exceeding 10% CNC concentration exhibited significant fragility, rendering them unsuitable for practical applications.
In the preparation of the nanocomposites, a Nafion solution in DMSO was prepared as described earlier, alongside CNC dispersions with the desired mass percentage using DMSO as a dispersant. The CNCs were dispersed in DMSO through tip ultrasound at 10% amplitude for 15 minutes, with cooling to prevent overheating, followed by 24 hours of mechanical agitation. Subsequently, the Nafion solution and CNC dispersions were combined and subjected to mechanical agitation for an additional 24 hours.
Membrane conformation was achieved through the deposition of CNC/Nafion dispersions in petri dishes for DMSO evaporation in a resistive oven. The evaporation process was conducted in two stages: initially, the samples were maintained at 80 ºC for 18 hours, followed by an increase in oven temperature to 120 ºC, which was sustained for an additional two hours.
After fabrication, the membranes underwent a cleaning process with deionized water to remove surface impurities and reduce residual solvent concentration. Subsequently, the activation of sulphonic groups was carried out by immersing the membranes in a sulfuric acid solution (0.5 M) at 80 ºC for 1 hour. Following this step, the membranes were rinsed with deionized water and left to dry at room temperature.
The membranes were analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) on a Bruker infrared spectrophotometer, specifically the Vertex 70 model, equipped with an Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) accessory. Total attenuated reflectance measurements were conducted over a range of wave numbers from 4000 to 650 cm-1, with a resolution of 4 cm-1 and 32 spectral accumulations per sample.
X-ray diffraction analysis was conducted using a Shimadzu 6000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) in continuous scanning mode at a speed of 2º.min-1 within the Bragg angle range (2θ) of 5 to 45º. The samples were prepared by cutting them into squares and securing them with double-sided tape beneath a glass slide.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the membrane surface were acquired using a Dimension V microscope (Veeco) at CNPEM-Campinas/SP. The images were captured in tapping mode at a frequency of 1 Hz, employing silicon needles with a curvature radius of 15 nm and an inclination of 12°.
The membranes underwent thermogravimetric analysis using a TGA Instruments Q500 model. Samples were subjected to heating at a rate of 10 ºC/min within the temperature range of 25 ºC to 900 ºC, under a nitrogen gas flow of 20 mL min-1. The onset temperatures for thermal degradation (Tonset) were determined through the examination of both thermogravimetric (TG) and derived thermogravimetric (DTG) curves. The onset temperature (T) was calculated by identifying the intersection of the extrapolation line from the initiation of the thermal event with the tangent to the curve at the temperature corresponding to the peak rate of thermal degradation of the material, as observed in the DTG curve.
The membranes underwent differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements using a TA Instruments DSC Q-100 equipment. The tests were conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 20 ºC min-1 within the temperature range of -50 ºC to 300 ºC.
In the dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) assay, rectangular specimens (5 x 30 mm2) of the membranes were prepared by cutting them with a mold and a scalpel equipped with a stainless steel blade. The DMTA tests were conducted using a DMA Q800 instrument from TA Instruments, operating in traction mode at a frequency of 1 Hz and an amplitude of 0.005 mm. The temperature range for the analysis was set from -30 to 180 °C, with a consistent heating rate of 2 °C min−1.
In the same equipment and using standardized specimens, mechanical tests were conducted under tension to generate stress-strain curves following the ASTM D882-18 standard with modifications. The tests were carried out at room temperature with a testing speed of 1 N min-1. Maximum stress (in MPa), percentage of deformation at rupture, and elastic modulus (in MPa) were determined from the stress-strain curves. Each sample underwent testing with a minimum of 6 specimens to ensure statistical reliability and accuracy in the results obtained.
To determine the water absorption capacity, the masses of the membranes were measured after being moistened and dried using an analytical scale. The water absorption capacity, denoted as ΔM, was calculated using equation (16):
The equation ∆𝑀= 𝑀𝑢−𝑀𝑆 𝑀𝑆 (16)1 represents the difference in mass, where Mu signifies the moist membrane mass and Ms denotes the dry mass. The dry mass (Ms) was determined by subjecting the sample to heat treatment in an oven at 60 ºC for 24 hours. Wet mass (Mu) measurements were conducted by immersing the membranes in deionized water at 80 ºC for 1 hour. Prior to the mass assessment, any excess water on the membrane surface was meticulously eliminated using filter paper.
The proton conductivity (σ) of the membranes was assessed through Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIE) utilizing a Solartron 1260 frequency analyzer and a teflon sample port fitted with two electrical connection terminals. The measurements were conducted at room temperature on both dry and wet samples.
For the analysis, an AC excitation of 200 mV was employed within the frequency range of 30 MHz to 10 MHz, with ten data points recorded per decade of frequency.
The Nyquist diagrams obtained were analyzed using Zahner's THALES software to ascertain the resistances (R) of the samples. The conductivity (σ) was then computed utilizing Equation (17), which incorporates the membrane thickness (L) in centimeters, the Resistance of the Membrane (R) in ohms, and the cross-sectional area of the membrane (A) in square centimeters.
The study utilized both manufactured membranes and the commercially available Nafion membrane in experiments conducted within an electrolytic cell featuring a proton exchange membrane (PEMEC). Catalyst-coated membranes (MCC) were specifically fabricated for these tests, with the MCC configuration consisting of an electrolyte (membrane) sandwiched between two electrodes (anode and cathode).
The CCMs with an active area of 3.98 cm2 were fabricated using the Decal method, also known as the transfer method. In this process, the electrodes (cathode and anode) are first deposited onto inert Teflon substrates and subsequently transferred to the membrane through hot pressing at 40°C.
In the electrode preparation process, catalyst powder and a 10% Nafion solution (m/m) were incorporated into paints using water (D1021, DuPont) and organic alcohol. The anodic electrode utilized IrO2 (Alfa Aesar, Premion, 99.99%) as the catalyst powder, while the cathodic electrode employed 60% Pt/C (HiSPEC 9100, Johnson & Matthey).
The inks were dispersed using an ultrasonic homogenizer (Bandelin Sonopuls HD 3200) and then applied onto inert teflon substrates with the assistance of a dosing blade (Coatmaster 509 MCI, Erichsen GmbH & Co. KG). Subsequently, the electrodes were dried in a resistive oven at 60°C for a duration of 3 hours. Following this, the dry electrodes were positioned on either side of the membranes and subjected to hot pressing at 100 ºC with a pressure of 200 kgf cm-2 for 3 minutes. The catalytic layers of the anode and the cathode achieved final loads of 2.1 mg Ir cm-2 and 0.8 mg Pt cm-2, respectively.
The catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs) were fabricated and subsequently tested in an electrolytic cell equipped with a proton exchange membrane (PEMEC) to generate polarization curves. These evaluations were conducted utilizing a Greenlight E60 test station. The porous transport layers (PTLs) employed in both the anode and cathode compartments were constructed from titanium plates sourced from Bekaert, boasting a porosity of 68% and a thickness of 350 μm. Iridium was utilized to coat the anodic and cathodic PTLs, resulting in superficial layers with a density of 0.5 mg cm−2.
To conduct the tests, each CCM was positioned between the PTL and subsequently placed inside the electrolyte cell. Following this, the cell underwent compression using a press and was then positioned at the test station, where all necessary inputs and outputs were connected.
The test commenced by heating the electrolytic cell to 80 °C. Ultrapure water, also preheated to the same temperature, was then supplied to the anode compartment at a flow rate of 50 mL min-1. Prior to generating the polarization curve, the electrolytic cell underwent preconditioning at current densities of 0.2 and 1 A cm-2 for 1 hour. Subsequently, the polarization curve was constructed by applying predetermined current values, with each current maintained for 5 minutes to verify the obtained voltage. The current was incrementally increased up to a maximum of 2.0 V. The reported results represent the average of at least three polarization curves.
To assess the impact of integrating various nanocellulose nanocrystals into the Nafion matrix, a comprehensive characterization was conducted encompassing composition, structure, morphology, thermal and viscoelastic properties, as well as protonic conductivity. Furthermore, the membranes underwent testing within an electrolytic cell featuring a proton-exchange membrane.
The examination of Nafion and its nanocomposites through vibrational spectra in the infrared region offers insights into the chemical and morphological attributes of the resulting material. Specifically, Commercial Nafion (Nafion 115), Conformation Nafion (Ncast), and nanocomposites incorporating commercial cellulose nanocrystals (N/CNC_C) and those derived from enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane straw (N/CNC_ENZ) were scrutinized utilizing the FT-IR technique, with the corresponding spectra depicted in Figure 1.
All the analyzed samples exhibited the main characteristic bands of Nafion, with the positions of these energy absorption bands in the infrared spectrum detailed in Table 1. The presence of these bands in the samples resulting from the forming process suggests that the method employed did not compromise the integrity of the polymer chains, branches, and sulphonic groups. These components are crucial for determining the morphology, mechanical strength, and electrical properties of the polymer.
The band observed at 2360 cm-1 is associated with the main polymer chain formed by -CF 2-CF 2-bonds. The band at 1620 cm-1 is attributed to the presence of water within the polymer structure. The bands detected at 1200, 1142, and 1060 cm-1 suggest the presence of sulphonic groups on the membrane, representing the asymmetric stretch vibration of the S=O bond, the symmetrical stretch vibration of the S=O lead, and the symmetrical S=O stretch, respectively. These bands can also be linked to the asymmetric and symmetrical stretch of the C-F bond in the primary chain of Nafion. Furthermore, the bands at 980 and 960 cm-1 exhibit the characteristic absorbance of the C-O-C bond found in the lateral chains of Nafion 30,41.
In addition to verifying the characteristic bands of Nafion, the FTIR spectra of the materials obtained were also examined to confirm the presence of residual solvents from the formation process. DMSO was the solvent utilized in the conformation process, and if not entirely removed from the polymer matrix, the samples' spectra may exhibit three distinctive bands of this solvent at 2657, 1659, and 1410 cm-1. The bands at 2657 and 1410 cm-1 correspond to the C-H bonding of the methyl group within DMSO, while the band at 1659 cm-1 is attributed to the C=O and S=O bonds of the solvent. However, upon analyzing the spectra of the produced membranes, none of the characteristic DMSO bands were detected, indicating the absence of any solvent residue in the manufactured membranes.
The spectra of the nanocomposites exhibit patterns that align with the anticipated chemical structure and composition, showcasing not only the characteristic bands of Nafion but also the absorption bands of cellulose nanocrystals (Table 4.2). Key bands indicating the presence of CNCs in the matrix include 3340 cm-1 (O-H stretching), 2900 cm-1 (C-H stretching), 1430 cm-1 (asymmetric deformation of C-H and C-O), 1315 cm-1 (angular symmetric deformation of C-H), and 897 cm-1 (C-O-C and C-H stretching). The distinctive cellulose band at 1061 cm-1, associated with the stretching of C-O and C-H groups, remains elusive due to potential overlap with the symmetrical stretch band of the sulphonic group found in Nafion.
The impact of incorporating cellulose nanocrystals into the polymer matrix of Nafion on the resulting membrane's crystallinity was assessed through X-ray diffraction analysis. The diffractograms depicted in Figure 2 reveal that the X-ray patterns of pure Nafion membranes (N115 and Ncast) exhibit similarities and are indicative of a semicrystalline nature, displaying a broad diffraction peak at 2θ ranging between 12 º and 20 º. This peak is attributed to the superimposition of a crystalline peak (2θ = 17.5º) and an amorphous halo (2θ = 16º) arising from the perfluoroether lateral chains of Nafion36,42.
As anticipated, the diffraction pattern of the nanocomposite membranes (N/CNC_C and N/CNC_ENZ) aligns with an amalgamation of the diffractograms of the individual components (Nafion and cellulose). Notably, these materials exhibited the emergence of the peak at 2θ = 23°, corresponding to the cellulose plan 002 43–46. Furthermore, a significant augmentation in the broad diffraction peak at 2θ ranging between 12° and 20° was observed, likely stemming from the superimposition of the characteristic peaks of Nafion with those of cellulose at 2θ values of 15° (plane 101), 17° (plane 10) 1̅43–46.
The presence of distinct crystalline peaks, indicative of cellulose, in the diffractograms of the nanocomposite membranes suggests that the embedded cellulose nanocrystals remained intact and did not undergo degradation during the membrane production process.
To assess the alterations in the morphology of the Nafion matrix resulting from the integration of various nanostructures, the samples underwent analysis through atomic force microscopy (AFM), as depicted in Figure 3. The surfaces observed for the commercially available Nafion samples (Figure 3a) and those obtained through the solvent evaporation method (Figure 3b) exhibit a rough texture typical of Nafion, comprised of aggregates in the shape of nanometric cylindrical particles.
To assess the distribution of cellulose nanocrystals within the polymer matrix, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images were acquired from the top and bottom sides of the samples. In both sets of samples containing commercial and enzymatic CNCs, a uniform distribution of nanoparticles was observed, with a comparable quantity of nanoparticles present on both the top and bottom surfaces of the membranes.
In terms of nanoparticle dispersion, it was observed that membranes fabricated from commercial cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) exhibited a more uniform dispersion compared to those made with enzymatic CNC. This discrepancy in dispersion can likely be attributed to the varying surface loads of the nanostructures resulting from the different production methods. Commercial CNCs are typically derived through acid hydrolysis with sulfuric acid, a process that yields charged nanoparticles, thereby aiding in the dispersion process. Literature reports indicate that suspensions of commercial CNCs (specifically from Maine) demonstrate high zeta potential values of approximately 70 mV, indicating highly stable suspensions. Conversely, CNCs obtained via enzymatic hydrolysis possess lower surface loads and are considered moderately stable, with zeta potential values ranging between approximately 25 and 31 mV.
The thermal stability of Nafion membranes, both with and without cellulose nanocrystals, was examined through thermogravimetric analysis. The findings from this analysis are visually represented in Figure 4 and quantitatively summarized in Table 2.
In Table 4.7 (a), it is evident that both commercial Nafion and Nafion produced by casting exhibit three distinct mass loss events characteristic of such materials. The initial mass loss event, occurring up to around 230 °C, is attributed to moisture evaporation. Between 230 and 370 °C, the second mass loss event is linked to the degradation of the sulphonic groups within the side chains of Nafion 50. Subsequently, the mass loss observed between 370 and 600 °C is associated with the degradation of the main chain of Nafion 50.
In relation to the membranes produced with cellulose nanocrystals, Table 4.7 (c-d) shows a similar thermal degradation profile for both samples. Analysis of the DTG graphs reveals four thermal events with maximum decomposition temperatures around 150, 185, 325, and 490 °C. The thermal events with the highest maximum decomposition temperatures (325 and 490 °C) coincide with those observed for Nafion, suggesting a common origin. Conversely, the events with maximum decomposition temperatures around 185 °C may stem from the degradation of the cellulose nanocrystals in the samples. Despite the fact that both commercial CNCs and those produced through enzymatic hydrolysis exhibit thermal degradation onset temperatures above 200 °C and 300 °C, respectively, some studies indicate a compromise in the thermal stability of cellulose when used in nanocomposites. Noonan et al. (29) suggest that the sulphonic groups in Nafion can catalyze the thermal degradation of the hydroxyl groups in cellulose.
While membranes containing CNCs exhibit thermal decomposition onset temperatures lower than those of pure Nafion membranes, the resulting nanocomposites demonstrate adequate stability for application in proton-exchange membrane electrolytic cells, given that the operational temperature of such systems typically remains below 100°C.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was employed to examine the thermal characteristics of pristine Nafion membranes containing cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). The DSC curves illustrating the first heating cycle for the polymer membranes are depicted in Figure 5.
The CSD curve derived from commercial Nafion revealed two endothermic peaks, one occurring at around 130 ºC and the other exhibiting a broader characteristic at approximately 230 ºC. These findings align with previously documented results in the literature concerning this material. The initial peak around 130 ºC is likely associated with the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the sulfion groups, while the subsequent peak at approximately 230 ºC can be attributed to the fusion of the crystalline regions.
The DSC curve of the Nafion membrane obtained through casting also exhibited the two prominent endothermic peaks characteristic of Nafion. The glass transition temperature (Tg) for this material displayed a slight decrease of approximately 5 ºC in comparison to commercial Nafion. This decrease in Tg for cast Nafion compared to the commercial variant has been previously documented in the literature. Matos et al. (50) suggested that Nafion membranes produced through casting may exhibit lower crystallinity levels when contrasted with commercially extruded membranes. This decrease in crystallinity promotes enhanced polymer chain mobility, consequently leading to a reduction in the glass transition temperature.
In membranes containing CNCs, the introduction of both types of nanoparticles resulted in an overlap of thermal events that can be attributed to both the fusion of the Nafion matrix and the thermal degradation of the CNCs, as previously noted in the TGA analysis (see Figure 4).
Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was conducted to assess the viscoelastic characteristics of membranes fabricated with and without cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), with the outcomes depicted in Figure 6.
In the case of the commercial Nafion membrane, the storage modulus (E') decreases as the temperature rises, with a more pronounced reduction occurring between approximately 90 and 140 ºC. This decrease in E' is accompanied by a peak in the tanδ curve at around 120ºC, indicating the vitreous transition of the material.
The Nafion membrane produced through conformation exhibited a viscoelastic behavior akin to that of the commercial membrane. In this material, the tanδ curve displayed a peak at around 110 ºC, indicating a decrease in the material's glass transition temperature (Tg) compared to the commercial membrane. This finding aligns with previous observations from the CSD analysis results.
The storage modulus of membranes produced with CNC was found to be superior to that of pure membranes across the temperature range under investigation, indicating the effectiveness of CNCs in reducing membrane deformation during heating. Particularly, a more pronounced increase in the storage modulus was observed in membranes produced with commercial CNC, possibly attributed to the enhanced dispersion of CNCs within the Nafion matrix, as evidenced by AFM analysis (Figure 3). The tanδ curve revealed an overlap of peaks between approximately 80 and 180 ºC, which could be associated with both the vitreous transition of Nafion and the observed mass loss within the same temperature range as indicated by thermogravimetric analysis (Figure 4). Furthermore, the shift of peaks towards higher temperatures may be linked to the constrained movement of Nafion chains due to the incorporation of CNCs, leading to an elevation in the glass transition temperature of the material.
The mechanical properties of the samples were assessed through tensile tests. The stress-strain curves, depicted in Figure 7, offer a comprehensive representation of the materials' behavior. The results obtained from analyzing multiple assays of each material are detailed in Table 3.
Analysis of the stress-strain curves (Figure 7) reveals distinct behaviors between the Nafion obtained through casting and the commercial Nafion. The cast Nafion exhibited a more uncertain behavior with increased deformation, whereas the commercial Nafion displayed a slightly more brittle nature with higher mechanical resistance. Upon incorporating CNCs into the Nafion matrix, a noticeable decrease in deformation levels and a corresponding increase in stress were observed, thereby modifying the polymer's mechanical characteristics.
These findings align with previous studies conducted by Noonan and colleagues (29). In their research, the authors utilized cellulose nanoparticles, specifically nanofibrils, to create Nafion matrix nanocomposites through solvent evaporation conformation. The outcomes of this investigation further indicate that the inclusion of such nanoparticles in Nafion leads to heightened maximum stress levels while simultaneously reducing material deformation.
The mean values of the elastic modulus, maximum stress, and strain for Nafion samples with and without CNC are detailed in Table 4.8. Notably, the sample prepared with enzymatic CNC exhibited the highest elastic modulus. Nevertheless, this sample also displayed the lowest deformation at rupture. This observation could potentially be linked to the presence of clusters, as evidenced in AFM images (Figure 3). These CNC clusters served as stress concentration sites, hastening failure and consequently leading to reduced tensile strength in the nanocomposites.
The hydration capacity of membranes is a crucial parameter that warrants investigation as it directly impacts the proton conductivity of the membrane, a key factor for its utility in electrolytic cells employing proton-exchange membrane (PEMECs). Augmenting the prosthetic conductivity of the membrane can be achieved by elevating the level of humidification. The water absorption capacity was assessed for all membranes under scrutiny, and the findings are detailed in Table 4.
The experimental data on the water absorption capacity of the commercial membrane Nafion 115 align closely with findings in existing literature and manufacturer specifications, registering at 50.57. Conversely, the water absorption capacity of the cast membrane surpassed that of the commercial variant. This disparity in humidification potential could be linked to variations in the crystallinity of the membranes. Crystalline regions restrict the polymer chains' expansion, ensuring material mechanical stability. Consequently, for the sulphonic group to expand and absorb water, this expansion must overcome the elastic energy of the polymer chains, which is more pronounced in materials with higher crystallinity. The conformation-derived membrane exhibits lower crystallinity compared to the commercially extruded one. Consequently, reduced chain crystallinity diminishes the polymer's resistance to expansion, thereby enhancing the membrane's water absorption capacity.
The incorporation of CNCs, whether commercial or enzymatic, into the Nafion matrix resulted in membranes exhibiting a notable enhancement in humidification capacity compared to the 100% Nafion membrane obtained through the same process. This enhancement can be attributed to the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of cellulose nanocrystals, which contribute to a high water absorption capability. Notably, membranes incorporating enzymatic CNCs displayed a more pronounced increase in water absorption capacity. This difference in performance could be linked to the method of nanocrystal production. Enzymatic CNCs, in contrast to their commercial counterparts, are derived through hydrolysis without the use of harsh acids like sulfuric acid, leading to the extraction of nanoparticles with a surface rich in hydroxyl groups.
In the literature, there are reports indicating an enhanced water absorption capacity upon the integration of nanocellulose into Nafion matrices. Jiang et al. demonstrated this phenomenon in their study, where Nafion membranes were fabricated using the solvent evaporation conformation technique. The incorporation of nanocellulose into the Nafion matrix, ranging from 10 to 50% (m/m), resulted in an observed increase in water absorption ability.
The electrical conductivity analysis, specifically ionic conductivity, of the samples was conducted through impedance spectroscopy measurements utilizing both dry and moistened membranes. Impedance spectroscopy diagrams for the wet and dried samples are illustrated in Figure 8. The experimental data enabled the determination of the membranes' conductivity, with the corresponding values detailed in Table 5.
When dry membranes are examined, it becomes evident that the introduction of CNCs results in a decrease in membrane conductivity. Nanocelluloses, including CNCs and CNFs, exhibit significantly low conductivity (~ 1x10-4 mS.cm-1) under conditions of low humidity, particularly in contrast to Nafion 27's conductivity. Consequently, the incorporation of CNCs into Nafion under low humidity conditions can be viewed as leading to isolated CNCs within the structure, thereby diminishing the electrolyte's electrical conductivity due to the volume fraction occupied by these isolated particles.
The aim of this study is to utilize the membranes manufactured as proton exchange membranes in water electrolysis cells. Throughout the electrolysis procedure, the membranes are in constant contact with water, necessitating an analysis of their performance in a wet state. Through a comparison of tests conducted on wet and dry membranes, it was observed that the conductivity of all samples increased with the deposition of the material. This conductivity enhancement is a characteristic trait of proton-conducting polymers like Nafion, where water serves as a medium for transporting charges.
The conductivity values obtained for wet commercial Nafion align with those reported for this polymeric electrolyte under similar conditions. The wet Ncast membrane exhibited superior conductivity compared to commercial Nafion, attributed to Ncast's higher water absorption capacity. The increased humidification of the membranes induced by conformational changes reduces the average free path for protonic conduction, consequently enhancing the material's conductivity.
The data in Table 5 indicate that the conductivity of wet samples rises with the inclusion of CNCs. In nanocomposites created with commercial CNC, this increase is approximately 6 mS.cm-1. However, nanocomposites incorporating enzymatic CNC exhibit a more pronounced increase, reaching around 20 mS.cm-1. This notable difference in conductivity enhancement for samples containing enzymatic CNC may be attributed to their higher water absorption capacity, as evidenced in Table 4.9.
An enhancement in Nafion conductivity through the incorporation of cellulose nanocrystals was documented in the research conducted by Hasani-Sadrabadi and 31 colleagues. The study involved the fabrication of Nafion membranes containing 5% (m/m) of CNC via the conformation technique, revealing a rise in proton conductivity across the temperature spectrum from 25 to 120 ºC. The authors suggest that CNCs function by linking the hydrophilic regions of Nafion (Closters), thereby augmenting the quantity of channels accessible for proton conveyance.
The membranes produced and the commercial membrane underwent testing in an electrolytic cell equipped with a proton exchange membrane (PEMEC). For the tests, a minimum of three samples of each membrane were coated with standardized loads: 2.1 mg cm-2 of iridium on the anode side and 0.8 mg cm-2 of platinum on the cathode side. All samples were subjected to the same testing parameters. The current versus voltage profiles (polarization curves) obtained during the membrane tests in the electrolytic cell are depicted in Figure 9. The potentials (V) exhibited by the electrolyte cell at specific current densities for each membrane are detailed in Table 6.
The polarization curves displayed for all samples exhibit the two characteristic regions of a PEM electrolysis polarization curve. At low current densities, the cell's potential increases sharply due to activation polarization. At higher current densities, the cell potential increases linearly with the current due to ohmic drop (cell resistance).
The membranes produced with 100% Nafion conformation exhibited a slight decrease in performance compared to commercial Nafion. Table 6 illustrates this observation, showing a performance drop of approximately 10mV when subjected to a current density of 1 A∙cm−2. This decline in performance was consistently observed across higher current densities as well.
A decrease in performance was noted in membranes containing CNC. Specifically, the membrane with commercial CNC exhibited a performance drop of approximately 40mV when subjected to a current density of 1 A cm−2 compared to the commercial membrane. Similarly, the membrane incorporating enzymatic CNC also showed a decline in performance relative to the commercial membrane. However, due to significant deviations observed among the replicates of the tests conducted on these samples, it is inconclusive to assert that the membrane with enzymatic CNC performs differently from the one with commercial CNC.
Based on the results obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy assays (Table 5), it is evident that the incorporation of CNCs into the Nafion matrix enhances the material's conductivity, thereby potentially improving membrane performance. A plausible explanation for the observed decline in material remnants could be attributed to a reduced application of catalytic layers (anode and cathode) on the membrane. This deduction is supported by the AFM images (Figure 3), which reveal a higher surface roughness on both sides of the CNC-incorporated membranes. These surface irregularities may hinder the catalyst's contact during deposition, consequently impeding effective interconnection between the components.
Although the membranes containing CNCs exhibited slightly lower performance, the findings presented in this study demonstrate the potential for utilizing these nanocomposite membranes in electrolytic cells with proton-exchange membranes (PEMECs).
The findings indicate that cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) can be efficiently extracted from sugarcane lignocellulosic biomasses, specifically bagasse and straw, through enzymatic processes. This discovery highlights a potentially more environmentally sustainable method for producing CNCs, offering a promising avenue to enhance the value of agroindustrial residues derived from lignocellulosic biomass.
The yields and properties of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) exhibited variability based on the duration of the hydrolysis reaction, suggesting that this parameter can be adjusted to produce nanomaterials with enhanced crystallinity and a more uniform size distribution. Conversely, the thermal stability of the CNCs showed minimal fluctuations with varying enzymatic hydrolysis times, with onset temperatures (T values) hovering around 310 °C across the different samples. Consequently, the enzymatic hydrolysis conditions employed yielded nanocellulose possessing high crystallinity and thermal stability, crucial attributes for its potential applications, such as reinforcement in nanocomposites.
Among the protocols investigated for the production of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) through enzymatic hydrolysis, the most promising production route was found to be the 72-hour duration in fibers treated with sugarcane straw. This particular protocol exhibited superior properties in terms of aspect ratio, crystalline index, and thermal stability compared to other studied methods.
CNC-based nanocomposite membranes, comprising both enzymatic and commercial components, were fabricated using a solvent evaporation forming technique that effectively dispersed CNCs within the material. However, the enzymatic CNC lacked sufficient loads, leading to the formation of nanoparticle agglomerates within the material.
While membranes containing CNCs exhibited reduced thermal stability in comparison to pure Nafion membranes, the resulting nanocomposites demonstrated adequate stability for application in PEMEC systems, given that the operational temperatures of such equipment typically do not exceed 100 °C.
The DMTA technique revealed that the conformation process led to a decrease in the glass transition temperature. However, mechanical tests indicated that the addition of CNCs to nafion resulted in heightened modulus and maximum stress values, albeit with decreased material deformation.
The incorporation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) into the Nafion matrix resulted in a notable enhancement in the humidification capacity of the membranes compared to the 100% Nafion membrane prepared through the same process. Furthermore, an improvement in the conductivity of the composite membrane was evident upon the introduction of CNCs.
Despite the enhanced conductivity, the nanocomposite membranes exhibited slightly inferior performance compared to commercial membranes when evaluated in a PEMEC. This discrepancy could potentially be attributed to the heightened roughness of the composite membrane surface. The decreased uniformity of the membrane surface might impede the effective fixation of catalysts during the deposition process, consequently leading to a decline in performance.
