This article conducts an analysis of the labor context in Ecuador during the 1930s to provide new quantitative, legal, and contextual insights. The information presented is crucial as it introduces three key elements essential for comprehending the work environment: the economically active population and their purchasing power, the legal framework concerning labor conditions, and a concise overview of the minimum wage implementation. The analysis employed a historical-comparative and analytical approach, focusing on three distinct worker groups: those in the public and industrial sectors, individuals in the interior and small-scale industries, and workers in rural areas. The first group enjoys various legal benefits, including compensation for eviction, premature separation, maternity leave, disability benefits, overtime pay, and a minimum wage that varies based on geographical zone and job type. In contrast, the second group experiences sporadic legal benefits, with minimum wages often assumed to be daily rates and paid in kind. The third group, however, lacks legal protections, living within their cultural norms, which precludes them from formal labor system legalization. Their compensation typically consists of in-kind payments or food exchanges.
The 1930s were characterized by the influence of political and economic events that reshaped the institutional structure of the country and laid the groundwork for a modernization process that was not unique to Ecuador but was part of the institutional modernization models in Latin America. Additionally, the international crisis significantly impacted the country's economic stability, particularly in the export sectors. The Great Depression led to a context of profound political instability in Ecuador during the 1930s, with 12 individuals serving as head of the executive power in less than a decade.
The modernization of Ecuadorian institutions was closely tied to the visit of the Kemmerer Mission, which provided guidance to the government in establishing the Central Bank of Ecuador. This institution centralized the monetary issue and led to the creation of additional control bodies like the Comptroller General of the State and the Superintendency of Banks. Furthermore, the adoption of the gold standard became a key component of the country's monetary policy. Many other nations in the Latin American region underwent comparable transformations, involving the establishment of national banks, regulatory agencies, and the reimplementation of the gold standard.
According to Eichengreen & Temin (2000), the Great Depression resulted in two phenomena affecting the prices of goods and products in countries adhering to the gold standard. Initially, a deflationary trend emerged due to the decrease in the money supply (Drinot & Knight, 2014). This deflationary pressure compelled industries to cut production costs, either through wage reductions or downsizing the workforce (Arnaut, 2010). The deflationary phase ceased when countries abandoned the constraints of the gold standard, as was the case with Ecuador in 1932. Subsequently, a new trend emerged, characterized by inflation, as countries no longer faced legal barriers to issuing new currency.
Within the economic and political milieu outlined, this research aims to scrutinize key variables concerning the labor conditions of Ecuadorian workers in the 1930s. The analysis will delve into the purchasing power and wages of workers, categorizing them into three distinct groups: firstly, those reliant on barter and communal survival mechanisms; secondly, salaried farmers and small-scale business employees remunerated with a daily wage supplemented by specific in-kind benefits; and lastly, workers situated within the centralized public and industrial sectors.
On the other hand, this study will delve into the various legal entities that have been established concerning labor regulations. The examination will center on the advantages afforded to employees, encompassing recompense for displacement, untimely termination, maternity leave, disability benefits, overtime compensation, as well as regulations on working hours and days, and the prohibition of child labor. Furthermore, a dedicated segment will be devoted to scrutinizing the enforcement of minimum wage policies in Ecuador, akin to practices observed in several other Latin American nations.
The implementation of wage changes within labor legal systems during the era of post-Great Depression populism governments saw politicians seizing the opportunity to advance their agendas. This period witnessed a blend of socialist and Keynesian economic adaptations, all under the overarching characteristic of populism. Notable examples include Lázaro Cárdenas in Mexico (1934-1940), Getulio Vargas in Brazil (1930-1943), and Juan Domingo Perón in Argentina (1943-1955) as highlighted by Zapata (2002). In Ecuador, Velasco Ibarra's government (1934-1935) marked the country's initial foray into populism. Subsequent decades witnessed significant changes in the highland hacienda system, with the Huasipungo system being phased out in favor of salaried relationships. In the central and northern regions of Ecuador, a shift towards a mixed economy model emerged, blending haciendas with smallholdings and transitioning from a patron-peasant dynamic to an employer-worker relationship, driven by agrarian transformations that shifted peasants from possessors to landowners, as noted by Salamea (1980).
The evolution of farms and the proliferation of production within the realm of large-scale farms across various nations necessitates a shift in perspective, wherein the large farm becomes the focal point for production expansion. This necessity is underscored by the pervasive prevalence of large-scale exploitation, even in countries that have previously undergone agrarian reforms or experienced significant transformations, as evidenced in the cases of Mexico and Bolivia (Murmis, 1980).
This revision article utilized the historical-comparative method and the historical-analytical method to examine the implementation of minimum wages in the Latin American region. Through the historical-comparative method, various similarities, differences, and trends were identified, with a significant trend being the differentiated implementation of minimum wages based on geographical areas and types of work. The historical-analytical method was instrumental in constructing the legal, economic, and social contexts that influence labor relations in Ecuador over the studied decade. This approach facilitated the presentation and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data, providing new insights into the subject matter.
While the methodology employed in this study could be categorized under Social History or Economic History, the article adheres to the principles of historical objectivity, acknowledging its inherent limitations. Following the school of thought of the esteemed Leopold Von Ranke, who viewed History as the presentation of facts, the article aims to present and narrate research findings without the ambition of passing judgment on the past or instructing future generations, as articulated by Iggers (2011:86). The article will proceed by delving into the economic context, followed by an exploration of the legal system, and concluding with an examination of the implications of the minimum wage.
During the decade under study, the region encountered the most severe crisis of the 20th century, known as the Great Depression. While various indicators of the crisis manifested within the Ecuadorian economic framework, it is noteworthy that the GDP exhibited a moderate growth trajectory from 1929 to 1934, averaging at 1.5% (Morillo 1996:687). Remarkably, there were no recorded declines in any of the years throughout the duration of the crisis.
One significant contrast lies in the Latin American region, where the GDP is projected to decline by 16% during the same period (Mitchell, 1993:762-764). However, the Ecuadorian economy primarily felt the impact in international commerce, which saw a 55% decrease by 1932 (Naranjo, 2021). Against this backdrop, the article delves into three key themes: the economically active population and their purchasing power, the legal framework surrounding working conditions, and a concise examination of the minimum wage implementation in Ecuador and other Latin American nations.
The information regarding the economic active population in Ecuador during the 1930s is somewhat ambiguous due to the absence of precise references to methodologies and systems established by the central government through national censuses. Consequently, the data provided are estimations derived from local forecasts. According to the National Economic Planning and Coordination Board, it was determined that by 1962, approximately 32% of the population could be classified as economically active.
In light of the absence of official data, our approach involves utilizing an initial estimate and extending it to the 1930s. By 1930, it was observed that roughly 14% of the populace resided in urban areas, equating to over 20,000 individuals (Bethell, 1998: 31). Extrapolating from these figures, an estimated 116,480 individuals were engaged in urban economic activities, while approximately 715,520 were involved in rural economic pursuits. De la Torre (1993) posits that in 1936, 55% of Quito's population were marginally employed, with 10.4% serving as day laborers, 23.5% as independent workers, and 21.1% as domestic workers. Furthermore, public sector employees accounted for 16.6% of the workforce in 1936 (Naranjo, 2017).
According to Linda Alexander Rodríguez (1992), half of the population was indigenous and led a sedentary lifestyle, relying on grains and tubers for sustenance. They engaged in barter, exchanging their products for cow's milk, goats, or cows, as well as meat, poultry, or sheep wool, as documented by the Banco Central del Ecuador in 1940.
This segment of the population resided within a labor context stemming from the Huasipungo, a land area leased for production that sustained families and communities. The concertaje system operated similarly across rural regions, particularly in the Ecuadorian highlands, leading to the detachment of rural areas from local and international markets. This portion of the economically active populace existed beyond domestic consumption and commercial transactions, engaging in product exchanges and patronizing goods they themselves grew or traded.
In the northern central Sierra, encompassing the provinces of Chimborazo, Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, Pichincha, and Imbabura, the hacienda system served as the foundation for textile and agricultural production, emerging as the primary source of income for laborers and the key driver of industrial development. Creamer (2018) contends that during the 1920s, a textile boom took shape, laying the groundwork for the specific type of industry that would flourish in the area. Notable instances include the Haciendas in Otavalo and the Valley of Los Chillos, as highlighted by Saint-Geours (1994).
The indigenous population formed the core of the peasantry, actively participating in the hacienda. Following them were the day laborers, small landowners, and artisans. Next in the social hierarchy were the mestizos, including merchants, carriers, employees, and urban artisans. Lastly, there were the whites residing in the city. By 1930, the perception of Indians had evolved significantly from what it was in 1875. With the society undergoing a process of democratization, the emergence of a more coherent national state, international ideological movements, and the rise of indigenism, the Ecuadorian Indian was no longer viewed simply as an illiterate labor force (Saint-Geours 1994: 168).
The remaining twenty-five percent of the population comprised wage workers and farmers engaged in internal trade. The economically active population also included public sector workers, merchants, industry owners, and renters who actively participated in the local market. This segment of the population was also involved in the external sector, encompassing both consumers of imported goods and producers of export goods.
The purchasing power of the economically active population varied based on their labor group. Limited information is available regarding the first group, as they operated within a barter system for exchange and commercialization. The absence of primary data and the challenges associated with calculating based on commercial exchange rather than monetary values of labor make it difficult to determine precise amounts.
In this field, the evaluation is solely qualitative, focusing on the social and labor conditions prevalent during the studied decades. The group under scrutiny is distinguished by their involvement in the production and consumption of various agricultural commodities including sugar, cotton, corn, rice, bananas, pineapples, oranges, lemons, as documented by Stevens in 1940.
In the second group, which comprised salaried workers and farmers, there is limited information available, sourced primarily from central regions of the country. For instance, salary records from 1936 for baker's assistants indicate a daily wage ranging between 2-5 sucres (see figure 1), translating to a monthly income of approximately 40 to 100 sucres, potentially augmented by 4 to 10 additional sucres if weekend work is factored in. Employment in large cattle ranches commanded higher wages, averaging around 75 sucres per month in 1936. Furthermore, as evidenced by the account book (see figure 2), workers also received supplementary compensation in the form of goods such as cattle, beef, sheep, potatoes, and corn.
In the second group, additional primary information regarding pensions can be included. Presidential decrees dating back to 1928 outlined pensions ranging from 66 to 143 sucres per month for primary teachers, aligning with the average earnings over the preceding five years. Moreover, the wages recorded at Hacienda Tungurahua in 1928, specifically 60 sucres for doormen and stamp sellers as documented in Official Gazette N.604 of 1928, offer valuable insights into the income dynamics of both salaried workers and farmers.
In the third group, comprised of the economically active population within the public sector, including workers in industries and merchants, data from Naranjo (2017) revealed that the lowest-paid employees and workers earned an average income of 91 sucres per month during the 1920s. However, these wages experienced a significant decline amidst the international crisis; the Great Depression led to a reduction of approximately 25 sucres in unskilled wages from 1929 to 1935. As anticipated, this group, directly engaged in local markets and national transactions and trade, received a higher remuneration compared to other groups.
Based on the data, it is evident that wages exhibited fluctuations directly correlated with the price index. Prior to 1932, factoring in the deflationary trend, real wages saw an increase as they remained nominally stable since 1929. Subsequent to 1932, with the abandonment of policies tied to the gold standard, inflation began to exert a direct influence on wages: real wages declined while employment surged due to the expansion of the money supply, thereby validating the Phillips curve (Naranjo, 2021). Figure 3 illustrates a cessation in the inflation growth by 1937, indicating a concurrent stabilization in wages from the same year onwards.
The purchasing power of Ecuador's economically active population is evident through the differentiation of groups. The first group, reliant on agricultural and livestock production as well as community exchange systems, maintained a stable purchasing power even amidst the international crisis. This stability was attributed to their internal commercial activities, which were not subject to the price fluctuations of the domestic market. This segment of the population served as a resilient buffer during the global crisis, as their subsistence methods were not reliant on national or international trade.
During the period spanning from 1929 to 1932, Ecuador experienced an annual average growth rate of 0.6%. However, it became evident that a segment of the population posed a significant burden during the recovery phase as it failed to contribute to increased production. Following the repercussions of the international crisis, the recovery trajectory in Ecuador lagged considerably behind that of other Latin American nations. Subsequently, from 1932 to 1939, Ecuador witnessed an annual average growth rate of 3.5%, notably lower than the Latin American regional average of 5% (Naranjo, 2017).
The second group, comprising salaried workers and farmers, along with the third group consisting of public workers, merchants, exporters, and agricultural owners, experienced a notable impact on their purchasing power during the Great Depression. This impact followed the patterns previously outlined: an initial increase in purchasing power until 1932, followed by a consistent decline until 1939. By 1937, wages had only managed to reach levels comparable to those of 1928, indicating a stagnation in purchasing power over the span of a decade. Feiker (1931) noted that Ecuador, with a population of approximately two million individuals, exhibited a low purchasing power akin to that of a Nordic country with a population of two hundred thousand.
The Ecuadorian labor context is examined through three lenses: firstly, the existing legal framework over the past decade; secondly, the execution of social security measures; and thirdly, an evaluation of the minimum wage. By delving into the labor system, a comprehensive understanding of the operational landscape emerges, shedding light on the conditions under which these operations unfolded. Furthermore, an exploration of social security unveils the initial legal advantages that workers secured. Lastly, scrutinizing the minimum wage illuminates how this factor was a consequence of a global trend towards establishing legal minimums for sustenance.
In the context of labor issues within the legal system, various provisions were established in the thirties to address worker conditions. The initial provision was outlined in the Penal Code of 1906, which remained in effect throughout the decade, prescribing imprisonment for those who reduced wages (Article 298). Subsequently, on September 11, 1916, regulations were introduced to define the hours and days of work, stipulating eight hours per day and six days per week (Albornoz 1931:52). In 1921, a law was enacted to provide pecuniary compensation to workers or day laborers for work-related accidents, followed by the establishment of the Social Welfare and Labor Section on July 13, 1926.
In the late 1920s, a number of legal entities were established to address labor-related issues.
The Individual Employment Contract Law lacked a precise definition of the terms "employee" and "employer," failed to outline the legal procedures for termination, and did not specify the types of compensation available in cases of untimely or premature dismissal.
The Law of Maximum Duration of the Weekly Day of Work and Rest mandates that private or public employees work eight hours a day and six days a week. Public workers are entitled to rest days as decreed in the norm, including Christmas and Civic Day. The law also stipulates payment for overtime worked and divides the working day into two parts with a break in between.
The Law on the Work of Women and Children, and Protection of Maternity strictly prohibits the employment of minors under 14 years of age. Employers are mandated to ensure that workers under 18 years of age receive formal education. For workers under 18, the maximum allowable working hours per week is set at eight. Concerning women, night shifts are prohibited, and employers are required to provide a subsidy for six weeks - three weeks before and three weeks after childbirth.
The Eviction Law encompasses the legalization of penalties for untimely or premature dismissals, alongside the establishment of clear requirements for evictions and compensation.
The Law of Civil Responsibility for Labor Compensation was established alongside the eviction law, aiming to regulate compensation and evictions. This legal framework, as outlined by Albornoz in 1931, linked compensation directly to the severity of cases resulting from work-related accidents.
The Law of Responsibility for Work Accidents and Procedures, a legal document published in 1928, comprises two main sections. The first section delineates the responsibilities of workers in cases of accidents and work-related illnesses. The second section outlines the obligations of employers concerning the partial disability of their employees resulting from work-related issues. According to Guerrero (1937:22), in such instances, the victim is entitled to compensation equivalent to two years' salary.
While the legal context provides insight into the functioning of the centralized public sector, it falls short in shedding light on the private sector, informal sector, and public sector in provinces beyond Pichincha and Guayas, which hold significant political and economic importance.
There is a lack of reports demonstrating the implementation of labor laws in the sectors under discussion, which is not surprising given the prevalence of informality in the private sector and the overall weak functionality of the public sector outside of Guayaquil and Quito. It is probable that these labor laws have been enforced in the centralized public sector and to some extent in the industrial sector, but it is unlikely that they have been applied in the majority of the informal sector.
In the case of peasants and a segment of the indigenous population residing within a huasipungo system, the labor structure they were subjected to did not align with their lived reality. Often, these workers found themselves devoid of land, shelter, or possessions, bound to a perpetual cycle of debt for meager wages that never seemed to diminish (Albornoz 1931:47). The adjustment to this labor framework occurred gradually in subsequent decades as the country's economy progressed and corporations expanded in both size and number. Social security was institutionalized in Ecuador as a governmental mandate in 1928, originating from the establishment of the Pension Fund, which primarily outlined retirement benefits, civil support, and funeral funds for both civilian and military personnel (Instituto Nacional de Previsión 1939:5).
The Pension Fund offered various benefits to workers, including reimbursement for contributions, income for disability and work accidents, coverage for work-related illnesses, medical assistance, and retirement systems that commenced at age 75 or after accumulating 20 years of contributions. According to the Instituto Nacional de Previsión (1939:7), in the event of unemployment or withdrawal from the Fund for any legal reason, workers were entitled to the full return of their contributions.
On July 31, 1936, the strike law was enacted, granting workers the right to strike after all avenues of institutional conflict resolution had been explored.
According to the regulations outlined by the Pan American Union in 1937, factory workers are obligated to adhere to the requests of their employer, a requirement that 51% of them must comply with. Furthermore, the workers are only permitted to declare a strike if, after three days of submitting their declaration, the employer either remains silent or responds negatively to their demands (Pan American Union 1937:25).
and it has since undergone several adjustments to keep up with inflation and changing economic conditions. This minimum wage serves as a crucial benchmark for ensuring that workers are paid a fair and decent wage for their labor, helping to prevent exploitation and ensure a basic standard of living. Additionally, examining the minimum wage in the broader Latin American context provides valuable insights into regional trends and variations in labor conditions, highlighting the importance of comparative analysis in understanding the complexities of labor rights and protections across different countries. By considering the establishment and evolution of the minimum wage in Ecuador and the Latin American region, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the historical and contemporary factors shaping labor conditions and the ongoing struggle for fair wages and working conditions.
Another significant accomplishment pertains to the establishment of a relative minimum wage. The absence of a legal framework for this issue created a pressing void that needed immediate attention. Following extensive research and analysis, it was determined that the minimum wage should be set at one sucre per day in mountainous regions and two sucre per day on the coast (Guerrero, 1937:22-23).
similar to that of the indigenous population, was particularly complex due to their informal and often subsistence-based economic activities. Consequently, the implementation of a universal minimum wage faced significant challenges in ensuring fair compensation across all sectors of the workforce. Despite efforts to regulate wages, disparities persisted, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and inclusive policies to address the diverse economic realities of the population.
In rural areas, a significant number of individuals do not receive monetary compensation for their work but instead are remunerated with the land they work on. In contrast, on rustic farms situated in mountainous regions, some workers receive salaries ranging from twenty to fifty cents, while those in warmer areas may earn between eighty cents to two or three sucres, depending on the specific agreements and relationships established within these agricultural settings (Moreno, 1992:73).
In examining the labor conditions of workers in the 1930s, it is crucial to consider the introduction of the minimum wage as a means of establishing legal thresholds essential for sustaining individuals. In Ecuador, the legalization of the minimum wage took into account regional disparities and diverse labor sectors, resulting in varying rates such as 25 sucres for inland jobs, 50 sucres for coastal positions, and 37.5 sucres for roles in the capital. Subsequently, this article will delve into the enforcement of minimum wage regulations across Latin America.
The countries examined in the subsequent analysis each navigated their unique local and national political landscapes, yet all converged on the establishment of minimum wage thresholds to ensure workers receive a basic level of sustenance. Factors such as the conditions of public sector employees, regional disparities, transportation challenges in specific areas, private sector labor demands, and the feasibility for employers to meet these wage requirements were carefully considered. Consequently, it becomes apparent how various nations formalized diverse minimum wage structures based on geographical positioning, currency exchange rates, and job categories. During the 1930s, the Latin American region experienced a surge in minimum wage implementations, either through legislative bodies or constitutional amendments. The constitutions of Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, and Peru explicitly underscored the necessity of maintaining consistent minimum wage standards (Owen 1938). Subsequently, other countries in the region gradually embraced these measures within their own unique political contexts.
The legal changes surrounding the implementation of minimum wages coincided with the rise of populist governments that seized upon the economic crisis of 1929 as an opportunity to shift blame onto the northern hegemon. During this period, many governments sought to secure electoral support from the masses by promising benefits for workers and employees, exemplified by leaders such as Lázaro Cárdenas in Mexico (1934-1940), Getulio Vargas in Brazil (1930-1943), and Juan Domingo Perón in Argentina (1943-1955) (Zapata, 2002). In Ecuador, these changes were instigated within the context of the Julian Revolution (1925-1932) and the inauguration of the first populist government under Velasco Ibarra (1934-1935).
In the instances of Ecuador, Cuba, Costa Rica, Chile, Brazil, and Argentina, several commissions were established to examine various potential minimum wage levels. Table 2 has been utilized to display the minimum wages in USD. The legal proceedings in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador, as documented in Owen's report (1938), will be scrutinized in the subsequent section.
In Argentina, significant legislative changes were implemented in the late 1920s and early 1930s to improve working conditions for employees. In 1929, Law 11.544 was enacted, setting the standard working day at 8 hours or 48 hours per week. Subsequently, in 1933, Law 11.723 introduced crucial amendments such as compensation and paid vacations, particularly benefiting workers in the commercial sector. The following year, in 1934, Law 11.933 was passed, mandating compulsory maternity leave starting 30 days before childbirth and extending up to 45 days postpartum (Cámara Argentina de Comercio y Servicios, 2018).
The initial implementation of minimum wage laws occurred in the public sector, with a legal decree on September 28, 1934, dividing public sector workers into two geographical zones denoted as zone A and zone E. In zone A, workers were entitled to a minimum wage of 160 pesos monthly or 6.40 pesos daily, while in zone E, the minimum wage was set at 90 pesos monthly or 3.60 pesos daily. Subsequently, minimum wage regulations were extended to the private sector, with the textile industry being subject to these laws on April 15, 1935, followed by footwear companies on June 9, 1937.
In the textile industry, there exists a distinction in wages between employees working on wool raincoats and those working on shorts, with the former receiving a minimum of 11 pesos and the latter a minimum of 12 pesos. The masons' strike of 1936, as documented by Owen in 1938, prompted authorities to issue a resolution on March 24 that established minimum wage rates for different positions within the industry. This resolution formalized the minimum wages for foremen at 6.40 pesos, foreman assistants at 5.2 pesos, and pawns at 4.5 pesos.
The minimum wages in Argentina have been converted into US dollars to facilitate comparison with other Latin American countries. Tables 2 and 3 illustrate the variation in minimum wages in US dollars across different industrial sectors. Workers in the trench coat textile industry received the highest wages, while those in the public sector of zone E earned the lowest wages.
The occupations with the lowest wages were primarily those involved in the production of undergarments, yet the workers were not solely focused on this specific task but also contributed to various aspects of the textile industry. Consequently, they were not exclusively associated with the sector characterized by the lowest income levels. Additionally, the official working month was typically defined as 25 days, although the actual number of days worked varied depending on the specific industry. In 1945, Secretary of Labor and Forecast Juan Domingo Perón extended the entitlement to paid vacation days to workers across all sectors through Decree 1740.
In Bolivia, on June 27, 1933, a decree was issued to legalize the wage increase in both the public and private sectors. The percentage of salary increase varied depending on the productive sectors and monthly income: for workers earning more than 1,201 bolivianos per month, the salary was raised by 780 bolivianos; for those earning less than 100 bolivianos per month, the increase was 120%; for workers with a daily wage of one boliviano, the raise was 120%; and for domestic workers earning up to five bolivianos per day, the increase was 80% (Owen, 1938).
In 1937, four years after the initial legislation, the minimum wage for the commercial and industrial sectors was officially established. Workers were entitled to a minimum wage of 140 bolivianos, regardless of gender. Older adult workers were guaranteed a minimum wage of five bolivianos per day, while minor workers aged between 14 and 18 received three bolivianos per day. However, this regulation notably excluded agricultural sector workers whose total assets did not surpass 50,000 bolivianos.
As illustrated in Tables 4 and 5, the minimum wage, when converted to US dollars, is categorized into three distinct sectors. The first sector pertains to the industrial commercial sector, where the minimum wage stands at 72.53. Moving on to the second sector, which encompasses workers classified as older adults, the monthly minimum wage is recorded at 64.76. Lastly, the third group comprises minor workers aged between 14-18 years old, with a minimum wage set at 38.85.
The minimum wage was instituted through negotiations between 1934 and 1937, under the presidency of Getúlio Vargas (1930-1945). The Federative Republic of Brazil (1934) enshrined the minimum wage in the Constitution, defining it as remuneration "capable of satisfying, according to the conditions of each region, the normal needs of the worker" (art. 121).
On January 13, 1936, a decree was issued that outlined special adjustments to the salaries of federal civil servants, as stipulated in the law enacted on the same date. Under this decree, employees earning less than 150 milreis saw their salaries raised to 200 milreis. Those earning between 150 and 1,500 milreis received a 40% increase up to 500 milreis, followed by a 20% increment up to 1,000 milreis, and a 10% raise up to 1,500 milreis. Employees falling within the income bracket of 1,500 to 2,500 milreis experienced a 300 milreis increase, while those earning between 2,500 and 3,000 milreis were granted a 250 milreis raise. Similarly, workers with incomes ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 milreis received a 200 milreis increment.
In the Constitution ratified on November 10th, 1937, Brazil acknowledged the necessity of a "minimum wage capable of meeting, as per regional variations, the basic requirements of labor" (Owen 1938:326). To address this, several committees were established to determine minimum wage levels according to geographical distinctions. Subsequently, these varied wage rates were endorsed through an executive decree.
In all instances, it was acknowledged that underage workers were compensated at a rate equivalent to half of an adult's income; roles undertaken in hazardous conditions warranted one and a half times the standard wage. Furthermore, any labor executed with remuneration below the minimum wage was deemed null and void, necessitating the employer to make up the discrepancy for the hours worked.
Tables 6 and 7 illustrate the establishment of the minimum wage in 1936 based on prior earnings. The minimum wage ranged from $17.50 to $278.40, reflecting the lowest and highest values set during that period.
In Chile, the labor code was ratified on May 13, 1931, establishing regulations for minimum wages determined through negotiations between two commissions. One commission comprised three worker representatives, while the other consisted of three representatives from the business and industrial sectors. These commissions were responsible for setting the minimum wage conditions and resolving conflicts with the General Labor Inspector (Vergara, 2014).
The nitrate industry was among the sectors that experienced distinct treatment. On January 8, 1934, the wages for this sector were delineated: single workers were entitled to a minimum wage of 10 pesos per day, while married individuals or heads of households received 15 pesos per day. Additionally, older adults, disabled individuals, or minors were compensated at half the rate of a single worker's salary.
The Superior Labor Council initiated discussions on a bill regarding the minimum wage, which was subsequently approved in March 1935 for presentation to the national congress. The proposed bill outlined a minimum daily income that was mandated to fall between two-thirds and three-fourths of the prevailing salary in each specific region of the country.
During President Arturo Alessandri's government (1932-1938), a commission was appointed by decree no. 1009 on October 11, 1935, to investigate the implementation of the minimum wage and suggest legal measures aimed at significantly enhancing workers' income through the concept of a family wage (Yáñez 2019:12). This commission put forth a proposal for a living wage and family wage tailored to different regions of the country, designed to cover the essential needs of an entire year, with a particular focus on ensuring a daily intake of 3,000 calories per worker. The outcome of this proposal was the establishment of a wage of 10.50 pesos in Zone I and 8.03 pesos in Zone V.
In 1937, the salary was officially sanctioned for the entire private sector, with divisions based on geographical areas: 300, 350, and 400 pesos per month. Within the municipality of Santiago, minimum wages were set at 12 pesos per day for temporary workers and 13 pesos for permanent employees. Tables 8 and 9 illustrate the salary in US dollars ranging from 4.24 to 15.72, with a minimum of 8 for a specific group comprising minors, elderly individuals, and workers with disabilities.
In Ecuador, discussions regarding the implementation of a legal minimum wage took place during the drafting of the Constitution of 1929. However, the language used in the document was not specific in terms of a precise amount. Article 151 simply stipulated that the minimum wage should be determined based on the cost of living and the climatic conditions specific to each region.
The legislation will establish the maximum duration of the working day and outline the method for determining minimum wages, particularly in consideration of the cost of living and the unique conditions and requirements of different regions within the nation. Additionally, it will mandate a weekly rest period and implement social security measures as outlined in article 151.18.
The establishment of a minimum wage in Ecuador in 1936 followed a period marked by labor unrest and political negotiations. It is crucial to note that the political landscape in Ecuador was particularly unstable in 1932, with a revolving door of approximately 12 individuals holding executive power until 1940. A significant labor dispute unfolded in 1934 with the shutdown of La Internacional, a prominent textile factory in the country. The Ministry of Government and Social Security, in its Report to the Nation, highlighted that one of the key demands of the strike leaders was the implementation of a minimum wage of 1.50 sucres for an eight-hour workday (Baquerizo 1934:74).
In his report, the Minister of Government and Social Security, Mr. Rodolfo Baquerizo Moreno, suggested that to effectively implement the intention of establishing salary standards, it would be advisable for the Honorable Congress to enact a Special Law specifically addressing this issue, following a comprehensive examination of the diverse regions and traditions within the country (Baquerizo, 1934:74).
On November 26, 1934, the Senate finalized the draft of the Minimum Wage Law, marking a significant milestone in the legislative process. However, the findings suggest that the development of this legislation was abruptly halted. Progress towards the enactment of the law was stagnant during the 1934-1935 period, highlighting a lack of advancement. The observation that wage determinations were based on agreements between parties until 1936 underscores a legal void attributed to the limited ability to formulate wage regulations for the industrial sector amidst the political turbulence from 1931 to 1935 (Creamer 2018: 36).
In 1936, following months of political turmoil, labor disputes, and legislative negotiations, the Organic Labor Law was enacted, setting forth the minimum wage standards in the nation (Registro Oficial No. 205, 1936). This legislation was a response to the agreements forged among key stakeholders, namely the workers' sector, industrialists, and the central government.
In 1937, President Federico Páez issued an executive decree that divided the minimum wage into two categories: one for manual workers and another for agricultural workers. This decree established minimum wage standards for agricultural workers and private employees, marking a significant development in labor regulations.
In the context of manual labor, the minimum wage stood at 2 sucres per day along the Coast and 1 sucre per day in the Sierra region. Notably, the capital city of Quito implemented a distinct wage structure, offering workers a salary of 1.5 sucres. Similarly, for agricultural laborers, the minimum payment scheme also varied.
Workers on the Coast earned 1.2 sucres, whereas those in the Sierra received 0.60 sucres. For workers under 18 years of age and women, whether in manual or agricultural sectors, the minimum wage was set at two-thirds of the standard rate. Interestingly, the legal framework did not specify the salary structure for domestic workers (Pan American Union, 1937).
Table 7 illustrates the segmentation of minimum wages based on sectors and geographical regions, specifically categorizing manual and agricultural workers in distinct areas such as the Sierra, the Coast, or the capital city, Quito. Consequently, the wage scale varied from USD 1.17 for agricultural laborers in the Sierra region to USD 4.77 for manual workers employed on the Coast.
In Ecuador, labor sectors vary in their monthly wages, with workers receiving 25 sucres per month in the Sierra, 50 sucres on the coast, and 37.5 sucres in Quito. Specifically in the agricultural sector, the lowest-paid workers earn 15 sucres monthly in the Sierra and 30 sucres on the Coast.
The 1930s were marked by a two-phase process: initially, the period was heavily impacted by the Great Depression, followed by a slow recovery. The first phase was distinguished by the adoption of monetary tools like the gold standard and the centralization of monetary issuance under the purview of the Central Bank of Ecuador.
The second period is marked by an increase in monetary emission, inflation, and political instability. This instability paved the way for the rise of populist governments, exemplified by figures like Velasco Ibarra, who was not the sole leader in the region to adopt such a stance. Similar movements were observed in the administrations of Getúlio Vargas in Brazil, Perón in Argentina, and Cárdenas in Mexico.
Within this context, the article examines three crucial aspects: the economically active population, the legal framework governing labor, and the minimum wage regulations. Concerning the economically active population, it can be categorized into three distinct groups: individuals engaged in a barter system, those employed in Haciendas as wage workers or farmers, and those who form part of the workforce in industries, commerce, or the public sector.
The initial group lacks substantial information on labor; however, the article delineates its essence through the production and consumption of agricultural commodities like sugar, cotton, corn, rice, bananas, pineapples, oranges, lemons, among others. Within the second group, the remuneration data for labor in Haciendas or Bakeries typically ranges from 2 to 5 sucres per day. Moving on to the third group, salaries exhibit a spectrum, catering to both unskilled and skilled workers.
In the realm of the legal system, several benefits have been introduced over the past decade, including compensation for eviction, premature separation, maternity, disability, and overtime worked. Additionally, regulations have been put in place regarding the maximum hours and days of work, as well as the prohibition of minors engaging in certain types of work. The article posits that these legal provisions are likely to be applicable in labor sectors within the centralized public sector.
A comprehensive or nearly comprehensive implementation of labor legal systems is likely among employees in the public sector and the major industrial sectors of the country. There is a lack of reports analyzing the labor conditions in other segments of the population based on the enforcement of established legal frameworks. This gap can be attributed to the prevalence of informal labor practices and a significant portion of the workforce engaging in barter systems or receiving non-monetary compensation as part of their wages.
In the context of Ecuador, the minimum wage varied across regions. In the Central Sierra, the wage stood at one sucres per day, while in the Sierra region, it was 25 sucres, and in the Coast, it amounted to 50 sucres. It is important to note that these figures are not universally applicable to all areas of the country. Nevertheless, they offer a localized and contextual insight into the prevailing employment conditions.
In the context of the Latin American region, two distinct trends emerge. Initially, there was a notable inclination towards the acceptance and implementation of minimum wage policies during the 1920s and 1930s. Subsequently, a pattern emerged wherein minimum wages were tailored to specific geographical regions, the age of the workforce, as well as their familial or physical circumstances. This entailed the establishment of varied wage rates for individuals with disabilities and married women, reflecting a nuanced approach to wage structuring within the region.
