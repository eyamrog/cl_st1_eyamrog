In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. In Brazil, the rapid spread of the virus necessitated the implementation of nationwide restrictive measures, sparking debates about the potential resumption of economic activities as early as April. By mid-December, the country had reported a staggering 6,970,034 confirmed cases and 182,799 deaths attributed to COVID-19.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the content and characteristics of official documents that guided the period of transition and resumption of economic activities in Brazil based on health indicators. METHODS: This research employed a documentary approach conducted between May and July 2020, utilizing official websites and publications from the state governments of the 27 federative units in Brazil as primary sources. Only documents that incorporated epidemiological and health indicators as pivotal criteria for decision-making concerning the relaxation, continuation, or reversal of social isolation measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the study.
FINDINGS: Plans, decrees, and technical notes were identified for 18 Brazilian federal units. In the majority of the documents, the scientific team consisted solely of technicians (n = 10). The range of indicators discovered varied from 2 to 11, categorized into 5 groups: frequency and distribution of the disease; social and collective adherence; installed capacity or service profile; productive potential; and availability of supplies.
The main conclusions drawn from this research highlight the significance of understanding governmental strategies implemented to ease restrictive measures in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. By analyzing indicators and facilitating comparisons across various federative units, valuable insights are gained into the disease's outcomes based on geographical locations. This approach enables the construction of a comprehensive pathology panorama within the country. Furthermore, the utilization of the study's findings by Brazil and other nations can serve as a valuable tool for reflection and strategic planning of policies amidst the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of SARS-CoV-2 a global public health concern, followed by the announcement of a pandemic state two months later. These decisions were based on the virus's pathogenicity, virulence, and the lack of effective treatment options. Given these factors, governmental efforts to reduce transmission and mortality rates are crucial in controlling the epidemic, with significant global implications, although the full extent of their effectiveness remains uncertain.
In Brazil, the high rate and rapid spread of contamination necessitated the implementation of stringent measures across both public and private sectors nationwide, restricting activities to essential services and enforcing adherence to public health guidelines and WHO-recommended social distancing practices. These measures underscore the comprehensive nature of addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, which involves not only health considerations but also social, political, and economic dimensions. In this context, the coordinated efforts of Brazilian federative units (states and the Federal District) are crucial, as aligning with the directives of relevant authorities and drawing from international experiences can significantly impact the effectiveness of government responses. Failure to act promptly or efficiently can place a heavy burden on public health systems and result in the loss of countless lives.
In February, it became imperative to develop contingency plans to aid the respective governments in addressing COVID-19 within the framework of the Unified Health System (SUS in Portuguese), a publicly funded national health entity. Consequently, the Ministry of Health's initiatives, geared towards curbing the pandemic, encompassed a spectrum of activities from epidemiological surveillance to providing intricate medical assistance. These efforts spanned from preparing for the imminent arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil to the present situation marked by the relaxation of restrictive measures and social distancing protocols.
In April, the discourse surrounding the gradual resumption of economic activities gained momentum with the detailed unveiling of initial state strategies aimed at easing restrictions in Brazil. The implementation of these plans commenced in May in at least one state, a development that was extensively covered by the Brazilian media and officially documented in bulletins.
The lack of a standardized national guideline for economic reopening has led to significant discrepancies in the recovery plans put forth by various federative units. These differences encompass the range and quality of indicators utilized, the metrics employed, and the transparency and reliability of data sources. This situation, compounded by the dearth of scientific literature on policy analysis for easing restrictions, prompted a comprehensive search and analysis of all economic recovery plans. This examination facilitated a discussion on the objectivity and parameterization that underpinned government agencies' decisions regarding the relaxation of social isolation measures in individual states.
The objective of this study was to analyze the strategies implemented by the governments of the Brazilian federative units, focusing on the indicators outlined in the normative guidelines that informed the reopening of activities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This research aims to provide public managers with a scientific foundation to navigate the intricate decision-making process associated with easing social isolation measures.
The documentary research was conducted from May to July 2020. An active search was carried out on electronic websites, including official journals and government webpages of Brazilian federative units (FUs), to identify official publications pertaining to the normative acts that provided guidance for resuming activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
A structured and standardized script, developed using Microsoft Office Excel® software version 16.0, was utilized for data collection and made accessible for cloud computing. Prior to data collection, a training session was conducted to calibrate the active search process. Following data extraction, a double-check procedure was implemented, with one author reviewing their records and a second author verifying the accuracy of the data.
A pilot study was conducted to test the script and search strategy, involving three teachers and six students from the Medicine and Nursing courses at the Federal University of Piauí (UFPI). Data collection was carried out by the participants after receiving theoretical, conceptual, and methodological guidance provided during weekly research meetings.
The sample comprised documents that met all the inclusion criteria simultaneously, including structured content based on epidemiological and health indicators defined by the WHO, legal validity during the data collection period, an official character attributed to the state level of government, a clear definition of the theoretical-conceptual and methodological framework for economic reopening during the pandemic, a proposed economic reopening agenda, and availability in the public domain. Exclusion criteria involved documents with unavailable full texts and those from unofficial sources.
The data analysis was conducted through a series of sequential steps. Firstly, a pre-reading phase was undertaken to grasp the overall structure of the documents and ensure alignment with the eligibility criteria. This was followed by a selective reading process aimed at determining the document type, the team responsible for its creation, and the incorporation of epidemiological and health indicators. Subsequently, a categorization stage was implemented to group the indicators based on qualitative similarities. Finally, a detailed descriptive and critical analysis of the data was carried out to draw meaningful insights from the information gathered.
The study focused on examining specific criteria including the type of document (such as a reopening plan, technical norm, or decree), the composition of the document creation team (comprising technicians, researchers, or teachers), and the presence as well as the quantity of indicators outlined in the norms. Furthermore, the analysis delved into specific elements such as the source's particulars, the nature of indicators (whether quantitative or qualitative), the basis for calculations, and the parameters used for classifying risks.
Among the 27 federative units, only 18 have formalized reopening documents based on epidemiological and health indicators, while the states of the Federal District, Goiás, Paraná, Roraima, and Tocantins have not yet established official plans for resuming economic activities. Additionally, although Bahia, Pernambuco, Amapá, and Maranhão have government plans to ease social isolation measures, they were excluded from this analysis due to their municipal scope and the lack of clearly defined indicators.
The documents formulated in Bahia were only valid at the municipal level, indicating that plans of municipal scope may be insufficient to effectively manage public health epidemics due to the observed fragmentation and lack of coordination among the numerous cities. Amapá, Maranhão, and Pernambuco were excluded from analysis as their documents lacked clear and formalized indicators necessary to guide the decision-making process.
In the sample of 18, reopening plans, decrees, and technical notes were identified, as shown in Table 1. Among the states analyzed, Amazonas, Ceará, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Piauí, Rio de Janeiro, and Sergipe included health metrics for economic reopening in their official documents. Acre, Pará, Paraíba, Rondônia, Rio Grande do Sul, and São Paulo outlined epidemic monitoring indicators in both reopening plans and official decrees and technical notes. On the other hand, Alagoas, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio Grande do Norte, and Santa Catarina established monitoring indicators solely through decrees and technical notes. Notably, the remaining states (Amapá, Bahia, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Maranhão, Pernambuco, Paraná, Roraima, and Tocantins) produced documents that did not align with the study's inclusion criteria.
In the analysis of normatives from 18 states, it was found that eight states (Alagoas, Amapá, Ceará, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Norte, Rondônia, Santa Catarina, and Sergipe) did not provide information on the composition and competencies of their document creation teams (Table 2). On the other hand, documents from Piauí, Espírito Santo, and Pará elucidated the diverse structures of their teams, with Piauí and Espírito Santo consisting of technicians and researchers/teachers, while Pará included technicians, researchers/teachers, and community members. Additionally, seven states (Acre, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Paraíba, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo) were found to have documents developed by technical teams comprising employees from state health departments.
The indicators outlined in the research article's documentary database were categorized as simple or composite, with the latter referring to the combination of two or more simple indicators. Among the normative frameworks examined, eight states utilized composite indicators: Espírito Santo, Pará, Piauí, Rio Grande do Sul, and São Paulo employed two indicators each; Alagoas and Acre utilized three; and Santa Catarina employed four. The most commonly recurring composite criteria focused on the disease's transmission and the capacity to address the state's healthcare system.
Most indicators, however, were utilized in isolation without being interconnected to the structuring of compound criteria. Additionally, the majority of documents (83.33%) incorporated up to seven simple indicators for decision-making purposes. Based on the count of simple indicators outlined in Table 3, the federative units were categorized into classes.
In this study, the indicators were categorized into five major groups based on specific characteristics: disease frequency and distribution, social and collective adherence, installed capacity/assistance profile, productive potential, and availability of inputs. These groups were visually represented and described in Figure 1, each designated with geometric symbols. The figure illustrates the territorial distribution of these parameters by mapping the presence of health indicators against normative bases and surveyed categories. A comprehensive breakdown of the indicators for each federation unit is provided in Supplementary Table 1.
During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, social isolation and activity restrictions were implemented haphazardly, lacking clear guidelines regarding the severity of measures based on the epidemiological status. Moreover, there was a notable absence of regulations concerning the eventual easing of isolation measures and the resumption of activities.
The absence of a cohesive strategic definition at the national level poses a significant challenge, as the process of easing restrictions is inherently more complex than their initial implementation. Public managers are tasked with the formidable responsibility of devising comprehensive strategies for reopening economic sectors, maintaining contingency measures to curb virus transmission, and fostering consensus and cooperation among the populace, business leaders, and policymakers.
The approach taken in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection through policies in Brazil has been marked by conflicting strategies between state and federal governments, creating challenges for a considerable segment of the population to comply with WHO guidelines on hygiene, respiratory etiquette, social distancing, isolation, and quarantine, alongside specific restrictive actions. The intervention of the Brazilian Supreme Court played a crucial role in affirming the independence of states and municipalities in decision-making processes, thereby addressing and potentially overriding contentious measures implemented by the federal government.
As of April, the majority of federative units utilized their granted autonomy to devise organized strategies for the resumption of economic activities due to the lack of a national policy to coordinate actions among states and municipalities. However, this process unfolded in a decentralized and fragmented fashion, resulting in the official release of plans, decrees, ordinances, and technical norms that exhibited a wide range of diverse characteristics.
As revealed in this study, out of the 27 Brazilian federative units, only 18 have put forth plans for resuming economic activities that are grounded in epidemiological and health indicators. This discrepancy raises questions regarding the criteria employed by the remaining nine federative units. These units either lacked formal reopening strategies altogether, implemented them only at the municipal level, or did so without adhering to clear and objective indicators.
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the formalization of guidelines is crucial for supporting the efforts of public managers and assisting in managing the expectations of the population. It is essential for the population to understand and adhere to the criteria employed by governments in making decisions regarding economic and social sectors, as these decisions have a direct impact on individuals' quality of life.
Moreover, the implementation of an official plan that is transparent, widely communicated to society, and equipped with explicit, easily comprehensible criteria is crucial in mitigating the impact of vested interests that could potentially sway governmental decisions. Hence, the incorporation of objective metrics is indispensable for the efficacy of governmental initiatives and, more importantly, for their equitable and democratic implementation, grounded in scholarly research and primarily focused on enhancing the welfare of the populace.
In the 18 states that have implemented economic recovery strategies, epidemiological and health indicators have been utilized as key determinants for assessing the flexibility, permanence, or potential regression to earlier phases of reopening the economy. The majority of these indicators have focused on aspects such as the prevalence and spread of the disease, as well as the operational capacity and support capabilities of the healthcare system. This approach demonstrates a partial alignment with the criteria outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) for informing public policy decisions regarding the easing of restrictions.
While some Brazilian states partially meet the criteria outlined by WHO 49, the majority have not implemented specific policies to effectively screen, monitor, and enhance the testing of suspected cases. Among the states assessed, only Pará, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Santa Catarina have shown some indicators related to these categories, albeit in a limited manner. Notably, only Pará provided details on the metrics used to calculate the indicators. This discovery is crucial because without a focused approach by the public health surveillance system, the reopening strategies may proceed in a context that does not accurately reflect the epidemiological situation of the state.
Another prevalent issue identified was the lack of transparency regarding the composition of the document development teams. Merely ten plans provided a detailed account of the professional backgrounds of the authors, predominantly comprising technicians. The involvement of researchers and educators in the formulation of these documents was either minimal or entirely unreported, with exceptions noted in the cases of Espírito Santo and Piauí. Community engagement was only mentioned in the context of Pará. Consequently, the inadequacy of coordination efforts in crafting these plans may pose significant challenges in fostering public awareness and participation, suggesting a disconnect between the scientific community and the policy development process.
The variation in the number of simple indicators adopted by each state ranged significantly from 2 to 11, yet this should not be the sole basis for assessing the effectiveness of state plans. Notably, detailed and structured plans with varying indicator counts were observed, such as São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, which respectively had 5 and 11 indicators. Apart from formalized government measures, certain plan components indicate more effective pandemic response strategies, including the incorporation of parameters for monitoring testing policies, the establishment and review of indicator cutoff points, careful delineation of criteria for transitioning between flexibilization phases, and the implementation of a regionalized policy framework. This regional approach enables resource management and the adjustment of measure stringency based on the prevailing epidemiological conditions at both micro and macro levels.
The analysis conducted in this study, while comprehensive, falls short of delving into the internal management processes, the diverse strategies implemented to combat the pandemic, and the shared responsibility of other governmental entities in influencing the outcomes. Consequently, it is imperative that the current analysis not be utilized as a definitive assessment of governmental administrations' efficacy but rather as a framework for evaluating the objectivity, lucidity, and openness of the recovery plans put forth by the individual Brazilian federated units under scrutiny.
Based on the aforementioned data and in consideration of the study's objective, it can be inferred that the normative foundation of Brazilian states exhibited variability in terms of structure and attributes due to the lack of a cohesive national policy to coordinate efforts among the various states. The implementation of disparate policies across different governmental tiers led to the dominance of state-formulated plans that fragmented the process of easing restrictions.
The lack of a centralized database that consolidates the strategies implemented by each state and facilitates comparisons poses challenges to public management. While numerous states have introduced reopening plans with well-defined indicators related to virus transmission and healthcare system capacity, crucial aspects such as testing and regionalized measures have not been adequately emphasized. This deficiency in planning for economic recovery has resulted in subpar plans that lack transparency, potentially leading to haphazard decision-making that undermines democratic principles and puts both the public and administrators at risk.
