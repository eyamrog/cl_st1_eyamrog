The World Health Organization has declared the new coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of pandemic proportions. This declaration has prompted governments worldwide to implement protective measures, including city lockdowns, travel bans, restrictions on group gatherings and public events, and the promotion of social distancing. Consequently, numerous health and exercise training facilities, along with cardiac rehabilitation services, have been forced to close. These stringent restrictions are significantly disrupting the daily activities of individuals across the globe.
While staying at home may help contain the spread of the virus, it inevitably leads to a reduction in regular physical activity and an increase in sedentary behavior, thereby heightening the risk of developing or exacerbating chronic conditions. Consequently, there exists compelling evidence supporting the importance of maintaining physical activity routines even amidst the ongoing pandemic crisis.
Cardiac rehabilitation is a crucial element in the continuum of care for individuals with cardiovascular disease. However, a significant issue lies in the fact that only a small proportion of patients who could benefit from such programs are actually referred to them. For instance, in the United Kingdom, less than 20% of patients discharged with heart failure receive referrals to cardiac rehabilitation. Similarly, in the United States, patient engagement in these programs remains low, with only 16.3% of Medicare patients and 10.3% of veterans participating after hospital discharge for conditions like myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The situation is not vastly different in Brazil, where access to cardiac rehabilitation programs also falls short of optimal levels.
There is a pressing demand for novel cardiac rehabilitation strategies that can effectively address current barriers such as geographical, logistical, cost-related, and access-related challenges. While home-based training is often recommended in situations where attending a cardiac rehabilitation facility is not feasible, many physicians hesitate to prescribe standalone exercises to cardiac patients. However, the European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention suggest that "home-based rehabilitation with or without telemonitoring shows promise in enhancing participation and facilitating behavioral changes." It is worth noting that Cochrane reviews have indicated that both home-based cardiac rehabilitation and traditional programs have comparable impacts on the quality of life of patients who have recently experienced a myocardial infarction or undergone coronary revascularization.
The American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation have recently released a scientific statement regarding home-based cardiac rehabilitation. This document emphasizes the importance of incorporating various interventions in cardiac rehabilitation programs, such as exercise training, dietary education, medication management, tobacco counseling, and psychosocial assessment.
It is crucial to emphasize the significance of conducting a thorough patient evaluation at the baseline to ensure accurate prescription of interventions. While cardiopulmonary exercise testing and physical examinations require in-person assessment, telemedicine could facilitate history taking remotely. It is essential to acknowledge that patients currently engaged in formal cardiac rehabilitation programs may not require alterations to their exercise prescriptions during the period of social distancing.
While severe cardiovascular events are infrequent during cardiac rehabilitation sessions, safety remains a paramount concern in both traditional rehabilitation facilities and remote programs. Therefore, in situations where physical distancing hinders thorough patient evaluation and risk assessment, it is advisable to prioritize light-intensity exercise. Additionally, remote cardiac rehabilitation should emphasize dietary education, medication management, tobacco counseling, and psychosocial assessment as key components that can be effectively delivered from a distance.
Hence, the prevailing evidence indicates the necessity of incorporating remote cardiac rehabilitation programs amidst the pandemic, as the potential dangers associated with sedentary behavior surpass those posed by carefully structured programs.
