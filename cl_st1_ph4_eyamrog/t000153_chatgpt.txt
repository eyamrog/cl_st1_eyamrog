This paper delves into the stigma surrounding abortion within the professional realm of service providers, specifically focusing on their integration into the Network of Healthcare Professionals for the Right to Decide. Established in Argentina towards the end of 2014 through a collaboration of women's and feminist organizations alongside healthcare professionals, this network serves as the backdrop for our exploratory, descriptive qualitative study. Spanning from 2016 to 2018, we conducted interviews with healthcare professionals to explore the interplay between abortion stigma and their membership within the Network. Findings reveal a shift in professionals' perceptions of abortion stigma upon joining a group characterized by shared objectives and professional homogeneity. They acknowledge a newfound confidence in resisting stigma, including negative self-perceptions of their work, fears of information disclosure, and disconnection from colleagues. This experience showcases the potential for professionals to actively combat stigmatization effects by asserting their professional identities.
In different contexts, individuals connected to abortion encounter stigma in diverse manifestations. This includes women and girls opting for abortion, individuals providing support, healthcare professionals, and pro-choice advocates, among others. Despite facing stigma, all these parties possess the capacity to resist or counteract such societal judgment.
The stigma associated with abortion is identified as a significant factor contributing to the negative consequences experienced by women, particularly in terms of delays in accessing the procedure (Fiala & Arthur, 2014). Within the realm of Social Sciences literature focusing on health, it has been established that the stigma surrounding abortion impacts how and where women seek care and who provides that care, highlighting the importance of recognizing and addressing this issue (Ganatra et al., 2017, p.2373). Scholars have emphasized the necessity of acknowledging and addressing stigma as a predictive factor in abortion safety and reproductive health outcomes, underscoring its role in morbidity and mortality risks (Ostrach, 2016, p.1).
When women and girls in Argentina seek legal abortion today, they encounter barriers stemming from professionals' attitudes towards abortion and the institutional culture. These barriers manifest in various ways: women receive unclear or incomplete information, or information not grounded in evidence; they face delays of different kinds; they must obtain a legal permit or navigate mediation by ethical committees; they undergo unnecessary medical examinations, among other obstacles hindering their access to abortion services.
The professionals' inadequate understanding of current legislation and attention protocols often results in significant legal violations, including the judicialization of women when they seek care for obstetric emergencies at healthcare facilities or the breach of medical confidentiality that providers are obligated to uphold.
In recent years, this situation has led to the criminal accusation of at least fifteen young and economically disadvantaged women, who have been accused of undergoing abortions (Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales, CELS, 2017). The prevalence of conscientious objection within healthcare institutions often extends to entire departments, posing a significant barrier to the provision of abortion services. The presence of healthcare professionals who are conscientious objectors not only perpetuates the stigma surrounding abortion but also reinforces the misconception that abortion is illegal (Fiala and Arthur, 2014; Morán Faúndes and Peñas Defagó, 2016).
The Penal Code of Argentina, established in 1921, outlines that abortion is not punishable if conducted to prevent risks to a woman's life or health, or in cases of rape. Despite this legal provision, the healthcare system has historically failed to offer abortion services, effectively creating a de facto total ban on the practice. This has led to a situation where many abortions are carried out clandestinely, despite the potential for inclusion under the causal model. Women and girls seeking non-punishable abortions often face pressure and privacy violations within public healthcare institutions. In response to these challenges, recent years have seen the development of collaborative strategies between women's movement activists and healthcare professionals in public institutions. Notably, the successful initiative known as the "Red de profesionales de la salud por el derecho a decidir" (Network of Healthcare Professionals for the Right to Decide) has emerged as a key player in this landscape. This article presents the research findings related to the Network's efforts and impact.
In our exploratory study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between abortion stigma and healthcare professionals within the Network. Through examining the narratives of these professionals, our goal was to gain insight into how healthcare providers perceive their connection to abortion stigma both before and after joining this group. Indicators of abortion stigma, such as a negative self-image regarding their work, concerns about confidentiality breaches, and societal disapproval of their profession, as well as a sense of isolation from their colleagues (O’Donnell, Weitz, Freedman, 2011), were considered in our analysis.
From 2015 to 2018, we conducted interviews with 13 healthcare providers residing in the province of Córdoba and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, encompassing general practitioners, gynecologists and obstetricians, clinical doctors, psychologists, and social workers. The research involved integrating insights from various professionals beyond the medical personnel's perspectives. Argentina's public health teams operate in an interdisciplinary manner, meaning that professionals with diverse specializations could participate in different stages of the abortion service delivery process.
The selection of interviewees was based on a non-probability sample design by purpose, utilizing chain-referral sampling or snowball sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in various settings, including workplaces, residences, and Network meetings, with some professionals participating in multiple meetings to enhance data collection. Each interview lasted approximately 40 minutes, with recordings and transcriptions facilitating subsequent analysis. To supplement the data, leaders from civil society and women's organizations were interviewed, and documents from various organizations, such as the National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe and Free Abortion, Catholics for the Right to Decide-Córdoba, and Women Rescuers Network, were reviewed. All interviewees were involved in the Network's formation, with additional interviews conducted with representatives from these organizations. The research project received approval from the Ethics Committee of the National Hospital of Clinics in Córdoba, Argentina. Verbal informed consent was obtained from each participant, emphasizing confidentiality and voluntary participation. Healthcare professionals and activists advocating for women's sexual and reproductive rights, all of legal age, willingly participated in the study. Prior to each interview, the informed consent was reviewed, ensuring anonymity and emphasizing the voluntary nature of participation. Personal data is securely stored and accessible only to the lead researcher, with all names changed to protect confidentiality. Consent details are documented in the interview recordings.
Based on prior studies (Drovetta, 2015a; 2015b), it has been posited that the stigma surrounding abortion serves as a significant barrier, alongside other factors, to accessing abortion services. This stigma specifically pertains to healthcare professionals who may fear repercussions if they assist women or girls in obtaining a non-punishable abortion.
At present, there is a dearth of qualitative research conducted at a regional level that provides insights into strategies aimed at eradicating the stigma associated with abortion. Building upon this deficiency, the primary objective of this study is to enhance understanding in this area by investigating, through the lens of professionals engaged in the field, the shifts in their perceptions of stigma upon their involvement in the Network. The focus of this article is to elucidate how actively engaging in one's role and advocating for their work serve as mechanisms of resistance against and elimination of the stigma surrounding abortion within the professional sphere.
The results obtained provide a foundation for further understanding of the phenomenon and suggest potential avenues for future research. Furthermore, this study sheds light on a professional organization's experience, which could serve as a model for others to replicate in diverse contexts.
Within the extensive body of English literature, numerous studies validate the fear experienced by abortion providers concerning the potential negative repercussions of disclosing their involvement in abortion procedures. These repercussions include discrediting from their peers and the exploitation they face, particularly from professionals who oppose abortion. Additionally, abortion providers articulate the psychosocial toll they endure individually, as they engage in "assistance" tasks that induce stress and both physical and emotional exhaustion. A consistent analytical thread across all research endeavors is the delineation of adverse impacts on the personal and/or professional lives of healthcare team members offering abortion services (Martin, Debbink, Hassinger, Youatt, 2014; Martin, Debbink, Hassinger, Youatt, Eagen-Torkko, Harris 2014; Norris, Steinberg, Kavanaugh, De Zordo, Becker 2011; Harris, Debbink, Martin, Hassinger 2011; O’Donnell, Weitz, Freedman 2011). Despite this, research on stigma and abortion in Latin America remains limited (Zamberlin 2015; Adesse, Bonnan, Silveira, Matos 2016). Over the past decade, studies have increasingly focused on elucidating the impact of stigma on women in the context of abortion under legal constraints (Palomino, Ramos, Davey, Guzmán, Carda y Bayer 2011; Galli y Sydow 2010; Shellenberg, Moore, Bankole, Juarez, Omideyi, Palomino, Zathar, Shingh, Tsui 2011; Vallejo, Botina, Gómez 2016), while other works delve into the repercussions of stigmatizing attitudes on healthcare professionals (De Zordo, 2012; Faúndes, Alves, Duarte, 2013; Vivas, Valencia, González, 2016).
Sociologist Ervin Goffman's groundbreaking research delves into the symbolic translation of personal attributes and their categorization in the formation of a "social identity." Goffman highlights how an attribute that is questioned at a specific juncture transforms into a stigma, characterized as a mark or fault, particularly prevalent in individuals deemed "uncommon" or possessing an "undesirable difference" (Goffman, 2008). He posits that this discrediting originates from a disparity between the virtual and real social identities that individuals are expected to uphold based on societal norms within various contexts. Goffman emphasizes that not all undesirable attributes are stigmatized, only those that deviate from the established stereotype of a particular individual (Goffman, 2006, p.132). While stigma is deeply discrediting for those affected, Goffman also notes that an attribute stigmatizing one individual can validate the normalcy of another, suggesting that stigma is context-dependent and relative to societal norms. The term "stigma" is viewed from a dual perspective: individuals are discredited when they believe their difference is already known or evident, while they are discreditable when they perceive their difference as hidden or not immediately perceptible to others (Goffman, 2006). In the latter scenario, the stigmatized attribute can remain concealed from external observers.
Goffman's concepts have been utilized to scrutinize various facets, encompassing healthcare institutions, their operations, and the doctor-patient interaction. Furthermore, they have been employed to elucidate the influence of illnesses on the subjective experiences of individuals afflicted by them.
In this study, we define abortion stigma as "the discrediting of individuals due to their association with abortion" (Norris et al., 2011, p.49), with a specific focus on how healthcare providers perpetuate it. To capture its complexities in real-world scenarios, stigma is conceptualized as a convergence of interconnected elements, encompassing the labeling of human differences, the formation of stereotypes linked to negative traits, the subsequent division between "us" and "them," and the ensuing disapproval, rejection, and discrimination facilitated by power dynamics that fuel its persistence (Link & Phelan, 2001; Phelan, Link & Dovidio, 2008). Stigmatization necessitates the exercise or access to social, economic, and political power, enabling the construction and perpetuation of difference through socially constructed categories (Link & Phelan, 2001). Power, therefore, plays a crucial role in upholding stigma.
Recent proposals suggest that it is crucial to delineate the structural impact of evidenced categories on defining the timing of experiencing or fearing stigma. This necessitates highlighting how an individual's stigma is shaped by the intersectionality of categories such as race/ethnicity, class, gender, age, and other diverse identities (Collins, Von Unger, Armbrister, 2008).
In contrast to studies that analyze stigma at an individual level, occupational stigma emerges when it impacts the job itself and its workers. Workers are often viewed as having chosen their professions voluntarily, leading to a perception of stigma as "controllable" (Kreiner, Ashforth, & Sluss, 2006, p.619). Within various contexts, the medical profession has attained a revered status, cultivated through the accumulation of significant symbolic capital over time. This capital can be jeopardized by revelations linking medical professionals to abortion practices. O’Donnell highlights that the fear of stigma extends to professionals involved in peri-abortion scenarios, including individuals participating in the abortion process indirectly, such as social workers, counselors, ultrasound technicians, and those overseeing patient recovery (O’Donnell, Weitz, & Freedman, 2011). Being labeled as an "abortionist" by colleagues carries a weight and stigma that can deeply unsettle professionals. Furthermore, professionals are concerned about protecting their accumulated symbolic capital within their families as well (Drovetta, 2015a). The stigma associated with abortion is evident through the diminished prestige attributed to the medical knowledge acquired in formal education. O’Donnell illustrates how individuals associated with abortion practices are often stereotyped as morally deficient, profit-driven, or technically incompetent "back-alley" practitioners (O’Donnell, Weitz, & Freedman, 2011, p.1358). Consequently, a stigmatized group can be defined as one whose identity or image challenges the full humanity of its members; in the eyes of others, these individuals and their group are seen as tainted, devalued, or flawed to varying degrees (Kreiner, Ashforth, & Sluss, 2006, p.620).
The significance of research pertaining to the stigma surrounding abortion among professionals is underscored by Kumar, Hessini, and Mitchell (2009) who argue that stigma plays a crucial role in pushing abortion out of mainstream practices and services offered by institutions, relegating it to secrecy and dissuading healthcare providers from engaging in any aspect of abortion care (Heilborn et al., 2012; O’Donnell, Weitz, Freedman, 2011). Consequently, what should be recognized as a fundamental aspect of medical practice is instead viewed as an aberration or rare occurrence, tainted by moral scrutiny.
In an effort to address the barriers to accessing non-punishable abortion in Argentina, the "National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe and Free Abortion," a coalition of over five hundred organizations and individuals engaged in advocacy since 2014, spearheaded the establishment of the Network of Healthcare Professionals for the Right to Decide. Initially conceived as a strategic initiative to provide support for individuals seeking abortion services in public institutions, this network aims to develop new tools that facilitate the realization of reproductive rights.
The establishment of the Network can be attributed to the collaborative efforts of civil and women's organizations that demonstrated a significant territorial presence and forged partnerships with local professionals. One notable organization involved in this initiative is "Catholics for the Right to Decide", which had been actively engaged in educational and awareness-raising activities for over ten years before the Network was officially formed.
The Network of professionals was established at the end of 2014 as an interdisciplinary space encompassing gynecologists, obstetricians, clinical doctors, nurses, social workers, and psychologists working within the public sphere. This interdisciplinary approach is a notable strength, as it avoids pigeonholing abortion as the exclusive domain of a single specialization, instead highlighting the collaborative role of all healthcare specialists within a team. The diverse range of specializations present helps shield professionals with lower symbolic capital, such as psychologists, social workers, and nurses, from heightened stigmatization when engaging in abortion-related care. Symbolic capital, defined as the legitimate recognition of different forms of capital, confers advantages to those who possess it (Costa, 2015, p.2). Noteworthy within the Network are numerous general practitioners, whose community health specialization equips them to focus on preventive health measures under the Primary Healthcare Service Program (APS). This emphasis on prevention is crucial, given the increasing number of non-punishable abortions being conducted at the primary care level using misoprostol in an outpatient setting (Amnesty International, 2017).
The Network's proposal, as outlined in its foundational charter (Carta Pública 2015), diverges significantly from traditional medical corporations or hegemonic medicine, offering fresh perspectives on abortion as a health issue. Consequently, the Network aims to introduce novel practices that can eventually be integrated into the institutional culture as the new norm. However, the question arises: who defines what is considered normal? Establishing a sense of normalcy poses a formidable challenge for the Network, yet it has successfully fostered a sense of solidarity among members, creating a shared experience of "there-are-others-like-me."
"In addition to healthcare providers who are conscientious objectors, there are also those who provide abortion services and support women's sexual and reproductive rights. It is essential to acknowledge and understand the existence of both perspectives within the healthcare system." (Interview with a female physician in Buenos Aires, September 2016).
Abortion, a prevalent issue, is often overlooked despite its frequency. It implicates the healthcare system and medical professionals, with many women turning to it for resolution. This sentiment was echoed by a female general practitioner during an interview conducted in Córdoba in July 2016.
Finding a professional community that normalizes their work can have a significant impact on mitigating the vulnerability associated with stigma (O’Donnell, Weitz, Freedman, 2011). A female professional emphasized this point by stating, "if the so-called abortionists, meaning ourselves, number 300 and publicly advocate for women's right to abortion, we cannot be all that bad... this is what 'common sense' dictates" (S. female, social worker. Interview, Córdoba, August 2017), underscoring the value of a collective affirmation of their work.
By 2017, the Network comprised approximately 800 professionals. Its main objective is to ensure practical access for women and girls to non-punishable abortions through the provision of Legal Interruption of Pregnancy services (medical or surgical abortions) in public healthcare facilities nationwide. Consequently, the members of the Network are recognized as providers of Legal Interruption of Pregnancy services within their respective institutions.
Members of the Network openly display their affiliation and actively engage in occupying public spaces, whether through participating in demonstrations that mark important dates for the feminist movement or attending national meetings of the organization. These activities align with their advocacy for pro-choice causes.
The Network is continuously expanding, thereby increasing its territorial reach. The extensive geographical dispersion of its members plays a crucial role in ensuring widespread access to abortion services. Some Network members operate in remote rural areas, isolated regions, indigenous communities, and among campesinos, where the availability of Legal Interruption of Pregnancy services at public institutions holds significant symbolic importance within the community.
To broaden its reach, the Network could leverage social media platforms such as Facebook to articulate its stance on contemporary issues like abortion, gender violence, and obstetric violence. Furthermore, the Network appears to engage with non-members by disseminating messages to a wider audience.
Understanding the legality and necessity of abortion being performed in a hospital posed a challenge for the interviewee, a female social worker from Buenos Aires. She acknowledged the numerous barriers that need to be navigated daily in this context. However, she emphasized the importance of aligning one's actions with both the prevailing laws and personal beliefs, highlighting the significance of belief in one's actions.
Individuals who become part of the organization undergo a process that publicly declares their support for legal abortion, thereby making their stance on the issue known. Conversely, those who choose not to join the Network face the potential stigma of being perceived as professionals who exploit women's reproductive needs for financial gain.
When health systems incorporate network professionals, there is a greater likelihood that these professionals will be influenced by their peers, including their actions, opinions, and public declarations as providers of abortion services. This influence creates a symbolic impact within the institutions and health teams in which they operate, as well as at a community level due to their visibility. Simultaneously, efforts are made to shift public opinion regarding the legitimacy of the demand for Legal Interruption of Pregnancy.
In our interactions with colleagues from the Network and legal professionals, we gradually realized our collective involvement in addressing issues surrounding abortion, a realization that had previously eluded us. Despite our efforts to contribute from our medical standpoint, we lacked the necessary organization and understanding of the needs of those on the other side of the table. The counseling sessions have since rectified this, offering a structured approach to our individual practices. This shift in approach was articulated by P. male, a clinical doctor, during interviews conducted in Córdoba in September 2018.
Increasing the number of providers openly offering abortion services can contribute to shifting the negative perception associated with these professionals. This endeavor also involves engaging other professionals to participate. By establishing a visible presence within society, it becomes possible to pave the way for future progress, fostering enhanced legitimacy and garnering greater social support for the Network.
The establishment of the Network was driven by the professionals' recognition of the necessity to reassess the role of healthcare providers in addressing the needs of women facing unplanned pregnancies. It became apparent that there was a lack of specific training during the pre-professional stage, essential for offering assistance within the public health system to women and girls in abortion situations. While the workers displayed a willingness to provide solutions, they lacked knowledge about available tools such as medical abortion and were unaware of the normative and legal advancements related to abortion provision as highlighted in studies by Drovetta (2015a, 2015b). Noteworthy among these advancements are the Action Protocols in the Guide for the Improvement of Post Abortion Care (2005), the Guide for Non-Punishable Abortion Integral Care (2010), and the Protocol for Integral Care of People with the Right to a Legal Interruption of Pregnancy in Argentina (2015), all developed by the Ministry of Health of Argentina.
Within the Network, there was a notable promotion of debates surrounding official documents concerning abortion provision from the Ministry of Health. Simultaneously, legal training sessions were organized by lawyers to disseminate knowledge on alternative interpretations of criminal law, alongside insights into successful public health system practices from countries like Colombia and Spain. This interdisciplinary approach involved collaborations with lawyers and legal professionals, with feminist women lawyers taking a prominent role in challenging conservative hegemony within the legal sphere, particularly concerning sexual and reproductive rights discussions. Essentially, the dissemination of legal information and institutional protocols within the Network empowered members to enhance their professional capabilities in abortion-related practices, utilizing tools endorsed by the State. These initiatives underscore the benefits of participating in a space that facilitates professional growth and skill development.
Every professional meeting presents an opportunity to exchange and analyze diverse experiences stemming from the care provided in doctors' offices nationwide. Through this information sharing, a consensus was reached on the importance of addressing the demand for safe abortions. This involves pre and post-abortion counseling sessions conducted within the professionals' workspaces in the Network. While the specifics of these sessions may vary based on contextual factors and available resources, they are uniformly grounded in a risk and harm reduction approach to mitigate the adverse effects of abortion practices in regions with restrictive laws (Briozzo, Labandera, Gorgoroso, Pons, 2007). In practical terms, these sessions involve providing evidence-based information on medication for abortion, issuing prescriptions for drugs obtainable at pharmacies, and scheduling a post-abortion ultrasound check-up two weeks later. The subsequent phase is more intricate, necessitating access to financial means for purchasing Misoprostol, a patented medication commonly used off-label for self-induced abortions. Additional requirements may include a suitable physical environment for the procedure, a supportive network, and the ability to recognize warning signs indicative of obstetric emergencies.
Current proposals demonstrate the potential for addressing stigma through a range of cognitive, affective, and behavioral strategies at both individual and collective levels (Kreiner, Ashforth, & Sluss, 2006, p. 619). Ashforth and Kreiner emphasize the significance of embracing a toolkit that fosters robust identification with one's job, alongside constructing a conceptual framework that provides adequate justification and meaning to one's chosen work. This framework aligns with the belief in the significance of the tasks undertaken and the necessity for their completion (1999).
The proposals stemming from studies conducted by organizations and the work they have undertaken have documented how, in the face of discrediting circumstances, the collective actions of certain actors serve as a means of resisting stigmatizing attitudes.
The findings of our study align with previous research. Professionals emphasize the benefits of being part of the Network, as indicated by the results of our current investigation. Primarily, their feedback underscores how collaborating with peers fosters a sense of belonging for individuals who share similar career paths. Additionally, it is evident that a shared perception of a common challenge enhances unity among members, as noted by Ashforth and Kreiner (1999), and aids in the cultivation of a robust professional culture.
Among the professionals interviewed, there is a prevailing notion that engaging in performing an abortion or being involved in its provision would expose them to the risk of being perceived as the discredited individual described by Goffman (2008, p.14-16).
"We initially embarked on this journey independently, engaging in conversations with women to educate them on the correct usage of Misoprostol, the signs they needed to be aware of, and the expected outcomes. Subsequently, we discovered a network of individuals within our office who were also involved in similar activities, although this was not openly discussed in public settings" (A. female, clinical doctor. Interview, Buenos Aires, October 2018).
Taking this into consideration, initially, they opted not to publicly engage in counseling work related to abortion, which they conduct in their offices and is safeguarded by the duty of confidentiality. However, upon joining the Network, their self-perception regarding their role prevents them from viewing themselves as discredited. Instead, they acknowledge that they are not breaching any norms and emphasize that becoming part of the group has brought about a significant transformation in their professional lives.
Research indicates that stigma indicators, such as negative self-perception of their work, fear of information disclosure and detachment from colleagues, and the apprehension of open disapproval of their profession (O’Donnell, Weitz, Freedman, 2011), are notably absent within the Network's members. These abortion service providers do not view their work as inherently sinful, dirty, or tainted (Hughes, 1958). These perceptions are recognized as socially constructed, historically contingent attributions that they acknowledge but have not internalized. They emphasize the importance of building stronger professional relationships, which involve the potential for sharing with peers the nature of their work, as strategies to combat the interpersonal disconnect stemming from abortion stigma (Martin, Debbink, Hassinger, Youatt, 2014).
The issue of stigma has been a topic of discussion within our team for some time. We recently convened a meeting to delve into this matter further, as some members expressed a desire to address it and learn from others' experiences in handling similar situations, particularly in disclosing their work to family and acquaintances. Personally, my family is fully informed about my involvement in legal pregnancy terminations. Over time, other team members have also gradually disclosed their roles to their own circles, facilitated by the Network's support in advocating for increased visibility. This insight was shared by M., a female general practitioner, during an interview conducted in Córdoba in June 2017.
The significance healthcare providers place on women's organizations as crucial allies in their work cannot be overstated. These providers often highlight the collaborative strategies developed in partnership with these organizations, specifically targeting the needs of low-income women seeking safe abortion services.
Many feminist women have formed strong bonds to acquire and distribute Misoprostol, assisting other women in accessing it as well. Collaborating became essential as the involvement of a doctor in the post-abortion care process is crucial. Initially feeling isolated, unsure of how to address the specific needs of impoverished women navigating abortion alone, the individual sought out a feminist activist for guidance. This activist and her group were instrumental in providing support where the individual felt powerless. In interviews, such as the one conducted with F. female, a clinical doctor in Córdoba in October 2017, the importance of collective action and support in ensuring access to safe abortion care is emphasized. The members of the Network advocate for humanizing the experience of abortion, challenging stereotypes and negative perceptions associated with the procedure. They view abortion as a fundamental right that demands unwavering dedication and commitment.
During my specialization practicum, I observed a doctor attending to a woman during childbirth at the hospital. Witnessing the treatment she received left me in a state of shock; as a student, I felt powerless to intervene. This experience led me to initially decide against pursuing obstetrics. However, I later found myself providing abortion services as a means of combating the prevalent injustices. In my view, practicing medicine allows me to contribute towards rectifying the mistreatment that women often face within healthcare systems. This sentiment was expressed by L., a female clinical doctor, during interviews conducted in Córdoba in November 2018.
"I firmly believe that my stance is not rooted in a sense of superiority or exceptional tolerance; rather, it is grounded in the recognition that access to abortion is a fundamental right enshrined in the law. It is imperative that women are able to exercise this right without hindrance. As an OB/GYN doctor, my role is to serve as a conduit for women seeking solutions to their reproductive health issues, a responsibility that the State is obligated to support and uphold" (M. male, OB/GYN doctor. Interview, Córdoba, October 2018).
The professionals' reports highlight the idea that assisting women, referred to by O’Donnel as a "redemptive quality of the job" (O’Donnell, Weitz, Freedman 2011), serves to validate a decision made not for financial gain, countering the common stereotype that clandestine abortion providers are solely motivated by profit. Embracing the value and necessity of their work becomes a means of justifying their role and combating the associated stigma. By actively engaging in resistance and transformation of negative perceptions, these healthcare providers enhance their capacity to mitigate vulnerability in the context of stigmatization.
In this study, our aim was to broadly characterize the practices embraced by the members of the "Network of Healthcare Professionals for the Right to Decide." Through our research, we aimed to investigate, from the professionals' own perspectives, the primary shifts they have encountered in their perception of abortion stigma since becoming part of the organization.
These reports have demonstrated the efficacy of resisting stigmatization by actively engaging with professional identity. This has translated into enhanced opportunities for women and girls to receive support from a Network professional for accessing non-punishable abortions in public institutions. Additionally, this active involvement has facilitated the implementation of pre and post-abortion counseling services in numerous healthcare facilities nationwide.
The establishment of the Network can be attributed to the successful navigation of challenges by the group and its members, culminating in a departure from obscurity. The gathered reports demonstrate a profound comprehension of the repercussions of being silenced, a phenomenon that often results in isolation and the perpetuation of social devaluation. Membership in the Network bolsters professional identity by fostering mutual support among professionals and working towards the collective objective of combatting potential discrediting experiences.
This research article highlights the importance of conducting research focused on analyzing the outcomes of the local alliance formed between feminist organizations, grassroots groups, and healthcare providers dedicated to sexual and reproductive rights. The establishment of this network stemmed from an initiative led by feminist activists who had already initiated collaborations with healthcare professionals, recognizing the necessity of their inclusion in efforts aimed at immediate improvements in the conditions surrounding the provision of safe abortions. Some sectors of local activism acknowledge that achieving social acceptance for legal abortion requires the active involvement of healthcare professionals. While the formation of coalitions may not entirely eradicate clandestine abortions, they represent a gradual process of transformation unfolding within the tangible experiences of women. These coalitions also play a crucial role in fostering cultural shifts related to attitudes towards abortion practices.
