The global landscape has undergone a profound transformation, a sentiment often deemed trite yet increasingly acknowledged by scientists and policymakers worldwide. While events like the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks evoked a similar sense of upheaval, the current state of affairs surpasses any prior experience. Even with the eventual development and distribution of a dependable vaccine for COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the specter of a potential future outbreak looms large. This lingering apprehension, rooted in the possibility of a more virulent and lethal contagion, is poised to endure in our collective consciousness and be inherited by generations to come.
The human species has grappled with viruses throughout its existence, yet the peculiar aspect of the current situation lies in our disregard for the early warnings in recent decades indicating that such a catastrophe was imminent. Noteworthy instances include the Marburg virus (MARV) outbreaks in Germany (1967, originating from primates imported from Uganda) and Angola (2005); the severe acute respiratory syndrome â€“ SARS (2002-2004), initially in Asia but subsequently spreading globally; the influenza or swine flu pandemic (2009); the occurrences of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, in 2012, 2015, and 2018); and the alarming Ebola outbreak in West Africa (2014-2016), among others that have garnered significant attention (further details available on the World Health Organization's website*).
There have been influential world leaders who have highlighted the threat posed by viruses, with Bill Gates being one notable figure. In a TED talk available on YouTube, the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation dismissed nuclear war as the greatest global peril, contrary to popular belief. Gates emphasized the potential devastating consequences of a highly infectious virus, asserting that the world was ill-prepared for such an event. This impactful presentation, delivered five years ago, remains relevant and timely in its warning about the dangers of viral outbreaks.
Countries worldwide are grappling with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, a crisis for which most were ill-prepared. The prevailing strategy, commonly referred to as "flattening the curve," aims to mitigate the spread of the virus by reducing the daily influx of new cases. By delaying the rate of infection, healthcare systems can better equip themselves to handle the crisis and potentially lower fatality rates, as noted by Kenyon (in press). While some nations have achieved relative success in implementing these measures, others face a bleaker outlook. Presently, Brazil is confronted with an alarming death toll nearing 12,000 attributed to COVID-19, with infection rates soaring. The current tally of over 170,000 confirmed cases is expected to surpass the one million mark imminently, a figure that may already be significantly higher due to widespread belief in substantial underreporting. Acknowledging the dearth of reliable data, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has conceded the country's lack of clarity regarding the true extent of the virus's impact. It is worth noting that the issue of inadequate data is not unique to Brazil alone.
Skepticism is prevalent in Brazil as the federal government's actions have faced harsh criticism, as noted in The Lancet (2020). The current situation prompts reflection on the deforestation of the Amazon, highlighting how wildlife can potentially harbor unknown pathogens that pose risks of human infection, as discussed by Val (2020), with outcomes that are difficult to predict. Despite this awareness, effective preventive measures have not been widely implemented. On the contrary, official reports indicate that illegal logging in the Amazon region is at an all-time high.
It is arguable that the prevailing priorities of most countries continue to heavily emphasize achieving rapid monetary growth, with the economy taking precedence over other critical issues such as the environment and public health. This suggests a pervasive societal ailment akin to acute myopia, where key decision-makers fail to recognize that investing in scientific research is crucial for averting and managing pandemics, as well as promoting overall social and economic progress. Those leaders who have acknowledged this reality are faring better in their responses to crises like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the value of a proactive approach to science-based solutions for the benefit of their populations.
Several researchers are concerned about the unpredictable nature of when the next virus may transition from wildlife to humans and the potential societal impacts. It is crucial that non-human animals are not unfairly scapegoated, as has occurred in the past. Preparation for such scenarios hinges on a comprehensive understanding of the basic biology of new organisms and our susceptibility to any pathogens they may harbor (Fauci et al., 2020). The evolving landscape poses significant challenges for scientists, a reality that is likely to intensify in the aftermath of the current pandemic (Andreote, 2018). Brazil, in particular, faces the added burden of managing other viruses like dengue (Colonetti et al., 2018) and zika, which are actively spreading to other regions in South America (Bayona-Pacheco et al., 2019).
The global landscape is poised to undergo a significant transformation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A critical question that emerges is whether policymakers worldwide will elevate the importance of investing in scientific endeavors. It is imperative to consider whether the tragic loss of millions of lives to various viruses over the years, accentuated by the current crisis, will catalyze a reevaluation of investment priorities. Ideally, there could be a reallocation of financial resources away from the development of weaponry and military infrastructure towards the enhancement of scientific research facilities. This shift could potentially lead to a deeper comprehension of the natural world, ultimately benefiting our societies in profound ways. Such a transition remains a hopeful aspiration for a brighter future.
