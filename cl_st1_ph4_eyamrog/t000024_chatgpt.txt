The study focused on the simultaneous relocation strategy of bromeliads, specifically Aechmea distichantha Lem. and Wittrockia cyathiformis (Vell.) Leme, in epiphytic and terricolous forms within the Montane Dense Ombrophilous Forest of Parque Estadual da Cantareira, São Paulo State, Brazil. These bromeliads were rescued from deforested areas caused by highway construction and were transplanted onto tree trunks, pitchforks, or directly into the soil. After a year, A. distichantha exhibited a 100% survival rate when transplanted in terricolous form and 83.33% in epiphytic form, while W. cyathiformis showed a 60% survival rate in both relocation forms. The findings suggest that both bromeliad species can be effectively relocated as epiphytes or terricolous plants. Direct relocation to the ground is recommended for practicality, especially in cases where suitable trees with forks at low heights are scarce, making manual fixing without equipment challenging.
The removal of vegetation cover for road work can lead to a decline in plant biodiversity, necessitating mitigation measures to minimize this impact (Stumpf et al., 2008). One proposed solution is the relocation of plant species removed from the construction site to conservation areas where these species naturally occur (Araújo, 2006). Scholars such as Primack (2008), Guardia et al. (2021), and Suzuki et al. (2021) have emphasized the importance of transplanting species from areas designated for vegetation removal to suitable relocation sites, a practice also advocated by Jasper et al. (2005) and Duarte & Gandolfi (2013), particularly in protected areas (Santos Júnior & Tamaki, 2014).
Studies have highlighted the pivotal role of Bromeliaceae species among epiphytes in their native ecosystems, emphasizing their ecological significance and potential for relocation (Jasper et al., 2005; Duarte & Gandolfi, 2013). Certain morphological features of bromeliads, like the leaf bases overlapping to create cisterns or phytotelmata, provide shelter and store water and nutrients, serving as vital resources for small animals (Benzing, 2000). Research by Stuntz et al. (2002) has shown that the evaporation of water from these bromeliad cisterns can alter the behavior and niche distribution of tree-dwelling fauna, thereby influencing microclimate conditions in the canopy and promoting lower temperatures in the surrounding area. Additionally, bromeliads contribute to the ecosystem by providing flowers, fruits, and nectar, as documented by Benzing (2004) and Cestari (2009).
The Bromeliaceae genera exhibit various life habits in their natural environment, including epiphytes, rupicolous, saxicolous, terricolous, and facultatives, capable of thriving on both the ground and trees (Fischer & Araújo, 1995). These genera are recognized as a crucial functional group within tropical forests (Barrancos et al., 2016). The ability to adapt to diverse conditions is essential for their survival post-relocation from their original habitat. When relocated as epiphytes, bromeliad specimens are typically affixed to tree forks using cotton strings (Jasper et al., 2005). However, over time, these specimens may become inclined in relation to the trunk axis, potentially compromising their survival by disrupting water storage in the cistern, leading to water stress and eventual plant collapse onto the ground (Freitas et al., 1998). Consequently, directly relocating them to the ground in an upright position could ensure greater rosette stability, particularly in larger bromeliads. This stabilized rosette would enhance the accumulation of rainwater and nutrients between the leaves, which can be absorbed by the plant or utilized by associated fauna (Benzing, 2000).
The absence of trees with pitchforks at a height of approximately 2 meters, which would facilitate manual fixation without the need for equipment, must be taken into account when considering the relocation of epiphytic bromeliads directly onto the ground, as larger pitchforks are typically found in the canopy of tall trees. If the survival of epiphytic species in soil is viable over an extended period, direct relocation to the ground could offer greater practicality, ensuring the continuity of their growth by generating shoots and inflorescences (Araújo, 2006). In terms of pollination, Varassin and Sazima (2000) observed hummingbirds such as Phaethornis eurynome and Ramphodon naevius pollinating bromeliads in the lower strata of the forest. Therefore, the translocation of bromeliads to the ground as opposed to high tree elevations may not impact the pollination of the transplanted species. For instance, Nidularium rubens, a ground-dwelling species, is visited by P. eurynome (Machado & Semir, 2006).
Numerous epiphytic bromeliad species have been observed to absorb nutrients not only through their aerial parts but also through their roots (Nievola & Mercier, 1996), showcasing efficient growth in nurseries for commercial potting with a substrate (Negrelle et al., 2011). Consequently, relocating them to the ground could prove to be a viable strategy. Previous studies have demonstrated success in relocating bromeliads in soil, on tree trunks, or in both conditions within the same community, irrespective of their life strategy (Freitas et al., 1998; Benzing, 2000; Araújo, 2006). Nevertheless, no research has yet compared the effectiveness of simultaneously relocating bromeliads as epiphytes on trees and as terricolous plants within the same crown projection area of a single tree. Such a comparison could enable the relocation of a larger number of specimens on the same day, streamlining the process in the field and reducing labor and operational costs.
In Brazil, Aechmea distichantha Lem. is found in the Cerrado and Atlantic Rainforest regions across various states including Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso do Sul (Forzza et al. 2010, Faria et al. 2022). Wittrockia cyathiformis (Vell.) Leme, on the other hand, is present in the Atlantic Rainforest spanning from Minas Gerais to Santa Catarina, at altitudes ranging from 750 to 1,900 meters (Wanderley et al. 2007). Both bromeliads exhibit a facultative habit and rely on bird pollination (Cestari 2009). A. distichantha is classified as a vulnerable species by Martinelli et al. (2008) and as least concern by Faria et al. (2022), while W. cyathiformis is considered an endemic species (Martinelli et al. 2008, Tardivo 2022). A. distichantha blooms year-round, whereas W. cyathiformis flowers from April to June and then again from August to December (Wanderley et al. 2007). These two species were rescued during deforestation linked to the construction of the Mário Covas Highway project in São Paulo, Brazil, which commenced in 2013.
This study seeks to assess the concurrent translocation of the bromeliads A. distichantha and W. cyathiformis, which were rescued from an area affected by road construction, to a nearby Montane Dense Ombrophilous Forest region in order to alleviate the consequences of deforestation. These particular species were chosen due to their prevalence in the deforested zone. The research has the potential to aid in mitigating the adverse effects of deforestation by facilitating the preservation of indigenous species and the safeguarding of genetic diversity. Furthermore, it offers insights into the advancement of cost-effective methodologies that can expedite and improve the success rate of Bromeliaceae colonization.
The plants were rescued from Section 4 in Arujá, São Paulo State, and São Paulo, São Paulo State, where vegetation suppression work was carried out due to the construction of the Rodoanel Mário Covas Trecho Norte, as documented in Guardia et al. (2021). The layout is illustrated in Figure 1a. The relocation site for the rescued plants was situated 4 km away from the suppression area (Figure 1b) (Google Earth 2022). The chosen relocation site was within the Montane Dense Ombrophilous Forest in Parque Estadual da Cantareira (PEC), São Paulo State, Brazil. PEC spans 7,916.52 ha and is recognized as one of the largest urban forests globally, serving as a significant forest remnant in the metropolitan region of São Paulo city. The area boasts numerous springs, and UNESCO has designated it as the Central Zone of the São Paulo City Green Belt Biosphere Reserve (São Paulo 2009). While most of the forest is in the middle stage of regeneration, there are also substantial stretches in advanced and mature stages (São Paulo 2009). The climate in this region is characterized as mesothermal and humid, with minimal rainfall deficits and water excess in summer (Cfb classification, Köppen 1948, Alvares et al. 2013). The average annual rainfall is 1,322 mm, with 229.8 mm in the rainiest month (January) and 31.7 mm in the least rainy month (August) (São Paulo 2009). The relocation area of the forest in this region exhibited 75% shading (Minipa® digital lux meter) on the Macuco Trail (23º24’29” S and 46º34’57” W). The temperature in this area ranged from 16.5 ºC (June and July) to 26 ºC (January and February), peaking above 32 ºC during the hottest months of relocation work (Figure 2). This temperature fluctuation mirrored that observed during the plant harvesting period (2013-2014), ranging from 15 ºC to 26 ºC, with temperatures exceeding 32 ºC in the hottest months, as per INMET 2022. The average annual rainfall during 2013-2014 was 1,322 mm.
The bromeliad species examined in this study were Aechmea distichantha Lem. (Figure 3a) and Wittrockia cyathiformis (Vell.) Leme (Figure 3b). Between 2013 and 2015, specimens of both species were salvaged during the clearance of vegetation for the development of the northern segment of the Mario Covas Highway in São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil. It is noteworthy that all the bromeliads retrieved were in the adult stage.
Plant harvesting - After deforestation, 60 adult individuals of both species residing on tree branches and soil were randomly harvested by fieldworkers, ensuring minimal mechanical damage to the root system. The collected plants were then mixed and transplanted into pots without distinction based on their original location on trunks or ground. These rescues were carried out by the research group at the Instituto de Botânica of São Paulo State, Brazil. Subsequently, the plants were cultivated in a substrate of Pinus composted bark and kept in a nursery covered with a high-density polyethylene black shade cloth providing 50% shading for a period ranging from six months to a year before relocation (see figures 3 a-b).
The plants of A. distichantha and W. cyathiformis used for relocation exhibited an average of 19.61 and 13.65 leaves, respectively, and displayed good phytosanitary conditions. The relocation took place in November 2015, during the peak rainfall period, in accordance with Lunelli et al.'s (2015) recommendation. Bromeliads were fixed onto trees using sisal string on their pitchforks or trunks, irrespective of the species, as noted by Jasper et al. (2005). Trained fieldworkers relocated the bromeliads, utilizing stairs to access higher pitchforks and trunks, ensuring secure fixation to prevent falls. Each plant was tagged with a numbered plastic tag. For terricolous relocation, bromeliads were removed from pots and transplanted within the same crown projection area of the tree where epiphytes were fixed. The plants were placed in holes made with a hoe, filled with soil, and compacted to secure them firmly in the ground. Thirty units of each species were relocated to soil simultaneously, with another 30 fixed onto tree trunks or pitchforks, totaling 60 bromeliads of each species. Aechmea distichantha plants were relocated as terricolous or epiphytic, while Wittrockia cyathiformis plants were relocated in both forms. The distribution of plants was random, mirroring the fieldwork conducted by technicians relocating rescued specimens, without distinguishing between reproductive or vegetative stages or considering size variations. The distribution of A. distichantha post-relocation was 20% (12 plants) and 21.7% (13 plants) in epiphytic and terrestrial forms, respectively, in the reproductive stage, while 30% (18 plants) and 28.3% (17 plants) were in the vegetative stage as epiphytes and terrestrials, respectively, out of the total 60 bromeliads.
Analyzed variables - The variables under evaluation encompassed the survival percentage, derived from the count of deceased plants, emerging sprouts, and leaves. The dependent variables of sprout emergence and survival were assessed over nine readings, whereas leaf evaluation occurred over five readings spanning from October 2015 to November 2016.
Experimental Design: Two independent experiments were conducted utilizing the bromeliads Aechmea distichantha and Wittrockia cyathiformis. The experimental design employed involved treatments organized in a split-plot over time, distributed across three blocks, with the primary treatment focusing on the relocation form (epiphytic or terricolous). Furthermore, the independent variables of Aechmea distichantha were assessed, taking into account the phenological stage (vegetative or reproductive).
In the experimental setup in the field, individuals were marked from 1 to 60 using white plastic tags affixed to the youngest adult leaves, which were deemed the most physiologically active. These tags were secured by threading a plastic string through a punched hole in the leaf. Once marked, the individuals were transported to the experimental site in the forest, where plants were randomly selected by drawing numbered pieces of paper. This random selection process ensured that bromeliads placed on the pitchfork, trunk, or ground were chosen without bias.
The specimens of Wittrockia cyathiformis, totaling 60 plants, were all observed in the vegetative stage without any showing evidence of floral scape. Statistical analyses were conducted using a generalized mixed linear modeling (GLMM) approach to examine the leaves and sprouts of Aechmea distichantha, with means compared using the Bonferroni test. Additionally, the data on the number of leaves and sprouts of Wittrockia cyathiformis were assessed for normality assumptions using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Subsequently, the data underwent Friedman test analysis, with medians compared through the Parwise Comparisons test (Durbin-Conover). The statistical analysis was performed using JAMOVI software (The Jamovi Project 2022). The survival of both bromeliad species was evaluated using the SISVAR program (Ferreira 2011), employing a split-plot in time experimental design across three blocks, with the primary treatment being the relocation method.
Relocation has been considered a method for plant conservation in cases of forest removal for road works (Jasper et al., 2005). Barrancos et al. (2016) demonstrated that transplanting bromeliads can serve as a simple and non-destructive approach to overcome the limitations of epiphyte dispersal and accelerate biodiversity recovery. The survival rates of A. distichantha specimens transplanted in terricolous form did not exhibit statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between vegetative or reproductive stages throughout the observation period, as indicated in Table 1. Plants relocated as terricolous or epiphytic in the vegetative stage displayed a 100% survival rate (Table 1). However, when plants were relocated as epiphytes in the reproductive stage, survival statistically decreased to 83.33% after 287 days from the experiment's commencement (initially 100%) (Table 1). Nonetheless, the survival rate remained relatively high. The elevated survival percentages observed for A. distichantha could be attributed to the plants being nurtured under nursery conditions in pots, ensuring better nourishment and phytosanitary conditions. These survival rates surpassed those reported in similar studies involving relocated Aechmea species, which recorded a 62.5% survival rate (Araújo, 2006). The methodology employed in this study mirrored the standard procedures typically followed during rescue operations by company workers, where A. distichantha plants were randomly collected from their natural forest habitat, irrespective of their epiphytic or terricolous nature.
The results indicate that W. cyathiformis plants (table 2) relocated as terricolous or epiphytic did not exhibit significant differences in survival rates, suggesting that the form of relocation did not impact survival during the experiment for this species. However, the survival rate decreased significantly over time in both relocation forms, remaining constant at 60% from 252 days until the end of the experiment (table 2). This trend suggests that W. cyathiformis experiences stress after 196 days of transplanting until definitive establishment. In a study by Jasper et al. (2005), 14 bromeliad species rescued from a forest area clearance for hydro-energetic purposes showed a mean survival rate of 67% after relocation, varying between 79% and 50% depending on the species over a 10-month period post-transplantation. Barrancos et al. (2016) demonstrated that the survival rate of the tank bromeliad Werauhia gladioliflora (H. Wendl.) J. R. Grant fixed onto trunks and branches ranged from 65% to 95% across sites after nine months, albeit with a shorter evaluation period compared to the current study (12.4 months). Duarte & Gandolfi (2013) observed a similar survival rate (75.9%) for Aechmea bromeliifolia (Rudge) Baker one year after relocation as an epiphyte. The vulnerability of epiphytes post-relocation may be attributed to their reliance on rainfall for water uptake, as they lack irrigation, making them susceptible to drought, as highlighted by Benzing (2000). For instance, Carvalho et al. (2017) demonstrated a significant 37% decrease in relative water content (RWC) in Guzmania monostachia (L.) Rusby ex Mez plants after eight days without irrigation, mirroring the effects of relocation observed in this study.
In their study, Jasper et al. (2005) highlighted the significance of efficient fixation to the host using materials that can withstand at least 10 months, opting for biodegradable string, while sisal was utilized in this particular investigation. This necessity underscores the potential benefits of directly relocating specimens to soil as a viable strategy to prevent mortality among rescued specimens, particularly in comparison to facultative species, as noted by Jasper et al. (2005). Consequently, when specimens with facultative habits, like Aechmea calyculata (E. Morren) Baker, were transplanted to soil, a survival rate of 79.6% was observed. In a similar vein, Freitas et al. (1998) conducted transplant experiments to evaluate the epiphytic growth of terricolous ramets of Nidularium procerum Lindman and Nidularium innocentii Lemaire, both tank bromeliads classified as facultative epiphytes, and noted a 100% survival rate after a two-year period.
The findings revealed that the leaf number of A. distichantha bromeliads in both vegetative and reproductive stages, whether transplanted as terricolous or epiphytic forms, did not exhibit significant differences (p > 0.05) between them throughout the experiment at various observation periods. This suggests that the form of relocation and the phenological stage do not have a substantial impact on leaf emission. Furthermore, the results indicated a significant decrease in the number of leaves (p > 0.05) from 252 days onwards, which then stabilized until the conclusion of the study, for both phenological stages and relocation forms. The decline in leaf count observed in A. distichantha and W. cyathiformis could be interpreted as an adaptive response to abiotic stress, potentially leading to leaf senescence during the acclimatization of bromeliads to a new environment. This reduction in leaves may also be attributed to the accelerated sprouting process triggered by environmental stress, as seen in other bromeliad species like Vriesea neoglutinosa Mez, which ceases leaf production and initiates new sprout formation upon reaching maturity. The experiment period experienced abiotic stress factors, particularly water deficit during drought months in July and September 2016, as depicted in Figure 2. Despite leaf loss, the survival rate remained high, indicating the ability of bromeliads to absorb water from the soil through their root systems and leaf imbrications. Although the precise measurement of new root emission was not feasible with the soil and canopy transplanting method employed, it can be inferred that these roots play a role in mineral nutrient absorption, thereby facilitating adequate nutrition for growth and development.
Furthermore, it is observed that in W. cyathiformis (Table 4), the number of leaves of bromeliads transplanted as terricolous or epiphytic did not exhibit significant differences (p > 0.05) across various observed periods. This suggests that the leaf count is not influenced by the form of relocation, a trend also evident in A. distichantha. However, the leaf count of W. cyathiformis experienced a significant decrease (p > 0.05) from 252 days onwards, maintaining a consistent level until the conclusion of the experiment. This trend potentially indicates that these bromeliads may face abiotic water and nutritional stress following relocation.
During the initial phase of acclimatization to a new environment, specifically between the removal and relocation of bromeliads, there is a possibility of encountering a nutritional deficiency owing to the restricted availability of nutrients. This deficiency can result in the inactivation of apical buds and subsequently stimulate the production of axillary sprouts. As noted by Freitas et al. (1998), the shedding of leaves during this establishment phase could be attributed to either natural senescence or an adaptive reaction.
The results of relocating A. distichantha specimens, as shown in Table 5, indicated that terricolous transplants did not exhibit statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in sprout numbers across observed phenological stages. Similarly, soil transplants did not show significant differences (p > 0.05) in sprout numbers regardless of phenological stage or time period. This suggests that soil transplantation is not influenced by the various phenological stages of A. distichantha. However, when A. distichantha bromeliads were transplanted as epiphytes, significant differences over time (p ≤ 0.05) were observed. Specifically, during the vegetative stage, there was a notable increase in sprout numbers at 252 days (approximately 10%), stabilizing at 1.06 and 1.12 sprouts. In contrast, transplants during the reproductive stage did not show significant differences (p > 0.05) in sprout numbers over time. The emergence of new sprouts may be linked to leaf senescence, a process that aids in nutrient recycling and resource efficiency. This increase in sprouts could be a response to abiotic stress, triggering the production of axillary sprouts. Conversely, bromeliads in the reproductive stage, transplanted as epiphytes, did not exhibit a significant increase (p > 0.05) in sprout numbers, as they were likely focused on floral scape production during this period (Table 5).
Regarding W. cyathiformis (Table 6), when relocated as terricolous or epiphytic, there were no significant differences in the numbers of sprouts observed (p > 0.05), suggesting that the form of relocation did not impact sprout emission during the experiment. Additionally, it was noted that sprout production remained consistent over time (p > 0.05), regardless of whether the plant was terricolous or epiphytic. This consistent behavior indicates that sprout emission remains stable over time, irrespective of the relocation form. The emission of new sprouts was likely triggered by abiotic stress from the new fixation environment on the phorophytes and transplantation into the forest ground. Jasper et al. (2005) suggested that new roots originating from shoots aid in the plant's attachment to the phorophyte, with root development typically taking six to 12 months post-transplantation. In this study, root system development was not assessed to prevent damage to young roots during specimen removal from the relocation site. Jasper et al. (2005) highlighted the significance of the root system for epiphyte attachment, noting a high mortality rate in Vriesea friburgensis Mez due to inadequate attachment to the phorophyte. Similarly, Barrancos (2016) demonstrated that the presence of new roots gripping the trunk enhances the survival of relocated specimens.
Duarte & Gandolfi (2013) noted that the size of the bromeliad specimen being relocated could impact its survival rate. Their research revealed that larger individuals of Aechmea bromeliifolia (Rudge) Baker demonstrated greater resilience to transplantation stress, ensuring their establishment in the new environment. While the study did not specifically address the size of the bromeliads, only mature plants were transplanted, excluding smaller specimens. The average number of leaves, 19.61 for A. distichantha and 13.65 for W. cyathiformis, was used as an indicator of growth stage. As the emergence of sprouts typically occurs when the largest plants reach maturity, selecting A. distichantha and W. cyathiformis specimens with sprouts could enhance relocation success, as these plants would have achieved a development stage capable of withstanding the stress of transplantation.
The findings suggest that A. distichantha may exhibit greater adaptability post-relocation compared to W. cyathiformis. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the survival rates of both species align with those reported for other transplanted bromeliads. It is noteworthy that the chosen relocation strategy, whether epiphytic or terricolous, could play a role in attracting pollinators, enhancing seed production, and facilitating the establishment of new populations. W. cyathiformis, a facultative bromeliad, is known to be frequented by birds and pollinated by hummingbirds. On the other hand, the facultative A. distichantha can be pollinated by either bees or hummingbirds. In terms of pollination dynamics, Varassin and Sazima (2000) observed Phaethornis eurynome and Ramphodon naevius hummingbirds pollinating bromeliads in the forest's lower strata.
The findings of this study confirmed that facultative epiphytic bromeliads can indeed be successfully transplanted to both soil and tree trunks. However, the survival rates post-relocation varied significantly, indicating a differential ability to acclimate to the altered physical and physiological conditions resulting from the transition from their natural habitat. These discrepancies are likely attributed to distinct genetic predispositions governing tolerance mechanisms towards relocation. Additionally, the influence of individual morphological traits, which likely played a role in determining survival rates, cannot be overlooked, especially considering that both species exhibited good phytosanitary conditions throughout their time in the nursery. Lunelli et al. (2015) noted the diverse responses of epiphytes to transplantation and emphasized the importance of studying species biology for effective relocation monitoring.
We have determined that the simultaneous relocation of A. distichantha and W. cyathiformis as epiphytes and terricolous plants is indeed viable. Nevertheless, transferring them to soil can effectively decrease implantation costs during the rescue operation by substantially reducing the labor required for relocating these bromeliads.
