ABSTRACT 
This cross-sectional survey investigated the pandemic impact on dental practice in May 2021 (second 
wave in Brazil). COVID-19 incidence and severity among respondents, vaccination status, and level of 
confidence in vaccines were surveyed, in addition to medications used for preventing or treating 
COVID-19, including controversial drugs/substances (vitamin D, ivermectin, zinc, and chloroquine). 
Dentists were recruited by email and responded to a pretested questionnaire until May 31, 2021. In 
total, 1,907 responses were received (21.2% return rate). Bivariate and multivariate regression 
analyses were performed (α=0.05). Prevalence Ratios were calculated for the association between 
professional characteristics and two outcomes: report of SARS-CoV-2 infection and use of 
controversial drugs. One third of dentists reported intermediate levels of confidence in safety/efficacy 
of vaccines, but 96% received at least one vaccine dose, mainly CoronaVac. The impact of the 
pandemic on dental practice was rated as lower/much lower compared with one-year before (first 
wave) by 46% of respondents; 27% of dentists reported to have had a positive COVID-19 test, ~50% 
had relatives or friends who had been hospitalized or died from COVID-19. At least one medication 
was used by 59% of respondents, 43% used two or more drugs and substances. Vitamin D (41%), 
(35%), and zinc (29%) were the most frequent drugs/substances. More experienced dentists (≥21 
years in practice) were 42% more likely to use controversial medications than less experienced 
respondents. Dentists with residency/advanced training as postgraduate education had 30% higher 
prevalence of controversial medication use than respondents holding MSc/PhD degrees. Respondents

with low confidence in vaccines were 2.1 times more likely to use controversial medications than 
participants with very high confidence. The overall findings of this survey highlight the high severity of 
the pandemic in Brazil, and raised questions about the use of scientific evidence by dentists in their 
decision to take controversial COVID-19 medications.

INTRODUCTION 
The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic imposed significant challenges to dentistry 
worldwide1–5. Dental practice during the pandemic has been associated with negative feelings among 
dentists, who had high anxiety levels and fear of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and infection at work5–8. A 
study during the first wave in Brazil showed that regional COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates were 
associated with fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection in dental offices5. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 
the Brazilian government has been criticized for being hostile to scientific evidence and unable to stop 
the spread of SARS-CoV-29,10. As of January 2022, the COVID-19 has caused more than 620,000 deaths 
in Brazil, one of the highest global mortality rates with approximately 290 deaths per 100,000 
inhabitants11. 
Amid an epidemiological crisis, a topic that has received great attention around the world has 
been the use of ineffective or controversial drugs and substances for preventing or treating COVID-
1912–17. The issue was a matter of investigational hearings in the Brazilian senate and included the off-
label use of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, among others. A recent article showed that a small 
set of poorly designed studies on medications played a significant role in misinformation during the 
first wave in Brazil18, when vaccines were still not available. In such a turbulent scenario with 
uncertainty about the future of the pandemic, combined with the fear and high risk of exposure to 
SARS-CoV-2 in dental offices, dentists could be inclined to self-medication or use drugs without proven 
efficacy against COVID-19. At the same time, hesitancy about accepting vaccination has been an issue 
worldwide19,20, and the level of confidence in the COVID-19 vaccines could be associated with the use 
of unproved medications. A recent survey in Italy showed that 18% of participating dentists reported 
hesitance about COVID-19 vaccination21, whereas another study showed higher willingness to receive a 
COVID-19 vaccine in South America than in the USA and Russia20.  
The objective of this study with dentists in Brazil was to address the impact of COVID-19 on 
dental practice in May 2021, when the second wave was in course, and one of the most severe periods 
of the pandemic in Brazil, with 148,000 deaths between March and April, 202111. This report addresses 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3483
the incidence and severity of the disease among dental professionals participating in a national survey, 
in addition to the medications used for preventing or treating COVID-19. Information on vaccination 
status and level of confidence in vaccines during this period were also investigated.  
 
 
METHODS 
Study design and ethical aspects 
This cross-sectional survey was implemented in Brazil in May 2021, one year after a similar 
survey had been conducted with dentists practicing in Brazil during the escalation of the pandemic 
curve in the first wave5. The study protocol had been approved by our institutional review board and 
all research methods were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The primary 
objective of the survey was to address the impact of COVID-19 on the dental care routine and 
associated aspects, including COVID-19 incidence, severity, medication use, and vaccination among 
the dentists surveyed. A questionnaire that had been developed and pre-tested in previous studies 
was used5,22. The respondents had to agree to participating in the survey, to enable their access the 
questionnaire. They were instructed to print or save the first page of the questionnaire to retain a 
copy of the informed consent form. In accordance with open science practices, the research project, 
the questionnaire in its original language, and the databank of responses are all available in an open 
platform (doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/DNBGS). An English translation of the questionnaire is presented in 
the Appendix. This report consulted the Consensus-Based Checklist for Reporting of Survey Studies 
(CROSS)23. 
 
Questionnaire development, content, and pretesting 
Details on the development and pretesting of the original questionnaire were published 
elsewhere5,22. The instrument was a self-administered electronic questionnaire, which underwent 
minor revisions for the present investigation, including suppression of 11 and addition of 5 questions 
mainly about COVID-19 severity, medication use, and vaccination, which were not present in the 
previous versions of the instrument. The new questions were formulated based on the inputs of three 
researchers in three discrete rounds of review.  
The questionnaire was created and hosted on SurveyMonkey (Momentive Inc., San Mateo, 
CA, USA). The first section informed the title and objective of the study, and the fact that the invitation 
was extended only to dentists. This section provided the term of informed consent, in which the 
participants were notified that their participation was voluntary and unpaid, and they were informed 
of the potential risks and benefits of the research. In addition, the participants were assured that 
responses would be treated anonymously and confidentially. Multiple participations from a same 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3483
respondent were not allowed by the surveying system, which also protected unauthorized access to 
the questionnaire. Each question was presented to the participants only after their response to the 
previous question, which meant that there were no discrete screens. The questionnaire contained 25 
mandatory items (1 open, 24 close-ended questions) including demographic and professional 
characteristics (n = 6), professional practices and challenges during the pandemic (n = 13), and 
questions about COVID-19 vaccination, prevalence, severity, and medication (n = 6). The items were 
not randomized, and no adaptive questioning methods were used. The responses could be revised by 
using back buttons at any time before submitting the completed form. In order to reduce bias related 
to response errors (units), the options ‘I'd rather not say’, ‘I don't know how to answer’, and ‘Does not 
apply’ were available in all close-ended questions.  
 
Sample selection, participant recruitment and survey administration 
A source population of 24,392 registered dentists were recruited by means of email invitations 
to participate, sent via SurveyMonkey (convenience sampling). The list was provided by the Brazilian 
Ministry of Health in 2020 and included professionals from all Brazilian states working in the public 
and/or private dental care networks. The list also included dentists who had participated in the first 
survey in May 20205. In previous studies, these sources were shown to lead to sample variability and 
correspondence with the general population of verified dentists in Brazil5,22. The email was a brief 
invitation containing the study objective, average response time (5 min), and notification of the 
university conducting the study. We tested whether the questionnaire could be read well on different 
computers, tablets, and cell phones. The first emails were sent on May 13, 2021. Reminder emails 
were sent seven and 11 days later to reduce non-response bias. Given a population of ~350,000 
dentists in Brazil, we estimated that 1,530 responses would be necessary to ensure a 95% confidence 
interval and 2.5% margin of error. Responses were collected until May 31, 2021. 
 
Data analysis 
To reduce non-response error, partial completion of questionnaires was not allowed 
(completion proportion = 100%). In some questions, the responses were restricted to a specific 
population, e.g., only dentists assisting patients when the survey was administered. The responses ‘I'd 
rather not say’, ‘I don't know how to answer’, and ‘Does not apply’ were treated as missing data. No 
strategies for item weighting, propensity scores, or sensitivity analysis were used. In analyses using 
data from the question on medication use, the following were labeled as controversial drugs and 
substances: vitamin D, ivermectin, zinc, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Descriptive statistics 
were used to identify frequencies and distributions of variables with respective 95% confidence 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3483
intervals (CI). Bivariate and multivariate Poisson regression analyses were performed, and Prevalence 
Ratios (PR) were calculated for the association between professional characteristics and two COVID-
19-related outcomes: report of SARS-CoV-2 infection and use of controversial drugs or substances by 
the dentists. Selection of variables in the multivariate models was performed using stepwise backward 
method. Variables from the bivariate analysis were kept only if p < 0.25. All analyses were performed 
in Stata 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) considering α = 0.05. 
 
RESULTS 
Out of the total number of 24,392 invitation emails sent to dentists, 1,347 emails bounced 
(5.5% loss) and 9,010 emails were opened (unique visitors), as registered by the surveying system 
(view proportion = 36.9%). A 21.2% return rate was calculated from those opened emails and a total 
of 1,907 valid responses were received from all 26 Brazilian states and the federal district.  
 
Sample characteristics 
The length of work experience and the levels of postgraduate education varied among 
respondents (Table 1). There was a predominance of responses from females and dentists in the public 
sector. Almost 90% of the participants worked in the South, Southeast, and Northeast regions. Data 
indicated that 96% of dentists in this survey received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by 
May 2021, and the most common vaccine was CoronaVac (65%). A predominance of high and very 
high confidence levels in the COVID-19 vaccines was reported (58%), but one third of the sample 
reported intermediate levels of confidence in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. 
 
Current impact on dental practice 
The impact of the pandemic on dental practice during the second wave was rated as 
lower/much lower compared with one-year before (first wave) by 46% of respondents. Nevertheless, 
39% reported feeling poorly or not prepared to treat COVID-19 patients, and 49% reported moderate 
or high fear of being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 during work. N95 masks and face shields were 
always used in dental appointments by at least 60% of respondents, and 27% declared to have treated 
patients with confirmed COVID-19.  
 
COVID-19 incidence, severity, and medication use 
In total, 27% of the dentists reported to have had a positive test for COVID-19 by May 2021, 
and the majority of them were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms (88%). Almost 50% of the 
respondents had relatives or friends that had been hospitalized or died from COVID-19. From the list 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3483
of seven medications or substances, 58.9% of the respondents reported to have used at least one as 
preventive or treatment measures for COVID-19. Vitamin D was the most common (41%), followed by 
ivermectin (35%), zinc (29%), and azithromycin (27%). Use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine was 
not prevalent (4%). In total, 42.7% of the dentists surveyed claimed to have used two or more drugs 
and substances. The most frequent combinations contained vitamin D + zinc either combined or not 
with ivermectin. 
Table 2 presents the prevalence ratios for the association between professional characteristics 
and SARS-CoV-2 infection by dentists. Sex, work sector, and years in practice were not associated with 
the prevalence of infection. Dentists working in the Northern region were 58% more likely to report 
having COVID-19 than those working in the South. Dentists who had residency/advanced training as 
their highest postgraduate education level were 26% more likely to have had the disease than 
professionals with MSc or PhD degrees. The level of confidence in COVID-19 vaccines was not 
associated with a history of infection, whereas respondents who claimed having no fear of being 
infected at work were 48% more likely to have had COVID-19 than those reporting high fear. 
Table 3 presents the prevalence ratios for the association between professional characteristics 
and use of controversial medications for COVID-19 in the multivariate analysis. The participants’ sex 
and work sector were not associated with the use of controversial medications. However, more 
experienced dentists (>21 years in practice) were 42% more likely to have used controversial 
medications for COVID-19 than less experienced respondents. Respondents from the Central-west, 
North, and Northeast regions were 29–37% more likely to use controversial medications than 
participants from the South. Dentists who had residency/advanced training as postgraduate education 
had 30% higher prevalence of controversial medication use than respondents holding MSc or PhD 
degrees. The level of confidence in COVID-19 vaccines also influenced the use of medications. 
Increased prevalence of using controversial medications was associated with decreased levels of 
confidence in vaccines. Respondents with low confidence in the COVID-19 vaccines, for instance, were 
2.1 times more likely to have used controversial medications than participants with very high 
confidence in the vaccines.  
 
DISCUSSION 
This study showed a high prevalence of COVID-19 among Brazilian dental professionals and a 
frequent occurrence of hospitalizations and deaths from the disease within their family members or 
friends during the second pandemic wave in the country. In addition, 59% of the respondents claimed 
to have used one or more substances as preventive or therapeutic measures, including vitamin D, zinc 
and ivermectin, which have limited evidence to support their clinical use against COVID-19.  
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3483
Studies conducted with dentists in several countries showed varying prevalence of COVID-19 
in different pandemic periods: 1.1% in Brazil (May 2020),5 9.1% in Belgium (July–September 2020),24 
2.6% in the USA (June–November 2020),25 4.9% in 11 Spanish-speaking Latin American countries 
(September–December 2020),26 10.9% in Italy (December 2020–January 2021),21 and 1.1% in Canada 
(July 2020–February 2021)27. In a multi-country survey with 36 countries in 2020, ~15% of participating 
dentists reported symptoms suggestive of COVID-1928. The only study we were able to find in the 
literature, which included dentists that with an occurrence of COVID-19 similar to that reported 
herein, was conducted in the Czech Republic in June 2021 and showed a 25% prevalence of positive 
tests among dental profesionals29. In general, all of these rates were noticeably lower than the 
prevalence reported in the present study (27%) and could be partially explained by differences in 
public health and social measures in response to the pandemic, distinct COVID-19 spreading rates in 
the countries concerned, and the different assessment periods. In the present study, for example, the 
prevalence of COVID-19 among dentists working in the Northern region was higher than it was for 
those working in the South, a finding that could be related to the government’s failure to follow 
science-based guidance30 and the abrupt increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Manaus 
(Amazonas state) during the first months of 202131. It is noteworthy that in our study, the high 
prevalence of dentists reporting a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection could also have been 
associated with the long-lasting trend of high contamination occurring in Brazil. Differently from other 
countries where the COVID-19 epidemic curves had peaks and reductions, Brazil continued to be a 
country with high rates of virus transmission during 2020 (first wave) and had an increase in cases the 
first half of 2021 (second wave) as a result of the lack of an effective national prevention strategy and 
the anti-scientific approach adopted by the Brazilian government. The high demand for healthcare 
services during the pandemic increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination, especially among 
dentists who came into close contact with patients. 
In addition to the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the study population, the dentists also 
frequently reported that people close to them had COVID-19. Whereas a survey in Italy reported that 
55% of dentists had one or more relatives or friends with COVID-1921, approximately 50% of the 
participants in our study reported to have a family member or friend who had been hospitalized or 
died from COVID-19. This result is overwhelming and highlights the severity of the pandemic in Brazil, 
with COVID-19 being the leading cause of deaths in the Brazilian public health system in 202032 and 
during the first months of 202133. Although the impact on dental practice in May 2021 seemed to be 
lower for the respondents when compared with May 2020, the participants still frequently reported 
feeling poorly prepared to treat patients with COVID-19 and had moderate to high fear of acquiring 
the disease at work. In fact, respondents who claimed having no fear of acquiring the disease were 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3483
more likely to have had COVID-19, a result that raises questions about the influence on the 
occupational hazard arising from more or less strict preventive measures adopted by the dentists 
interviewed. In addition, a high-risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in dental offices combined with a 
frequent occurrence of COVID-19 within their family circles could be associated with underlying high 
levels of psychosis and anxiety3,7, which may help to explain the high prevalence of off-label drugs 
used for preventing or treating COVID-19 in the present sample. 
Misinformation has been a major problem in the ongoing pandemic and a potential source of 
public confusion and controversy. A study conducted in Vietnam when the pandemic had just started, 
showed that more than 91% of healthcare workers learned about COVID-19 via social media34, which 
are digital places from which the misinformation has free access to pathways that are not subject to 
content policing, and could lead to driving the population into a state of panic35. Healthcare 
professionals are expected to keep themselves up to date with reliable information so that they can 
educate and treat their patients properly. Scientific literature plays an important role in this context 
of professional practices. This is highlighted in the present study by the observation that dentists 
holding MSc or PhD degrees were less likely to take controversial medications than those with a lower 
level of postgraduate education. On the other hand, healthcare workers have been described as major 
practitioners of self-medication36. In the pandemic, a report on a sample of participants including 
healthcare workers in Togo, showed a 34% prevalence of self-medication to prevent COVID-19, with 
vitamin C being the product most frequently used (28%)37. Other professional characteristics can also 
influence the use of drugs. We found that more experienced dentists were more likely to have taken 
controversial medications than younger practitioners, a result that could be associated with the higher 
risk of older adults having severe cases of COVID-19. In addition, respondents with low confidence in 
COVID-19 vaccines were 2.1 times more likely to use controversial medications than participants with 
a high confidence in the vaccines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show this 
association. 
Among the many factors that may negatively interfere with evidence-based healthcare 
practice in the pandemic context is the large number of low-quality studies reporting conflicting 
results for COVID-19 treatment. This is coupled with difficulties of implementing the best available 
evidence due to lack of time, knowledge, or basic skills to find and critically appraise the literature. 
This means that the controversial substances addressed herein could be considered either effective 
or ineffective depending on the article selected and how it was interpreted. Regarding vitamin D, for 
instance, a systematic review including varied study designs suggested that its supplementation was 
associated with reduced intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and 
mortality38. In contrast, a systematic review with randomized trials and quasi-experimental studies 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3483
reported that vitamin D did not reduce the risk of these clinical outcomes39. A meta-analysis on 
micronutrient supplements demonstrated that zinc reduced death rates of COVID-19 patients, 
whereas vitamins C and D did not affect mortality40. Another meta-analysis concluded that there is no 
evidence to support routine zinc supplementation in COVID-19 patients41. Karale et al.42 indicated that 
treatment with ivermectin for COVID-19 may reduce the need for hospitalization, but the mortality 
benefit was uncertain, and no effect was observed on the need for ICU admission and mechanical 
ventilation, or on the length of hospital stay. In addition, a living network meta-analysis concluded 
that it was highly uncertain whether ivermectin used as preventive measure would be capable of 
reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection43. Another problem regarding the evidence-based use of 
medications is that methodological issues are generally present across the primary studies. In all 
systematic reviews quoted here, the authors highlighted that more randomized controlled trials with 
larger sample sizes and less risk of bias, imprecision, and/or heterogeneity were necessary. It seems 
that the topic about controversial drugs and substances for COVID-19 will still attract attention in the 
following years as definitive conclusions will hardly be accepted universally. In the meantime, dentists 
are encouraged to rely on evidence arising from randomized trials or meta-analyses that have been 
judged as having low risk of bias and good methodological quality, or through evidence-based 
guidelines when available. 
A positive finding in the present study was the high rate of vaccination for COVID-19 among 
the dentists surveyed. In Brazil, healthcare professionals were prioritized for vaccination following the 
elderly, thus dentists were vaccinated in the first stages of the immunization program by using the 
first vaccines available in the country. This explains the high frequency of dentists using CoronaVac, 
which was the first vaccine authorized for emergency use by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency 
in January 2021. This vaccine was developed by the Brazilian Institute Butantan in association with the 
Chinese laboratory Sinovac. A study showed that the rapid scaling up of vaccination using CoronaVac 
among Brazilian elderly was associated with a significant decline in mortality when compared with 
younger individuals44. Sadly, the vaccine was criticized by President Bolsonaro and his allies during its 
testing phases in 2020. In that period, a study showed that Brazilians were less likely to accept 
vaccination when the country of origin of the vaccine was mentioned45. Particularly, rejection of a 
vaccine from China was strong among President Bolsonaro’s supporters. As of January 2022, four 
vaccines have been available for use in Brazil and dentists around the country are eligible for taking 
booster shots. Further studies could investigate the acceptance of dental practitioners to new COVID-
19 vaccination phases and the maintenance of other preventive measures to address whether a so-
called ‘pandemic fatigue’ may decrease their adherence to individual and collective risk reduction 
strategies46.  
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3483
The present study has limitations that should be acknowledged, and caution should be taken 
when extrapolating the results observed herein. Respondents were free either to accept or not to 
accept the invitation to participate in the survey, which may lead to self-selection bias increasing the 
chances of dentists who were more concerned with the pandemic to participate and perhaps more 
willing to take medications. In addition, we did not collect data on doses or frequency of usage of the 
controversial drugs and substances, which may have varied largely among participants. Self-reported 
information about use of medications may also be influenced by social desirability bias, but the 
questionnaire was anonymous and thus the influence could be low. A strength of the study was that 
a large sample of dentists was recruited in a period when the country was struggling to deal with the 
pandemic. In addition, this seems to be the first study assessing COVID-19 incidence, severity, 
medication use, and vaccination among dentists. Further studies could explore reasons underlying the 
use of controversial drugs and substances and socioeconomical aspects involved. 
 
CONCLUSION 
This survey with dentists showed a staggering body of evidence during the second wave of 
COVID-19 in Brazil, including high incidence of the disease among professionals, frequent occurrence 
of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 among their family members or friends, and very frequent 
claim of using medications as COVID-19 preventive or treatment measures. The overall findings 
highlighted the high severity of the pandemic in Brazil and raised questions about the use of scientific 
evidence by dentists in their decision to take controversial COVID-19 drugs and substances such as 
vitamin D, zinc, and ivermectin.
