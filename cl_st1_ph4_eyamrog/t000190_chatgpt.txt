SARS-CoV-2, a highly transmissible virus transmitted through both air and fomites, is responsible for causing acute severe respiratory syndrome. The severity of the illness it induces can necessitate hospitalization and costly intensive care interventions. Its rapid spread has resulted in a global pandemic that has instilled fear worldwide, with millions of individuals infected and nearly half a million fatalities reported within the initial months of 2020 (up to June 17, 2020). It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 likely originated from natural sylvatic cycles involving bats in China.
Our aim is to discuss the human immune inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and how these individual immunoinflammatory profiles correlate with disease severity, timing of therapeutic interventions, pathogenesis, potential drug candidates, and comparative drug prices for COVID-19.
Efficient treatment for COVID-19 necessitates early disease detection, a combination of drugs targeting the virus replication cycle, and specific, individualized drug treatment tailored to the immunoinflammatory human profile responses, all administered in a timely manner.
Identification of specific serum immunomarkers in individuals with COVID-19 at disease onset, during follow-up, and at the resolution of the immunoinflammatory storm could pave the way for personalized therapeutic interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
COVID-19 is unlikely to be the final emergent human disease with rapid pandemic potential. The acquisition of knowledge regarding human host profiles and immunoinflammatory responses presents an opportunity that could lead to the development of quicker and more effective strategies for addressing future diseases.
We are a diverse population of 7 billion individuals, each possessing a unique arrangement of DNA material. Within the vast array of 3 billion DNA base pairs, our lifestyles, habits, and mental well-being contribute to the complexity of our epigenetics.
Despite the well-established nature of this phenomenon, discussions surrounding pathogen invasion and emerging diseases often overlook the significant impact of human genetics and epigenetic variation. These variations play a crucial role in shaping diverse host immune responses to pathogen infections and in determining the differential impacts on various human populations and cohorts.
In the early 1960s, Australian doctor John Murray Last, during his postgraduate work at the London Hospital in the UK, identified what he termed 'subclinical diseases' and introduced the vivid metaphor of 'disease as iceberg.' He noted that only a fraction of patients within a given exposed population exhibit symptoms (Last, 1963) (see Figure 1). Last's observations encompassed subclinical, undetected manifestations of both acute and chronic conditions like urinary infections, tuberculosis, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis, among others. He emphasized that what is recognized as 'disease' by general practitioners merely represents the visible tip of the iceberg. Within this visible tip, a minority of individuals display moderate to severe symptoms, while the majority of affected individuals experience mild or no symptoms.
For COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the incidence of severe cases appears to align with the iceberg model of disease (see Fig. 1 and Table I). Despite the understanding that testing and notifications likely capture only a fraction of the actual coronavirus infections, rapid immunochromatographic tests for antibodies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) antigen testing can confirm approximately 0.001 to ~1% of cases within the total population (refer to Table I). These figures serve as a proxy for individuals exhibiting moderate to severe symptoms, seeking testing at healthcare facilities, and being officially recorded in statistical data. Surveys conducted in 120 cities across Brazil, representing 32.7% of the nation's population (equivalent to 68.6 million individuals), have revealed an average infection rate of 3%, with some cases being entirely asymptomatic (EPICOVID19 - Universidade de Pelotas, data as of June 11, 2020). These percentages exhibit significant variability, reflecting diverse scenarios across different Brazilian cities. Notably, IgM positivity for COVID-19 ranged from 0.5% in most cities of the Southern Brazilian States to as high as 25% in Boa Vista, Roraima, located in the Northern Region (EPICOVID19 - Universidade de Pelotas, data as of June 11, 2020).
These figures may appear modest at first glance, yet they present significant concerns and pose formidable challenges even for well-equipped healthcare systems. COVID-19, being a rapidly spreading infectious acute respiratory syndrome, demands intricate treatment protocols that entail the availability of intensive care units, ventilators, specialized equipment, a substantial quantity of disposable consumables, and a proficient workforce, all simultaneously prepared for immediate deployment. A portion of patients necessitate prolonged intensive care spanning several weeks, with an estimated 1 to 16% of symptomatic cases failing to achieve recovery, as outlined in Table I.
Individual immune responses play a crucial role in the context of emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome known as COVID-19. It is evident that individuals exhibit exacerbated immunoinflammatory responses as they strive to combat the invading pathogen, a phenomenon that appears to be closely associated with the development of symptomatic, full-blown COVID-19. These responses not only exhibit variability on an individual basis but also evolve over the course of the disease progression, ultimately influencing the outcomes of COVID-19.
Comorbidities and risk groups alone cannot fully account for the segmentation of COVID-19 clinic presentations in a given population, ranging from mild to severe. While the elderly, hypertensive, diabetic, obese, immunosuppressed, and chronically ill individuals are at a higher risk, as is typical for any infection, there are instances where seemingly healthy individuals in the population are more prone to developing severe cases of COVID-19. These severe cases are often associated with the clinical presentation of a 'cytokine storm'.
Uncontrolled immune inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases, including hemorrhagic dengue (Sierra et al., 2010) and severe malaria (Penha-Gonçalves, 2019).
The term 'cytokine storm' was initially coined in 1993 in a paper discussing graft-versus-host disease (Ferrara et al., 1993). This phenomenon has since been associated with various infectious agents such as the avian H5N1 influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, group A streptococcus, variola virus, and the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as outlined in a review by Tisoncik et al. (2012). The concept of cytokine storm has resurfaced in the context of COVID-19 due to its pronounced immune-inflammatory cellular and molecular processes, which appear to be closely correlated with fatal outcomes (see Fig. 2).
Immunoinflammatory profiles are anticipated to influence the outcome of COVID-19, with genetics, immune responses, and inflammatory markers playing crucial roles. However, our understanding of how these factors interact and impact individuals is still in its nascent stages. Efforts are underway to categorize individuals based on these profiles and translate this knowledge into clinical practice. It is important to note that these profiles are dynamic and likely influenced by both genetic factors and epigenetic modifications in individuals.
We propose the identification of three distinct human immunoprofile groups for COVID-19, which could also be applicable to other cytokine storm-prone diseases. These groups include: 1) individuals unlikely to develop a cytokine storm, 2) those with a potential for cytokine storm development, and 3) those highly likely to experience a cytokine storm. The differentiation among these groups could be based on various factors such as i) the nucleocytes/monocytes ratio (Tay et al., 2020), ii) levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and iii) immunoinflammatory markers like tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a), interferon gamma (IFN-c), tumor growth factor beta (TGF-b), as well as other interleukins such as IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 (Sierra et al., 2010; Tay et al., 2020). Enhanced laboratory indicators of these factors in blood serum may significantly improve outcome predictions through efficient and rapid diagnostic approaches.
Enhancing our understanding of individual-specific immune and inflammatory responses would significantly aid in identifying at-risk populations. Genetic and epigenetic influences play a crucial role not only in infectious diseases caused by pathogens like bacteria and viruses but also in various degenerative disorders, ranging from endometriosis (Bellelis et al., 2019; Garcia-Goméz et al., 2020) to conditions associated with aging, such as senility (Hu et al., 2019).
Therefore, the classification of human immunoinflammatory profiles could lead to improved therapeutic interventions.
Possible suitable times for drug intervention in COVID-19 are indicated by red arrows in Figure 2: a) early (likely involving antivirals), b) symptomatic (likely involving anti-inflammatory drugs), and c) storm (likely involving MAbs and corticoids) (Fig. 2). The landscape of potential drugs for COVID-19 remains largely uncharted due to its emergence as a disease. Developing and bringing a drug or vaccine to market necessitates significant investments of time and resources. The journey from drug discovery in the laboratory through three phases of clinical research involving animal and human populations of increasing sizes typically spans 5-10 years. The intricate process from laboratory to bedside incurs costs ranging from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars for a single drug to become accessible to society. Moreover, even if a treatment exists, it must undergo authorization, registration, and regulation before it can be administered. Given the urgency of managing a deadly and highly contagious disease like COVID-19, repurposing existing drugs emerges as a critical emergency strategy in the integrated approach to pandemic control.
Antivirals are the initial focus when considering treatments for covid-19, given its viral etiology. The mechanisms of virus pathogenesis likely contribute to direct cell destruction and tissue damage. However, it is crucial to consider whether the host response plays a significant role in the disease burden experienced by infected individuals. In response to the urgent need for effective treatments, drug repositioning has emerged as a promising strategy to combat covid-19. These repurposed drugs are already approved for other conditions and have a known safety profile. Additionally, certain anti-inflammatory medications have been explored experimentally for their potential in treating covid-19.
Understanding the intricate pathways and triggers involved in inflammation presents promising prospects for the identification of potential therapeutic targets.
To better manage homeostasis in individuals with a moderate to high immunoinflammatory profile, addressing both inflammation and viral infections is crucial. This approach could potentially mitigate the severity of illness in this particular group.
Numerous pathological mechanisms have been extensively studied and reviewed in relation to COVID-19. These include: 1) the direct attack of the viral particle on lung tissue, leading to cell destruction upon exit post-replication (Tang & Kang, 2020); 2) the dissociation of hemoglobin structure resulting in the production of iron and porphyrin (Wenzhong & Hualan, 2020); and 3) uncontrolled or exacerbated inflammatory responses (see Fig. 3), which have the potential to induce a range of blood-related pathologies such as ischemia and tissue destruction in organs like the heart, brain, kidneys, and lungs (Dhama et al., 2020).
Various drugs have been tested against COVID-19, including antiviral drugs such as favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, ribavirin, and oseltamivir, as well as aminoquinolones like chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Monoclonal antibodies such as sarilumab and tocilizumab, anti-cytokines like anti-IL-6, immune-plasma from recovered patients, plasma containing inflammation regulatory factors like PlasmaCord®, antibiotics like azithromycin, anti-helminthic drugs like nitazoxanide, corticosteroids, immunomodulators like interferon, and other drug classes including camostat have also been investigated. Prices are provided comparatively per 100 mg whenever feasible (see Table II).
Currently, there are over 135 clinical trials underway for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, signifying a significant effort in vaccine development. The journey of vaccines from the laboratory to society typically involves four phases: preclinical (involving non-human animal testing), followed by phases I (focused on safety), II (expanded trials), III (evaluating efficacy), and finally approval (WHO 2020, New York Times 2020). These vaccine candidates employ diverse designs aimed at stimulating the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in humans. These designs include self-amplifying RNA, vectors utilizing chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOx1, adenovirus Ad26, adeno-associated virus for delivering coronavirus gene fragments (gene therapy), vesicular stomatitis viruses, protein-based molecules, whole attenuated viral particles, and repurposed tuberculosis vaccines (WHO 2020, New York Times 2020). Despite the utilization of rapid and combined approaches, the anticipated timeline for a COVID-19 vaccine to reach the market is by the end of 2020 or early 2021. The production, distribution, and availability of billions of doses worldwide will be a monumental task that needs to be meticulously planned and executed.
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, easily transmitted through the air and fomites, with certain cases necessitating hospitalization and costly intensive care treatments.
Certain segments of the population appear to exhibit a heightened susceptibility to COVID-19, with risk groups including the elderly, individuals with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and other comorbidities being significantly impacted by the disease. It is plausible that the genetic, immune, and inflammatory profiles of infected individuals contribute to the varying outcomes of COVID-19, potentially shaping the iceberg-like presentation of the disease (Last, 2013). A deeper understanding of the unique immune and inflammatory responses of individuals could enhance our ability to identify and categorize risk groups, as these genetic and epigenetic factors not only influence viral infections but also play a crucial role in various degenerative conditions, ranging from endometriosis to senility.
Uncontrolled inflammation serves as a pivotal pathological mechanism in numerous infectious and non-infectious conditions. Understanding the intricate pathways of inflammation presents promising avenues for the identification of potential therapeutic targets.
Efficient treatment for COVID-19 necessitates early detection, a combination of drugs targeting the virus replication cycle, and specific, individualized treatment tailored to unique immunoinflammatory human profiles and responses in a timely manner.
Identification of specific immunomarkers of COVID-19 in human serum during onset, follow-up, and resolution of the immunoinflammatory storm holds promise for tailoring individualized therapeutic interventions that could potentially improve patient outcomes.
Pathogen transmission cycles in nature, involving non-human hosts, vectors, and pathogens, frequently deviate from these cycles through a phenomenon known as spillover, where the pathogen moves from its usual cycle to infect a human host. This has been observed in various emerging and reemerging diseases like Zika and yellow fever.
Serious acute respiratory syndromes have recently emerged due to two other coronaviruses that have spilled over from sylvatic cycles (Fig. 3). The first coronavirus, SARS-CoV, resulted in 8096 infected individuals and 774 deaths across various countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and America between 2002 and 2003. The second coronavirus, MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), caused an outbreak in 2012 that was primarily contained within Southeast Asia and the Middle East. MERS-CoV was reported in 26 countries, with 1621 confirmed cases and 584 deaths globally (World Health Organization-WHO, December 7, 2015), suggesting a potential return to sylvatic cycles with camels as reservoirs.
In addition to the emergence of new diseases, recent years have witnessed the resurgence of old diseases, including dengue, yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya, and even measles, for which a vaccine exists.
COVID-19 is unlikely to be the final widespread emergent human disease. Studying human host profiles and immunoinflammatory responses to infectious diseases presents an invaluable opportunity for learning that could pave the way for quicker and more effective strategies in combating the continuously evolving landscape of emerging human diseases.
