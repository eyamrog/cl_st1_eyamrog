This article delves into the contrasting experiences of Ireland and England, shedding light on their differing conceptions and practices of religious education (RE) to establish a normative framework for organizing RE in multicultural states. The analysis delves into three main conceptions of religious education: the liberal perspective, which prioritizes neutrality and objectivity; the pragmatist viewpoint, characterized by egalitarian principles; and the tradition-oriented stance, rooted in substantive ethics. Challenging the notion that RE should solely focus on providing information without critiquing content, the argument is made for an ethical-dialogical approach to RE. This approach advocates for students to engage in learning from each other's beliefs and experiences, drawing from their cultural traditions, while still maintaining the ability to critically evaluate diverse moral perspectives. Particularly tailored for multidenominational schools that acknowledge the ethical value of religious learning, this approach is sensitive to matters of conscience in pluralistic settings.
How can religious education (RE) effectively address intercultural learning in democratic contexts? This article critically examines various conceptions and models of RE in Ireland and England to develop a normative framework that promotes dialogical rationality. Emphasizing the interconnectedness of cognitive and experiential knowledge, I challenge the notion that RE should solely focus on imparting information. I argue that without a transcendental perspective on truth inquiry, egalitarian RE models may not effectively encourage citizens to broaden their cultural perspectives beyond local boundaries. Therefore, I advocate for an ethical-dialogical approach to religious education, which enables students to articulate moral insights based on their personal experiences of religious phenomena and critically evaluate both religious and secular truth claims.
The neutralist-liberal conception of Religious Education (RE) is characterized by a strong emphasis on impartiality, aiming to achieve objectivity, critical analysis, and pluralism in the educational process, aligning with normative principles upheld by the European Court of Human Rights (Folgerø v. Norway, 2007; Hasan and Eylem Zengin v. Turkey, 2008; Lautsi v. Italy, 2011). This perspective suggests the existence of a neutral, independent standpoint of reason that serves as the foundation for normative values and scientific standards in education. Central to this view is a secular understanding of public morality and a formal approach to education that separates cognitive knowledge from its practical application.
In Ireland, proponents of the neutralist-liberal conception include organizations like the Humanist Association of Ireland (HAI), the Education Equality group, and Atheist Ireland. While they collectively advocate for educational system reform to eliminate discrimination in admissions and uphold the rights of children and parents to conscience, their current proposals regarding the teaching of religion exhibit nuanced differences.
In order to promote social cohesion, the public school in the HAI should focus on instilling shared values that cater to the needs of all citizens and groups within the country. Religious Education (RE) should primarily serve an informative purpose, drawing from a comparative analysis of religious and non-religious perspectives. The HAI strongly opposes the denominational model, which it believes exacerbates divisions within Irish society, particularly by segregating students during RE classes. In contrast, the HAI advocates for an inclusive RE model that is accessible to all students without infringing upon their fundamental rights, suggesting that confessional instruction should be limited to outside school hours.
The perception of Religious Education (RE) as advocated by the Humanist Association of Ireland (HAI) emphasizes the objective delivery of RE content in schools, irrespective of their religious affiliations, in order to promote educational neutrality. This stance was articulated in their 2011 submission to the Irish Human Rights Commission regarding Education and Religion.
In an ideal society, religious beliefs would be considered a private matter, with the public arena, including schools, maintaining strict neutrality in this regard. Schools ought to foster social cohesion and an open society founded on common human values, being truly inclusive and accommodating towards the religious and non-religious needs of all individuals they cater to, even the smallest minorities. Failure to do so may lead to a scenario where the demands of powerful or well-organized minorities are prioritized, potentially disregarding the needs of others (HAI, 2001, p. 14).
The relegation of matters of belief to the private realm, along with an egalitarian approach to education that is rooted in "shared human values" and rejects differential treatment based on majority or minority status, reflects a liberal perspective that distinguishes between objective and practical knowledge. In line with this perspective, a religious education curriculum is seen as having the sole objective of exploring the factual and cognitive aspects of religious phenomena.
The concern regarding the objectivity of the educative process is also echoed by Atheist Ireland, which strongly critiques the multidenominational model of Religious Education (RE) implemented by Educate Together schools. They argue that this model tends to introduce symbolic elements that may hinder the acquisition of constructive knowledge while blurring the distinctions between the public and private spheres. According to Atheist Ireland, RE should be free from any influence of religious practices within the local community, advocating for a school environment devoid of celebrations, rituals, and religious symbols. They assert that only this form of secular education aligns with the UN's standards for a pluralistic educational system. In their perspective, achieving this level of secularism is crucial for meeting the requirements set forth by the UN.
A non-denominational or secular school may offer an ethics program, but it typically does not integrate moral and spiritual growth within this curriculum. In such a setting, the emphasis is on acknowledging that morality can exist independently from spirituality, as highlighted by Doyle (2014).
The European Court has consistently emphasized the importance of offering citizens access to an educational system that delivers educational content in an objective, critical, and pluralistic manner. It is reasonable to suggest that a secular education, which primarily focuses on the historical aspect of the religious phenomenon, is best suited to fulfill this objective.
In Ireland, the organization Humanist UK, formerly known as the British Humanist Association, advocates for Religious Education (RE) to be an inclusive, impartial, objective, fair, balanced, and relevant subject that allows students to explore various religions and non-religious worldviews (Humanist UK, 2017). While they appreciated the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority's initiative to release a non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education (NFRE) in 2014, the group has expressed concerns about the adequate representation of Humanism in RE syllabuses as suggested by the NFRE. The NFRE recommended the study of Christianity across all key stages but emphasized a demographic rationale for the understanding of other religious and secular ethical systems. Humanism, according to the NFRE, should be included in the RE syllabus only "where appropriate," with the decision left to the discretion of each Local Education Authority (LEA). Humanist UK argues for equal treatment of Humanism and other religions, advocating for centralization of the RE syllabus in alignment with a National Framework to achieve this parity, contrasting what they perceive as the NFRE's lenient approach (Watson, 2007, p. 2).
The shift towards a broader inclusion of various religions in the curriculum of Religious Education, aimed at fostering impartiality towards diverse religious and non-religious lifestyles, signifies a departure from a detailed examination of religious phenomena. This change reflects a similar epistemological perspective on knowledge acquisition, one that moves away from practical involvement in evaluating ethical aspects.
The National Secular Society shares this perspective, consistently voicing strong critiques regarding the preferential treatment Christianity receives within Religious Education provisions. Emphasizing the importance of maintaining objectivity and neutrality throughout the entire curriculum, the society advocates for a more balanced and inclusive approach to religious teachings in educational settings.
We argue that the comprehensive instruction of a particular faith should fall under the purview of parents, for those who desire it, rather than being a responsibility of state education. Just as the state should not be involved in promoting religious beliefs, it should also refrain from challenging the legitimacy of such beliefs or political ideologies. Consequently, we advocate for the substitution of religious education with a fresh curriculum that enables students to adopt a more impartial and religiously unbiased stance when contemplating moral and ethical dilemmas (National Secular Society, 2013: 9).
Acknowledging that concepts surrounding normative and value-based aspects of religious beliefs can be addressed within a comprehensive curriculum of philosophy and ethics, it is crucial to emphasize the society's stance on the independence of public values from theological moral assertions (National Secular Society, 2017, p. 23).
The argument that the privileging of Christianity in RE syllabuses and school life violates liberal equality by marginalizing minority worldviews and perpetuating dominant structures is a valid concern that warrants attention. Reflective thinking necessitates an appreciation of diverse social values and norms, as highlighted by the liberal objection. However, in the realm of education, it is crucial to consider the experiential aspect of knowledge acquisition. Pragmatist philosophies emphasize the importance of tradition and cultural perceptions rooted in social activities. Scholars like John Dewey and Richard Rorty have underscored the significance of engaging in social experiences as a key component of the learning process. Through collective experiences, individuals gain the necessary resources to derive meaning from their thoughts and surroundings.
Dewey (1929, p. 30) posited that every science aims to illuminate the "specified course of searchings, doings, and arrivals, in consequence of which certain things have been found." This implies that philosophical and scientific consensus is achieved through reconstructing the historical experiences that have shaped individual conclusions about a specific object. These conclusions are based on distinct "choices" regarding justification criteria, necessitating a reconstruction that allows rational agents to assess findings within a shared framework of reasons (Dewey, 1929, p. 31). Dewey also suggested that experience finds its parallels in history, life, and culture, while Rorty (1999), Dewey's disciple, emphasized that intellectual freedom and the pursuit of the good require a socialization process that acquaints individuals with historical narratives and social norms. Individuation, the critical evaluation of social practices following socialization, represents the culmination of education but relies on the cultural resources of language communities. Essentially, being rooted in a tradition precedes engaging in social criticism.
Dewey's and Rorty's perspectives can be elucidated through Thomas Kuhn's concept of scientific paradigms. In his seminal work, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" (1962), Kuhn delves into how the inherent nature of language shapes epistemic paradigms, leading humans throughout history to formulate diverse views of reality based on specific linguistic preconceptions. The transition from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican scientific paradigm, for instance, enabled Western astronomy to adopt new research tools and observe celestial movements in previously static areas of the sky, challenging the notion of the superlunary heavens as perfect. In contrast, Kuhn points out that the Chinese, with cosmological beliefs allowing for celestial motion, had documented observations of new stars in space earlier than their Western counterparts (Kuhn, 1962, p. 116). As Kuhn (1962, p. 113) emphasizes, "What an individual perceives is influenced by both the object of observation and their prior visual-conceptual experiences."
The argument posited is that the pragmatist critique of objective knowledge aligns with a tradition-oriented approach to Religious Education (RE), suggesting that practical knowledge can be enriched through a curriculum that acknowledges and incorporates local cultural practices and students' encounters with religious phenomena. The assertion is that as these practices intertwine to create a collaborative network, Dewey's philosophy presents opportunities for a shared exploration of ideals of a fulfilling life, shaped by cultural perspectives. While I will later distance myself from the non-metaphysical aspects of pragmatist theories, the emphasis placed by Dewey and Rorty on culture as the cornerstone of moral and intellectual investigations resonates with my ethical-dialogical framework for RE.
The assertion that Religious Education (RE) syllabuses, as per the neutralist liberal perspective, should strive to encompass a wide array of religions, prioritizing breadth over depth, neglects the experiential aspect of cognitive knowledge. Ninian Smart (1968, p. 93-94) emphasizes that, akin to the study of philosophy or sciences, comprehending the rationale behind diverse religious belief systems necessitates personal engagement akin to a quest. Smart argues that merely presenting Plato's teachings in a dry manner would lack vitality without a dialogical approach involving objections, connections, and reinterpretations based on specific concerns. Similarly, the history of sciences should elucidate the reasons behind evolving methods and concepts to rectify past paradigms and enhance techniques. Consequently, it is evident that RE is most impactful when it cultivates an engaged attitude where religious content resonates with believers' lives, activities, and aspirations. Notably, each discipline, even in a historical context, intertwines cultural experiences and scientific knowledge, drawing on narratives specific to a particular space-time framework that shapes societal relevance. Thus, the emphasis on Western philosophers like Plato, Kant, or Mill over Eastern philosophies like Confucianism or Daoism in Western philosophy classes reflects their greater influence on social and political practices. However, this should not imply a static view of knowledge, as societal pluralism may prompt a heightened interest in Eastern philosophies. To comprehend alien cultural and intellectual paradigms better, a practical understanding of the activities, attitudes, and lifestyles underpinning those philosophies is essential. Comparing Western notions of individual freedom with Eastern perspectives on collective life and their implications for rights and justice could be enlightening. This comparative approach could be particularly relevant in understanding conflicts between children and parents of Asian descent regarding marital choices. Leveraging the diverse experiences of students from various backgrounds can enhance the efficacy of mutual learning initiatives.
An ethical-dialogical approach that considers the diverse ways in which religion is experienced by members of the main religious traditions in the country, as well as by adherents of minority faiths in specific localities, is advocated over a neutralist model that prioritizes breadth over depth. By adopting this approach, the syllabus can be tailored to not only address general ethical inquiries but also delve into the specific issues that are pertinent to the local community. This framework enables students to engage in meaningful dialogue, facilitated by the syllabus and teacher guidance, where they can inquire about the significance of their religious beliefs and how these beliefs shape their actions. Recognizing the experiential nature of learning, it is also recommended to incorporate intercultural activities such as school visits to museums and temples to further enhance understanding and appreciation of different religious practices.
The pragmatist/postmodern educational framework offers the advantage of considering students' unique experiences in faith activities as a starting point for educational efforts. However, while diverging from the objectivism of liberal stances, it lacks an epistemological or ontological foundation for systematic approaches to critical thinking and self-critique. By focusing on individual and social utility through self-oriented practices and neglecting a comprehensive view of public morality, this perspective inevitably faces the paradox of an autonomous thinking agent that, in exercising its freedom, might choose disengagement and embrace a conservative ethical and moral position.
In Ireland, the Learn Together curriculum, implemented in Educate Together schools, exhibits unique nuances in both its propositional framework and local practices, posing challenges for analysis within the context of specific modalities of Religious Education. Despite this complexity, certain elements within the curriculum reflect a pragmatic/postmodern approach to religion. The curriculum is structured around four distinct strands: Moral and Spiritual, Equality and Justice, Belief Systems, and Ethics and the Environment. While these strands collectively aim to foster an exploration of diverse worldviews and cultivate critical thinking skills for ethical decision-making, the 'Belief Systems' strand emerges as the primary focus on religious topics. This particular strand was meticulously crafted to delve into the major religions prevalent in Ireland, including Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, and Buddhism, delving into their origins, doctrines, symbols, and celebrations.
In the exploration of each religion's worldviews, rituals, and practices, students are encouraged to develop an appreciation for these traditions by seeking out similarities and "common links" between them. Despite the curriculum's goal of promoting critical thinking, it approaches divergent perspectives cautiously, assuming that there are shared elements and values that unite different traditions. This approach is evident in the document's explanation of the objectives of the 'Belief Systems' unit. The first unit, "Introducing Key Figures in the Major Belief Systems," instructs fifth and sixth graders to identify common features among religious leaders and the evolution of various Christian traditions, highlighting issues that arose and the movement towards greater integration (Educate Together, 2004, p. 36). Similarly, the second unit, "Rites and Ceremonies," tasks children with discussing similarities and differences in rituals and ceremonies across major belief systems, emphasizing the identification of commonalities (Educate Together, 2004, p. 37). This emphasis on finding common ground extends to the remaining units, "Celebrations" and "Beliefs and Values," where students are prompted to recognize shared elements in religious festivals and distinct codes and value systems (Educate Together, 2004: 38, p. 39).
The notion of "common links" between diverse religious values and experiences across various traditions suggests that practices in Religious Education serve as a tool to advance predetermined secular objectives linked to the appreciation of cultural diversity. This translates into unique forms of religious expression that, despite their differences, can equally contribute to the cultivation of public virtues and the reinforcement of social bonds by fostering new connections. Notably, in contrast to the stance outlined in the Introduction to the Primary School Curriculum (1999), which emphasizes the spiritual aspect of life as a pursuit of truth and a search for a transcendent element within human experiences, the Learn Together curriculum does not explicitly connect critical thinking with the quest for truth, as the term is absent from the document. While it introduces concepts like reflective thinking and critical knowledge, it adopts a cautious stance towards religious truths and moral inquiries, leaning more towards the assumption that certain notions of equality and human rights form the foundation of all educational efforts. In an article titled "The Religious Void in Irish Education" (2016), Paul Rowe, the CEO of Educate Together, critiques religious educators who argue that the absence of strong denominational influences would result in a "moral vacuum." Instead, he highlights the importance of:
Educate Together challenges the notion that a singular religious or philosophical perspective is essential for moral development or overall human flourishing. Through the collective experience of its schools, the movement has consistently demonstrated the opposite. By prioritizing a robust value system centered on equality and human rights, and fostering a school culture that embodies these principles, Educate Together has proven its capacity to effectively address the diverse educational and social requirements of students. As highlighted by Rowe (2016), this approach enables schools to deliver a holistic, enriching, and inclusive educational experience.
The Learn Together curriculum, despite its emphasis on the cognitive and aesthetic aspects of religious phenomena, lacks the critical approach required for evaluating diverse religious viewpoints on truth and moral inquiry within the realm of Religious Education.
In Britain, the multicultural provisions introduced by the ERA faced criticism for what some perceived as an "Anglocentric" bias towards core subjects. This critique extended beyond history and geography, where non-English and non-Western contributions to British identity were often overlooked, to encompass arts and music, which typically favored European creators. The report Diversity and Citizenship in the Curriculum: Research Review (2007), commissioned by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), highlighted these issues. The authors noted that the National Curriculum tended to promote a narrow sense of Britishness synonymous with Englishness, excluding other groups like Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish, as well as emphasizing Whiteness and Christianity. To counteract this monocultural education, the curriculum should be reformed to incorporate minority narratives and global perspectives on identity formation. Regarding Religious Education (RE), the report pointed out discrepancies between classroom teachings and students' religious practices, as well as the exclusion of minority faiths like traditional African-Caribbean religions.
Despite a sincere effort to promote pluralism in the curriculum, the research adopts a constructivist viewpoint to underscore the dynamic nature of national identities and the challenges linked to educational policies that seek to instill specific contentious political beliefs. While the study makes a compelling argument for revising the History Curriculum to acknowledge the contributions of minority groups to the nation's progress – citing Peter Fryer to highlight the overlooked roles of Asian, Black African, and Caribbean individuals in both world wars – it falls short in establishing a structured framework of ethical perspectives to foster critical thinking. Rather than advocating for a uniform set of values and a unified concept of citizenship, the report advocates for prioritizing "antiracism and the exploration of universal human rights," while also supporting the celebration of diverse cultural identities in public life. The analysis of current views on citizenship education in Britain, which is currently dispersed across various curriculum domains including moral and spiritual education, underscores the importance of recognizing public virtues beyond national values to accommodate ongoing struggles for identity redefinition.
Drawing on Clive Erricker's conceptualization of Religious Education (RE), this study aims to evaluate the pragmatism theories within the realm of multicultural education. Erricker (2007) articulates his postmodern educational philosophy by referencing Kierkegaard's theology of the absurd and Derrida's language theory. Regarding the former, Erricker embraces the idea of God as the Unknown, existing beyond rational comprehension, in a realm of absolute difference that defies conceptualization. He argues that Kierkegaard's view of faith as absurdity highlights the futility of trying to define God through metaphysical reasoning, emphasizing instead a performative approach to religiosity. This performative attitude, oriented towards the unknown, necessitates interpretation and decision-making on the part of the individual in the process of constructing meaning. In essence, the individual must actively choose what to believe, recognizing the inherent uncertainty and complexity of religious faith.
Erricker draws on Derrida's concept of iterability, emphasizing the re-appropriation of meanings in discourse acts to underscore the constructive nature of religious narratives. Rather than attempting to impart moral lessons or advocate for fixed values, educators of religion should encourage individuals to reinterpret religious doctrines based on their own perspectives and requirements. This approach necessitates facilitating dialogical processes that enable students to determine the relevance of religious narratives in their personal lives, drawing from a range of experiences with the religious phenomenon.
Erricker's theory introduces a significant level of pragmatism by challenging the notion that rational actors can assess the validity of religious claims. This shift in perspective removes the emphasis on truth within the educational process, thereby diminishing religion's role in fostering a shared sense of justice and solidarity through common ethical values. With the transcendental nature of moral inquiry stripped away, normative discourses lose their critical function and give way to a utilitarian approach that prioritizes individual will and idiosyncratic objectives. At the communal level, political compromises are relied upon to manage conflicts of interest without seeking normative resolutions, further highlighting the shift towards a utilitarian particularism in societal decision-making.
This pragmatist perspective overlooks the significance of truth in guiding dialogues, trapping social groups within their own worldviews and hindering the broadening of cultural perspectives. Furthermore, by shifting the moral importance of religious interpretations to earthly realities that no longer reference the metaphysical domain, this standpoint neglects potential resolutions to essential normative conflicts. Notably, the concept of truth I advocate is rooted in Jürgen Habermas's (2003) framework of communicative rationality. According to this model, democratic agreements are shaped by moral assertions that mirror truth, as individuals can evaluate their soundness based on a notion of universal justice. While democratic discussions remain ongoing, individuals must inevitably take a stance of "yes" or "no" towards conflicting truth and moral contentions that may challenge their worldview.
Considering that specific vocabularies are shaped by the need for mutual understanding, it is essential for an educational endeavor to adopt a context-transcendental perspective within a linguistic community that remains receptive to transcending its own limitations. Maeve Cooke (2001, p. 14) argues that citizens' pursuit of new semantic meanings, surpassing mere justifications, is grounded in a metaphysical acknowledgment of the stubbornness of reality. This recognition of reality's resistance serves as a catalyst for creative efforts towards semantic and normative innovation, driven by citizens striving for a more refined concept of social justice. Merely relying on an epistemic rationale for moral validity falls short in justifying the quest for context-transcendental rationales through meaningful exchanges with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. The invocation of various historical and religious narratives, rather than an end in itself, should facilitate the collaborative reconstruction of scientific and moral validity claims through intersubjective dialogue. As the process of reconstructing language is oriented towards truth, moral deliberations should lead to shifts in perspectives, fostering the transformation of distinct cultures into a broader political unity. Through the evaluation of ethical norms and truth conceptions, participants contribute to shaping the public sphere with a republican ethos of shared values, either advancing or relinquishing their cultural or religious moral viewpoints in deliberative processes.
It is important to highlight that both the Learn Together curriculum and the Diversity and Citizenship in the Curriculum report fall short in their attempts to define the ethical curriculum by solely focusing on the expression of diverse worldviews. By adopting this approach, they neglect the fundamental ethical inquiries regarding truth and moral validity, assuming that a shared commitment to equality and human rights will naturally foster social cohesion, despite the presence of conflicting narratives. By emphasizing commonalities between religions and invoking human rights principles, these documents tend to adopt a postmodern perspective that shares similarities with certain protestant schools of educational thought from the nineteenth century, particularly those influenced by Friedrich Schleiermacher's theological framework that prioritizes experiences over conceptual knowledge. This perspective tends to view religious diversity as mere linguistic variations of universal human phenomena, overlooking the inherent self-constitutive nature of cultural reasoning systems. It fails to acknowledge that diverse philosophical and cultural frameworks inevitably lead to incompatible moral assertions.
Conversely, given the inherent incompatibility of cultural moral claims, it is imperative for public schools to prioritize promoting truth enquiry over maintaining neutrality towards diverse narratives, while still valuing reflective and critical knowledge. In contemporary democracies, contentious issues such as those in bioethics, gender discrimination, and the balance between individual and collective rights exemplify conflicting perspectives on human rights, rooted in varying ontological and epistemological assumptions. Without a shared foundation of justice principles derived from a priori moral rationales, a purely narrativist approach to moral and political values, divorced from a common commitment to truth and validity, would fail to foster social cohesion. As different cultural groups assert divergent ethical stances, they would soon realize the absence of common ground for accommodating diverse lifestyles within a unified political community, potentially leading to disengagement rather than active participation.
Stanley Hauerwas, emerging from a Protestant background, presents a radical theological interpretation of communitarian virtue ethics. He vehemently critiques Christian movements advocating for a fusion of Church and state, drawing heavily from John Howard Yoder's ideas. Hauerwas approaches any endeavor to control politics in the name of religion with skepticism, arguing that the state's demands for efficiency and security often clash with the essential virtues of faith. He asserts that if Christians were to hold political power, they would likely need to compromise moral principles to accommodate non-Church members. Hauerwas introduces a dichotomy in ethics, distinguishing between 'evangelical counsels' for the devout and 'precepts' for the general populace, highlighting the challenges of universal moral expectations. He expresses deep concern that prioritizing secular governance could force Christians to choose between the gospel's emphasis on selflessness and the nation's inclination towards conflict. Consequently, he opposes state-endorsed religious practices, asserting that religious individuals should not seek political power to reshape societal values. Instead, Hauerwas advocates for focusing on cultivating the virtues essential for achieving communal objectives within the Church.
Hauerwas' assumptions fail to acknowledge the potential for mutual learning that engaging in religious lifestyles within diverse environments could offer believers. By encapsulating a specific notion of the good life and the associated virtues within a narrativist framework of faith virtues, Hauerwas overlooks the opportunity for individuals to expand their religious conceptual horizons, allowing for varied interpretations of applying gospel principles in different social settings. Through the lens of intersubjective reasoning, narratives are constantly evolving, enabling the realization of a virtue framework aligned with contextual objectives. Just as Christians have moved away from endorsing slavery as a legitimate institution, citing biblical justifications (such as St. Paul's actions with Philemon), they can also reassess the significance of Christ's sacrifice in various contexts regarding self-sacrifice. Does it mandate a complete rejection of violence, even in defense of innocent lives, or should it be seen as a guiding principle for fostering forgiveness and averting hatred? By participating in this process of learning, both religious and secular individuals can identify shared moral principles, accommodating diverse perspectives within the Church and pluralistic environments. They may conclude that violence is justifiable for self-defense but prioritize forgiveness over retribution when life-threatening situations are absent, aligning with the principles of national reconciliation exemplified by Desmond Tutu's concept of Ubuntu in South Africa.
The awareness of reason's limitations, coupled with a transcendental pursuit of truth, underpins a shared moral inquiry among individuals striving for a good life. To foster productive engagements, the learning process must be guided by rational exploration of moral agreement and critical evaluation of religious communal objectives and justice concepts. Rather than endorsing a minimalist human rights perspective that overlooks ethical worldview clashes or a pragmatic approach solely focused on communitarian activities, Responsible Education (RE) should facilitate mutual learning through a universal, critical moral inquiry stance. It should also support the reshaping of cultural perspectives, enabling moral dialogues to influence national values and constitutional principles cohesively. Just as divergent lifestyles with distinct religious views on human equality were integrated into a new constitutional framework post-American Civil War, opting for forgiveness over retribution showcases citizens' ability to draw on religious narratives for a collective grasp of civic virtues and a republican justice notion.
According to Andrew Wright and Elina Hella (2008, p. 56), a confessional education refers to any form of religious education where both the learners and the curriculum share a common worldview, as categorized by them. This definition encompasses not only denominational models of religious education but also multidenominational models that seek to explore various religious and non-religious moralities. It is crucial to note that this concept diverges from political liberalism as it is rooted in a substantive ethical framework of political principles that communicates tradition-based reasons through worldviews and cultural perspectives. Comparing religious education in Finland and the UK, Wright and Hella highlight that both systems adopt a "confessional" approach, with Christianity holding a central position in the syllabuses and significantly influencing topics related to moral and civic education in the national curriculum. Additionally, in both countries, students are expected to engage with religious and non-religious worldviews to foster spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development. Nevertheless, as emphasized by Wright and Hella (2008, p. 56), this confessionalism does not imply the uncritical indoctrination of students into a particular worldview. Given that Christianity and secular liberalism are internally contested worldviews, learning within each framework should necessitate critical judgment.
Aligned with the perspectives of Wright and Hella, my proposal advocates for a model of Religious Education (RE) that integrates religious traditions and secular worldviews to facilitate moral learning. This model diverges from a neutralist framework of public reason by fostering students' autonomous thinking in schools through the critical and pluralistic communication and evaluation of substantive ethical claims of justice. To distinguish this approach from the confessional RE typically offered by religious schools, I categorize it as a tradition-oriented conception of RE. This perspective emphasizes the connection between substantive cultural values and educational endeavors. Within this framework, I differentiate between the denominational schooling model and an ethical-dialogical RE. The latter involves multidenominational models that encourage inter-faith dialogue by articulating comprehensive beliefs and experiential knowledge. While both models align with a tradition-oriented RE, I argue that an ethical-dialogical education is better suited to fulfill the demands of a context-transcendent rationality, as defined by Maeve Cooke.
The Irish primary and secondary schooling system predominantly consists of national and voluntary schools under religious patronage, where Religious Education (RE) is typically delivered through a denominational model aimed at instilling students with a specific faith. In Catholic Schools in Ireland, RE adheres to the guidelines outlined by the Irish Catholic Bishop’s Conference, as detailed in the document Grow in Love (2015). One of the key objectives of this educational process is for students to develop "a sensitivity to and knowledge of other Christian traditions (ecumenism)" and "a sensitivity to some other religious traditions and a basic knowledge of their principal beliefs, spiritual values, and traditions (inter-Religious Education)" (Irish Catholic Bishop’s Conference, 2015: 31).
In various Christian schools, the Follow Me program organizes Religious Education offerings for students from the Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, and Methodist denominations. This initiative emphasizes the acquisition of knowledge and the development of critical thinking skills regarding diverse religious traditions, particularly through a distinct segment focused on the exploration of "other faiths." Within this framework, it is highlighted that students ranging from third to sixth grade are encouraged to cultivate an understanding and appreciation of the beliefs and practices of individuals from different religious backgrounds or those who may not adhere to any specific faith tradition, particularly within their school or local communities (Board of Education, 2018).
The tension between National Curriculum guidelines and religious ethos has impacted schools under Catholic patronage, evident in the Church's negative response to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's (NCCA) proposal for an 'Education about Religions and Beliefs and Ethics' programme in 2015. In a consultation report, the NCCA recognized the necessity for a differentiated RE and Ethics education that delves into the nuances of theistic and non-theistic worldviews in a critical and pluralistic manner. While the document explored various approaches to addressing topics related to ERBE within a separate subject or integrated throughout the main Curriculum, particularly in areas like Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and Social, Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE), the NCCA emphasized the importance for patrons to foster a reflective stance towards religious and non-religious perspectives, promoting a pluralist epistemology that examines different faiths and beliefs without favoring one over the other. Despite these efforts, some teachers and Bishops representing Catholic denominational schools raised concerns about the program's feasibility, fearing it could confuse students by presenting conflicting messages about the authenticity of their faith.
The most advanced representation of this concept of Religious Education (RE), which has already been implemented, can be observed in Community National Schools managed by Education and Training Boards (ETBs). Their curriculum, known as Goodness Me, Goodness You (GMGY), highlights the constructivist aspect of the learning process and advocates for a critical approach to RE through inter-religious dialogues within the 'Beliefs and Religion' strand. This approach promotes the exchange of personal belief experiences (both religious and secular) to facilitate children's understanding 'about' and 'from' religion (Education and Training Boards, 2016, p. 14). By inclusively addressing religious and non-religious traditions, the curriculum respects students' diverse backgrounds and cultures, delving into various spiritual concepts and viewpoints through collaborative activities involving parents and faith communities.
In England, every state-funded school, whether voluntary aided, voluntary controlled, or academies (free schools that receive state funds through specific contractual links with the government), is required to adhere to the National Curriculum. The Education Act of 2002 stipulates that the curriculum, in its overarching framework, is designed to foster the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental, and physical development of students within the school and society at large. Additionally, it aims to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to navigate the opportunities, responsibilities, and challenges they will encounter in their future lives.
In voluntary-aided schools, the RE syllabus and daily collective act of worship are determined by the governors, who also oversee staff employment and admission policies. Conversely, in voluntary-controlled schools, these responsibilities fall under the purview of the LEA. The majority of state-funded faith schools in England are historically Christian or Jewish, reflecting the development within these faith communities. However, there are a limited number of Islamic-maintained schools, along with a few Sikh and Hindu voluntary schools. Similar to Catholic and main Protestant Churches in Ireland, many of these faith schools incorporate the study of other religious traditions into their RE syllabus.
In voluntary-controlled schools and community schools, the Religious Education (RE) syllabus of each Local Education Authority (LEA) reflects the official policy concerning the communal aspects of the educational process, rooted in an experiential approach to learning. An example of this is seen in the Birmingham Agreed Syllabus (2007), which delves into the local nuances of Christian faith development while also considering the diverse family backgrounds of students in the classroom. This syllabus aims to incorporate other religious traditions into the RE program to reflect their presence in the local community. The document underscores the significant roles of parents, churches, and community organizations in shaping the religious and ethical development of students, promoting a perspective that encourages mutual understanding among followers of different faiths.
In Cornwall, the prioritization of Christianity over other faith traditions is justified by its role in shaping moral perceptions and providing a framework of meanings that influence society's way of life. According to the United Kingdom: Cornwall Council (2014, p. 12), Christianity significantly impacts the lives of all citizens, regardless of their personal beliefs, influencing aspects such as the calendar, language, and culture while continuing to shape moral perspectives. When examining the development of alternative faith traditions, particular attention is given to the unique characteristics of local groups and their historical evolution, fostering an ethical inquiry rooted in communal experiences. For instance, the document highlights Buddhism as the largest non-Christian tradition in Cornwall, noting that many adherents did not inherit the faith. This prompts educators and students to explore the reasons behind Buddhism's popularity and investigate the connections between Cornish Buddhism and its iterations in Asian contexts.
The research article delves into the Hampshire, Portsmouth, Southampton, and the Isle of Wight’s Agreed Syllabus, which has also been adopted by the City of Westminster’ LEA in London. This syllabus underscores the importance of conceptual inquiry in addressing religious and spiritual themes, aiming to equip children with evaluative skills by articulating their experiential knowledge. The syllabus outlines five foundational steps for Religious Education (RE): 1) Communicate and Apply, where children utilize their experiences to present and discuss concepts like community, celebration, and worship - progressing from a general understanding to specific manifestations in various religious traditions; 2) Enquire and Contextualize, where students recognize differences in interpretation and begin to question meaning and significance; and 3) Evaluate, where they are prompted to make judgments on the relevance of these concepts to a meaningful way of life. The Hampshire syllabus, like the others, promotes an empathetic learning approach, encouraging pupils to gain insight into different traditions by empathizing with others' perspectives. Notably, it emphasizes that during the Evaluation stage, children should be able to conduct two distinct assessment procedures: one based on the standards of the interlocutors within their religious tradition, and another where students reflect on how these concepts and experiences can illuminate their own spiritual journey of inquiry (United Kingdom. Hampshire County Council, et al, 2016).
In 2014, Ofsted released a report focusing on maintained faith schools, emphasizing their role in upholding their denominational ethos through structured practices like prayers, celebrations, and holidays. For instance, Muslim schools typically incorporate five prayer-times into the school day and may limit physical education during Ramadan. A Hindu school mentioned in the report offered Sanskrit classes alongside the National Curriculum and served exclusively vegetarian food. However, the report expressed apprehension about certain Muslim schools potentially deviating from the National Curriculum by attempting to teach required skills in diverse contexts. It underscored the importance of inspectors inquiring about how schools organize their curriculum to ensure the essential skills and subjects are covered. Notably, the report highlighted that while art and music might be restricted in some schools, they are still mandated components of the National Curriculum.
In 2015, Ofsted conducted inspections in 22 independent faith schools, revealing that a significant number, specifically 10, failed to adhere to the prescribed Curriculum standards, while four were unable to demonstrate the promotion of fundamental British values. Ofsted emphasized that the deficient schools lacked a comprehensive curriculum that would enable students to cultivate their aesthetic and creative abilities. Additionally, the report highlighted the failure of these schools to provide a broad understanding of other religious traditions and beliefs, thus limiting students' exposure to diverse perspectives. Gender disparities were also noted in certain Muslim schools, where segregation of men and women for routine tasks was observed, alongside concerns about the exposure of pupils to inappropriate literature containing extremist, sexist, or partisan ideologies. Furthermore, the report expressed apprehension over the inadequate knowledge of British history, politics, and institutions among many students, with a notable lack of awareness about political parties among the majority. (United Kingdom, Ofsted, 2015, p. 15-16).
As previously emphasized, both the Irish and English educational systems recognize the importance of the religious aspect in human development and the interconnectedness of spiritual and moral education. This specific focus, tied to the correlation between spiritual education and communal values, on both local and national scales, marks a notable shift from a neutral standpoint. Nevertheless, the diverse array of experiences with Religious Education (RE) in these nations demonstrates varying methods of organizing the school curriculum, which can either facilitate or impede intercultural understanding and critical dialogue.
The Irish schooling system, as it stands, is primarily denominational, with religious education falling largely under the purview of specific churches and religious organizations. This setup, as outlined in the national Constitution, is designed to uphold freedom of conscience and religion, enabling parents to raise their children in their preferred faith. Furthermore, it underscores a broad recognition of the significance of religious education for citizens, with the option to opt out serving as a deviation from the standard practice, albeit tailored to various denominational viewpoints.
In Ireland, approximately 90% of primary and secondary schools are denominational, whereas in England, this model is primarily found in voluntary-aided schools, independent schools, and faith academies, serving one third of the student population. Independent schools represent a mere 1% of the total school count, educating roughly 7% of students, while faith-maintained schools deliver religious education to about 25% of children. The remaining two thirds of English students attend non-denominational maintained schools, which still provide religious education classes based on the preferences of each Local Education Authority (LEA).
As highlighted by Mawhinney (2007) and Fischer (2016), the Irish educational system is deemed inadequate in terms of democratic pluralism due to its heavy reliance on denominational schools to cater to public schooling needs, leading to discriminatory enrollment policies and the imposition of specific ethos. This setup restricts parents of children with diverse religious or secular beliefs from making informed choices and subjects their children to a unidirectional process of faith indoctrination. While liberal critiques of current state policies hold merit to some extent, as Ireland may not be violating European human rights laws, they fall short of meeting the standards of communicative rationality.
This does not imply, however, that the former prevents every possibility of critical assessment of different religious and non-religious worldviews. The evidence above demonstrates that both the Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland have prioritized equipping pupils with the ability to evaluate truth and moral claims from various religions, evident in sections of their curriculum dedicated to studying other faith traditions. As argued by Terence McLaughlin (1990), a religious upbringing that allows for questioning and exploration of diverse perceptions of reality does not infringe upon the principles of liberal autonomy. Recognizing that child rearing inherently involves imparting specific teachings, moral values, and engaging in practices that foster a sense of comfort and security, it is evident that denominational schooling, in itself, does not violate children's fundamental rights.
When considering faith formation, it is essential to address two key issues through a reflective, dialogical rationality. The first issue pertains to the distribution of denominational and non-denominational schools within a specific region or country, ensuring that parental rights concerning their children's upbringing are safeguarded. Given the compulsory nature of primary education, it is imperative for the state to ensure that schools can accommodate all children in the local community, taking into account their parents' religious or non-religious backgrounds. By prioritizing geographical factors over religious affiliation in the access to public education, the state can ensure equitable opportunities for democratic participation in an educational setting where religious traditions and ethical values are respected. This approach allows all students to engage in truth and moral inquiry at both cognitive and communal levels, fostering a conducive environment for holistic development.
On the other hand, ETB National Community Schools adhere to a model that aligns with the concept of multidenominational education. This approach involves leveraging students' religious backgrounds by encouraging their active participation alongside parents and religious communities in activities aimed at exploring conceptual meanings and spiritual experiences with teachers and peers. By doing so, it acknowledges the importance of familial and community influences on spiritual development, allowing for a degree of subsidiarity in addressing religious matters. Additionally, the GMGY curriculum fosters a dynamic approach to learning, emphasizing an open-ended process that transcends predefined content boundaries. Rather than confining education to a set curriculum, it encourages educators and learners to engage with students' personal experiences, facilitating a reevaluation of their understanding of diverse religious and non-religious perspectives.
In England, the evolution of Religious Education (RE) teaching in voluntary controlled and community schools presents a significant opportunity for reciprocal learning and critical dialogue by articulating substantive ethical perspectives derived from each student's faith background. The syllabuses in Birmingham and Cornwall exemplify this approach by delving into the social and historical aspects of religious practices in their regions, offering valuable insights into the rationale, values, and concepts underpinning spiritual engagements within diverse religious traditions. This framework enables a contextual understanding of the teleological meanings and truth assertions within these faith communities. By emphasizing students' backgrounds and fostering family engagement, RE ensures that spiritual education and growth originate from within the rational frameworks of specific belief systems, while also incorporating fresh perspectives and values over time.
The Hampshire Agreed Syllabus stands out for its potential to foster intercultural learning by viewing Religious Education as a process of conceptual inquiry. This approach aims to delve into children's comprehension of religious values, meanings, and propositions while fostering mutual criticism through empathetic dialogue. Teachers are tasked with prompting students to articulate their perspectives on both familiar concepts like community, ritual, and law, as well as more unique ones such as Umma, Eucharist, and Torah. Through contextualization, children engage with stories, case studies, and testimonies that broaden their intellectual horizons to alternative frameworks of meaning. Ultimately, in the evaluative phase, educators encourage students to transcend their original contexts and consider how these concepts and practices illuminate their own perceptual frameworks. This process involves expanding vocabularies by linking meanings and modes of use to specific worldviews.
In the context of denominational schools, it is essential to consider an ethical-dialogical approach to Religious Education (RE), which necessitates these institutions to acknowledge and engage with religious assertions from various faith communities. In addition to conducting their own RE classes, primarily focused on indoctrinating students into a specific spiritual tradition as per Rortyan perspectives, these schools should also facilitate platforms for inter-faith dialogues. Given that faith narratives are inherently shaped in relation to alternative ways of understanding worldly and spiritual realms, it is imperative to recognize that religious communities must address diverse spiritual claims akin to how they engage with scientific rationality. Just as students are expected to critically evaluate theories proposed by Newton and Einstein based on their overall validity, they should similarly be encouraged to assess the veracity of faith beliefs. While initial suspension of judgment may be necessary to grasp different reasoning frameworks, once familiar with the rational canons of each tradition, individuals may determine which tradition better addresses practical or theoretical challenges that arise from introspective analyses.
A general Education about Religions and Beliefs and Ethics program could be applicable even in denominational schools. However, the NCCA's suggestion of a specific subject or cross-curricular area aiming to present religious content without favoring any faith perspective raises philosophical questions. Does it aim to endorse a neutral or postmodern view of religion, assuming a shared framework of political principles in the public sphere while supporting a relativistic epistemology in the private realm? Or does it encourage cross-cultural understanding to the extent that students are expected to empathize with each other's perspectives? If the former, the Catholic Church's objection to the project due to its incompatibility with their beliefs and educational objectives is valid, and the proposal fails to foster a dialogical approach to truth-seeking as previously discussed. If the latter, it should be recognized that true reflectivity necessitates substantive criticism, allowing for the resolution of inconsistencies and shortcomings within traditions through the acquisition of new conceptual knowledge. Following evaluative processes, this should lead social groups towards a unified ethical system.
Every ethical inquiry commences from a specific historical knowledge base, which is distilled into a cultural tradition. Independent schools, like those scrutinized by Ofsted in 2014 and 2015, should not be exempt from engaging with their society's primary traditional canons, encompassing scientific, moral, and religious worldviews. Concerning gender relations, it is crucial to acknowledge a minimum threshold for normative principles that facilitate discursive practices. While citizens may highlight interdependence between roles and challenge notions of sameness or critique the sexualization of women in sports or the workplace, legal norms that restrict female citizens from accessing education, basic rights, or opportunities for self-expression should not be tolerated. This is because normative frameworks that hinder instruction and communication impede the very process through which societal progress is achieved.
Throughout this article, I have contested the notion that an impartial, neutralist conception of Religious Education (RE) is feasible or preferable. I have highlighted the interconnectedness between the object of scientific inquiry and the rational subject, emphasizing that the observer is inevitably influenced by their historical narratives and epistemic frameworks when selecting and assessing evidence. Subsequently, I have illustrated that multidenominational models of RE, which exclude a critical examination of substantive truths and moral assertions put forth by religious belief systems, neglect the ethical potential inherent in their reservoir of meanings to instigate liberating shifts in perspective. While the primary goal of RE is not to lead students to a specific conclusion regarding the worth of faith-based content within educational settings, it does facilitate a process through which individuals can cultivate critical faculties to autonomously navigate their beliefs over time.
In order to effectively establish a democratic space for ethical inquiry, Religious Education (RE) in common schools should be guided by a dialogical approach that critically examines the truth claims of various traditions. This approach should also consider the social narratives, personal experiences, and background knowledge of students within the classroom. A common school that embraces all members of the local community, respects their cultural and religious diversity, and fosters an environment conducive to democratic deliberation, fulfills the criteria of rational accountability without compromising the moral integrity of individuals. It is essential to avoid a reductionist view of the educational process that neglects the experiential aspect of knowledge in order to maintain the holistic development of students.
