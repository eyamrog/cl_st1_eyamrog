Objective: This study aims to assess the precision of chest computed tomography (CT) scans in individuals presenting with symptoms suggestive of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection at a cancer center.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective single-center study involved the selection of 91 patients who underwent chest CT scans and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests on the same day. The CT results were categorized into negative, typical, indeterminate, or atypical findings. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were computed for two distinct scenarios: in the initial scenario, only typical findings on CT were deemed positive, while in the subsequent scenario, both typical and indeterminate findings were considered positive.
Results: The mean age of the patients was 58.2 years, with a majority being male (60.4%) and having a previous cancer diagnosis (85.7%). Computed Tomography (CT) scans revealed typical findings in 28.6% of cases, indeterminate findings in 24.2%, and atypical findings in 26.4%. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) results indicated a positive presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 27.5% of cases. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the first and second scenarios were 64.0%, 84.8%, and 79.1%, and 92.0%, 62.1%, and 70.3%, respectively.
In conclusion, computed tomography (CT) demonstrates a high level of accuracy in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Various interpretation criteria can yield either heightened sensitivity or specificity. Therefore, integrating CT as a triage test in settings with limited resources during the pandemic can aid in optimizing the utilization of PCR tests, isolation facilities, and intensive care units.
The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2) has led to a surge in demand for healthcare services, with numerous uncertainties surrounding its management. The illness resulting from this virus (COVID-19, coronavirus disease-19) is highly contagious but exhibits a relatively low fatality rate (1–3.5%). However, it is projected that 15–20% of those infected may develop severe pneumonia, with 5–10% requiring intensive care. Older individuals with underlying health conditions face a heightened risk of mortality from the disease. Currently, the established gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) conducted on respiratory tract specimens.
Numerous studies have highlighted the imaging aspects of COVID-19, particularly focusing on high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the chest. While this method is not currently a standard recommendation for screening or initial diagnosis of the disease, it proves valuable in evaluating disease severity, treatment response, identification of complications, and differential diagnoses. Limited research has explored the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT in screening individuals with suspected COVID-19, underscoring its significance in regions where serological testing (PCR) is scarce or delayed due to the presence of other endemic and seasonal viruses.
Cancer patients exhibit a heightened susceptibility to contracting COVID-19 and experience a more unfavorable prognosis compared to non-cancer patients. CT findings have been linked to an elevated likelihood of severe events in cancer patients. Additionally, these individuals face an increased risk of developing various pulmonary complications either due to the disease itself or its treatment, including opportunistic infections, thromboembolism, drug toxicity, actinic pneumonitis, and others. These complications could either present as differential diagnoses or be interconnected with SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients.
The objective of this study was to assess the precision of chest CT scans in patients exhibiting clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 within a cancer treatment facility.
This retrospective, observational, single-center study received approval from the National Commission for Research Ethics, with informed consent being waived. The study focused on patients who underwent chest CT scans for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and had RT-PCR tests collected on the same day between February and March 2020 at a cancer center.
Clinical variables in this study encompassed age, gender, presence and type of neoplasia, time of symptom onset, signs and symptoms upon admission, and serological test results. Two seasoned radiologists meticulously reviewed the chest CT exams, categorizing imaging findings in accordance with the consensus statement on reporting chest CT findings associated with COVID-19, as outlined by the Society of Thoracic Radiology, the American College of Radiology, and the Radiology Society of North America.
Typical findings include multifocal ground-glass opacities with a round morphology, predominantly located in the peripheral, posterior, and diffuse or lower lung zones. These opacities may present with or without consolidation and may exhibit visible intralobar lines, commonly referred to as "crazy paving." Additionally, characteristic signs such as the halo sign and reversed halo sign may also be observed (see Figure 1).
Indeterminate findings refer to imaging features that are nonspecific and do not align with typical characteristics, such as ground-glass opacities that exhibit a diffuse or central distribution, rather than being rounded or unilateral in nature (see Figure 2).
Atypical findings in imaging studies may include isolated lobar or segmental consolidation devoid of ground-glass opacities, discrete small nodules exhibiting a centrilobular "tree-in-bud" distribution, cavitation, isolated pleural effusion, or enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, as illustrated in Figure 3.
The chest CT scan did not reveal any significant findings.
Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables were characterized using mean, median, interquartile range (IQR), and range. Diagnostic accuracy metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were computed for two distinct scenarios. The first scenario considered only chest CT scans with typical findings as positive, whereas the second scenario included chest CT scans with typical or indeterminate findings as positive. The RT-PCR test served as the gold standard for comparison. Proportions were presented alongside binomial exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs), utilizing the "exact" Clopper-Pearson CIs for sensitivity and specificity, and standard logit CIs for PPV and NPV. Sensitivity and specificity comparisons between the scenarios were conducted using the McNemar test, with statistical significance set at a p-value less than 0.05. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS software, version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Out of the 136 chest CT exams conducted during the study period due to clinical suspicion of COVID-19, 91 patients (66.9%) with available RT-PCR results were included in the study. The majority of these patients were male (n = 55; 60.4%), with a mean age of 58.2 years (median, 61 years; IQR, 51–68 years; range, 19–88 years), including 47 (51.6%) individuals aged over 60 years. The most commonly reported symptoms included cough in 55 patients (60.4%), fever in 34 (37.4%), and dyspnea in 36 (39.6%). The average duration of symptoms reported was 6.0 days (median, 5 days; IQR, 1–7 days; range, 1–30 days), with 30 (33.0%) patients experiencing symptoms for 0–2 days, 15 (16.5%) for 3–5 days, and 18 (19.8%) for 6–7 days.
The study revealed that a majority of patients (n = 78; 85.7%) had a previous cancer diagnosis, with hematologic malignancies (n = 21; 23.1%), breast cancer (n = 13; 14.3%), and lung cancer (n = 8; 8.8%) being the most prevalent types. Approximately 25 patients (27.5%) were concurrently receiving oncologic treatments such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy at the time of examination. Additionally, comorbidities were identified in 17 patients (18.7%), with cardiopathy and pneumopathy each occurring in 6 cases (6.6%).
In the study, chest CT scans revealed typical findings in 26 patients (28.6%), indeterminate findings in 22 individuals (24.2%), atypical findings in 24 cases (26.4%), and were negative in 19 subjects (20.9%). RT-PCR results indicated negativity for SARS-CoV-2 in 55 cases (60.4%), positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in 25 patients (27.5%), and positivity for other viruses in 11 individuals (12.1%).
In the first scenario, where only chest CT with typical findings was considered positive, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were 64.0%, 84.8%, 61.5%, 86.2%, and 79.1% respectively (Table 1). In the second scenario, when chest CT with typical or indeterminate findings was deemed positive, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 92.0%, 62.1%, 47.9%, 95.3%, and 70.3% respectively (Table 2). Comparatively, the sensitivity of chest CT was notably higher in the second scenario (92.0% vs. 64.0%; p = 0.016), while the specificity was significantly higher in the first scenario (84.8% vs. 62.1%; p < 0.001).
The findings of the current study demonstrate that chest CT exhibits strong diagnostic performance in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients at a cancer center. The results were categorized based on established criteria for interpreting CT scans in individuals suspected of having COVID-19. Two distinct scenarios were explored for CT interpretation: the first scenario considered only those chest CT scans with typical findings as positive for COVID-19, while the second scenario also included CT scans with indeterminate findings as positive. This distinction proves valuable in situations where CT scans are readily available, but RT-PCR testing is limited, time-consuming, and resources such as hospital beds and isolation units are scarce. Notably, the first scenario demonstrated high specificity, ensuring that patients with positive results are accurately identified for further investigation or intervention, minimizing false-positive outcomes. Conversely, the second scenario exhibited high sensitivity, enabling the identification of patients with negative CT results who may not require additional investigative or intervention measures, such as RT-PCR testing, isolation, or hospitalization, due to the rarity of false negative CT results.
We believe that our data provide clinical evidence supporting the use of CT triage recommendations as an alternative indication in resource-constrained environments for patients with suspected COVID-19 infections. A recent statement by the Fleishner Society suggested that chest CT could be considered for medical triage of patients with suspected COVID-19 who exhibit moderate to severe clinical features and have a high pre-test probability of the disease, particularly in situations where rapid point-of-care COVID-19 tests are unavailable.
Previous studies have reported a high sensitivity of 97% but low to moderate specificity ranging from 25% to 56%. However, these studies did not clearly outline the criteria employed to classify chest CT findings as positive. In contrast, Bai et al. illustrated that CT scans exhibit a high specificity in distinguishing COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias, albeit with a moderate sensitivity. These contrasting results indicate that the diagnostic accuracy of CT scans can vary significantly based on the criteria utilized for evaluating the findings.
It is crucial to note that imaging findings can vary depending on when infected patients undergo imaging (8, 12, 16). Studies have shown that over half of patients scanned within two days of symptom onset may exhibit a negative CT scan (27). In our study sample, 30 patients underwent CT scans within two days of symptom onset, with only two of them showing false-negative results.
This study is constrained by limitations stemming from the small sample size and short follow-up period. The RT-PCR test, utilized as the gold standard in this investigation, is recognized for its high specificity but a sensitivity range of 60–70% in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is acknowledged that RT-PCR testing is susceptible to potential vulnerabilities associated with preanalytical factors such as suboptimal procedures for sample collection, handling, transport, and storage, as well as analytical challenges like testing outside the optimal diagnostic window and other technical issues. Previous research has indicated that individuals with COVID-19 may exhibit early CT changes even before a positive RT-PCR result. To enhance the diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a comprehensive approach combining clinical and epidemiological suspicion with RT-PCR testing and chest CT findings is likely the most effective strategy. Additionally, in cases where initial RT-PCR results are negative but clinical and imaging evidence strongly suggests COVID-19, repeated RT-PCR testing should be considered.
In conclusion, computed tomography (CT) demonstrates a high level of diagnostic accuracy in identifying cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it is recommended that CT be incorporated as a triage tool in settings with limited resources during the pandemic. This integration can aid in optimizing the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, allocation of isolation beds, and management of intensive care units.
