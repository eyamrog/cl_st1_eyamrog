Protection of rivers is crucial for socioecological systems, with benthic macroinvertebrate communities serving as indicators of river water quality. This research aimed to evaluate water quality at Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall in Peruíbe, SP, focusing on benthic macrofauna. Sampling occurred at 3 sites with varying anthropic influences, assessing physical-chemical parameters, sedimentology, and macrobenthic organisms using kick sampling. Organisms were identified to the lowest taxonomic level, with sensitivity and tolerance points assigned based on pollutant response. A biological index was computed to gauge water quality, with ecological indices compared via ANOVA. Physical-chemical parameters met legal standards, and 13 taxonomic groups of benthic macroinvertebrates were identified, showing similar Shannon diversity indices. Taxa scores yielded biological indices ranging from regular to excellent, with Diptera (with head) I as the dominant taxon. Sensitive groups were present across all sites, indicating good water quality during the study period.
Rivers are streams that flow from higher elevations to lower relief areas, ultimately emptying into seas, lakes, or larger rivers. The water in these fluvial systems originates from various sources, including melting glaciers, rainfall, and groundwater (DUNN, 1989). The one-way flow of water supports the development of diverse habitats, hosting a variety of fauna and flora species (BUSS, 2008). These water bodies serve multiple ecological functions, such as regulating erosion and deposition processes, transporting sediment, sustaining the hydrological cycle, and more (ANA, 2008). Additionally, rivers are crucial for human survival, providing essential environmental services.
To maintain a continuous supply of environmental goods and services through ecosystem processes, a high quality of water is essential. However, a concerning 53% of Brazilian cities are experiencing a decline in both the quality and quantity of water resources, with 38% being impacted by water pollution (CAMPANILI et al., 2010). In countries like Brazil, untreated domestic, industrial effluents, and agricultural runoff are frequently discharged into water bodies, exacerbating the issue (SNIS, 2017). The significant presence of contaminants in water leads to the degradation of riverine ecosystems, while the decomposition of organic matter from sewage and industrial effluents results in reduced dissolved oxygen levels, negatively impacting aquatic species (CETESB, 2019). Moreover, the excessive phosphorus content in fertilizers contributes to eutrophication and the uncontrolled growth of algae, some of which can produce and release toxic substances into the water (BARRETO et al., 2013). The disposal of various chemical pollutants like drugs, pesticides, and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from sewage, industrial waste, and agricultural activities further worsens water contamination (Khan, 1977; Liu et al., 2013). Additionally, the natural flow of rivers facilitates the long-distance transport of pollutants, affecting environments far from their original sources (ABESSA et al., 2018).
In this context, safeguarding aquatic ecosystems, particularly rivers, is crucial to fulfill the needs of populations and uphold environmental integrity (Stolton & Dudley, 2003). Various tools exist for protecting riverside areas and water sources, including legal safeguards like those offered by riparian forests, regulated in Brazil by the Forest Code (Brasil, 2012), and the establishment of protected areas designed to preserve water quality, safeguard biodiversity, ecological processes, forest remnants, and environmental services (Magini & Abessa, 2017).
The increasing establishment of protected areas globally is frequently motivated by the imperative to safeguard habitats and/or species facing threats or critical conditions (BORRINI-FEYERABEND et al., 2017). Nonetheless, water conservation is frequently neglected in these efforts. Regardless, determining the carrying capacity of the protected area is crucial in any scenario for the preservation of the ecosystem in question (JALLIAN et al., 2012) and should, therefore, be consistently assessed and supervised.
Research indicates that tourism in rivers within protected areas, like the Formoso River in the Formoso River Ecological Park in Bonito and the Prata River in the Private Reserve of Natural Heritage (RPPN) Fazenda Cabeceira do Prata, both situated in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) in the central-west region of Brazil, has a significant environmental impact. These rivers are renowned touristic destinations, as highlighted by ESCARPINATI et al. (2011) and COELHO et al. (2011).
The Brazilian System of Protected Areas (SNUC) aims to promote scientific research and environmental monitoring by providing means and incentives (BRASIL, 2000). Biomonitoring, a valuable tool for achieving these objectives, involves the assessment of bioindicator organisms or communities, which are organisms with known tolerance ranges to pollutants (PHILLIPS; RAINBOW, 2013). A common approach to biomonitoring involves analyzing benthic macrofauna, where the taxonomic identification of macroinvertebrates is used to evaluate water quality based on their responses to environmental variations (PIEDRAS et al., 2006). Macroinvertebrates play a crucial ecological role and serve as vital links within the food chain. Due to their association with the substrate, submerged vegetation, and water column, as well as their sensitivity to environmental changes, they are widely utilized for monitoring water quality globally (FRANÇA; CALLISTO, 2012). Various protocols are available for watershed biomonitoring using microbenthic communities (MORSE et al., 2007; BUSS, 2008).
In developing countries such as Brazil, protected areas often lack a management plan, necessitating urgent research to generate knowledge and support effective management. The Jureia-Itatins Mosaic of Protected Areas serves as a significant example of this issue, lacking a management plan and requiring scientific information. Situated within the Atlantic Forest biome, a biodiversity hotspot, this region is crucial for conservation efforts as one of the largest preserved fragments of the Atlantic tropical rainforest in the country. Unfortunately, it has been experiencing significant loss of area due to urbanization and agricultural activities in its vicinity (CERATI; ZANINI, 2009).
Itinguçu State Park (PEIT) is a part of the protected areas within the mosaic and encompasses the picturesque Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, which is formed along the course of the Itinguçu river. The biota of this region comprises 29 fish species across 12 families, alongside a diverse array of insects, lizards, squirrels, snakes, sloths, and other wildlife (MAGINI; ABESSA:, 2017). The waterfall stands out as the primary tourist attraction, experiencing its peak visitation during the summer months. In 2008, the site welcomed 45,217 visitors, prompting authorities to impose restrictions on daily visitation numbers until further studies could determine the optimal maximum capacity for visitors (MAGINI and ABESSA, 2017).
The establishment of regulations to govern site usage in order to mitigate negative effects is imperative, given that tourism, even when labeled as ecotourism, has the potential to cause harm (RUSCHMANN, 1993). Within this framework, water contamination from tourists can result from the application of substances like sunscreens, insect repellents, moisturizers, solid waste, sedimentation, and other sources (RUSCHMANN, 1993). This study seeks to evaluate water quality at Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall (Peruíbe, SP, Brazil) through benthic macrofauna biomonitoring.
The Itinguçu State Park (PEIt) spans an area of 5,040 hectares and is situated between the cities of Peruíbe and Iguape in the state of São Paulo (SÃO PAULO, 2013). Designated as a whole protection area, PEIt functions as a no-take zone, permitting public visitation for recreational purposes while also potentially incorporating elements of environmental education. The park's landscape is characterized by short rivers that flow from the mountainous region to the beaches, including the Guaraú and Itinguçu rivers, along with the beaches of Guarauzinho, Arpoador, Parnapoã, Brava, and Juquiazinho (MAGINI; ABESSA:, 2017). Divided into two primary sections, Arpoador and Itinguçu, both areas feature Atlantic Dense Rainforests, with the Arpoador section additionally encompassing mangroves and restinga forests.
The PEIt features several trails utilized for visitation, monitoring, and circulation, among other purposes, including one specifically designated for accessing the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall (Figure 1), as previously noted (SMA, 2009; MAGINI and ABESSA, 2017). Situated between the Itatins Mountain Ridge and the coastal plain, the waterfall stands at an altitude of 35m and lacks a vertical drop, instead featuring a 17-meter step known as the Paraíso toboggan. While the access path remains relatively well-preserved, the presence of trails and visitor activity can potentially lead to adverse impacts, such as habitat fragmentation, erosion, silting, soil compaction, and pollution of both soil and water (SMA, 2009).
In this particular context, Normative Ordinance 144/2010 of Fundação Florestal sets the daily visitor limits at Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, currently capped at 180 for individual visitors and 90 for organized groups. This restriction aims to mitigate potential impacts on the preserved area and ensure the waterfall's use as a tool for environmental education. The presence of restaurants near the visitor center (MAGINI; ABESSA:, 2017) serves as a vital income source for the local community; however, it can also result in adverse effects such as water pollution from improper waste disposal and an increase in river siltation, potentially harming the local biota.
The sampling was conducted on October 19, 2020, during a dry period to prevent the occurrence of waterspouts, a phenomenon where rainfall at the river's source leads to a sudden surge in water flow. This precaution was taken to ensure the safety of the researchers involved in the sampling process and to prevent any potential disruptions to the investigation due to the displacement of organisms (BUSS, 2008). Samples were collected at three distinct sites (Figure 1): P1, situated upstream of the public use areas (reference point); P2, at the primary bathing location; and P3, at a secondary bathing spot.
Water samples were collected for the validation of parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and temperature, utilizing a multimeter probe. Additionally, sediment samples were gathered and preserved at 4°C in the laboratory for subsequent analysis of organic matter (OM) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) contents, as well as grain size distribution. Initially, the sediment samples underwent drying at 60 °C for 48 hours as per the method outlined by CARMO and SILVA (2012). The quantification of OM was conducted using Goldin's gravimetric method (1987), involving the distribution of 5g aliquots in porcelain crucibles, followed by weighing before and after conditioning in the muffle at 550 °C for 4 hours. The loss of mass of the incinerated waste indicated the OM content. The determination of calcium carbonate content was achieved through gravimetry by hydrochloric acid (HCl) digestion, which reacts with CaCO3, liberating carbon dioxide and solubilizing the Ca, leading to sample weight reduction, as described by GROSS (1971) and LORING and RENTALA (1992). The grain size distribution was carried out using the dry-sieving method, where 60g of dry sediment was sieved through a series of meshes (φ scale) and mechanically agitated for 15 minutes. Subsequently, the quantity present in each mesh was weighed on a high precision balance to ascertain the amounts of each particle size class in the sample. The granulometric classification method was based on the scales proposed by Wentworth (1922, 1933) (mm) and Krumbein (1934) (Fi).
The sampling method utilized in this study followed the protocol outlined by Buss (2008), with adaptations suggested by CETESB (2019). This protocol emphasizes the importance of considering various mesohabitats, including fine substrate (comprising fine sands and muds), thicker materials (such as coarser sands), gravel, pebbles, loose rocks, and others. In the specific case of the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, the environment was identified as a mesohabitat characterized by thick substrate, which is anticipated to exhibit lower biodiversity compared to other habitats (Buss, 2008). Each sampling site was divided into three distinct sections within the same mesohabitat, and sampling was conducted using a sieve with a mesh size of 0.5-0.6 mm (Buss, 2008) through the kick sampling technique, involving collection directly from the substrate (Buss, 2008; Feeley et al., 2011; CETESB, 2019). The organisms collected were examined under a stereo microscope, separated from the sediment, and preserved in 40% alcohol. Subsequently, taxonomic classification was performed on the specimens, as elaborated further in the subsequent sections of this study.
Macroinvertebrates are organisms that are large enough to be retained on a 1 mm mesh and can be observed without the need for equipment like microscopes. Benthic macrofauna encompass a diverse array of taxonomic groups, including insects, mollusks, and crustaceans, among others.
Biomonitoring involves utilizing data on organism distribution within habitats to assess environmental conditions. To achieve this, organisms sampled were meticulously identified at the most specific taxonomic level using identification keys. The methodology advocated by CETESB (2019) suggests assigning points to each organism based on their sensitivity and tolerance to pollutants, categorizing them as (5) sensitive species, (4) indifferent, (3) tolerant, (2) second-order opportunists, and (1) first-order opportunists (BORJA et al., 2000; BORJA; MUXIKA, 2005). Subsequently, a biological index is computed by summing these values to indicate water quality, which can range from very poor to excellent (BUSS, 2008; CETESB, 2019). These indices facilitate qualitative comparisons between different sampling sites, enabling the assessment of water quality variations.
Ecological indices were computed to evaluate the macroinvertebrate community's reactions to environmental fluctuations, including specific richness, evenness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity, utilizing Primer® 6.0 software (Borja et al., 2000; Borja; Muxika, 2005). The ecological indices were further scrutinized through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Cluster analysis was conducted to examine the community structure, employing Simpson's index and comparison by paired groups with the objects and descriptors.
The physical-chemical parameters of the Itinguçu River water fall within the acceptable ranges for freshwater bodies as outlined in CONAMA Resolution 357/05 (BRASIL, 2005). The waters were slightly acidic, with elevated levels of dissolved oxygen and minimal turbidity, as indicated in Table 1. Temperature readings fluctuated between 22.7 and 23.1 ºC.
The sediment textural data obtained from samples collected at the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall revealed a predominance of coarse and very coarse sands, as indicated in Table 2. The standard deviation suggested a poor selection of grains, with the sediment also containing pebbles and very fine sands. These findings imply that the sediments are likely sourced from nearby areas (McCave & Syvitski, 1991). Furthermore, the prevalence of coarser grains signifies a high-energy environment, typically associated with waterfalls due to the strong water flow. Generally, these sediments were found at shallow depths relative to the water level (Bujan et al., 2019).
The sediment samples analyzed revealed low levels of CaCO3, ranging from 0.099 to 0.845 (Table 2), indicating a scarcity of bioclastic structures like shells. This deficiency can be attributed to the swift river flow, which efficiently sweeps away the lighter CaCO3 fragments downstream. Similarly, the organic matter (OM) content was also found to be low (4.51; 6.28; 4.74, respectively), a consequence of the high water flow that impedes the deposition of organic material, as previously discussed by TEIXEIRA et al. (2000).
Twenty-one taxonomic groups were identified across the three sampling sites (see Table 3), up to the taxonomic levels of order and family. Beghelli et al. (2012) demonstrated that reaching the species level identification of benthic macroinvertebrates is contingent upon the collection and analysis of nymph, pupa, and larva phases, a task deemed unattainable at present. Furthermore, Silveira (2004) highlighted the successful biomonitoring of microbenthic communities through the identification of organisms at broader taxonomic levels, such as class.
In an initial analysis conducted by replicates, it was observed that P3C and P2C had a higher number of individuals sampled, while replicate P1A exhibited a greater number of taxonomic groups (10) compared to P3B, which only had 3 groups. Pielou's equitability (J) values at each sampling site indicated that a significant proportion (above 77%) of the maximum diversity was present in all samples with minimal variation between them. The Shannon diversity index displayed some differences between replicates, yet the mean values calculated for each sample were 2.13, 2.16, and 2.12, respectively (refer to Table 4). This suggests a uniformity in the assemblages across the three sampling sites. Focusing on the replicates, Margaleff richness values ranged from 0.83 (at P3B) to 3.11 (at P1A). ANOVA results indicated that ecological indices such as diversity, richness, and evenness were consistent among the samples. The high levels of diversity, richness, and equitability point towards good water quality in the Itinguçu River, particularly at the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall.
Biological indices were computed following the guidelines outlined by CETESB (2019, and revealed the presence of sensitive organisms, such as Trichoptera (with house) and Plecoptera, which received the highest score of 5 (refer to Table 5). Tolerant organisms, including Diptera, Nematoda, Hirudinea, Turbellaria, Polychaeta, and Oligochaeta, were also identified and documented in Table 4. By summing the points assigned to the organisms at each sampling site, the ecological index for each replicate and sampling site was determined. The majority of replicates were classified as excellent or good quality, with only two replicates (P2A and P3B) falling into the regular quality category. Additionally, upon grouping the replicates to assess water quality at each sampling site, all three locations were deemed to have excellent water quality based on the index.
The cluster analysis revealed that the sampling sites exhibited similarities of 50% or more, as indicated by the taxonomic composition of the respective sampling replicates (see Figure 2). Notably, two primary groups emerged: one encompassing all P2 replicates and two from P3 (P3A, P3B), albeit differentiated by sampling site; and a second group comprising replicates from P1 and P3C. This analysis underscores a notable resemblance between the assemblages of P1 and P3. Conversely, the species-based cluster analysis did not yield distinct associations, likely due to the prevalence of "double-zeros," with most groups occurring in only a few replicates, except for Diptera with head I and II, and Diptera without head.
Research on the benthic ecology of rivers and creeks along the Atlantic coast of Brazil, particularly within protected areas like the Jureia-Itatins Mosaic where the PEIt is situated, is notably scarce. Therefore, this study holds significant relevance as it contributes new insights into water quality, as well as the composition, diversity, and status of benthic macroinvertebrates specifically at the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall.
The quality of water is contingent upon its physical, chemical, and biological variables. While physical-chemical parameters are crucial, singular measurements only reflect instantaneous conditions that may not necessarily represent the overall water quality. Conversely, resident organisms can serve as long-term monitors of water quality (Gorni & Alves, 2012). The physical-chemical parameters of the Itinguçu River fell within the normal ranges specified by federal standards for protected areas (Class 1 waters) and were consistent with values reported in the literature for environments exhibiting good water quality (Lutz, 1968; Yanoviak, 1999; Hrovat et al., 2009; Monteiro et al., 2008; Taniwaki & Smith, 2011; Tszkydel et al., 2015). Furthermore, these values closely resembled those observed in rivers within the Intervales State Park, SP (Alves et al., 2008; Melo, 2009).
The sedimentological data revealed no significant divergence among the sampling sites, suggesting that variations in taxa distribution along these sites were primarily influenced by sedimentological factors. The resemblance between sites could potentially elucidate the similarities observed in benthic assemblages across the sampling locations. The organic matter content in the sediment of Cachoeira do Paraíso closely resembled that reported by Cunha and Calijuri (2008) in a study of lotic environments near our study site in Iguape, SP. In line with our findings, the authors linked the low organic matter levels to multiple factors, including high energy conditions (Cunha; Calijuri, 2008). It is crucial to note that the river regime at Cachoeira do Paraíso is heavily influenced by rainfall, with intense rainstorms significantly altering conditions and rendering the river environment highly unstable. During periods of heavy rain and thunderstorms, benthic organisms may be easily displaced and carried downstream, potentially explaining the characteristics observed in the samples.
The Diptera taxonomic group, including the head, was the most abundant among the sampled organisms, totaling 80 individuals. First-order opportunistic organisms exhibit a high tolerance to contaminants, changes in physical-chemical patterns, and climatic variations. Taxonomic groups like Diptera, Nematoda, Hirudinea, Turbellaria, Polychaeta, and Oligochaeta fall into this category. Additionally, the distribution of some representatives of these groups is linked to the substrate type and water flow in the environment (POE; STEFAN, 1974; GORNI; ALVES, 2012). These freshwater organisms typically inhabit the sediment surface and play a vital role in organic matter decomposition. For instance, Oligochaeta individuals actively contribute to water purification, serving as primary consumers or decomposers (UZUNOV et al., 1988; ABEBE et al., 2006). Other representatives like Turbellaria and Hirudinea have limited dispersion in the environment and may be characteristic of the specific environment under study (KNAKIEVICZ, 2014; METCALFE et al., 1984).
The order Diptera encompasses numerous organisms that are commonly found in polluted water bodies, including those receiving sewage inputs, stagnant water in urban settings, and others (FAGUNDES; SHIMIZU, 1997). Additional research indicates a higher Diptera density in degraded environments, attributed to the abundance of organic matter (OLIVEIRA et al., 2010; MACHADO et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the prevalence of primary opportunistic organisms in the Itinguçu River is likely influenced more by natural factors, such as significant fluctuations in river flow, rather than anthropogenic factors.
Second-order opportunistic organisms, such as the family Ceratopogonidae within the Diptera order and the Odonata order, exhibit a higher density and richness of larval groups in forested environments compared to deforested areas. Research indicates that the deposition of eggs is hindered in deforested regions due to increased exposure, leading to a greater abundance of Ceratopogonidae larvae in forested settings (YANOVIAK 1999a, 2001; NGAI et al. 2008). The presence of these organisms in the samples collected at the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall and its surroundings can be attributed to the favorable environmental preservation in these areas.
Both Ceratopogonidae and Odonata may be influenced by periods of rain and dry spells, as well as by various water physical-chemical parameters including conductivity, temperature, pH, and turbidity (BULÁNKOVÁ, 1997; YANOVIAK 1999ª). The larval development of numerous Odonata species is closely linked to temperature; Lutz (1968) proposed that 20 °C could be a limiting factor in temperate environments, although this threshold remains unknown for tropical and subtropical rivers. In the context of this study, Odonata were exclusively observed in P1.
The tolerant group in this study consists of the Ephemeroptera order, known for its long life cycle and sensitivity to changes in physical-chemical parameters of the aquatic environment, such as conductivity, nitrate, and dissolved oxygen (TIMM, 1997; HROVAT et al., 2009). Hrovat et al. (2009) demonstrated that water body depth influences the distribution of these organisms. Ephemeroptera individuals are typically found in lotic environments, where they can reach high densities, but their distribution is significantly affected by spatial changes, often concentrating along stream banks (HROVAT et al., 2009). In the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, they were observed at low densities in P1 and P3.
Sensitive organisms were collected in all sampling sites, with the order Plecoptera standing out for its high sensitivity to pollution and low levels of dissolved oxygen, as indicated by a high score in the calculation of the biological index (TIMM, 1997). Studies conducted in Estonia further underscored Plecoptera's sensitivity to physical-chemical water parameters like pH and temperature (TIMM, 1997; HROVAT et al., 2009). The order Trichoptera, comprising various species found globally, thrives in cold, flowing waters such as waterfalls and springs, with their larval forms exclusively aquatic. This group is recognized as an excellent biological indicator, particularly certain species highly responsive to pollutants (HOLZENTHAL et al., 2015). Within this group are species that construct protective, predatory, or organic matter filtration structures using materials like sand, rocks, and leaves (HOLZENTHAL et al., 2015), alongside free-living species that do not engage in such construction activities (HOLZENTHAL et al., 2015).
Despite the overall similarity of the benthic macrofauna assemblies across the three sampling sites, the cluster analysis revealed some minor distinctions. Primarily, there was a notable resemblance between replicates, indicating consistency within the data. Additionally, subtle variations were observed among the sampling sites, as illustrated in Figure 2. The underlying reasons for these differences remain uncertain and could potentially be attributed to natural influences, such as hydrogeochemical properties, or anthropogenic factors like pollution or human disturbance.
The assortment of organisms in mesohabitats was found to be sufficient as these areas are conducive to the presence and establishment of benthic macroinvertebrates, offering benefits such as a food source, breeding grounds, and physical substrate. However, fluctuations in these factors could impact the distribution of organisms across various mesohabitat locations (Gorni & Alves, 2012). Furthermore, these organisms serve as effective spatial indicators of habitat disturbances due to their limited mobility within the environment (Beghelli et al., 2012).
Within the realm of ecological indices, the biological diversity highlighted in this study showcases elevated values in comparison to research conducted in areas impacted by human activities. Notably, Diptera and Oligochaeta emerged as the predominant organisms in these regions, known for their high tolerance to contaminants (BEGHELLI et al., 2012; TANIWAKI; SMITH:, 2011). The Shannon diversity index values obtained from the three sampling sites closely mirrored those documented by Rosa et al., (2011) at the Poço D'Anta biological reserve in Minas Gerais. However, the richness values were comparatively lower than those observed in muddy sediments. The Itinguçu river's water regime and sediment texture were identified as factors hindering the development of macrobenthic communities, unlike areas with fine sand and muddy sediment (HYNES, 1970, ROSA et al., 2011) characterized by more stable conditions. Furthermore, the high equitability observed implies a favorable water quality, as lower values are typically associated with diminished quality environments. The findings from this study contribute to the assertion that the Itinguçu River, particularly in the vicinity of the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, maintains good water quality standards (SILVEIRA, 2004). This assertion is further supported by the biological indices calculated (CETESB, 2019), which classified all three sampling sites as exhibiting excellent quality. Nevertheless, given that the sampling occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when visitor restrictions were enforced, it is prudent to interpret these results with caution. Continuous monitoring of the river is recommended to assess whether the conditions remain unchanged post the return of visitors, particularly at sites P2 and P3 (GOUVEIA, 2014). Such ongoing studies would be instrumental in identifying the key factors influencing the structure of the benthic macrofauna community at the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall.
Biomonitoring through the observation and calculation of biological indexes using macroinvertebrates has demonstrated its effectiveness, making it a viable alternative to traditional water quality assessments like chemical and microbiological analyses (ESCARPINATI et al., 2011).
The current study represents the initial data collection on the macroinvertebrate community composition at the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, which is fed by the Itinguçu River in PEIt, SP, Brazil, along with an assessment of water quality. The physical-chemical parameters observed were within acceptable ranges for rivers within restricted protected areas and were consistent across all sampling sites. Sediments were predominantly sandy with low levels of organic matter and CaCO4. Utilizing classical ecological indices, exploratory analysis, and a biomonitoring index, the study consistently indicated the high quality of water at the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, ranging from good to excellent. Furthermore, the biomonitoring approach, focusing on benthic macroinvertebrates, demonstrated its effectiveness for assessing streams within the protected regions along the Atlantic coast of Brazil.
