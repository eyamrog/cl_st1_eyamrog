Salinization resulting from irrigation in agricultural areas has become a global concern. This research focuses on examining the impact of salt stress on the germination and early growth of Ruta graveolens L. Common rue seeds were exposed to varying concentrations of sodium chloride and calcium chloride, ranging from zero to -0.4 MPa. Germination tests, initial germination count, seedling length, and dry weight measurements were conducted to evaluate the seed responses under different saline conditions. The findings indicate that excessive salt levels hinder both the germination percentage and the initial growth of common rue seedlings, irrespective of the type of salt used to induce stress.
Seed germination is a critical and delicate phase in the plant life cycle, playing a pivotal role in seedling establishment and subsequent plant growth. This process is significantly influenced by various abiotic factors, including temperature, oxygen levels, and water availability (Carvalho & Nakagawa, 2012). Water, in particular, emerges as a crucial determinant for non-dormant seed germination, impacting the percentage, speed, and uniformity of germination. Its presence is closely linked to reserve mobilization and the release of energy through respiration, thereby stimulating enzyme activity and growth regulator function. Moreover, water plays a vital role in diluting the protoplasm, facilitating metabolic processes geared towards the resumption of embryonic growth (Marcos Filho, 2015).
Understanding water relations is crucial for comprehending the seed germination process under water stress conditions. Currently, approximately 20% of irrigated land is affected by salt stress, highlighting the significance of this issue (Taiz et al., 2017). Soil salinization, primarily caused by inadequate agricultural practices like the excessive use of salt-rich fertilizers and inefficient crop irrigation methods, poses a significant threat to agricultural productivity (Cruz et al., 2017). Salinity adversely impacts crop yield by limiting soil water availability and inducing toxicity from elements like sodium and chlorine (Souza et al., 2014). Moreover, it leads to protein denaturation, membrane destabilization, and hindered photosynthesis, ultimately impeding above-ground plant growth (Taiz et al., 2017).
Several researchers have investigated plant propagation under varying levels of simulated saline stress. However, there is a noticeable gap in the literature concerning the evaluation of salt effects on common rue seed germination. Common rue (Ruta graveolens L.), a member of the Rutaceae family, is typically grown from seeds and is valued for its medicinal properties attributed to secondary metabolites like flavonoids, coumarins, organic acids, terpenoids, lactones, and various alkaloids (Ratheesh et al., 2009). Among these compounds, rutin, a flavonoid found in the leaves, has been recognized for its antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory attributes (Benazir et al., 2011).
The common rue thrives in neutral, well-drained soils that are periodically irrigated and receive full sun exposure. Once established, the plant can withstand drought conditions but is intolerant of waterlogged soils. Its growth is particularly robust in semi-arid environments, where it can flourish in nutrient-poor soils and endure high temperatures (Corrêa Júnior et al., 1994). Regrettably, this species remains inadequately researched in various agronomic aspects, particularly in relation to saline stress conditions.
Understanding the varying responses of different plant species to excessive salt exposure is crucial for identifying potential strategies for controlling salinity in arid and semi-arid regions, where soil salinization is a persistent issue (Oliveira & Silva, 2019). Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the germination and early growth of common rue under various levels of salinity.
The experiment was conducted at the Plant Genetics Laboratory within the Department of Biology, College of Natural and Exact Sciences at the Federal University of Santa Maria (RS). Common rue seeds procured from the ISLA Seeds Company (Porto Alegre, RS) were utilized. To break dormancy, an initial pre-cooling phase at 5 ºC was implemented for seven days, in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Rules for Seeds Testing (Brasil 2009).
To assess the impact of saline stress on the germination of common rue seeds (Ruta graveolens L.), solutions of sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) were prepared at concentrations representing zero, -0.10, -0.20, -0.30, and -0.40 MPa. Distilled water served as the control at the zero level. The determination of the solution quantities needed to achieve specific osmotic potentials was carried out using the Van't Hoff equation, as outlined in previous studies (Braccini et al., 1996; Taiz & Zeiger, 2013).
The impact of salts on seed germination was assessed through a series of tests.
Germination tests were conducted using four replicates of 100 seeds each, which were evenly distributed in plastic boxes known as gerboxes. These seeds were placed on three germitest paper sheets that had been moistened with either distilled water or a saline solution at a ratio of 2.5 times the weight of the paper. Following sowing, the plastic boxes were placed in a Bio-Oxygen Demand (BOD) chamber set at a constant temperature of 20 °C under continuous light exposure. Seed germination assessments were carried out at both seven and 28 days, marking the conclusion of the test, with the results being reported as percentages according to the methodology outlined in Brasil (2009).
The initial count was performed in conjunction with the germination test, during which the percentage of normal seedlings was assessed on the seventh day of the experiment (Brasil, 2009).
Seedling length was assessed by sowing four sets of 20 seeds, which were either moistened with distilled water or a solution. These seed batches were enclosed in paper rolls and placed in a germination chamber at a consistent temperature of 20 °C for a period of seven days. Subsequently, the total length of 10 randomly selected normal seedlings was measured using a millimeter ruler for each set. The average length of the seedlings was calculated by summing the measurements from each set and dividing this total by the number of normal seedlings assessed, with the results reported in centimeters (cm) as outlined by Nakagawa (1999).
The dry weight of the seedlings was determined by initially obtaining the fresh weight from 10 normal seedlings that had been previously measured, with four replicates. These seedlings were then placed in paper bags and dried in a dryer at 60 °C until a constant weight was achieved, which took approximately 48 hours. Following this, the seedlings were weighed using a precision balance with a sensitivity of 0.001 g, and the results were reported in milligrams (mg) as per Nakagawa (1999).
Data analysis: The experimental design followed a completely randomized 2 x 5 factorial scheme, incorporating two salts and five saline concentrations. Percentage-based variables were transformed into arc sen <> for analysis. The data underwent analysis of variance, with significant findings leading to qualitative variable comparisons through the Scott-Knott test at a 5% error probability level. Quantitative variables were further analyzed using regression analysis with the Sisvar software (Ferreira, 2011).
Variations in the functionality of salts and osmotic potentials of solutions were noted during the analysis of germination data for common rue seeds, as depicted in figures 1 and 2. The absence of salts resulted in the highest germination percentages at 82%, with a noticeable linear decline in germination rates as NaCl concentrations increased, dropping below 50% at a CaCl2 potential of -0.1 MPa (figure 1a).
The initial germination count conducted seven days post-sowing revealed a delay in germination for seeds exposed to saline stress. A gradual decline in the percentage of normal seedlings was observed with increasing NaCl concentration, with no germination occurring from seeds at -0.3 MPa of CaCl2 (see Figure 1b). This phenomenon could be attributed to the reduced rate of seed water absorption as water potential decreases, while the surplus of salts leads to cytotoxicity and cell dehydration, ultimately diminishing metabolic activity and impeding the synthesis of new tissues in the seeds due to limited water availability (Marcos Filho, 2015). Consequently, water accessibility diminishes, potentially lowering the percentage of seeds that successfully complete germination or even completely halting the process (Velázquez-Márquez et al., 2015).
Stefanello et al. (2018) reported similar findings when investigating the impact of varying salt concentrations on the germination of common thyme seeds (Thymus vulgaris L.). Their study revealed a detrimental effect of NaCl and CaCl2 salts on seed germination and vigor, with observed negative impacts at osmotic potentials of -0.3 and -0.2 MPa, respectively. In a separate study, Mguis et al. (2011) examined common rue seed germination under NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.7 MPa, determining that germination was significantly hindered by NaCl concentrations exceeding 0.1 MPa. Furthermore, Yamashita et al. (2009) noted a decline in the germination percentage of common rue seeds with increasing NaCl concentrations, with significant reductions observed only at -0.8 MPa and the lowest germination percentage recorded at an osmotic potential of -1.0 MPa (22%).
In a study involving four distinct osmotic agents (CaCl2, KCl, MgCl2, and NaCl), Stefanello et al. (2019) determined that chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.) exhibited sensitivity to exposure to various salts with osmotic potentials ranging between -0.1 and -0.4 MPa, as evidenced by reduced germination and vigor. Similarly, Barbieri et al. (2019) observed that the gradual decrease in osmotic potential caused by NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 salts had a detrimental impact on the germination and initial growth of quinoa seedlings (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.).
Under conditions of water deficit, plants experience cell dehydration, leading to a decrease in pressure potential (turgor) and cell volume. This dehydration initiates a cascade of effects, including an increase in ion concentration in the cytosol, which can become cytotoxic by inducing protein denaturation and membrane destabilization, ultimately resulting in cell death (Taiz et al., 2017). In seeds, the consequences of water deficit include a lower germination percentage, prolonged average germination time, and a reduction in primary root and hypocotyl growth (Demontiêzo et al., 2016; Freire et al., 2018).
In soil salinity conditions, the water potentials present can impede the necessary water absorption for germination. Imbibition, particularly with the accumulation of sodium chloride, may lead to the rupture of seed tegument layers, causing harm to the embryo and ultimately resulting in embryo death (Freitas et al., 2013). The impacts of salinity are a culmination of intricate interactions involving morphological, physiological, and biochemical processes such as seed germination, plant growth, and the uptake of water and nutrients (Akbarimoghaddam et al., 2011). Salinity exerts its influence on various aspects of plant development, encompassing germination, vegetative growth, and reproductive processes (Bano & Fatima, 2009).
In Figure 2a, a notable decrease in the total length of common rue seedlings was observed, dropping from 5.1 cm in the control group to 1.14 cm when exposed to -0.4 MPa NaCl. Conversely, seedlings did not exhibit normal growth when subjected to -0.3 MPa CaCl2 salt. This trend was further reflected in the dry weight measurements, which plummeted from 0.9 mg to 0 mg upon exposure to the calcium chloride solution, as depicted in Figure 2b. Interestingly, while there was a decrease in seedling length in the NaCl solution, no significant difference in dry weight was noted (Figure 2b). It is important to note that due to the minute amount of material being measured in milligrams, errors, whether human or equipment-related, could have potentially influenced the recorded data.
The outcomes of our study align with those reported by Cavalcante et al. (2019) in rice seeds (Oryza sativa L.), indicating that root growth was adversely impacted by NaCl, particularly at higher concentrations (up to 0.6 MPa). This decline in growth was similarly noted by Dalchiavon et al. (2016) in their research on the impact of saline stress on common bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), where elevated saline levels led to a decrease in root growth, impeding their normal progression. Furthermore, Oliveira and Silva (2019) observed a decrease in shoot and root growth of common bean seedlings, along with reduced fresh and dry seedling biomass even at low salt concentrations (0.1 MPa), underscoring the species' limited tolerance to salt stress induced by KCl.
When plant tissues, particularly seeds or roots, are exposed to elevated saline concentrations, salt stress leads to a decrease in seedling growth, as evidenced in our study (Cavalcante et al., 2019). Cell growth emerges as the most impacted process, characterized by diminished water absorption. The impact of salinity on the root system stems from direct contact with salts in the medium, resulting in reduced transpiration and growth rates (Guimarães et al., 2013). Salinity not only hampers the germination process by impeding water absorption kinetics but also facilitates the influx of potentially toxic ions, such as Na+ and Cl-, which can induce physiological disorders and ultimately lead to plant demise (Pereira et al., 2014).
The findings of our study revealed that higher saline concentrations in the substrate led to a notable reduction in both seed germination and the initial growth of common rue seedlings. Specifically, calcium chloride (CaCl2) had a more pronounced impact on seedling growth in comparison to sodium chloride (NaCl). As highlighted by Souza and Cardoso (2000), the distinct chemical compositions of these solutions can induce alterations in germination and vigor outcomes, even under comparable water potentials.
These findings hold ecological significance as they shed light on the tolerance levels of plant species towards salt presence, crucial for determining suitable crops for specific environments, particularly in saline regions. They also aid in the implementation of tailored management and irrigation strategies to prevent salinity escalation (Pereira et al., 2017). The common rue's low tolerance to water stress suggests a non-adaptive trait, indicating limited establishment potential in areas with water scarcity due to narrow germination thresholds.
The presence of excess salt, specifically NaCl and CaCl2, has been observed to significantly decrease both the germination percentage and the initial growth of common rue seedlings, irrespective of the stress-inducing substance employed.
