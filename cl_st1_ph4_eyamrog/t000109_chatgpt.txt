This paper introduces an agent-based model that forecasts the daily progression of individuals hospitalized in intensive care units as a result of COVID-19, presenting findings for the year 2020. It also examines the number of fatalities, confirmed cases, asymptomatic carriers, and other pertinent epidemiological variables categorized by age groups. The study incorporates key aspects of Paran√° city's climate (Entre R√≠os, Argentina), its societal dynamics, and public transportation as model inputs, while considering varying levels of isolation and social distancing. Through a series of Hidden Markov Models, the model replicates virus transmission linked to human mobility and activities within the city. The spread of the virus within hosts is simulated by tracking disease stages, accounting for comorbidities, and a portion of asymptomatic carriers. By calibrating the model to align with data on ICU admissions and COVID-19 fatalities in the specific city under investigation, the system can be utilized to assess the effects of isolation and social distancing measures on population dynamics. Furthermore, it enables the simulation of scenarios that could potentially overwhelm the healthcare system due to inadequate infrastructure, as well as forecasting the repercussions of social gatherings or increased mobility among individuals.
In March 2020, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak, had infected over 270,000 individuals globally and resulted in more than 11,300 fatalities [1]. The epidemiological scrutiny of various outbreaks of this disease worldwide has facilitated the creation of diverse models, predominantly mathematical, aimed at monitoring and forecasting epidemic spread [2][3][4][5]. It is against this backdrop that the current study emerges, seeking to offer an alternative approach that incorporates a broader array of real-world factors and enables the prediction of the repercussions of various social and health policies.
According to current epidemiological reports, this pandemic exhibits characteristics seldom observed in other infectious diseases. COVID-19 stands out due to its high basic reproduction number (R0) reaching up to 2.79, an asymptomatic infectious period lasting up to 14 days, where a subset of individuals remain symptom-free and can only be identified through serological testing, and a significant variability in both time and clinical outcomes. Research has demonstrated that the epidemic's dynamics are primarily influenced by factors such as climate, local social and health practices, comorbidities, age demographics, and various other variables. The complexity of these influencing factors necessitates a departure from traditional mathematical models towards the development of more intricate and realistic computational models tailored to specific regions. This study introduces a novel model that integrates local elements including social, cultural, geographical, and climatological variables, directly linked to the epidemic and its modes of transmission.
A significant portion of the existing literature on epidemic modeling and simulation, particularly in the context of COVID-19, presents global models that are typically based on differential equations of the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) type or similar variations, tailored to this specific disease. However, the epidemic modeling community has also been exploring local or fine-grained models, including agent-based models (ABM), as evidenced in various studies [10][13][17][18], including the one under consideration in this research. These models offer enhanced flexibility and control over various epidemic aspects, incorporate the inherent randomness of such systems, and enable real-time monitoring of simulation runs in both time and space [10][11][19]. Nonetheless, they do come with the trade-off of requiring substantial computational resources and access to extensive local data for effective adaptation to specific scenarios.
Agent-Based Models (ABM) represent computational modeling and simulation techniques utilized for investigating the intricate organization and dynamics of complex systems. These models encompass an artificial society comprised of autonomous and diverse agents that engage in non-trivial interactions among themselves and with the environment, governed by specific rules, thereby shaping a social architecture. The social dimension is defined by the heterogeneity, autonomy, interdependence, and social embedding inherent in these computational agents. Notably, there is a scarcity of models possessing these characteristics applied to the context of COVID-19. Moreover, the existing models are predominantly tailored to specific scenarios within particular regions or countries, posing challenges in their generalizability to novel situations due to the substantial scientific and technical expertise required for such extrapolation.
This paper introduces a novel model known as the Agent-based model for COVID-19 Simulation (AbCSim), designed to facilitate the modeling of individuals with COVID-19, encompassing symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, as well as those categorized as susceptible or recovered within a population [24]. The model is constructed to capture the intricate dynamics of the disease and interpersonal interactions among populations, incorporating geographical and climatological data pertinent to the pandemic. Moreover, it incorporates a host transmission block utilizing a series of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) [25][26][27] to represent the mobility and social behaviors of agents within the modeled geographical area. AbCSim operates on the computational simulation platform Repast [28] and is openly accessible through GitHub. This model enables the simulation of the entire population at an individual level, focusing on a city scale or larger, specifically tailored for Paran√° city in Entre R√≠os, Argentina, and subjected to various scenarios to forecast the local progression of the epidemic.
Repast is a platform comprising a suite of open-source modeling and simulation tools centered around agents, compatible with various operating systems. To conduct experiments or test new scenarios, a computer cluster is essential to run multiple instances of the model concurrently, yielding results based on central tendencies due to the stochastic nature of the studied phenomenon. This platform facilitates the incorporation of agents' characteristics, behaviors, and interactions with both their peers and environments. The overarching model structure is depicted in Figure 1, illustrating different levels of granularity. The primary level showcases the comprehensive model (represented by a black block) inclusive of initial conditions, inputs, and outputs. The subsequent level delineates the core components of the system (depicted by blue blocks): one block for simulating virus spread within each host (on the left) and another for disease transmission between hosts (on the right), as suggested by previous researchers. The subsequent level (green blocks) elucidates submodels encompassing Epidemiological characterization and Infectivity for each agent alongside their respective parameters. It also encompasses Interpersonal contact, Location, and Mobility/Activity submodels, along with specific parameters pertinent to these submodels. Lastly, the third level introduces the Transport and Infectious trail submodels (magenta blocks), with each submodel slated for detailed exploration in subsequent sections.
As an Agent-Based Model (ABM), the model's foundation lies in the agents referred to as humans (Ha). Each Ha possesses the capacity to both acquire and transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus, alter symptoms and health conditions in response to the spread of infection, and adjust behaviors accordingly (Infectivity submodel, Section 3.1). Additionally, every Ha is characterized by distinct attributes and features that align with particular risk factors and comorbidities (Epidemiological characterization submodel, Section 3.2).
The critical relationships among human agents in COVID-19 epidemiology are depicted in the Interpersonal Contact submodel (Section 4.1), which also illustrates the interactions between human agents, land plots, and the environment. These relationships are influenced by factors such as the average distance maintained in various locations, the duration of stay, and adherence to mask-wearing and social distancing protocols (Sections 4.1 and 4.2).
In the Location submodel, a specialized geographic information system (GIS) module within the Repast platform is utilized, with a detailed explanation provided in Section 4.2. This system enables the differentiation and characterization of various locations such as family residences, buildings, stores, squares, and transportation hubs where individuals reside or frequent. Agents within the model represent the geographical environment and individual plots within the city, each possessing unique attributes and methods. Additionally, key public transportation modes are depicted as specific locations for communal gatherings, as elaborated in the Transportation submodel (Section 4.2.1). The precision and quality of the geographical data within this system are crucial for accurately simulating the mobility patterns and activities of each individual within the Ha society.
On the contrary, each Ha exhibits distinct behaviors based on its age range, habits, and the specific neighborhood in which it resides, which are randomly assigned at the onset of each simulation in accordance with the city's population statistics. In light of this, every Ha moves autonomously in accordance with probabilities (ùê¥ ùúñ ùúÜ‚Ñé,ùëí,ùëô(ùê¥, ùêµ, ùúã)) linked to state transition matrices (activities/locations) within a set ùúÜ‚Ñé,ùëí,ùëô of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that encapsulate the Mobility/Activity submodel. Each HMM is associated with a particular location (l) (neighborhood/city/area) where the Ha resides, its age range (e), and the time slot (h) during the simulation. The details of this submodel will be further elaborated in Section 4.3. Additionally, the persistence of active viruses in various locations/environments is depicted by the Infectious trail submodel, as outlined in Section 4.3.1.
The infectivity submodel of AbCSim is derived from a mathematical model originally introduced by Arenas et al. [31]. This model was subsequently translated into Repast to simulate the spread of the virus among human agents.
Each "Ha" is associated with a state attribute based on one of the seven epidemiological compartments in which the metapopulation is divided: S for susceptible, E for latent or exposed, I for symptomatic infectious, A for asymptomatic infectious, R for recovered, D for deceased, and H for hospitalized. The diagram presented in Figure 2 illustrates the various components, relationships, and parameters of this submodel.
This submodel encompasses all the distinctive features specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, including significant epidemiological impacts stemming from asymptomatic carriers (A) or those with mild symptoms. It also takes into account the proportion of individuals necessitating intensive care hospitalization (H), with the assumption that all human agents have access to respiratory ventilators, given that the healthcare capacity in the studied city has not been surpassed.
Considering the characteristics of human agents mentioned earlier, this submodel functions in the following manner: the susceptible individual Ha becomes infected with a probability ùõΩ through interpersonal contact with another infected Ha, who may be symptomatic (I) or asymptomatic (A). This infection probability is influenced by a variable v, which is linked to the daily mean temperature. Upon infection, the susceptible individual transitions to the exposed group (E). Exposed individuals, after 1 ùõº days, develop symptoms or remain asymptomatic based on a characteristic probability ùúÇ, which is determined by the age range of Ha. Once infected, there are two potential outcomes. The first scenario involves Ha requiring hospitalization (H) in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a probability ùõæ, which is influenced by Ha's age range, comorbidities, and risk factors. These risk factors or comorbidities are unique to each Ha, and their impact on the likelihood of ICU admission is detailed in Table 2 in the subsequent section (Epidemiological characterization submodel). If Ha does not require ICU admission after 1 ùúá days, they are considered recovered and immune from reinfection for an average period of 11 months, as per [32]. While in the ICU, individuals face a mortality probability ùúî [33] after an average duration of 1 ùõπ days [34][35]. Following this period, Ha exits the ICU and moves to the Recovered compartment.
The human agent population was categorized into five age groups: children, young people, adults, older adults, and elderly individuals. Transition constants between epidemiological compartments, as illustrated in Figure 2, are unique to each age range and are depicted in the figure.
The infectivity submodel governs Ha's behavior based on its epidemiological compartment. When Ha is in the Susceptible compartment, it adheres to daily activities and movements predetermined by the Mobility submodel. Conversely, if Ha resides in a compartment other than Susceptible or Exposed, it ceases movement, presumed to stay at home to prevent disease transmission to other Ha. Consequently, household members transition to the Exposed compartment.
In AbCSim, the transmission probability from interpersonal contact is a parameter that extends beyond purely epidemiological considerations. The parameter ùõΩ is not only influenced by epidemiological factors but also by the variable v, which fluctuates throughout the year and is inversely correlated with the daily mean temperature. This relationship is supported by studies that characterize COVID-19 as a seasonal disease. Consequently, the value of ùõΩ is contingent upon the variable v(Temp), which peaks at its maximum value (1) on July 15 and reaches its minimum value (0.5) on January 15, coinciding with higher daily mean temperatures in the southern hemisphere.
As discussed earlier, each Ha variant possesses distinct epidemiological characteristics that influence the parameters of the Infectivity submodel outlined in Table 1. Noteworthy attributes include the presence of comorbidities or risk factors and the occurrence of symptomatic infected individuals within households.
Comorbidities significantly elevate the likelihood, denoted by the variable ùõæ, of transitioning from being infected to requiring inpatient care in the intensive care unit (ICU), as indicated by the specific percentage outlined in Table 2 [33].
Two attributes associated with Ha's behavior have epidemiological implications: adherence to social distancing and the effectiveness and adherence to mask usage. While both attributes contribute to the epidemiological profile of each agent, their functionality is detailed in the Interpersonal Contact submodel (Section 4.1).
For every Ha, a method exists to determine if another agent is present within a 2-meter radius [39][40][41]. Should this proximity persist for 15 minutes or more, and if either agent is infected (showing symptoms or not), the epidemiological status of the uninfected Ha shifts to exposed (E) with a probability of ùë£(ùëáùëíùëöùëù) ‚àóùõΩ.
For each household (Ha), the model takes into account the current national definition of "close contact." This process triggers an automatic transition from susceptible (S) to exposed (E) for household members residing with a symptomatic infected individual, irrespective of confirmed interpersonal contact. Furthermore, each household (Ha) is characterized by an attribute indicating adherence to mask usage. This attribute influences the parameter ùõΩ through a coefficient termed mask. The mask coefficient adjusts ùõΩ during close contact scenarios by reducing it by 30% [17][21][42][43] when a high level of mask adherence is exhibited by Ha. Conversely, when mask adherence is low, the mask coefficient remains inactive.
Finally, this submodel considers an attribute of each Ha, defined by the level of adherence to social distancing. This attribute, termed distancing, can have two values: high or low. When Ha exhibits a high level of observance, it ensures compliance by checking for the absence of any other agent within a 1.8m radius before occupying a position in the geographical grid that is not its home. If this condition is met, Ha proceeds to take the position; otherwise, it waits until space becomes available. Conversely, when distancing is low, Ha will occupy the desired position upon movement, irrespective of the current capacity.
In order to approximate the locations where citizens reside, work, engage in consumption, and partake in leisure activities, GIS tools integrated into Repast were employed. This data, in conjunction with verified daily movements, delineates the social habits of each individual. These habits were ascertained through 441 individual field surveys, adhering to age and gender quotas, and meeting the stipulations of the Ethics Committee responsible for reviewing and approving the survey structure, anonymization procedures, and informed consent protocols.
To depict various structures like houses, workplaces, shops, and recreational areas, city grid maps sourced from the Paran√° Municipality Land Registry Office were utilized in this study. Additionally, tools such as Google Maps and Google Places¬Æ were employed to initially map different sections of the city under investigation. Subsequently, a physical examination of the parcels and their designations was conducted on-site to validate the data obtained from these resources. This process was further augmented by the use of GPS-based tracking tools to supplement the GIS map with field survey data. By integrating this information into the system's operational framework, each hectare was allocated attributes corresponding to the specific submodel, ultimately populating the entire map with the appropriate number of human agents assigned to each land parcel.
Figure 3 displays a detailed map of neighborhoods or districts No. 2 and No. 11 in Paran√° city, highlighting the key AbCSim locations and activities conducted within those areas.
This section delves into the impact of public transportation on COVID-19 epidemiology. Various public transportation lines were depicted as fixed positions or locations on a map, with each bus stop occupying a 10x4 m area. This simplification was intended to capture the essential dynamics of public transportation relevant to the study. Individuals can access this area every 20 minutes, reflecting the average frequency of local transportation, and typically maintain an average distance of 2 meters for a duration of 20 minutes. The recommended distancing is momentarily breached for a minute, representing the time taken to move from the entrance to a seat and then to the exit. Following this 20-minute period, each individual can choose to relocate to a different position on the map or remain in the transportation area for an additional equivalent period, based on a transition probability determined by the Mobility/Activity submodel, which will be elaborated upon in the subsequent section.
As previously outlined, public transportation possesses its own unique capacity constraints, yet it also presents a potential for close contact, a factor influenced by the adherence of individuals to wearing masks and practicing social distancing, as is the case in any other setting within the model.
This submodel aids in simulating the mobility of human agents residing in a specific district or neighborhood within the model, taking into account factors such as age range and the time slot being simulated. It further determines the specific activity that each human agent (Ha) will engage in at the next period of time within the designated location. Certain activities, such as work or study locations and types, remain consistent for each Ha throughout the simulation, while others, like leisure activities, are determined as they are scheduled to occur.
In order to determine the precise location of each Ha at any given moment, AbCSim utilizes a sequence of waypoints situated in distinct geographical coordinates derived from a collection of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) [25]. These HMMs outline the likelihood of transitioning from one location to another based on the current position of Ha in the preceding moment and the designated activities associated with Ha's specific characteristics.
It is acknowledged that the behavior associated with each Ha's mobility varies throughout the day, leading to the generation of specific Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for distinct time slots. This pattern is also observed across different age ranges, where each Ha exhibits a unique mobility profile and engages in activities that are commonly shared among all human agents within a particular neighborhood or district.
It is assumed that virus transmission on streets is negligible, thus having no impact on the model. Consequently, it is postulated that mobility on foot between plots is instantaneous for Ha. As outlined in the preceding section, only the dynamics of public transportation mobility are depicted, as this form of movement is deemed a potential activity for the state Others, a topic to be elaborated on later.
The set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that make up the Mobility submodel is denoted as ùúÜ‚Ñé,ùëí,ùëô(ùê¥, ùêµ, ùúã). Each specific ùúÜ‚Ñé,ùëí,ùëô HMM corresponds to a particular Ha, determined by age range (e), neighborhood (l), and time slot (h) relevant to the simulation time.
In the state graph depicted in Figure 4, it is evident that all Hidden Markov Models (HMM) consist of four states, each denoting a distinct location or activity: Home (C), Work (T), Leisure (E), and Others (O). Correspondingly, every HMM is associated with its unique transition matrix ùê¥‚Ñé,ùëí,ùëô, which outlines the probabilities of state transitions ùëé‚Ñé,ùëí,ùëô(ùëñ, ùëó), indicating the movement from one type of location (j) to another (i). Additionally, there exists a matrix ùêµ‚Ñé,ùëí,ùëô that illustrates the output probabilities ùëè‚Ñé,ùëí,ùëô(ùëò, ùëñ) for each state (representing the k potential locations where an individual in state i could transition to), along with an initial location probability vector ùúã. Notably, the vector ùúã is consistently set as (1,0,0,0) to signify the commencement of the day, under the assumption that all individuals initiate their day at home.
The potential states exhibit distinct characteristics as follows:
This location symbolizes Ha's residence and consequently, yields only one potential result. The precise spot on the city's geographical map that signifies the outcome for this condition is delineated as an attribute for every Ha and constitutes a component of the Location submodel. This attribute is selected randomly from a habitable geographical zone within the city at the onset of the simulation and remains constant throughout the entire simulation.
The state denotes the specific work or study location of each Ha, which may be shared by multiple human agents. In some cases, this location aligns with their home, particularly for those who do not engage in work or study activities. The work or study location remains constant for each Ha and is determined at the onset of the run from a range of potential places. These locations vary in terms of the likelihood of selection for human agents based on their respective age groups.
The category of "leisure" locations refers to places that are frequently visited by individuals and are commonly utilized by multiple community members. Examples of such locations encompass cinemas, parks, and shopping centers. Each neighborhood has a distinct list of these leisure spots, each with an associated probability that fluctuates based on the residents' habits and preferences.
The category of "other locations" comprises less common instances. This includes places such as ATMs, warehouses, restaurants, supermarkets, pharmacies, and public transportation.
Time slots are operationally defined as specific periods of time allocated for a particular activity or event. These time slots are typically predetermined and scheduled in advance to ensure efficient organization and utilization of time. In research studies, time slots are often used to designate specific intervals for data collection, participant interviews, or experimental procedures. By clearly defining time slots, researchers can effectively manage their time and resources, ensuring that tasks are completed within the designated time frame. Additionally, the use of time slots allows for better coordination and synchronization of activities, facilitating smooth and systematic progress in research projects. Overall, the precise definition and allocation of time slots play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and productivity of research endeavors.
In the morning, specifically from 8:00 to 12:00, this time slot is denoted as time slot 0.
During the early afternoon, specifically between 12:00 and 16:00, falls within the designated time slot 1.
During the afternoon hours, specifically from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM, falls within the second designated time slot.
Evening, defined as the time period between 20:00 and 24:00, falls within time slot 3.
Age ranges are operationally defined in this study as specific intervals of chronological age, typically spanning a certain number of years. These intervals are used to categorize participants into distinct groups for the purpose of analysis and comparison. In the context of this research, age ranges serve as a means of organizing data and examining potential differences or patterns across different age groups. It is important to establish clear and consistent age ranges to ensure the validity and reliability of the study findings. By clearly defining age ranges, researchers can effectively interpret and communicate the results of their analyses in a meaningful and coherent manner.
Children aged 5 to 14 years old were included in the study, with an age range starting from 0.
Young people, typically defined as individuals between the ages of 15 and 24, represent a crucial demographic group in various societal contexts. This age range, often characterized by significant transitions and developmental milestones, plays a pivotal role in shaping future generations and influencing social trends. Understanding the unique needs, challenges, and opportunities faced by young people is essential for policymakers, educators, and other stakeholders seeking to support their growth and well-being. By recognizing the distinct characteristics and experiences of individuals within this age group, interventions and initiatives can be tailored effectively to address their specific concerns and promote positive outcomes. As such, research focusing on young people aged 15-24 is instrumental in informing evidence-based practices and policies aimed at enhancing the overall welfare and prospects of this demographic cohort.
The study focused on adults aged between 25 and 39 years old, representing an age range of 2.
The study focused on individuals classified as older adults, specifically within the age range of 40 to 64 years old.
Elderly individuals, defined as those aged 65 years and above, represent a significant demographic group within society. This age range is characterized by a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional changes that can impact their overall well-being and quality of life. As individuals age, they may experience a decline in physical health, including issues such as decreased mobility, chronic conditions, and frailty. Cognitive changes, such as memory loss and cognitive decline, are also common among the elderly population. Additionally, emotional well-being can be affected by factors such as social isolation, loss of loved ones, and changes in living situations. Understanding the unique needs and challenges faced by elderly individuals is crucial for developing effective interventions and support systems to enhance their quality of life and promote healthy aging.
Table 3 displays the matrix values ùê¥‚Ñé,ùëí,ùëô for the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) corresponding to a specific neighborhood, denoted as l, within the age range of 0 (Children) and time slot 0 (Morning). Therefore, a0,0,l(i, j) represents the transition probabilities for a child (e = 0) from neighborhood l during the morning (h = 0) moving from state i (row) to state j (column). For instance, a0,0,l(1, 2) = 25 signifies the probability value (scaled by 1000) indicating the likelihood of a child from neighborhood l transitioning from work/study (1) to a leisure location (2) during time slot 0. Appendix A provides a comprehensive overview of probabilities A and B across all age ranges, time slots, and neighborhoods as defined in AbCSim, focusing on the initial phase of the Preventive and Mandatory Social Isolation (PMSI) enforced by the Argentine National Government.
This submodel illustrates the potential for Ha to become infected through contact with surfaces previously contaminated by another Ha. Studies [44] [45] suggest that plastics, commonly encountered in daily life, are among the materials most frequently touched by humans. The virus can persist on these surfaces for a duration that varies exponentially and inversely with ambient temperature. If an infected Ha remains in a specific location for more than 16 minutes, there is a possibility that it could leave behind an infectious residue on handled objects (fomites). This phenomenon can be quantitatively described through a mathematical model [44] as: ùëÉ(ùë°) = ùëí((‚àíùëè).ùë°)
In the equation provided, the variable b is defined as b = e^(-(4.9) + (temp/10)), where e represents the base of the natural logarithm and temp denotes the temperature. This formula encapsulates a mathematical relationship involving temperature and a constant value of 4.9. The exponential function e is raised to the power of the negative difference between 4.9 and the temperature divided by 10. This expression signifies a specific calculation based on the given parameters, offering insights into the relationship between temperature variations and the resulting value of b.
Here, P(t) denotes the probability of virus contact via a plastic surface, with t representing the time elapsed since fomite handling in hours, and temp indicating the daily mean temperature. This equation was integrated into the GIS projection system, enabling each cell where an infected Ha persisted to potentially infect another Ha with the associated probability P(t). While this factor was incorporated for comprehensive modeling purposes due to its connection to various hygiene practices aimed at disease prevention, recent studies and practical applications have indicated its negligible influence on outcomes.
As delineated in preceding sections, the model comprises various blocks and submodels, each possessing distinct characteristic parameters that necessitate calibration for optimal functionality.
The diverse composition of AbCSim necessitates the utilization of distinct mechanisms by each submodel to acquire, modify, and fine-tune parameters. Certain constants were sourced directly from existing literature, whereas others underwent adjustments through the grid search technique, aligning simulation results with accessible empirical data.
Finally, the model comprehensively captures various facets of reality by incorporating diverse parameters in a clear and explicit manner. The data gathered was meticulously evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and the parameters were fine-tuned by a qualified expert.
The unique characteristics of each block are delineated in the subsequent sections, with Appendix A outlining the key parameters of the model to ensure the reproducibility of this study and its findings.
Based on the values suggested in the literature [31], an initial calibration of parameters primarily associated with virus spread within hosts was conducted. To refine the parameter values related to virus spread within hosts, data on the progression of epidemic variables from March to May 2020 in the municipality of Vo (a small village in northern Italy) [46] was utilized, along with geographical, climatic, demographic, and behavioral information pertaining to its residents.
To validate the model, the initial conditions and parameters pertaining to host transmission in the city of Hoyo de Manzanares were utilized (Reference 9, 47). Following the methodology outlined in other epidemiological models based on agents (References 13, 48), it was confirmed that the outputs of AbCSim align with the field data collected. Additionally, the dispersion of model outputs, assessed in relation to the interquartile range, was deemed acceptable.
To evaluate the model against established habits in Argentine cities, a simulation was conducted using real data from the Loncopu√© district in the Neuqu√©n province. In this analysis, not only were local habits taken into account, but also a phase transition of the PMSI. The daily case data reported for Loncopu√© aligned well with the model's predictions, serving as a validation measure for AbCSim and establishing the values outlined in Table 1.
The values assigned to mask-wearing and social distancing within the Interpersonal Contact submodel were determined in accordance with the literature outlined in Section 4.1. Observations revealed a correlation between the shifting phases of isolation and distancing and a subsequent rise in individuals' mobility, a trend supported by data from Google Mobility12. This transition towards increased mobility, indicative of a return to pre-pandemic routines, is mirrored in the alterations seen in the parameters of matrices A and B across different Hidden Markov Models as detailed in Appendix A.
This section details the simulation output results generated by AbCSim, incorporating data and parameter adjustments specific to the city being studied. The simulation covers the period from June 12, 2020, when a notable increase in local cases was observed, up to December 30, 2020. The model was calibrated using the city's climograph, variations in isolation and distancing measures, and the initial count of infected individuals during this timeframe.
Figure 5 illustrates the comparison between the ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 positive patients, sourced from Entre R√≠os province Critical Units Monitoring Program (Programa de Monitoreo de Unidades Cr√≠ticas, PMUC), during the study period, and the estimates derived from the model. This comparison holds significant importance in predicting potential strains on the local healthcare system. Moreover, the dataset obtained from reality aligns closely with the model's output, indicating a high level of accuracy. The figure validates that the weekly reports on ICU bed occupancy with COVID-19 patients are consistent with the model's projected values.
Figure 6 illustrates the daily count of COVID-19 cases, encompassing both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, as projected by the model during the analyzed timeframe. Notably, official statistics only capture a fraction of the true total cases due to their reliance on testing protocols and case surveillance, in addition to the challenges associated with identifying asymptomatic infections. The model's projections suggest that the actual number of infected individuals surpasses the figures presented in official reports, aligning with findings from existing literature on similar case investigations [49].
Finally, Figure 7 illustrates the accumulated number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 as estimated by the model during the specified study period. This model output can be readily cross-referenced with the data field, establishing a direct correlation between the estimated number of accumulated deaths and the figures reported by the UTN FRCU - COVID-19 GIBD Research Group Databases for Paran√° city.
This study introduces AbCSim, an agent-based model designed to simulate the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic at a localized urban level. AbCSim is uniquely equipped to capture the multifaceted dynamics of the epidemic, enabling its adaptability to diverse scenarios. The research outlines the methodology employed for parameter calibration within the system, along with the approach for integrating fluctuations in social distancing protocols, human behavior, and climatic conditions over temporal scales. To demonstrate its utility, the model was specifically implemented in Paran√° city during the latter part of 2020.
The results obtained align with data from various official sources, including PMUC, notably regarding the availability of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients in the city. Additionally, the model outputs were found to correspond with the reported number of deceased individuals during the specified time frame. These findings suggest that the model is capable of forecasting the probable progression of case numbers and bed occupancy in the near future.
AbCSim offers valuable insights that enable the quantification of the impacts resulting from the adoption of various health policies at the local level. Such characteristics render this model an indispensable instrument for decision-making processes aimed at evaluating healthcare system utilization, averting its potential collapse, and incorporating a contextual understanding of individuals within their respective local economic and social contexts. Subsequent research endeavors will delve into multiple case studies, showcasing the outcomes derived from employing this model in diverse urban settings or even on a broader state-wide scale. Furthermore, forthcoming studies will expand the scope of this model to encompass the evaluation of vaccination campaigns and the diverse variants of viruses.
