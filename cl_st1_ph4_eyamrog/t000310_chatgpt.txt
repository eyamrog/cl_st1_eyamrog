The global community is currently grappling with a novel challenge in the form of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by a betacoronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Phylogenetically, this virus is closely related to the SARS-CoV, which caused a severe outbreak in China in 2003, and the MERS-CoV, responsible for a significant number of deaths in the Middle East in 2012.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Just twenty-three days later, reported cases had surged to 1,056,777 across 182 countries, with 55,781 deaths, predominantly concentrated in Italy, Spain, France, China, and Iran. Brazil had recorded 8,195 cases and 335 deaths, while Portugal reported 9,886 cases and 246 deaths, figures that have seen a sharp rise since the onset of the pandemic.
In response to the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases, particularly in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states, various precautionary measures have been implemented in Brazil, Portugal, and other countries. These measures include school closures, event cancellations, reduced bank hours, limited commerce operations to essential sectors, recommendations for home isolation, and suspension of public transportation between municipalities and states. With the absence of a vaccine or specific therapy, these actions are crucial to curb the spread of the virus and prevent overwhelming the healthcare system, as witnessed in Italy and Spain. The transmission of the virus through respiratory droplets during sneezing, coughing, and talking, as well as contact with contaminated surfaces, underscores the necessity of these measures. The use of PCR assays for detecting viral RNA in respiratory samples has been pivotal for diagnosing COVID-19, with widespread testing being adopted in various countries to control the pandemic. Efforts are also underway to develop tests that can assess population immunity, identifying individuals who have developed immunity and can safely resume normal activities. This will play a crucial role in the subsequent phases of the pandemic.
Analyses conducted by Imperial College, along with projections on COVID-19 cases, have estimated that without intervention, there could be 7 billion infections and 40 million deaths globally in 2020. Additionally, they have highlighted that mitigation strategies emphasizing protection could potentially halve this burden, potentially saving 20 million lives. However, such measures could strain healthcare services, particularly in lower-income regions. This underscores the critical need to implement stringent measures that restrict movement, enforce social distancing, and potentially even isolation. It is crucial to acknowledge that inadequate reporting, testing, and delayed test results could compromise the accuracy of a country's statistics if they fail to adhere to the WHO's recommended policies on testing performance.
A study carried out in China involving 72,314 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 revealed varying degrees of clinical severity within the sample, with 81.4% experiencing mild severity, 13.9% severe severity, and 4.7% critical severity. The predominant symptoms observed included fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and diarrhea, while additional signs and symptoms like sore throat, chest pain, mental confusion, and lethargy were also reported.
Approximately 5% of infections may progress to a severe course characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary bleeding, severe lymphopenia, kidney failure, circulatory shock, and multi-organ failure. The case-fatality rates varied significantly by age group in Italy (1,625 cases) and China (1,023 cases), standing at 7.2% and 2.3%, respectively. This discrepancy can be attributed in part to the older age distribution in Italy and the higher prevalence of comorbidities among the Italian population.
Between one fourth and half of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 present with underlying chronic conditions, particularly cardiovascular (CVD) and cerebrovascular diseases, which significantly elevate the likelihood of experiencing a severe disease course and mortality. A meta-analysis encompassing six studies conducted in China, involving 1,527 COVID-19 patients, examined the prevalence of CVD, revealing the following percentages: hypertension at 17.1%, heart and cerebrovascular diseases at 16.4%, and diabetes at 9.7%. Additionally, a study involving 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China highlighted preexisting comorbidities such as CVD (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), and hypertension (6%), correlating with a case-fatality rate of 2.3%. These investigations underscore the significance of not only chronic ailments but also age and the individual's immune status in relation to COVID-19 mortality, illustrating a complex, multifaceted, and bidirectional model that may encompass the medications utilized in managing these conditions.
Acute and chronic cardiovascular complications have been observed in relation to various mechanisms, including relative ischemia, systemic inflammation, and pathogen-mediated damage, leading to elevated levels of biomarkers such as troponin I, BNP, and d-dimer. Myocardial damage, shock, and arrhythmia were noted in 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, respectively, necessitating intensive care admission. A meta-analysis of four studies involving 341 COVID-19 patients revealed a significantly higher standardized mean difference in cardiac troponin I levels among those with severe disease compared to milder cases (25.6; 95%CI: 6.8-44.5 ng/L). Furthermore, a retrospective multicenter cohort study in China demonstrated that elevated d-dimer levels upon admission (> 1µg/mL) were linked to in-hospital mortality even after adjustments (OR 18.4; 95% CI: 2.6-128.6 µg/mL).
Venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 has been reported, likely stemming from vascular inflammation, hypercoagulable states, and endothelial dysfunction. Fulminant myocarditis and heart failure have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with preexisting coronary artery disease potentially increasing susceptibility to the infection. In a case series involving 150 COVID-19 patients, 7% of the 68 deaths were attributed to myocarditis with circulatory failure. Other studies have detailed cases of fulminant myocarditis with high viral loads and post-mortem evidence of mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in heart tissue. A recent case report highlighted a unique scenario where a patient with myopericarditis and significant left ventricular dysfunction tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but lacked pulmonary symptoms. This patient was successfully treated with dobutamine, lopinavir/ritonavir, steroids, chloroquine, and standard heart failure therapy. Another study found that heart failure was present in 23.0% of COVID-19 patients, with a higher prevalence among non-survivors (51.9% vs. 11.7%). The role of pre-existing ventricular dysfunction in this outcome remains uncertain.
Murine models and human post-mortem samples have demonstrated that SARS-CoV can modulate the myocardial and pulmonary angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading to myocardial inflammation, pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory failure, potentially elucidating the cardiovascular implications in critically ill patients. Nevertheless, the current data remains inadequate to definitively ascertain the direct applicability of these findings to humans, with no research yet investigating the impact of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors on individuals with COVID-19.
Several studies have indicated that ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) may up-regulate ACE2, potentially heightening susceptibility to the virus. Conversely, other research has demonstrated that ACEI/ARB could enhance the pulmonary protective role of ACE2. The Brazilian Society of Cardiology, the European Society of Cardiology, and the American College of Cardiology advocate for a personalized evaluation of each patient, advising against the abrupt discontinuation of ongoing therapeutic regimens to prevent clinical instability and negative health consequences.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment available for COVID-19. Chloroquine has demonstrated the ability to impede viral infection by elevating the endosomal pH critical for virus-cell fusion, exhibiting inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Antiviral medications such as ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and remdesivir are undergoing evaluation in ongoing studies. Notably, the lopinavir/ritonavir combination can impact heart conduction, leading to QT-interval prolongation and advanced atrioventricular block. Furthermore, these drugs have interactions with antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, statins, and beta-blockers.
When managing patients with COVID-19, cardiologists must remain vigilant for emerging clinical presentations, including arrhythmias, left ventricular dysfunction, and systemic embolism, which could be associated with the disease, given the substantial gaps in our understanding of its pathophysiology.
The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered the dynamics and operations of societies globally in an unprecedented manner. The challenges posed are immense, particularly in terms of the immense strain placed on national health systems, which have never before faced such a severe stress test. Nevertheless, this crisis also presents an opportunity to revamp and fortify health systems, while simultaneously underscoring the crucial role of healthcare professionals in our society. It is imperative that policymakers strive to secure the most efficient means of ensuring the sustainability of health systems, all the while guaranteeing that healthcare professionals receive the appropriate recognition and reward for their tireless efforts and unwavering dedication, often overlooked during times of peace.
The global crisis has elicited an unparalleled display of solidarity from nations worldwide. As we confront the immense challenges that loom on the horizon, it is imperative that we continue to prioritize and hold dear the significance of this issue.
