Olfactory dysfunction (OD) stands out as one of the most frequently reported symptoms associated with COVID-19. While past research has underscored the significance of olfactory training (OT) as a crucial intervention for postinfectious OD, there remains a dearth of understanding regarding its efficacy following SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential avenues for its optimization.
Objective: This study aims to evaluate the potential optimization of olfactory training (OT) through intensive application, involving a higher frequency of fragrances administered over a condensed timeframe, for individuals experiencing persistent olfactory dysfunction (OD) following COVID-19 infection. Additionally, the research seeks to identify and analyze various variables associated with OD and treatment outcomes within this specific patient cohort.
Method: In this multicenter randomized clinical trial, 80 patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction (OD) following COVID-19 infection for less than three months were recruited. These patients were allocated into two groups, one receiving treatment with 4 essences and the other with 8 essences over a period of four weeks. Prior to and post-treatment, subjective assessments and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) were conducted to evaluate olfactory function.
Results: Both groups exhibited a notable enhancement in olfaction, as assessed subjectively and through UPSIT scores. However, no significant disparities were observed between the two groups. Furthermore, it was found that individuals experiencing olfactory fluctuations tended to have higher UPSIT scores.
Conclusion: The data presented in this study indicate that enhancing training through the addition of more scents over a 4-week period does not demonstrate superiority compared to the traditional method. Additionally, there appears to be a correlation between fluctuating olfactory abilities and higher scores on the UPSIT.
In December 2019, the transmission of a novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, which leads to the illness COVID-19, originated in China. This virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and contact routes. The typical symptoms associated with the disease include cough, fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, and a sudden loss of smell or taste.
Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is now recognized as a cardinal symptom of COVID-19, with a high predictive value. It is not only one of the most frequently reported symptoms but also appears to be more pronounced when assessed using psychophysical testing. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT®) is a psychophysical test designed for identifying microencapsulated odors and has been adapted and validated for use in various countries, including the Brazilian population. In nearly all cases, patients with COVID-19 had their UPSIT results classified as either anosmia or severe hyposmia.
Prior research highlights olfactory training (OT) as a crucial intervention for postinfectious olfactory dysfunction (OD). This therapeutic approach entails consistent and daily exposure to various scents over an extended duration. Hummel et al. initially outlined an OT protocol aimed at enhancing overall olfactory sensitivity, utilizing four key essences (phenylethyl alcohol, eucalyptol, citronella, and eugenol) for a 12-week period. Building on this, Altundag et al. found that rotating odors every 12 weeks could potentially enhance the efficacy of OT in individuals suffering from post-infectious OD.
The present study seeks to compare the olfactory function response to olfactory training (OT) using 4 and 8 essences among patients experiencing recent onset of olfactory dysfunction (OD) following COVID-19 infection over a 4-week period. Our aim is to determine if OT can enhance olfactory rehabilitation through an intensive regimen involving a greater variety of fragrances within a condensed timeframe. Furthermore, we aim to conduct a prospective analysis of patients with persistent post-COVID OD to explore additional variables associated with the disorder or the response to OT.
This multicenter randomized clinical trial enrolled participants aged 18 to 60 years who had experienced COVID-19 infection within the past three months, as confirmed by RT-PCR testing at the time of diagnosis, and reported persistent olfactory alterations lasting at least four weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Exclusion criteria encompassed individuals unable to provide valid written informed consent and those with a history of multiple SARS-CoV-2 infections, sinonasal conditions like chronic rhinosinusitis or nasal masses, a documented traumatic brain injury leading to olfactory dysfunction, pre-existing olfactory dysfunction prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection, known neurological disorders impacting olfactory function, and ongoing or prior treatments for COVID-19-induced olfactory dysfunction.
Patients were recruited through the dissemination of the study in the press and social networks and subsequently followed up in the Otolaryngology services of tertiary hospitals in Curitiba and Londrina. Upon expressing interest and willingness to participate in the research, patients were presented with an informed consent form administered by one of the physicians involved in the study. Each participant underwent a comprehensive medical evaluation conducted by an otolaryngologist, encompassing nasal endoscopy and the utilization of visual analogue scales (VAS) to subjectively evaluate nasal symptoms, olfaction, taste, and the impact of olfactory dysfunction (OD) on their quality of life. The assessment also included an evaluation of chemosensory disturbances, COVID-19 immunization status, olfactory fluctuations, and complaints pertaining to trigeminal nerve-related nasal function. The psychophysical evaluation of smell was carried out using the UPSIT®, a validated standardized odor identification test employing a "scrape and sniff" format, where microencapsulated odorants are released upon scratching a strip. Normosmia was defined as a score of ≥34 for men and ≥35 for women out of a total of 40 points, with an increase of ≥4 points indicating a clinically significant improvement in symptoms. Both the UPSIT and subjective assessments were repeated within a 4-week period following the initiation of the prescribed treatment.
Patients were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to two distinct groups for olfactory training (OT). The initial study cohort was provided with a classical olfactory training set (COT) comprising four essential oils: rose, eucalyptus, clove, and lemon. In contrast, the second group received an advanced olfactory training set (AOT) containing eight essential oils: rose, eucalyptus, clove, lemon, citronella, mint, vanilla, and cedarwood.
Patients were introduced to the guidelines for conducting the olfactory training (OT) during their initial appointment, which were further reinforced through the distribution of easily comprehensible instructional booklets. Throughout the training period, individuals were exposed to each scent for 15 seconds twice daily, with a 30-second interval between each scent presentation. Additionally, patients were provided with video tutorials the day following the commencement of therapy and were contacted via telephone after completing 1 and 3 weeks of OT by the research team to stress the significance of adhering to the treatment regimen. In addition to the instructional materials, participants were equipped with a diary to monitor their training progress. Those who had not engaged in the olfactory training for a minimum of 7 consecutive days were excluded from the study.
The study design received approval from the ethics committees of the participating institutions, with reference numbers CAAE: 46698721.5.0000.0096 and 47078821.5.0000.0020.
Quantitative variables were characterized by mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and interquartile range. The presence of OD was evaluated using the binomial test, while a comparison between UPSIT® and VAS scores was conducted through the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. Multiple assessments were compared using Friedman’s non-parametric test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was employed for comparing two groups based on quantitative variables, while the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was utilized for more than two groups. Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated to analyze the correlation between two quantitative variables. Fisher’s exact test or the Chi-square test was used to assess the association between two categorical variables. Statistical significance was considered at p<0.05, with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons. Data analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics v.28.0 software by IBM Corp. in Armonk, NY.
Three hundred and forty patients underwent eligibility screening, with eighty ultimately enrolled in the study. Among them, only one patient necessitated intensive care during their COVID-19 illness, while the remaining individuals experienced mild to moderate symptoms that did not warrant hospitalization. Analysis of the study participants indicated an average age of 36.7 ± 10.3 years, with an average duration between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and the initiation of OT treatment being 63.9 ± 24.2 days (refer to Table 1). The average time from the onset of symptoms to the development of OD was 4.6 ± 3.8 days. Additional characteristics of the study cohort can be found in Table 2.
Table 3 illustrates a significant increase in the complaint of anosmia, the complete loss of the sense of smell, among patients during the COVID-19 period, with 82.5% reporting this symptom. In contrast, only 13.8% reported anosmia at the initial appointment, and none reported it after 4 weeks of occupational therapy (OT). Concurrently, the prevalence of self-reported hyposmia showed a progressive increase during this period, mirroring the trends observed for parosmia and phantosmia complaints. The history of ageusia was noted in 63.8% of patients during the COVID-19 period, but this prevalence rapidly declined to 1.3% by the study's conclusion. Dysgeusia complaints were reported by 23.8% of patients at the time of infection, increasing to 75% at the start of treatment and then decreasing to 63.8% after 4 weeks. Ultimately, only 3.8% of patients denied experiencing any chemosensory complaints by the study's end.
No statistically significant differences were observed between treatment groups in terms of sex, age, current or previous smoking status, use of nasal corticosteroid spray, COVID-19 vaccination status, the interval between onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment initiation, and the interval between the first appointment and the second visit, as indicated in Tables 4 and 5.
Participants' subjective sense of smell exhibited improvement over the course of the study and between medical appointments, as indicated by the olfaction VAS. The overall evaluation of all participants revealed a statistically significant variance when comparing the four time points at which assessments were conducted (pre-COVID-19, during COVID-19 acute phase, initial appointment, and follow-up) through both general comparison (non-parametric Friedman test; p < 0.05) and multivariate analysis (Dunn post hoc test corrected by Bonferroni; p < 0.05) (refer to Table 6). Another subjective metric, rated on a scale from 0 to 10, demonstrated improvement as discomfort related to olfactory deficits decreased between the first and second appointments, with mean scores of 7.2 ± 2.7 and 6.2 ± 3, respectively (p < 0.05). Furthermore, there was a significant enhancement in taste VAS scores between appointments, as outlined in Table 7.
In the comprehensive evaluation of the participants, a statistically significant improvement was observed in the mean UPSIT score, with a notable difference between the initial (25.2 ± 7.1) and final (26.7 ± 6.3) UPSIT scores, indicating a mean increase of 1.5 ± 3.9 in the final test score (Wilcoxon nonparametric test; p=0.002). Analysis of UPSIT and olfaction VAS between the COT and AOT groups did not reveal any significant differences among the treatment groups (Table 8). Furthermore, when examining the directly queried subjective improvement, where responses were limited to yes or no, 81.3% of participants reported improvement, yet no statistically significant variance was observed between the treatment groups.
In the context of other factors examined for their potential impact on olfactory outcomes, it was noted that individuals who experienced fluctuations in their sense of smell during the initial consultation exhibited higher UPSIT scores both at the baseline (26.8 ± 6.1 vs. 22.3 ± 7.9; p=0.011) and final evaluation (28.1 ± 4.8 vs. 24.0 ± 7.6; p=0.029) compared to those who did not report such fluctuations. Furthermore, these patients with varying olfactory abilities presented with more nasal symptoms during the first visit (5.2 ± 3.4 vs. 2.9 ± 3.0; p=0.003) than those without this particular symptom. However, despite these findings, individuals reporting olfactory fluctuations demonstrated a statistically lower subjective improvement, as indicated by olfactory VAS scores (1.8 ± 2.5 vs. 2.9 ± 1; p=0.03). The incidence of smell fluctuation between the initial and subsequent visits was found to be significantly different (binomial test; p=0.023), with 62.8% of patients reporting this symptom initially and 78.8% upon their return.
No significant association was observed between the reported alterations in nasal functions of the trigeminal nerve and the presence of chemosensory disorders at any of the assessed time points (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.05). Similarly, there was no correlation between these reported complaints and the mean UPSIT scores or the VAS scores based on the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.05).
To date, there have been limited randomized clinical trials investigating olfactory training in patients with COVID-19-related olfactory dysfunction, with no comparative studies on different variants of this therapy within this specific patient subset. This study stands out as the first to assess an alternative approach to olfactory training in these patients, utilizing a combination of eight essential oils simultaneously. Noteworthy in our research was the comprehensive evaluation conducted by an otolaryngologist, which included nasal endoscopy and a psychophysical test validated for this population and commonly utilized in olfactory research. Various potential influencing factors on olfactory complaints and response to therapy were meticulously controlled for, such as age, smoking history, duration of olfactory dysfunction, severity of the disorder, smell fluctuations, trigeminal function impairment reports, adherence to olfactory training, nasosinusal symptoms, and topical corticosteroid use. Patients were also provided with instructional videos on olfactory training via their smartphones and received follow-up calls to ensure compliance with the regimen.
The AOT essential oils were carefully selected by a fragrance expert within our research group, utilizing olfactory training methods like the Carles Method 10 to enhance recognition and memorization of odors. Our aim was to encompass a variety of odor families to stimulate different receptors in therapy, including representatives from citrus, floral, aromatic, and spice families like lemon, rose, eucalyptus, and clove, as well as minty, sweet, and woody scents such as citronella, mint, vanilla, and cedarwood. The addition of these scents to olfactory training was intended to optimize olfactory recovery in patients. However, our study revealed no statistically significant difference in UPSIT score progression between the AOT (1.0 ± 4.2) and COT groups (1.7 ± 3.8) (p=0.281). Similarly, there were no discernible variations between the groups in the data obtained from the various VAS-scores (refer to Table 8). These findings suggest that intensifying olfactory training does not demonstrate superiority over classical training within the 4-week timeframe proposed in this study.
In a study by Altundag et al., a modified version of olfactory training (OT) was evaluated, where patients were trained with four different scents every 12 weeks over a 36-week period. The group that underwent this alternating regimen performed better on the Sniffin' Sticks test compared to the group following the traditional 4-essence OT. Additionally, a positive correlation was noted between the duration of smell loss and the response to OT, a trend supported by previous studies. Our research focused on patients with recent olfactory dysfunction to enhance the potential benefits of training and facilitate group comparison. A notable distinction between our study and Altundag et al.'s work lies in the duration of OT use, which was notably shorter in our study and potentially linked to the lack of efficacy observed in the AOT group.
In a clinical study comparing periodic alternation of odors with classical training in patients with posttraumatic olfactory dysfunction (OD), no significant difference was found between the training modalities. It is well-established that olfactory rehabilitation through olfactory training (OT) yields varying outcomes based on the underlying cause of the dysfunction. Patients with posttraumatic etiology tend to exhibit poorer responses compared to those with postinfectious OD, for instance. However, there remains a gap in research as no study has yet investigated the effectiveness of modified OT in individuals recovering from COVID-19.
A challenge to the analysis and applicability of treatments for olfactory dysfunction (OD) is occupational therapy (OT) adherence. According to Fornazieri et al, adherence to treatment tends to decrease progressively over the course of treatment. To address this issue, the suggestion of intensifying OT by increasing the number of scents for a shorter treatment duration has been proposed. At the conclusion of the survey, only 3.75% of patients had discontinued treatment, with one in the AOT group and two in the TOC group. Daily adherence was high, with none of the patients failing to use the OT for 7 days, leading to no exclusions based on this criterion. Side effects were limited to mild symptoms, with no need to interrupt the OT. The most commonly reported complaints included headache, nausea, and worsening of nasal symptoms.
An essential aspect of our research involves the examination of self-assessment and performance in psychophysical tests. Within our study, 81.3% of participants noted an enhancement in their sense of smell, with 84.6% in the AOT group and 79.6% in the COT group (p=0.763). Across all groups, there was an average increase of 1.5 ± 3.9 points in the UPSIT score (p=0.002). While a change of four or more points in the UPSIT score is typically deemed clinically significant, this level of improvement was only observed in a minority of patients within the study. Previous literature has highlighted a weak correlation between these tests and subjective evaluations, emphasizing the necessity of utilizing standardized tests alongside self-assessment when evaluating patients with olfactory concerns.
The average time for the onset of olfactory dysfunction (OD) following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, as indicated in Table 1, was found to be 4.6 ± 3.8 days. This aligns with previous literature reports (22,23).
Numerous studies have indicated that COVID-19-related olfactory dysfunction (OD) typically has a brief recovery period for the majority of patients, manifesting around 1 to 2 weeks following the onset of the disorder (22, 24–26). Vaira et al. highlighted a heightened likelihood of a prolonged olfactory disturbance in individuals experiencing symptoms persisting beyond 20 days from the onset of OD (25). In our research, participants were specifically chosen after a minimum of 4 weeks of olfactory complaints to exclude those who might naturally recover irrespective of treatment.
In this study, consistent with existing literature, a sudden onset of anosmia was noted during the acute phase of COVID-19 (refer to Table 3), followed by a gradual improvement alongside the emergence of additional qualitative olfactory disorders. While parosmia appears to signal the restoration of olfactory discrimination and identification functions, no correlation was identified between the presence of this symptom and improved performance on the UPSIT or olfaction VAS assessments.
In the comprehensive examination of patients using gustation VAS (Table 7), the mean values were 6.1 ± 2.7 and 6.9 ± 2.5 at the initial and subsequent appointments, indicating an improvement of 0.8 ± 2.9 (p=0.009). Nevertheless, the analysis revealed no significant statistical variance between the OT groups (Table 8), both in terms of the mean at the initial appointment (p=0.608) and the disparity between this and the mean at the follow-up appointment (p=0.491).
During both assessments, patients were queried regarding their perception of fluctuations in their sense of smell. At baseline, such complaints were noted in 62.8% of patients, increasing to 78.8% by the end of the study, indicating a more pronounced prevalence compared to the findings reported by Jerome et al. As anticipated, individuals experiencing olfactory fluctuations exhibited elevated VAS scores for nasal symptoms (p=0.003). It is well-established that fluctuations in olfaction are frequently linked to nasal conditions, particularly allergic diseases, while being less prominent in individuals with postinfectious olfactory dysfunction.
The presence of this symptom during the initial appointment correlated with higher scores on both the first UPSIT (p=0.011) and the subsequent appointment (p=0.029). These findings potentially indicate a connection between these fluctuations and the regeneration process of the neuroepithelium.
Interestingly, fluctuations in olfaction were found to be associated with a decline in smell perception as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (p=0.029). It is worth noting that self-assessment of olfactory function often reflects alterations in nasal patency more prominently than changes in actual olfactory abilities. This observation helps elucidate why the fluctuations observed in our study were more pronounced in individuals experiencing more severe nasal symptoms, consequently leading to poorer VAS scores.
The trigeminal nerve plays a significant role in olfactory perception, particularly in the perception of freshness in minty odors and the tickling sensation associated with carbonated beverages. Its somatosensory function within the nasal cavity was evaluated through standardized inquiries during the initial patient assessment. The potential link between trigeminal function impairment and reported chemosensory disruptions was examined at three specific time points: during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, at the initial consultation, and upon follow-up. Interestingly, none of the reported disturbances appeared to be correlated with trigeminal function, indicating a probable divergence in pathophysiology from that of olfaction.
One primary limitation of the current study is the brief duration of the proposed treatment. The objective is to assess an alternative to the originally described TOC by Hummel et al. (8), which involves a more intensive approach, encompassing twice the number of scents and a shorter duration of stimulation. It is acknowledged that the majority of studies in this area have implemented olfactory training over an extended period, thereby constraining our ability to fully evaluate the potential advantages of AOT.
Another potential critique pertains to the choice of the psychophysical test utilized for patient assessment, specifically the UPSIT, which focuses solely on odor identification and neglects the evaluation of discrimination or olfactory threshold capabilities as seen in alternative tests. Nevertheless, research by Doty et al. proposed that various psychophysical tests tap into a shared source of variability, indicating that olfactory dysfunction and enhancement can be adequately gauged through odor identification alone.
A prospective evaluation using subjective scales and psychophysical tests in patients experiencing persistent olfactory dysfunction post-COVID revealed an enhancement in smell capacity following olfactory training (OT) conducted over a 4-week period. However, the findings indicate that intensifying the training by incorporating a greater variety of essences does not demonstrate superiority over the traditional four-week approach. Further research involving an extended treatment duration is necessary to more comprehensively assess the potential advantages of olfactory training. Moreover, the data suggests that individuals with fluctuating olfactory abilities exhibit higher scores in psychophysical assessments.
