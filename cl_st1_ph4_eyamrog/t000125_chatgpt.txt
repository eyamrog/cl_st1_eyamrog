The current study evaluates the performance of Brazilian universities in the "U-Multirank" from 2017 to 2020. "U-Multirank" is a multidimensional academic ranking originating in Europe and has been providing results since 2014. This ranking system offers a unique multidimensional approach aimed at highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each university through five dimensions, rather than a singular ranking. This model holds particular relevance in Brazil as it is the framework that Capes is adopting for the upcoming evaluation of the post-graduate system in the country. While there will be necessary adaptations, a comprehensive examination of this ranking is crucial to anticipate its future application. Notably, only 20 Brazilian universities were included in the 2020 ranking, a modest figure yet significant within the regional context, considering that South America as a whole has just 35 universities listed.
In recent years, academic international rankings have garnered increasing attention from scholars, students, and the general public (Eccles, 2002; Calderón; França; Gonçalves, 2017; Calderón; França, 2018a, 2018b; Dill; Soo, 2005; Ganga-Contreras et al., 2020). These rankings emerged at the onset of the 21st century and have consistently sparked debates due to their outcomes. Academic institutions worldwide strive to improve their positions in these rankings, often publicizing their achievements prominently upon attaining favorable results.
The ongoing debates surrounding these rankings have significantly increased their visibility, further fueling interest from various stakeholders. Over the past two decades, a plethora of research studies have emerged in this field, solidifying it as a distinct area of inquiry. Notable contributions include works by WEBSTER (2001), VAN RAAN (2005), LIU and CHENG (2005), AGUILLO et al. (2006), MARGINSON and VAN DER WENDE (2007), BILLAUT, BOUYSSOU, and VINKE (2010), AGUILLO et al. (2010), THÉRY (2010), SHIN and TOUTKOUSHIAN (2011), SHIN, TOUTKOUSHIAN, and TEICHLER (2011), BERNHARD (2012), MOURA and MOURA (2013), SORZ et al. (2015), STACK (2016), HERTING (2016), GONÇALVES and CALDERÓN (2017), LLOYD, ORDORIKA, and RODRIGUEZ-GÓMES (2011), DRESCH (2018), ANDRIOLA and ARAÚJO (2018), and ROTHEN and SANTANA (2018).
The initial ranking that emerged was the "Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) (http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2020.html), commonly referred to as the "Shanghai Ranking," established in 2003 (CALDERÓN; FRANÇA, 2018b). Its purpose was to assist the Chinese government in identifying universities for sending Chinese students overseas and to assess the standing of the leading Chinese universities in comparison to the top global institutions.
Subsequently, additional international rankings emerged. The "Webometrics Ranking of World Universities" (http://www.webometrics.info/en; AGUILLO; ORTEGA; FERNANDEZ, 2008) was introduced in 2004, alongside the ranking "THE-QS," which later split into the "Times Higher Education World University Rankings," referred to as "THE" (https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings), and the "QS World University Rankings," known as "QS" (https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings) in 2010. Following this trend, numerous other countries developed regional or national rankings (SHIN; TOUTKOUSHIAN, 2011; RIGHETTI, 2015 and 2019).
In the context of these discussions, a distinct concept emerged in Europe with the proposal of a multidimensional ranking system (Van Vught & Ziegele, 2012). This initial concept led to the development of "U-Multirank" (https://www.umultirank.org/), which assesses the performance of academic institutions across five dimensions: Teaching and Learning, Research, Knowledge Transfer, International Orientation, and Regional Engagement. Each dimension is assessed using multiple indicators, allowing users to evaluate universities based on individual indicators or grouped categories, focusing on the aspects most relevant to their needs.
The extensive use of indicators in "U-Multirank" provides a comprehensive perspective on universities, yet it also highlights the issue of data scarcity, especially for non-European institutions, notably those in Latin American countries. A significant portion of the data is sourced from questionnaires distributed to universities, but many institutions fail to consistently report this information. This concern is particularly relevant when examining the Brazilian universities included in this ranking.
In South America, this ranking remains relatively less popular, with only 35 universities included in the 2020 version: 3 from Argentina, 20 from Brazil, 6 from Chile, 3 from Colombia, 2 from Ecuador, and 1 from Peru. Despite the limited representation of Brazilian universities in the ranking, Brazil holds a prominent regional position in this regard.
The concept of a multi-dimensional ranking system was first introduced in 2008 (Van Vught & Ziegele, 2012). Subsequently, the European Commission embarked on the development of a comprehensive academic ranking system, with the initial complete results being unveiled in May 2014. This ranking system was formulated and executed by the European Commission in collaboration with a consortium comprising the Centre for Higher Education (CHE) in Germany, the Center for Higher Education Policy Studies (CHEPS) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and The Foundation for Knowledge and Development (Fundación CYD) in Spain. Dr. Frans van Vught from CHEPS and Dr. Frank Ziegele from CHE lead this project. Although relatively recent, this ranking system is gaining traction. The 2020 edition encompassed 1,788 universities from 92 countries, encompassing approximately 5,000 faculty members and over 11,400 programs across 28 subject areas. (https://www.umultirank.org/about/u-multirank/frequently-asked-questions/)
As previously elucidated, "U-Multirank" does not provide a comprehensive ranking of universities; instead, it categorizes them based on specific performance indicators that are organized into five dimensions. This approach highlights the individual strengths and weaknesses of each university across various indicators and dimensions. Users have the flexibility to create their own customized rankings by selecting the dimensions and indicators that align with their specific requirements.
The U-Multirank categorizes universities into five performance groups based on each indicator: A (Very good), B (Good), C (Average), D (Below average), and E (Weak). This classification system helps mitigate accuracy issues by consolidating grades, thereby confining these issues primarily to the boundaries between the performance groups.
The data utilized by "U-Multirank" for categorizing academic institutions is sourced from questionnaires submitted by the institutions themselves and open-source databases, including bibliometric and international patent databases. Additionally, it incorporates surveys completed by around 145,000 students. These details can be accessed at the following links: https://www.umultirank.org/export/sites/default/press-media/documents/IR-2020-questionnaire_display-version.pdf and https://www.umultirank.org/export/sites/default/press-media/documents/UMR_Studifragebogen_2020_english.pdf.
As anticipated, data from universities and students may not always be readily accessible due to non-responses to questionnaires. Additionally, there exists a challenge of low reliability and accuracy in the gathered data. While this poses a weakness in the ranking system, it is not deemed critical as the primary objective is not to create an all-encompassing classification. Users can still derive value from the available information while disregarding the missing data points.
Figure 1 illustrates the traditional graphical representation utilized to present the outcomes provided by "U-Multirank" (https://www.umultirank.org/). The circle depicts the five Dimensions: Teaching and Learning (green), Research (pink), Knowledge Transfer (blue), International Orientation (orange), and Regional Engagement (purple). Each Dimension consists of specific Indicators represented as segments of the circle. Within the Teaching & Learning Dimension, the Indicators include: 1- Bachelor graduation rate, 2- Masters graduation rate, 3 - Graduating on time (bachelors), 4 - Graduating on time (masters). In the Research Dimension, the Indicators encompass: 5 - External research income, 6 - Research publications (size-normalized), 7 - Art related output, 8 - Citation rate, 9 - Top cited publications, 10 - Interdisciplinary publications, 11 - Post-doc positions. The Knowledge Transfer Dimension features: 12 - Income from private sources, 13 - Co-publications with industrial partners, 14 - Patents awarded (size-normalized), 15 - Industry co-patents, 16 - Spin-offs, 17 - Publications cited in patents, 18 - Income from continuous professional development. The International Orientation Dimension includes: 19 - Foreign language bachelor programs, 20 - Foreign language master programs, 21 - Student mobility, 22 - International academic staff, 23 - International doctorate degrees, 24 - International joint publications. Lastly, the Regional Engagement Dimension comprises: 25 - Bachelor graduates working in the region, 26 - Student internships in the region, 27 - Regional joint publications, 28 - Income from regional sources, 29 - Master graduates working in the region. Additional information can be found in the Indicator book of "U-Multirank" (https://www.umultirank.org/export/sites/default/press-media/documents/Indicator-Book-2020.pdf), which includes specifics on the grading calculations. It is important to note that the graphical representation does not include all 36 Indicators utilized in the 2020 version of the ranking, omitting: Research publications (absolute numbers), Strategic research partnerships, Professional publications, Open Access Publications, Patents awarded (absolute numbers), Graduate companies, and Regional Publications with Industrial Partners.
The subsequent phase of the ongoing research involves conducting an individual analysis of the performances of the 20 Brazilian Universities featured in the 2020 edition of the ranking, utilizing the graphical representation depicted in Fig. 1. The primary objective is to gain an initial insight into the performance of Brazilian universities in 2020, paving the way for a comprehensive study spanning the years 2017 to 2020. This phase builds upon the research conducted by Morandin et al. (2020), which juxtaposed the outcomes derived from "U-Multirank" with those from the Ranking Universitário Folha in 2020. The outcomes of these universities are illustrated in Figure 2.
The Brazilian academic institutions included in the 2020 ranking, sourced from the website "https://www.umultirank.org/" on February 18, 2020, comprise a list of prominent universities. These institutions are: Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Federal University of São Paulo, State University of Maringá, Federal University of São Carlos, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Fluminense Federal University, University of Campinas, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, Federal University of Ceará, Federal University of Pernambuco, University of Brasília, Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing (ESPM), University of São Paulo, UNESP State University of São Paulo, Federal University of Paraná, Federal University of Viçosa, Rio de Janeiro State University, and Federal University of Mato Grosso.
One notable observation pertains to the substantial presence of missing data, visually depicted by the slices of circles exhibiting lighter shades, indicative of indicators with incomplete information. This prevalent issue within the "U-Multirank" underscores the imperative for Brazilian institutions aspiring to enhance their standings in this ranking to diligently address and rectify such data gaps.
The Teaching and Learning Dimension (green) stands out as having the largest amount of missing data among the institutions under observation. Twelve institutions lack any reported data in this dimension, four have two missing data points, two have one, and one institution (ESPM) has three missing data points, while only the Federal University of Ceará has all data available. The data utilized in this dimension is sourced from questionnaires provided by the institutions, which accounts for the high number of missing data points. To enhance their standing in this dimension, institutions must prioritize reporting data. Notably, ESPM made its debut in this ranking in 2020 and is already the second-highest in terms of data reporting, indicating a strong commitment to this ranking. Analyzing the performance of institutions with substantial data, we find that the Federal University of Ceará has received good grades, with 1 C, 2 B, and 1 A. Similarly, ESPM demonstrates a commendable performance, securing 1 C, 1 B, and 1 A.
The next dimension to be analyzed is research, which offers a wealth of data compared to teaching and learning. This abundance is primarily due to the fact that indicators such as research publications (size-normalized), citation rate, top-cited publications, and interdisciplinary publications can be sourced from open channels. Conversely, indicators like external research income, art-related output, and post-doctoral positions rely on information provided by institutions.
An examination of Fig. 2 reveals that the University of Campinas, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, and Unesp have data available for six out of the seven indicators, which is a commendable achievement. On the lower end of the spectrum, Rio de Janeiro State University stands out with data available for only three indicators, while the remaining 16 institutions have data available for at least four indicators. In terms of grades, Unesp (3 A, 1 B, 2 D) and the University of Campinas (3 A, 1 B, 1 C, 1 D) exhibit the strongest performances in this dimension. Following closely are the State University of Maringá, Federal University of São Carlos, Federal University of Pernambuco, and the University of São Paulo, each with 2 A grades.
In terms of Knowledge Transfer (KT), all the institutions included in the study possess data for at least three out of the seven indicators examined. Notably, the University of Campinas stands out as the sole institution with data available for all seven indicators. Within this dimension, four indicators are sourced from open outlets: Co-publications with industrial partners, Patents awarded (size-normalized), Industry co-patents, and Publications cited in patents. The remaining indicators, namely Income from continuous professional development, Income from private sources, and Spin-offs, rely on institutional reports for data. It is worth mentioning that ESPM leads the pack with three indicators rated as A, while five other institutions follow closely with two A ratings each.
The International Orientation dimension, highlighted in orange, is the fourth dimension under scrutiny in this research. This dimension comprises six indicators, with only International joint publications being sourced from open outlets. The remaining five indicators are sourced from the institutions themselves and include Foreign language bachelor and master programs, Student mobility, International academic staff, and International doctorate degrees. Notably, twelve institutions have data available for just one indicator, sourced from open outlets (International joint publications), indicating a need for enhanced reporting in this dimension. Conversely, four universities have data available for all six indicators, demonstrating proactive efforts to report data and improve their ranking positions. These universities include Unesp, University of São Paulo, State University of Campinas, and State University of Maringá. The Federal University of Ceará stands out with the sole A grade, while the University of São Paulo and University of Campinas each received a B grade, marking the next best performances in this dimension.
In examining the Dimension of Regional Engagement (purple), it becomes evident that there are five indicators to consider. Regional joint publications are the only indicator sourced from open channels, while the remaining indicators are derived from institutional data. These include Bachelor graduates employed within the region, student internships within the region, income generated from regional sources, and Master graduates working in the region. Notably, there is a significant amount of missing data within this dimension, with sixteen out of the twenty institutions only providing data for the indicator sourced from open channels (Regional joint publications). This deficiency can be attributed to inadequate data reporting practices. Among the institutions, ESPM stands out with the most comprehensive results, boasting data for four indicators and achieving a performance rating of 3 A's and 1 B. Following closely is the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, which received a rating of 2 A's.
Next, we delve into the issue of missing data concerning Brazilian institutions throughout the entire period under study (2017-2020). This aspect holds significant importance as the absence of data stands as a primary factor contributing to lower rankings within this context.
Figure 3 illustrates the percentage of data available for all 35 indicators utilized over the four years under examination. These indicators encompass a range of metrics including bachelor and master graduation rates, on-time graduation rates for both levels, citation rates, research publication figures, external research income, art-related output, top-cited publications, interdisciplinary publications, post-doc positions, strategic research partnerships, professional publications, co-publications with industrial partners, income from private sources, patents awarded, industry co-patents, spinoffs, publications cited in patents, income from continuous professional development, graduate companies, foreign language programs at bachelor and master levels, student mobility, international academic staff, joint international publications, international doctorate degrees, graduates working in the region, student internships in the region, regional joint publications, and income from regional sources. Notably, indicators such as "Graduating on time (long first degree)", "Long first degree graduation rate", "Open Access Publications", and "Regional Publications with Industrial Partners" were exclusive to the year 2020 and were not considered in the other years examined, thus omitted from this study. Each year from 2017 to 2020 is represented by a distinct colored line: blue for 2017, red for 2018, green for 2019, and purple for 2020.
It is evident that there are notable similarities in the data across the years 2019 and 2020, with slight improvements observed in certain indicators, particularly in the first two indicators (1 - Bachelor graduation rate and 2 - Masters graduation rate) and indicators 24 to 27 (24 - Foreign language bachelor programs, 25 - Foreign language master programs, 26 - Student mobility, 27 - International academic staff). This suggests a gradual increase in data availability, although it remains below the desired level. Notably, only 12 out of the 35 possible indicators (34.29%) have data available exceeding 90% in at least one of the years. In our analysis of Brazilian institutions, we will focus on these 12 indicators to gain insights into their performance based on the available information.
Next, Figure 4 illustrates the progression of the overall data accessibility pertaining to Brazilian Institutions from 2017 to 2020. The data reveals a peak of 44.71% in the years 2019 and 2020, marking a notable increase from the minimum of 38.48% recorded in 2018. This indicates a stabilization in this metric over the past two years, showcasing some advancements compared to preceding years. However, despite these improvements, the current value falls short of being sufficiently competitive to secure favorable rankings for our Universities.
In examining the issue of missing data comprehensively, it was noted that among the 1788 academic institutions featured in the 2020 ranking, there was a prevalence of 39.84% missing data, 5.70% data categorized as "not applicable," and 54.46% of data that was accessible. This indicates that Brazilian institutions lag approximately 10% behind the global average in terms of data availability. A comparative analysis with European countries, where "U-Multiranking" originated, reveals that out of the 79 Spanish educational institutions assessed in the 2020 edition, 86.15% of the data is accessible. Spain serves as a pertinent benchmark due to its substantial representation in the ranking. Consequently, Brazilian institutions fall approximately 40% below their Spanish counterparts in terms of data availability.
A broader comparison can be drawn by examining a larger sample of European universities. When looking at the top 300 best-performing institutions in Europe for the year 2020, based on the average of various dimensions, it becomes evident that they possess 85.72% of available data, with 10.20% of data missing and 4.08% deemed as "not applicable." It is important to note that this represents an upper threshold, given that these are the top performers within Europe as per the ranking criteria. Consequently, Brazilian institutions lag behind, approximately 40% below the top 300 European universities in terms of performance metrics.
Upon examining these figures, it becomes evident that there is a considerable distance to cover in order to achieve satisfactory levels of accessible data. Encouragingly, it is apparent that Brazilian Universities have the potential to enhance their standings in this ranking simply by consistently and precisely reporting data.
Subsequently, an examination was conducted on the performance of Brazilian Universities listed in the four years under scrutiny in this research (2017-2020). This analysis focused solely on indicators with data availability exceeding 90%. The indicators considered encompassed Citation rate, Research publications (absolute numbers), Research publications (size-normalized), Top-cited publications, Interdisciplinary publications, Co-publications with industrial partners, Patents awarded (absolute numbers), Patents awarded (size-normalized), Spinoffs, Publications cited in patents, International joint publications, and Regional joint publications.
The initial challenge lies in devising a comprehensive classification of academic institutions utilizing the "U-Multirank," a tool not originally designed for this purpose. Despite its primary objective differing, the "U-Multirank" does generate general classifications upon request. For instance, upon querying the 2020 version for a broad classification of Brazilian universities solely based on Indicators with over 90% data availability, the resulting list is presented in Table 1.
In order to establish this classification, "U-Multirank" employs a criterion akin to an "Olympic Medals Table." Universities with the highest number of A grades are deemed the top performers, with scores of B and below factoring in solely as tiebreakers. Consequently, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro secures the first position, boasting 3 A grades, 3 B grades, 2 C grades, and 3 D grades, surpassing the Federal University of São Carlos, which secures the second spot with 3 A grades, 2 B grades, and 6 D grades. Subsequent rankings adhere to the same methodology.
This method of general classification is questionable as it does not consider overall performance across all indicators. Additionally, assigning different weights to each dimension poses a problem, as dimensions with more indicators may disproportionately influence the overall evaluation. An illustrative example can be seen in the comparison of the second and third positions on the list. According to the criteria set by "U-Multirank," the Federal University of São Carlos holds the second position with 3 A grades, 2 B grades, and 6 D grades, while the University of São Paulo occupies the third spot with 3 A grades, 1 B grade, 3 C grades, and 5 D grades. If we were to assign point values to grades, such as A = 5, B = 4, C = 3, D = 2, and E = 1, the Federal University of São Carlos would accumulate 35 points, whereas the University of São Paulo would amass 38 points, indicating a stronger overall performance. Consequently, the ranking positions would be reversed, placing the University of São Paulo in second place. It is evident that this approach may lead to various potential issues of a similar nature.
In addressing this issue, various solutions can be considered. In this study, a distinct approach is adopted for categorizing Universities comprehensively. Initially, averages of Indicators within each Dimension are computed, followed by the calculation of a global average incorporating values from all Dimensions. This method assigns equal weight to each Dimension, irrespective of the number of Indicators, thereby avoiding the nearly equal significance given to grades B or E, as observed in the "U-Multirank" system.
In this study, we will analyze the performances of individual Brazilian institutions across each year. Rather than relying on the conventional "Olympic Medals Table" approach used by U-Multirank, which focuses solely on the number of A, we will assess the overall performance of each institution by utilizing the average of the dimensions as a parameter for classification. Tables 2 to 5 present the performance data of each Brazilian university from 2017 to 2020. These tables display the averages of all indicators, the averages of indicators within each dimension, and the averages of the dimensions, incorporating all available data for a comprehensive analysis.
In 2017, as depicted in Table 2, São Paulo State University (UNESP) demonstrated a significant advantage with an average score of 2.81 points, surpassing the Federal University of Mato Grosso, which secured the second position with 1.56 points. Subsequently, all other universities fell below the 1.0 point threshold, closely clustered together. Notably, a mere 0.32 points separated the third-ranked institution from the last. UNESP excelled across all dimensions, particularly noteworthy are the categories of "Teaching and Learning," where it scored 3.25 points, a dimension where only UNESP and the Federal University of Mato Grosso (2.00 points) provided data, and "Regional Engagement," where UNESP achieved an impressive score of 4.00, in contrast to the second-place score of 1.17, also held by the Federal University of Mato Grosso. The underlying reasons for these outcomes warrant further investigation, yet it is crucial to acknowledge that UNESP significantly expanded its campus network in recent decades by assimilating smaller private academic institutions across various cities in São Paulo state.
In 2018, as depicted in Table 3, São Paulo State University (UNESP) maintained a clear advantage, despite a decrease in its score from 2.81 points in 2017 to 2.49 points in 2018. UNESP still holds a significant lead over the second-place holder, the Federal University of Mato Grosso, which averaged 1.57 points, a mere 0.01 increase from its 2017 result. Following the top two positions, all other universities fall below the 1.0 point mark, closely clustered with a mere 0.29 points separating the third and last positions. UNESP continues to dominate across all dimensions, particularly excelling in "Teaching and Learning" with 3.25 points, a dimension where only UNESP and the Federal University of Mato Grosso (2.00 points) have provided data, mirroring the 2017 results. Additionally, in the "Regional Engagement" dimension, UNESP experienced a significant decline from 4.00 in 2017 to 2.50 in 2018, while the Federal University of Mato Grosso saw an increase from 1.17 to 1.33. This shift is the primary reason for the narrowing gap between the top two Brazilian universities.
In 2019, as depicted in Table 4, a noticeable increase in reported data is observed, particularly within the "Teaching and Learning" Dimension. Presently, there are five Institutions with available data in this Dimension, as opposed to the previous two. All five Universities now boast average grades exceeding 1.00 points. Consequently, this alteration has led to a shift in the ranking of top performers. UNESP São Paulo State University retains its leading position, albeit with a reduced average of 2.42 points, marking a decrease of 0.07 from 2018. The State University of Campinas now secures the second spot, boasting an average of 2.05 points, a mere 0.01 points ahead of the Federal University of Ceará in third place. The University of São Paulo follows in fourth place, with an average of 1.85 points. Federal University of Mato Grosso has slipped to fifth place, now holding 1.27 points, a decline of 0.30 points from its 2018 results. Federal University of São Paulo, with 1.04 points, rounds off the list of Brazilian Universities surpassing the 1.00-point threshold, securing the sixth position.
Unesp no longer dominates across all dimensions, now leading solely in "Regional Engagement" and sharing the top spot with the State University of Campinas in "Teaching and Learning." In addition to this shared position with Unesp, the State University of Campinas also leads in "Research" and "Knowledge Transfer." The category of "International Orientation" is spearheaded by the Federal University of Ceará.
As Brazilian universities place greater emphasis on reporting data, the results become increasingly diverse among them, leading to a dispersion of top rankings across various dimensions rather than being concentrated in a single university.
In 2020, as depicted in Table 5, a noticeable trend of escalating data reporting persists, especially within the "Teaching and Learning" Dimension, now encompassing data from eight Institutions. Furthermore, there has been a rise in the count of Brazilian Universities with average grades surpassing 1.00 points, now totaling eight such institutions.
Three institutions that were not previously listed have emerged: ESPM (Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing), Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, and State University of Maringá. These institutions have secured notable positions in the ranking, with ESPM claiming the top spot, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul ranking sixth, and State University of Maringá in seventh place. This achievement reflects the significant efforts made by these institutions in providing data to "U-Multirank." It is worth noting that ESPM is not a university but a smaller academic institution, prompting the need for further investigation into how the size of an institution may influence its ranking position.
Following ESPM, which boasts an average score of 2.82 for the Dimensions, the State University of Campinas once again secures the second position with a consistent score of 2.05, mirroring its 2019 performance. Notably, it now stands as the leading institution among the largest Brazilian Universities. The Federal University of Ceará retains its third-place position, trailing the State University of Campinas by a mere 0.02 points. Surpassing the 2.00-point threshold, the University of São Paulo claims the fourth spot, maintaining an average score of 1.85. UNESP São Paulo State University, on the other hand, slips to fifth place, attributed to both the improved performances of other institutions and its own setbacks, resulting in a significant decline to an average grade of 1.76, marking a substantial decrease of 0.66 points from the previous year.
Among the institutions with average scores exceeding 1.00 points, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul stands out with a score of 1.75, followed by the State University of Maringá at 1.73 points, and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro at 1.03 points.
In the realm of knowledge transfer and regional engagement, the newly established ESPM takes the lead, with the University of Campinas once again at the forefront in research and sharing leadership in international orientation with the University of São Paulo. Federal University of Ceará now spearheads teaching and learning initiatives.
The current study assessed the performance of Brazilian universities in the "U-Multirank" from 2017 to 2020. "U-Multirank" is a multidimensional academic ranking that holds significant importance in Brazil, as it serves as the basis for a new method being adopted by Capes to evaluate the post-graduate system in the country.
It was noted that this ranking is not widely embraced in Brazil, with only 20 Brazilian institutions included. Similarly, South America has a mere 35 universities listed. There is a pressing need to enhance these figures as this ranking is gaining traction globally.
Another crucial aspect of this ranking is its exclusion of indicators reliant on "reputation" surveys, a common feature in other prominent rankings such as "QS" and "THE". Consequently, the results are grounded solely in highly objective indicators. However, a notable drawback is the extensive reliance on questionnaires sent by institutions for a significant number of indicators, with many institutions failing to provide regular reports. Consequently, a prevalent issue within this ranking is the scarcity of data due to incomplete submissions.
Brazilian institutions have shown an improvement in data availability, with percentages rising from a minimum of 38.48% in 2018 to 44.71% in 2019 and 2020. Despite this increase, these figures remain below the global average of 54.46% in 2020, as well as the averages of Spanish institutions (86.15%) and the top 300 performers in Europe (85.72%), both also recorded in 2020.
When examining individual performances, it is evident that São Paulo State University (UNESP) held the top position in the rankings for both 2017 and 2018, yet experienced a decline in subsequent years. The year 2019 witnessed a surge in reported data and the emergence of new Brazilian institutions in the rankings, underscoring the increasing significance of this ranking within Brazil. This development has led to a more distributed leadership across institutions in various dimensions, thereby enhancing the balance among the top performers in Brazil. The trend towards greater equilibrium among institutions was further solidified in 2020.
This initial study serves as a foundational exploration, highlighting the significance of the identified aspects that warrant further in-depth investigation.
The author expresses gratitude to "U-Multiranking" for providing the data utilized in this study, which were obtained through a formal request to the organization.
