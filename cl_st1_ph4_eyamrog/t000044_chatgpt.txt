Can gestures enhance the teaching and learning process? This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current research within the realm of education, focusing specifically on gestural communication. Studies have been conducted across various educational levels, highlighting the efficacy of gestures in aiding second language acquisition, inclusive education, and science and math instruction. The existing body of research consistently demonstrates the beneficial impact of gestural communication in facilitating the introduction and comprehension of new vocabulary in second language instruction, serving as a valuable tool for both teachers and students with disabilities, and enhancing the teaching of complex and abstract concepts in the fields of science and mathematics. Notably, there is compelling evidence suggesting that gestures serve as a covert yet potent means of information exchange, learning facilitation, and even reasoning assistance.
In everyday communication, individuals tend to gesticulate while speaking, with gestures often conveying information that may not be readily apparent in the spoken words. This phenomenon extends to students as well, where their gestures can serve as indicators of conceptual uncertainties, offering teachers valuable insights into their thought processes. Moreover, students themselves can benefit from their own gestures or those of their instructors, as these non-verbal cues can prompt the discovery of new ideas or perspectives. As highlighted by Novack and Goldin-Meadow (2015), gestures possess the dual capacity to not only mirror a student's comprehension of a problem but also to actively influence and enhance their understanding.
According to Walkington, Chelule, Woods, and Nathan (2019), gestures are crucial in mathematical reasoning, serving as a sign that mathematical comprehension is embodied, intrinsically connected to action, perception, and the physical body. When students collaborate and participate in mathematical conversations, they employ discourse strategies like explaining, challenging, and enhancing each other's reasoning, frequently blending speech with gestures during discussions.
Developing research based on gesture analysis holds promise as the use of gestures in education remains under-researched and is a relatively new topic (FLOOD et al., 2014). Understanding the potential impact of gestures on the learning process is crucial, given their natural presence in our daily lives. Gestures serve as a communication channel between the most adept tutor and the learner, a facet often overlooked by traditional learning theories.
However, what is the significance of gestures in the interaction between a teacher and student in the context of teaching and learning? Are gestures considered a crucial communication channel in the classroom setting? How do gestures aid in the teaching process? Is there existing research in the field of education that focuses on gesture analysis and its impact on teaching practices? With these inquiries in mind, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to explore the pertinent aspects and studies concerning education and gestures. In light of these inquiries, this literature review aims to address the overarching question that encapsulates our objectives: What role does non-verbal communication, specifically gestures, play in the facilitation of the teaching and learning process?
The aim of this study is to explore evidence from both Brazilian and international educational research literature regarding the impact of gestures on teaching and learning processes, and to examine the current trends in this particular research domain.
This study seeks to explore the role of gestures in enhancing the teaching and learning experience for students by conducting a comprehensive literature review. To achieve this objective, we have outlined four distinct stages, or key components, that are essential for the successful completion of this research endeavor (refer to Figure 1).
Figure 1 illustrates the search procedures employed in this study. The initial step involved defining the search problem, as previously discussed, which included determining the databases to be utilized, selecting appropriate search terms (key words), and specifying the search period. Following the delineation of our research parameters, the subsequent stage of the investigation entailed conducting the actual search for relevant studies pertaining to our central theme.
The study utilized three primary databases: ERIC, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The search terms employed across all three platforms were "gestures" and "learning," with the search period set between 2000 and 2019.
The third phase involved the selection of articles based on exclusion and inclusion criteria, as outlined in Table 1. Subsequently, the final stage of the research process entailed a comprehensive reading of the chosen articles and the subsequent development of this text to address the central research question posed in the study.
Similar to Pereira et al. (2019), our research also adopted a two-phase approach for the inclusion or exclusion of selected articles during the literature review. In the initial phase, we evaluated the titles, abstracts, and keywords of the articles. Subsequently, based on predefined criteria, we proceeded to the second phase. This latter phase involved a thorough reading of the complete papers identified in the first phase, followed by their classification based on similarities and proximity to our research objectives.
A table (Table 1) was devised to aid in the selection of articles, with criteria developed by the authors of this study. The criteria were carefully crafted to provide a focused perspective aimed at addressing the research problem driving this literature review.
After selecting 69 articles based on established criteria, we initially categorized them by teaching levels to pinpoint where research on gestures in teaching and learning is most prevalent along the academic trajectory. Subsequently, we arranged the articles in a historical sequence based on publication dates to ascertain any trends in publication frequency, indicating a potential rise in research interest. The final grouping of articles from phase 1 involved a thorough content analysis of each article, leading to the emergence of categories organically during the reading process.
The findings suggest a consistent growth in the utilization of gestures for educational purposes since 2009, as illustrated in Graph 1.
In terms of the distribution of papers based on the categories identified during the review process, the majority (71%) are focused on activities implemented within classroom settings. Approximately 21% of the papers pertain to research concerning the teaching of a second language through the utilization of gestures and inclusive educational practices. The remaining 8% of the articles fall under the category of theoretical reflections.
Research conducted in educational settings has predominantly focused on Elementary School and Higher Education levels, with limited attention given to postgraduate classrooms in relation to the subject of gestures in education, as indicated by Graph 2.
Following the establishment of the initial pre-defined categories for analysis, which were organized based on factors such as year and school level, a subsequent categorization was conducted. The objective of this secondary categorization was to ascertain the significance of gestures in the educational process, with the intention of clustering the articles identified in the literature review into categories that would effectively address our research inquiry. These emergent categories were derived from a thorough examination of the literature, taking into account the commonalities among the articles and their respective impacts on the teaching and learning dynamics.
The research article delves into various categories including the construction of knowledge and concepts, analysis of non-verbal communication by students, analysis of non-verbal communication by teachers, analysis of mental images of teachers, teaching for inclusive education, and the teaching of languages as depicted in Figure 2.
These categories provide insights into the potential impact of gestures on the teaching process, drawing from existing research conducted in classroom settings across various educational levels. The initial category highlights the role of gestures, employed by both teachers and students, in facilitating knowledge construction. Through gestures, students can articulate their thoughts and grasp abstract concepts that may otherwise seem distant from their everyday experiences. The subsequent categories shed light on the significance of analyzing non-verbal communication, particularly gestures, in the context of teaching and learning. Such analysis enables a deeper understanding of students' inquiries, comprehension levels, and overall engagement, thereby offering opportunities for enhancing instructional practices.
The fourth category introduces two articles that discuss how gestures can offer insights into students' mental imagery. These articles highlight the role of gesticulation in revealing students' mental images, aiding in understanding their thought processes during discussions with peers and teachers, as well as when explaining and justifying their responses related to Physics concepts.
The penultimate category, inclusive education, delves into research concerning the significance of gestures in the instruction of students with inclusion needs, specifically focusing on autistic students. The final category encompasses articles that support the use of gestures in teaching a second language or the native language itself. To facilitate a clearer comprehension of these categories, the accompanying diagram illustrates the research question, the distinct categories, and the authors who endorse each category.
Do gestures aid in student learning beyond merely guiding their visual focus? Wakefield et al. (2019) delved into this notion by employing eye-tracking technology to investigate a commonly suggested mechanism - the capacity of gestures to direct visual attention. Drawing from earlier research by Singer and Goldin-Meadow (2005), the authors highlight the potential of conveying new concepts through gestures, where hand movements complement verbal explanations. Through their study, it was revealed that children exposed to math lessons with accompanying gestures, as observed through eye-tracking metrics, exhibit distinct patterns in visual attention compared to those without gestures. These students tend to scrutinize the problem being elucidated more intently, divert less attention towards the instructor, and display a greater tendency to synchronize their visual focus with the information being conveyed in the instructor's speech.
In 2012, Garcia and Infante published a study focusing on the influence of gestures within the mathematical learning environment of higher education workshops. Following the workshops, the researchers observed a notable correlation between the use of gestures, both dynamic and static, and the students' cognitive processes. These gestures were found to be integral to the students' problem-solving strategies, particularly in relation to diagramming and problem construction. Interestingly, the complexity of the problems presented seemed to directly impact the frequency and intensity of students' gestures. Furthermore, the researchers noted a social aspect to gesture adoption, with students being influenced by their peers' gestures and subsequently incorporating and modifying these gestures over time.
In their exploration of how gestures can enhance STEM teaching, Stieff, Lira, and Scopelitis (2016) conducted two studies in Chicago (USA) to investigate the impact of gestures on students' spatial thinking in STEM content. The first study compared the effectiveness of watching and reproducing gestures versus reading a text, while the second study compared the impact of gestures with an instructional method involving concrete models but lacking gestures. The findings revealed that gestures can serve as a valuable tool in supporting students' spatial cognition in STEM disciplines, as students who utilized gestures outperformed those who did not, indicating the efficacy of incorporating gestures in teaching practices.
Chue, Lee, and Tan (2015) conducted a study within the realm of higher education focusing on Chemistry in Singapore. Their research aimed to provide a concise literature review on communication and education, highlighting the potential impact of iconic gestures in science education. Specifically, they examined the use of iconic gestures by a university professor to illustrate abstract concepts like particle size, position, and movement. The researchers proposed that these gestures could enhance the understanding of complex scientific ideas, offering a more comprehensive representation of meaning beyond verbal communication.
These four studies collectively demonstrate the significant role gestures play in knowledge construction. As a complement to speech, gestures become particularly crucial when conveying complex and essential explanations. They serve as a valuable aid in facilitating students' cognitive processes, enhancing their ability to think critically and reason effectively within the educational context.
When students engage in discussions about topics covered in class with others, it is common to observe them resorting to gestures to elucidate and elaborate on their ideas and concepts. Flood et al. (2014) suggest that this practice represents a form of public, visually accessible spatial communication, where gestures and bodily movements serve as effective tools for conceptualizing the intricate, submicroscopic, three-dimensional, and dynamic aspects of chemical phenomena.
Laburú, Silva, and Zômpero (2015) conducted a study with high school students focusing on Electrostatics concepts through experimental activities to gain insights into the students' scientific understanding. The evaluation of students during these activities revealed that certain concepts were challenging to grasp, leading to misconceptions or a complete absence of understanding. This lack of clarity was attributed to difficulties in visualization rather than a fundamental misunderstanding of the concepts themselves. The researchers suggested that gestures played a crucial role in helping teachers comprehend students' grasp of scientific knowledge, emphasizing their significance in shaping students' cognitive development in relation to scientific concepts.
In 2015, Weinberg, Fukawa-Connelly, and Wiesner conducted a study in the United States aimed at exploring the role of gestures in enhancing mathematical thinking and communication within the field of Mathematics. The research was carried out at a public university within the context of an introductory abstract algebra course. The findings of the study revealed that gestures play a significant role in conveying both specific and general mathematical meanings, underscoring the interconnectedness of various components within the semiotic framework.
The examination of students in this study revealed that gestures serve as a valuable tool for teachers to comprehend their students better, particularly in understanding their challenges in verbal expression. Through gestural analysis, educators can gain insights into the inner workings of students' minds, particularly in conveying abstract concepts.
In 2017, Aizawa, Giordan, and Silva conducted a study involving graduate students during their mandatory undergraduate internships. Employing Video-Stimulated Remembrance, the researchers recorded the students while they were teaching their classes, subsequently analyzing their gestures based on Kendon's (2004) categories. The findings of this study indicate that the undergraduates exhibited an enhanced gestural and multimodal perception, demonstrating an increased awareness of verbal content, body positioning, and hand gestures. This heightened awareness enabled them to potentially adjust their actions in order to convey meanings more effectively in the future (Aizawa, Giordan, & Silva, 2017).
In 2014, Mortimer et al. conducted a study in Brazil focusing on how two university teachers utilized various semiotic modes to facilitate interaction and construct meanings in Chemistry classes. The teachers' instructional methods were recorded and subsequently analyzed. The findings revealed that each teacher employed and integrated diverse semiotic modes, including speech, gestures, and board drawings, as tools for communication with students. The study highlighted the significance of these semiotic modes, particularly gestures, in enhancing the construction of meanings within the classroom setting.
Both Brazilian researchers discovered in their study how analyzing teachers' gestures can open up new avenues for teaching and provide valuable support during classes. Their findings underscore the importance of teachers being mindful of their gestures while instructing. By utilizing gestures effectively, educators can enhance students' comprehension and prevent the transmission of misconceptions or inaccuracies.
Scherr (2008) surpasses previous research on gestures in higher education by aiming to provide evidence that students' gestures can not only supplement gaps in verbal expressions but also offer valuable insights into students' cognitive processes, thereby enhancing our understanding of their thoughts on Physics in a given moment. According to Scherr (2008), the realm of Physics education presents a fertile ground for delving deeper into these matters, suggesting that researchers in this field can both gain from and contribute to the ongoing exploration of the significance of gestures in cognition and learning.
Similar to Garcia and Infante (2012), Ramos and Serrano (2013) conducted their research by organizing a workshop (extension course) for undergraduate students. Following activities involving molecular modeling software, the researchers interviewed undergraduate chemistry students. In line with Scherr's (2008) perspectives, the interviews aimed to delve into the students' thought processes while responding to questions, thereby establishing a connection between their gestures and mental imagery during the question-answering process.
This category provides insights into how gestures can offer a window into students' thought processes when they are elucidating specific content or articulating their responses. Analyzing gestures through methods like Think Aloud helps in deciphering the connection between students' gestures and their mental representations.
In their study, Marchena et al. (2019) examined the gesture usage of twenty-one verbally fluent autistic adults and twenty-one typically developing controls during a controlled conversational task. The research focused on observing how these adults utilized gestures in their communication.
Autistic adults exhibited a higher tendency towards unilateral gestures as opposed to bilateral gestures, a motor trait that is specifically linked to the individual gesture associated with autism symptoms. The researchers suggest that co-speech gestures could potentially serve as a bridge connecting the symptoms of impaired non-verbal communication with the recognized variations in motor abilities observed in individuals with autism.
In their research, Özçalışkan, Adamson, Dimitrova, and Baumann (2018) demonstrated that children and parents exhibit similar types of gestures and gesture-speech combinations. Specifically, when studying children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or Down syndrome (DS), they noted distinct differences in gesture production compared to children with typical development (TD). Interestingly, while children displayed variability in the frequency of producing different types of gestures and gesture-speech combinations based on their diagnosis, parents did not exhibit the same variability.
Gestural comprehension, as highlighted by Dimitrova, Özçalışkan, and Adamson (2017) from Sweden, remains a relatively underexplored area, particularly concerning children on the autism spectrum who struggle with gesture production. Building upon McNeill's (2005) prior research, this group of scholars focused on children between the ages of 2 and 4 to investigate the various types of gestures and their interplay with speech. The findings indicate that children exhibit a stronger grasp of deictic and reinforcement gestures in conjunction with speech compared to iconic/conventional gestures and supplementary combinations, a trend that persists across different age groups within the autism spectrum.
The research conducted by Wray et al. (2017) aimed to investigate the use of gestures by children with language disorders as a potential compensatory mechanism for their language difficulties. The findings of the study revealed a close interconnection between gestures and language, indicating that deficits in gestures were often observed in conjunction with challenges in verbal communication.
Glasser et al. (2018) investigated whether children comprehend iconic gestures related to events as early as those related to entities and if their understanding is affected by gesture production patterns in their native language. The study revealed that children's comprehension of event-related gestures is influenced by their native language's gesture production patterns, with a stronger grasp on gestures conforming to specific language patterns compared to those that deviate, particularly concerning the movement aspect of gestures.
In 2019, Huang, Kim, and Christianson of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlighted the utility of gestures in language learning, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that gestures are distinct from other words being learned and that the number of words introduced is limited. Their study demonstrated that introducing new vocabulary in a second language alongside corresponding gestures can enhance students' ability to recall these words. The researchers delved into the theory of double coding, which posits that learners can benefit from the alignment between gestures and new vocabulary, ultimately improving their learning outcomes.
In 2017, researchers Matsumoto and Dobs at the University of Pennsylvania conducted a study exploring the role of gestures in teaching and learning grammar within second language classroom interactions, a theme also investigated by Huang, Kin, and Christianson (2019) in higher education settings. The study involved analyzing the gestures employed by teachers to elucidate temporal concepts in English and those used by students in their responses. Findings revealed a consistent use of abstract and metaphorical gestures by both teachers and students, suggesting their potential significance as valuable tools for instructional purposes and evaluating student comprehension.
In a study conducted at the University of International Studies in Xi'an, China, eighty-nine students participated in research aimed at investigating the impact of tuning gestures on the learning of prosody, a component of traditional grammar focused on speech sound characteristics like accent and intonation. Yuan, González-Fuente, Baills, and Prieto (2019) conducted the study by dividing the students into two groups. The control group received intonation training without tuning gestures, while the experimental group received the same training but with additional tuning gestures representing contours of nuclear intonation. The findings of the study indicate a significant improvement in the experimental group, with individuals possessing stronger musical skills showing better results. Interestingly, those with weaker musical skills benefited even more from observing the tuning gestures.
In their 2017 study, Vogt and Kauschke, hailing from Germany, investigated the impact of iconic gestures on vocabulary acquisition in young children. Their findings suggest that iconic gestures play a crucial role in enhancing word learning efficiency, particularly in children who are in the early stages of language development or facing language difficulties. By facilitating richer cognitive encoding, these gestures offer valuable support in the language acquisition process.
The primary function of gestures is to facilitate communication. However, beyond their role in communication, gestures play a crucial role in cognition and learning, particularly in language comprehension. They go beyond merely enhancing the clarity of a message; they can also aid students in grasping concepts and fostering cognitive development, which is the central focus of this study (Chu & Kita, 2016).
In the classroom, students often communicate non-verbally through their body language. For instance, when a student energetically swings their arm in response to a teacher's question or avoids making eye contact, they are signaling their desire to participate. These subtle gestures, known as non-verbal communication, play a significant role in classroom interactions (Goldin-Meadow, 2017).
Goldin-Meadow (2018) posits that gestures possess the capacity to enhance learning across all children and potentially mitigate disparities in language and mathematics performance. Furthermore, gestures can serve as a valuable instrument for educators to grasp the cognitive processes of students, enabling them to gauge the depth of comprehension achieved through the integration of verbal and nonverbal communication.
The use of gestures in educational settings holds significant potential, as highlighted by Goldin-Meadow (2017) who identifies three primary modes of their application. Firstly, educators can benefit from scrutinizing their own gestures to prevent any inadvertent transmission of misleading information to students. By contemplating how concepts can be visually represented through hand movements, teachers can deliberately incorporate these gestures into their instructional practices.
Encouraging students to gesture while explaining a problem can be beneficial. The gestures they produce often reveal a deeper understanding of the problem's evolution, a comprehension not always apparent in their verbal explanations. These gestures can serve as a diagnostic tool for teachers, providing insights into students' existing knowledge and areas where they are prepared to further their learning.
Encouraging students to gesture about a problem can facilitate the activation of any implicit ideas they may have regarding the issue at hand. This activation, subsequently, can enhance their receptiveness to new instructions (Goldin-Meadow, 2017). Thus, gestures serve not only as a reflection of thinking but also possess the capacity to influence the thinking processes of both listeners and speakers. Gesturing emerges as a valuable tool that can be harnessed by students, teachers, and researchers alike to gain insights into the workings of the mind.
According to Chu and Kita (2016), there is evidence suggesting that co-judgment and co-speech gestures share common properties, indicating a common underlying mechanism. The researchers found that individuals tend to produce more co-production gestures when speech production is challenging compared to when it is easier. Similarly, they observed an increase in judgmental gestures during more difficult quiet problem-solving tasks as opposed to less challenging ones.
Finally, gestures not only serve as reflections of our thoughts but also play a crucial role in shaping and transforming those thoughts. It is widely acknowledged that gestures have the capacity to convey substantial information, leading to the notion that observing and learning from the gestures of others is a plausible concept. However, in order to validate this assumption, it becomes imperative to actively engage in the manipulation of gestures and assess the subsequent effects of such manipulation on the learning process (Goldin-Meadow, 2017).
The evolution of published research on the use of gestures in classrooms demonstrates a clear trend of growth and increasing fascination with this theme over the years. Starting from 2009, there has been a noticeable rise in the number of articles focusing on nonverbal communication in academic journals. These articles cover a range of topics, from practical classroom applications to more theoretical discussions, prompting readers to consider the significance of gestures as a communication channel that is both ancient and contemporary. Research findings suggest that gestures can play a valuable role in teaching a second language, promoting inclusive education, and enhancing the learning experience in challenging subjects such as science and mathematics, where many students struggle.
In the teaching of a second language, gestures play a significant role in how a new word is introduced, how assessments are conducted, and in establishing a stronger connection between gestures and new vocabulary. Within inclusive education, the incorporation of gestures opens up new possibilities for research, potentially serving as a valuable resource to support teachers and students with disabilities or disorders. Furthermore, in the realms of science and mathematics education, gestures are recognized as a valuable tool for elucidating abstract and intricate concepts.
In the context of everyday speech, individuals frequently rely on gestures to articulate their thoughts, elucidate concepts, or elucidate scientific models to educators or peers. These non-verbal cues are crucial for discerning a student's mental representations and can reveal gaps in their verbal explanations. Consequently, our literature review underscores the significance of gestures in the educational realm, highlighting their potential to enhance the teaching-learning dynamic by offering fresh insights and avenues for educational advancement. Additionally, we emphasize the value of incorporating gesture-based resources to enrich students' academic development.
Of particular significance is the notion that gestures can be perceived as an "external device" that assists individuals in reasoning about various topics, including facilitating visuospatial thinking. Gestures serve as a means of conveying ideas between individuals (external function) and are probably also internalized as mental images (internal function), akin to Vygotsky's (1986) depiction of the connection between thought and language. This conclusion, which the authors aim to present in this review, underscores the role of gestures in cognitive processes.
In conclusion, revisiting the primary research question posed in this paper, which investigates the role of gestures (non-verbal communication) in the teaching and learning process, it is evident that gestures play a crucial role in enhancing the educational experience. Their significance cannot be understated, and it is imperative that their analysis be incorporated into teacher training programs. Therefore, it is essential for both the academic realm of Education and the practical realm of education, encompassing formal and informal settings, to acknowledge the importance of non-verbal communication, particularly gestures, which serve to convey specific ideas in the minds of educators and learners. It is crucial that gestures are recognized as being as significant and meaningful as verbal communication, prompting further research to delineate the boundaries and potentials of this vital mode of human interaction.
