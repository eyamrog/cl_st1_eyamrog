Since the onset of the year, global attention has been captivated by developments originating in China, triggered by a local physician's disclosure of a surge in instances of an unusual respiratory ailment attributed to a novel virus, followed by his enforced silence and subsequent demise due to the same respiratory affliction. It is imperative that the narrative of the initial stages of what would eventually burgeon into a pandemic, and was mishandled through negligence, be accurately portrayed. This strain of influenza presented as a distinct variant, swiftly progressing to severe pneumonia and fatalities. Incidences were first documented in Wuhan, located in Hubei province, China towards the conclusion of 2019, rapidly escalating to affect a concerning proportion of the province's populace and subsequently the entire nation. The contagion swiftly transitioned from an outbreak to an epidemic, evident in the escalating tally of reported cases and fatalities across the region.
Since the outbreak of the epidemic in China, numerous countries have activated their public health emergency centers, and Brazil is no exception, despite initial skepticism from administrators and the public. The causative agent of the "new flu" was swiftly identified as SARS-CoV-2, leading to the disease being named Covid-19. Subsequently, Covid-19 rapidly disseminated across all continents, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic in early March.
In Brazil, the Ministry of Health declared a Public Health Emergency of National Importance (or ESPIN) on February 3, 2020, followed by the sanctioning of law No. 13,979 dated 2/6/20202, which outlines measures to address emergencies of national and international significance, specifically in response to Covid-19. Subsequently, in the following month, Brazil announced a state of community transmission nationwide, as per Ordinance No. 454 dated 3/20/20203, leading to the enforcement of stricter quarantine, isolation, and social distancing protocols.
Despite these efforts, the number of COVID-19 cases and fatalities in Brazil has continued to rise. The government has consistently emphasized the importance of staying at home, particularly for the elderly and individuals with underlying health conditions.
Data from the most recent bulletin released by the Ministry of Health on April 4, 2020, indicated a total of 10,278 confirmed cases and 431 fatalities. Alarmingly, over 80% of the reported deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus were among the elderly population, with a significant proportion of individuals having at least one pre-existing risk factor associated with COVID-19, notably heart disease and diabetes. These findings underscore the urgent need for the implementation of more robust and targeted interventions to safeguard this vulnerable demographic.
The document from the ABRASCO Aging Working Group emphasizes serious concerns regarding the multiple vulnerabilities faced by older adults and the numerous deficiencies in the care provided to this demographic. It suggests that without prompt action, there is a risk of an age-related genocide targeting individuals aged 60 years and above.
Efficient advocacy for prevention and protection measures is crucial in mitigating contagion among older adults across diverse settings, including their homes, care environments with family and caregivers, social isolation scenarios, and long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Such advocacy efforts are essential for curbing mortality rates among individuals aged 60 and above.
In response to this concerning scenario, a team of researchers affiliated with the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), focusing on aging and primary health care, has put forth a set of suggestions regarding how Primary Health Care can aid in executing the plan for safeguarding elderly individuals residing in their own residences and in overseeing and supervising Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) for the elderly within the area.
The implementation of effective healthcare initiatives in primary care in Brazil underscores the significance and efficacy of the Brazilian National Health Service (SUS), the Family Health Strategy (ESF), and the National Social Care System (SUAS) from a cohesive and integrated standpoint. These dimensions are crucial in ensuring the protection of older adults across all living environments, including those facing heightened vulnerabilities such as residents in long-term care facilities, individuals within the community, low-income populations, homeless individuals, refugees, and nomads. Additionally, the introduction of emergency public policies is essential in reducing hospitalizations, minimizing the necessity for intensive care interventions, and most importantly, preventing fatalities, a trend observed both globally and within Brazil.
It is imperative that sectoral and intersectoral actions embrace an integrated approach, engaging all pertinent sectors and integrating the scientific principles that support the efforts of healthcare teams nationwide. This approach should extend to local territories, where competencies and skills are honed to incorporate a diverse range of technologies into their practices.
From this standpoint, the group suggests a tool for monitoring crucial home care for the elderly's health, particularly in the context of COVID-19. This tool is intended for use by families, healthcare teams in Primary Health Care (PHC), as well as managers involved in health and intersectoral initiatives.
The tool facilitates the identification of strengths and weaknesses in elderly care management, offering guidance for primary healthcare (PHC) interventions to prevent hospitalizations and fatalities. Given the pressing demand for comprehensive and effective support for this vulnerable demographic, the tool can be integrated into training programs to oversee the safeguarding of older adults. This training can be particularly valuable in areas with limited or absent Family Health Strategy coverage, ensuring that caregivers are equipped to provide essential care and support to the elderly population.
Hence, it is imperative to effectively communicate the group's concerns to all stakeholders involved in discussions concerning the elderly population receiving primary health care, ensuring the provision of adequate care for this demographic amidst the ongoing pandemic induced by the novel coronavirus. This dissemination of information is crucial in fostering a collective effort towards enhancing the care model for the elderly in Brazil, thereby addressing the unique challenges posed by the current health crisis.
