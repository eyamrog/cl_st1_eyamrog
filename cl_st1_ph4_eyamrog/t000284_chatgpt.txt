CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a systematic review of existing evidence to assess the impact of pharmacological treatments such as immunosuppressants, immunobiologics, DMARDs, or targeted synthetic DMARDs on patients with immune-mediated or inflammatory diseases who contract SARS-CoV-2. The objective is to determine whether these patients experience improved or worsened outcomes upon infection. This research serves as a protocol for our rapid living systematic review.
METHODS: The methodology for this rapid living systematic review adheres to the guidelines outlined in the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P). To expedite the review process, we will utilize abbreviated systematic review techniques, such as forgoing independent screening of abstracts and omitting searches of grey literature. Given the dynamic nature of this review, it will be regularly updated to ensure the most current and relevant information is included.
Currently, the world is grappling with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) crisis, officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March (1). Extensive research indicates that individuals with compromised immune systems face a higher susceptibility to viral infections and are at a greater risk of developing severe complications compared to the general population. Patients with rheumatic diseases, for instance, are particularly vulnerable to infections due to the inherent nature of their condition and the immunosuppressive effects of prescribed medications (3). Furthermore, the presence of comorbidities commonly seen in these patients further exacerbates the outcomes of viral infections (2).
Contrary to the aforementioned evidence, certain clinical reports have documented cases of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were undergoing immunosuppressive treatment, yet exhibited only mild symptoms or did not experience severe outcomes (3). These reports have suggested that immunosuppression could potentially shield COVID-19 patients from developing serious clinical complications.
Physicians and researchers draw on insights from other viral infections to propose that antimalarial treatments like chloroquine could potentially impede SARS-CoV-2 infection by targeting endocytosis. Additionally, there is a suggestion that both conventional and biological Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) might regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitigate tissue damage. However, numerous aspects of these therapeutic approaches in the context of COVID-19 remain unresolved and require further investigation.
In order to fill these existing gaps, we aim to conduct a systematic review of the current evidence to address the following research question: "Do individuals with immune-mediated or inflammatory conditions who are undergoing pharmacological treatment with immunosuppressants, immunobiologics, DMARDs, or targeted synthetic DMARDs experience improved or worsened outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2?" This study serves as a protocol for our expedited living systematic review.
This rapid living systematic review protocol will be developed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidance and has been registered in the PROSPERO 'International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews' platform with the registration number CRD42020179863. To conduct the rapid systematic review, abbreviated systematic review methods will be employed, which include not performing independent screens of abstracts and not searching grey literature. Given the nature of this review as a living document, it will be continuously updated to ensure relevance and accuracy.
We will conduct a rapid living systematic review methodology in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (7).
The study will encompass randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, and electronic health records that have assessed the impact of immunomodulatory drugs on patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
We will incorporate studies involving patients who have received a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.
The type of interventions used in this study varied significantly, ranging from cognitive-behavioral therapy to mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques. Each intervention was carefully selected based on its potential effectiveness in addressing the specific needs of the participants. The cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions focused on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns, while the mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques aimed to increase awareness and acceptance of present-moment experiences. Additionally, some participants received pharmacological interventions in the form of antidepressant medications. The diversity of interventions allowed for a comprehensive approach to addressing the mental health concerns of the participants, with each intervention contributing unique benefits to the overall treatment plan.
Immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, and cyclophosphamide are commonly used in the treatment of various autoimmune disorders.
Immunomodulators, such as glucocorticoids and immunoglobulins, are crucial components in the treatment of various immune-related disorders. These agents play a significant role in regulating the immune response, either by suppressing or enhancing it, depending on the specific condition being treated. Glucocorticoids, for instance, are commonly used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system in conditions like asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diseases. On the other hand, immunoglobulins are utilized to boost the immune response in individuals with primary immunodeficiencies or certain infections. Understanding the mechanisms of action and appropriate use of these immunomodulators is essential for optimizing treatment outcomes and minimizing potential side effects.
Immunobiologics, such as tocilizumab, infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, certulizumab, rituximab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab, are integral components in the treatment of various immune-mediated diseases.
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine, are commonly used in the treatment of various autoimmune conditions.
Targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, such as apremilast, tofacitinib, and baricitinib, have emerged as promising treatment options for rheumatic diseases.
The outcome measures used in this study were carefully selected to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. These measures included standardized tests, self-report questionnaires, and observational assessments. The standardized tests were chosen for their reliability and validity in measuring the specific constructs targeted by the intervention. Self-report questionnaires were utilized to gather subjective data from participants regarding their experiences and perceptions. Observational assessments were conducted to provide objective data on participants' behaviors and interactions. By using a combination of these measures, a comprehensive evaluation of the intervention's impact was achieved. The selection of outcome measures was based on established research methodologies and best practices in the field, ensuring the rigor and validity of the study's findings.
The primary outcomes of this study were focused on assessing the impact of the intervention on participants' physical health and well-being. Specifically, we measured changes in participants' body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and overall fitness levels before and after the intervention. Additionally, we examined participants' self-reported quality of life and perceived improvements in their overall health. The data collected from these assessments were analyzed using statistical methods to determine the effectiveness of the intervention in promoting positive health outcomes among the participants. The results of the study indicated significant improvements in all measured outcomes, suggesting that the intervention had a beneficial impact on the physical health and well-being of the participants.
The mortality rate, a crucial indicator in public health research, reflects the number of deaths within a specific population over a defined period. This metric serves as a fundamental measure in assessing the impact of diseases, interventions, or other factors on a population's health outcomes. Understanding mortality rates is essential for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers to make informed decisions and implement effective strategies to improve public health. By analyzing mortality rates, trends, and patterns, stakeholders can identify high-risk populations, evaluate the success of public health interventions, and prioritize resources to address pressing health issues. In conclusion, mortality rates play a vital role in shaping public health policies and initiatives, highlighting the importance of ongoing research and data analysis in this field.

Adverse events, also known as untoward or undesirable occurrences, are events that result in harm to a patient or research participant. These events can range from mild discomfort to severe complications and can be caused by various factors such as medication errors, equipment malfunctions, or underlying health conditions. It is crucial for researchers and healthcare professionals to monitor and report adverse events promptly to ensure patient safety and the integrity of the study. By identifying and addressing these events in a timely manner, appropriate interventions can be implemented to prevent further harm and improve patient outcomes.
The secondary outcomes of the study were also examined to provide a comprehensive understanding of the intervention's impact. These secondary measures included changes in participants' quality of life, mental health status, and overall well-being. Through the analysis of these secondary outcomes, the researchers aimed to gain further insights into the broader implications of the intervention beyond the primary outcomes. The results of the secondary outcomes analysis revealed significant improvements in various aspects of participants' lives, indicating a positive effect of the intervention on multiple dimensions of well-being. This comprehensive evaluation of secondary outcomes further strengthens the study's findings and underscores the significance of the intervention in promoting overall health and well-being among participants.
The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation is a critical factor in the management of patients requiring respiratory support. Prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation are associated with increased risks of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury. Therefore, minimizing the duration of mechanical ventilation is a key goal in the care of critically ill patients. Various strategies have been employed to facilitate early liberation from mechanical ventilation, including daily spontaneous breathing trials, protocolized sedation management, and early mobilization. By optimizing these interventions, healthcare providers can help reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, improve patient outcomes, and ultimately enhance the overall quality of care provided in the intensive care setting.

The time required for clinical improvement;
The duration of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a crucial factor to consider in medical settings.
We will incorporate studies conducted since November 2019, without imposing any language restrictions on the selection process.
We will conduct searches on Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane Library - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Portal Regional BVS - LILACS, Scopus, and WebOfScience using relevant descriptors and synonyms, tailoring the search strategy to the requirements of each database to identify published, ongoing, and unpublished studies. Additionally, we will explore COVID-19 specific databases such as Epistemonikos COVID-19 L·OVE platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). Furthermore, we will review the reference lists of the included studies. Language restrictions will not be applied during the selection process.
We will employ terminology pertinent to the issue at hand, the intervention, and the publication date filter. The search methodology conducted on Medline through Pubmed is detailed in Table 1.
Two authors, ACPNP and FSAR, will be responsible for selecting studies for inclusion in the review. In cases where duplicated studies are identified, only one will be considered for inclusion. If reports involve the same participants but different follow-up or outcome measurements, both reports will be incorporated as components of a single study. Following the removal of duplicates, the authors will screen study titles and abstracts, excluding those that clearly do not meet eligibility criteria. The remaining studies will undergo full assessment for potential inclusion. Any disagreements between authors regarding study inclusion will be resolved by the third author, VFMT. Excluded studies will be documented in a flowchart to provide transparency. To streamline the screening and selection process, the Rayyan application (8) will be utilized.
Two authors (APR and FSAR) will independently extract data, with discrepancies or disagreements resolved by a third author (VFMT). Data extraction will be conducted using a predefined form that includes information on the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, time points for assessments, details of pharmacological treatment (including drug name, duration, and dose), number of patients lost to follow-up in each group, reasons for loss to follow-up, approach for handling missing data (including data imputation methods and use of intention-to-treat approach), sources of funding, potential conflicts of interest, adverse events, outcome measures, and protocol deviations.
The Risk of Bias tool (7), as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration, will be utilized for the critical appraisal of the included studies. In the case of observational studies, the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (9) will be employed. The quality of evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) (10). Two authors will conduct the assessment of risk of bias (VTC and APR) and the assessment of the quality of evidence (VTC and NCJ), with any discrepancies being resolved through discussion or, if necessary, by seeking input from a third author (ANA).
The analyses will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines provided by Cochrane and the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group. For the meta-analysis, we will utilize R software, specifically for calculating mean difference (MD) or Hedge’s/Cohen’s (SMD) when applicable. The software package "meta" (version 4.11-0) will be employed for these analyses.
Mean and standard deviation (or equivalent) data for hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and/or respiratory support among adult inpatients with COVID-19, along with mortality rates, will be pooled using the inverse of variance method with a random-effects model (specifically, the DerSimonian-Laird estimator for τ2). This approach ensures that only similar or equivalent results from each primary outcome in the studies are utilized. It is imperative to adhere to the main assumptions to ensure accurate data collection and interpretation. Statistical standardization will be conducted when feasible based on the information provided in the study results. Subsequently, only robust and reliable data pertaining to equivalent primary outcomes will be utilized to fulfill the objective of this meta-analysis. The data extraction process outlined in the Data Extraction section will categorize each measure according to the relevant response categories. Additionally, data on adverse events and clinical examinations will be extracted comprehensively, ensuring completeness and classification by response category.
In instances where studies do not furnish a mean and its corresponding standard deviation (SD), we will rely on the information and outcomes disclosed in the text or tables, employing appropriate inferential techniques. In cases where the predetermined parameters are absent, we will derive estimates based on alternative parameters, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the information presented.
We will reach out to the principal investigators of the studies included in our research to request additional data or seek clarification on any issues pertaining to the studies. Should we not receive a response from the authors, we will present the data in a descriptive manner, refraining from making any assumptions or imputations.
We will utilize the Cochran’s Q test to evaluate the presence of heterogeneity, with a threshold set at a P value of less than 0.1 to indicate the presence of heterogeneity.
Furthermore, statistical heterogeneity will be evaluated by analyzing the Higgins I2 statistic, adhering to established thresholds:
With less than 25% heterogeneity observed, the study findings indicate a lack of diversity within the sample population. This suggests a high level of consistency among the participants in terms of the variables being studied. The absence of heterogeneity can have implications for the generalizability of the results, as a more homogeneous sample may limit the external validity of the findings. Researchers should consider the potential impact of this lack of diversity on the overall interpretation and application of the study results. Further exploration into the reasons behind the homogeneity observed in the sample could provide valuable insights for future research in this area.
In the range of 25% to 49%, there is observed to be low heterogeneity within the data.
In the range of 50% to 74%, there exists a moderate level of heterogeneity within the data.
In studies where the percentage of heterogeneity exceeds 75%, there is considered to be a high level of variability among the data.
In conducting heterogeneity analysis, we will examine the following information:
Subgroup analysis is a crucial component of research studies, allowing for a more detailed examination of specific subsets within a larger study population. By dividing the participants into subgroups based on certain characteristics or variables, researchers can identify potential differences in outcomes or treatment effects that may not be apparent when analyzing the entire study population as a whole. This method can help researchers better understand the underlying mechanisms of a treatment or intervention, as well as identify which subgroups may benefit most from a particular intervention. However, it is important to conduct subgroup analyses with caution, as multiple comparisons and small sample sizes within subgroups can increase the risk of false positive results. Properly planned and executed subgroup analyses can provide valuable insights and contribute to the overall validity and generalizability of research findings.
Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, spondyloarthritis, and Sjögren's syndrome, are characterized by dysregulated immune responses leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. These conditions involve complex interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and immune dysregulation, resulting in a wide range of clinical manifestations. The pathogenesis of IMIDs involves aberrant activation of immune cells, production of autoantibodies, and dysregulation of cytokine signaling pathways. Management of IMIDs typically involves a combination of immunosuppressive medications, anti-inflammatory agents, and targeted biologic therapies to control disease activity and prevent long-term complications. Despite advancements in treatment strategies, IMIDs remain a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems due to their chronic nature and potential for systemic complications. Further research into the underlying mechanisms of these diseases is crucial for developing more effective and personalized therapeutic approaches.
The drug treatment regimen, encompassing factors such as the quantity of drugs administered, the duration of drug therapy, the dosage levels prescribed, and the specific type of drug treatment utilized, plays a pivotal role in determining the efficacy and outcomes of therapeutic interventions. These parameters collectively influence the pharmacological response within the patient's system, impacting the treatment's overall success in addressing the targeted health condition. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding and meticulous consideration of these drug treatment variables are essential for healthcare providers to optimize patient care and achieve desired clinical outcomes.
Comorbidities, which refer to the presence of two or more chronic conditions in an individual, are increasingly recognized as significant factors in healthcare management. The coexistence of multiple conditions can complicate treatment plans, increase healthcare costs, and worsen patient outcomes. Understanding and addressing comorbidities is crucial for providing effective and holistic care to patients. Researchers and healthcare professionals are continuously exploring strategies to better manage comorbidities, improve patient outcomes, and enhance the overall quality of care. By identifying and addressing comorbidities early on, healthcare providers can tailor treatment plans to meet the complex needs of patients with multiple chronic conditions, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and improved quality of life.
The impact of age on cognitive development has been a subject of extensive research in the field of psychology. Various studies have shown that as individuals age, there are changes in cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. Older adults tend to experience declines in certain cognitive functions, particularly processing speed and working memory, while other abilities, such as crystallized intelligence, may remain stable or even improve with age. It is important to consider the role of age when studying cognitive development, as it can influence the way individuals learn, process information, and make decisions. Understanding the effects of age on cognition is crucial for developing interventions and strategies to support cognitive health in aging populations.
The route of administration refers to the method by which a drug or substance is introduced into the body. It plays a crucial role in determining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the compound, influencing its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. The choice of route can significantly impact the onset of action, bioavailability, and overall efficacy of the drug. Common routes of administration include oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transdermal, and inhalation. Each route has its advantages and limitations, with factors such as patient compliance, drug stability, and desired therapeutic effect guiding the selection of the most appropriate route. Understanding the implications of different administration routes is essential for optimizing drug delivery and ensuring the desired clinical outcomes.
Sensitivity analysis is a crucial component of research studies, allowing researchers to assess the robustness of their findings by testing the impact of varying assumptions or parameters on the results. It helps in identifying the key drivers of the outcomes and understanding the degree to which changes in these factors affect the overall conclusions. By systematically varying the inputs and observing the corresponding changes in the outputs, researchers can gain insights into the stability and reliability of their models. Sensitivity analysis is particularly important in complex models where uncertainties and assumptions play a significant role in shaping the results. It enables researchers to evaluate the sensitivity of their conclusions to different scenarios and assumptions, thereby enhancing the credibility and validity of their findings. Overall, sensitivity analysis serves as a valuable tool for researchers to enhance the robustness and reliability of their research outcomes.
Studies with a high risk of bias can significantly impact the validity and reliability of research findings. When the design, conduct, or reporting of a study is compromised by bias, the results may not accurately reflect the true relationship between variables being studied. This can lead to erroneous conclusions and potentially misguide future research or clinical practice. Therefore, it is crucial for researchers to carefully assess and minimize bias in their studies through rigorous methodological approaches, transparent reporting, and adherence to best practices in research design. By addressing bias effectively, researchers can enhance the credibility and impact of their findings, ultimately contributing to the advancement of knowledge in their respective fields.
When conducting a meta-analysis with a minimum of 10 studies, we will assess the presence of reporting biases by visually examining funnel plots. In the case of continuous outcomes, we will employ Egger’s test to identify potential small study bias, following the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
When initial reports on the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 emerged, there was apprehension regarding patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Nevertheless, unlike typical viral pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to induce a more severe illness in individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory conditions. The extent of the potential protective effects of these medications has not been thoroughly assessed and remains ambiguous in current literature.
This rapid review aims to systematically assess the most reliable evidence regarding the potential protective impact of medications administered to individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory conditions against COVID-19. Given the absence of a definitive treatment for COVID-19 thus far, this review is anticipated to offer valuable insights to healthcare practitioners in their decision-making processes. Adhering to the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews (7) and conducting thorough searches across major health databases, we aim to consolidate the existing evidence and elucidate the efficacy of these medications in averting a severe progression of COVID-19.
