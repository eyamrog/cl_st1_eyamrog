Objective: This study aims to evaluate the influence and relationship between socioeconomic vulnerability and COVID-19 outcomes as well as adherence to social distancing measures in Brazil.
Methods: The Gini Coefficient (GC), the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), epidemiological data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil, and the Social Distancing Index (SDI) were obtained from online databases and evaluated for each Brazilian state. The data underwent statistical analysis using non-parametric tests and multiple linear regressions.
Results: The mean values for the GC and SVI were 0.495 and 0.261, respectively. A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between the socioeconomic indicators and the three variables associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. States characterized by very low social vulnerability exhibited lower death rates per 100 thousand inhabitants attributed to COVID-19 compared to states with moderate social vulnerability. The SVI emerged as a predictive factor for the accumulation of cases, confirmed deaths, and adherence to social distancing measures in Brazilian states amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions: The outcomes of COVID-19 in Brazilian states exhibit a correlation with the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), indicating a relationship with socioeconomic conditions. The severity of the pandemic's impacts is notably heightened in less privileged communities within the country.
In less than four months following the initial confirmed case of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Brazil, the nation has surpassed the milestone of over one million accumulated cases and more than 50,000 confirmed deaths. These figures are believed to be significantly higher due to the probable underreporting resulting from the country's focus on testing only severe cases. Amidst the pandemic, Brazil has been grappling with a political crisis that has hindered the effectiveness of measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 and addressing its socioeconomic repercussions.
Brazil, as the largest and most populous Latin-American country, benefits from its continental dimensions, which contribute to a diverse range of socioeconomic and geographical aspects. Each region in Brazil exhibits distinct characteristics in terms of social behavior, genetics, and economic backgrounds, highlighting the necessity for tailored measures and health policies to allocate medical resources effectively and address social issues while acknowledging and respecting the unique features of each area.
All regions in Brazil have reported cases of COVID-19. A notable socioeconomic disparity exists among these regions, which contributes to various challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges include disparities in access to and comprehension of information about the disease, availability of diagnostic tests, healthcare personnel, and intensive care units. Additionally, political decisions aimed at controlling the spread of the virus are influenced by these regional disparities.
Despite assertions like "COVID-19 virus does not discriminate" propagated by certain politicians and media outlets, it is evident that COVID-19 is not a socially impartial affliction. It is crucial to direct particular attention towards vulnerable populations, as recent data highlights a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities in terms of incidence and mortality rates. Urgent measures are required, including enhanced scientific research and comprehensive surveillance, to enhance response strategies and resource allocation in addressing health disparities amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the influence and interrelation of socioeconomic vulnerability on COVID-19 outcomes and adherence to social distancing measures in the context of Brazil.
The Gini Coefficient (GC) and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI were utilized as socioeconomic indicators in this study. The values attributed to these indicators for each Brazilian state were obtained from the online databases of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and the Institute of Applied Economic Research. Alongside these socioeconomic indicators, epidemiological data pertaining to the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and the Social Distancing Index (SDI) were also evaluated for each Brazilian state.
The Gini coefficient (GC) serves as a statistical measure of dispersion commonly employed in economics to depict the distribution of income or wealth within a specific geographical region, standing as the predominant metric for assessing inequality. This metric has found application in the realm of healthcare to gauge disparities. The GC value spans from 0, indicating absolute equality with all households earning identical incomes, to 1.0, signifying complete inequality with households earning a wide spectrum of incomes.
The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a metric designed to illuminate various indicators of exclusion and social vulnerability beyond the narrow understanding of poverty solely in terms of inadequate financial resources. The SVI aims to identify the presence, absence, or inadequacy of certain "assets" within different regions of Brazil, assets that should be universally accessible to all citizens through governmental intervention. Comprised of three sub-indices—urban infrastructure, human capital, and income and labor—the SVI represents significant categories of assets, the possession or lack of which significantly impacts the well-being of populations in modern societies. Ranging from 0 to 1, a higher value indicates greater social vulnerability within a region. Values between 0 and 0.200 signify very low social vulnerability, while those between 0.201 and 0.300 indicate low vulnerability, 0.301 to 0.400 suggest moderate vulnerability, 0.401 to 0.500 imply high vulnerability, and 0.501 to 1 indicate very high social vulnerability.
Epidemiological data on the cumulative cases and confirmed deaths per 100,000 inhabitants attributed to COVID-19 in each state were gathered from the online database of the Brazilian Health Ministry. The dataset utilized in this study encompasses information spanning from February 25, 2020 (marking the initial recorded case in Brazil) to June 20, 2020.
The Social Distancing Index (SDI) was developed to combat the transmission of COVID-19, and since its inception, it has undergone continuous enhancements aimed at furnishing increasingly precise information for governmental bodies and research establishments. The index was formulated by applying a sophisticated distance algorithm to highly precise geolocation data. To ensure a more precise classification and dependable data, polygons from all regions of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) were utilized. The data is accessible on the Inloco website (https://mapabrasileirodacovid.inloco.com.br/pt/), where it is presented in the form of a map and chart. SDI values are depicted as a percentage of social distancing, ranging from 0 to 100%.
The data underwent statistical analysis with all tests applied at a significance level of 5% and a confidence interval of 95%. The analyses were conducted using SPSS software version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Due to the hypothesis of normal distribution not being confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, nonparametric tests were employed for statistical analysis. The strength of the association between different measures was assessed using Spearman rank correlation. Group comparisons based on SVI categorization were conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post-hoc Dunn test. Multiple linear regressions were carried out to determine whether GC or SVI could predict accumulated cases, confirmed deaths, and social distancing index in Brazilian states during the COVID-19 outbreak.
During the period under examination, the average number of accumulated cases and confirmed deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in the Brazilian states stood at around 697 and 24, respectively. The mean Social Development Index (SDI) score for the states was calculated at 38.77%. In terms of socioeconomic indicators, the mean values for the Gini Coefficient (GC) and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) were recorded at 0.495 and 0.261, respectively, as detailed in table 1. The SVI values exhibited a range from 0.134 to 0.374, indicating that none of the states demonstrated high or very high levels of social vulnerability.
The analysis of states with varying social vulnerability indices revealed notable disparities in the death toll. States characterized by very low social vulnerability exhibited a lower number of COVID-19 related deaths per 100,000 residents compared to states with moderate social vulnerability, as illustrated in Table 2.
The Spearman correlation test revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between the socioeconomic indicators and the three variables associated with the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil, with the exception of the correlation between the GC and confirmed deaths (Table 3).
The analysis of multiple linear regressions revealed statistically significant models indicating that the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) served as a predictor of accumulated cases, confirmed deaths, and the social distancing index in Brazil during the COVID-19 epidemic. A higher SVI, reflecting increased social vulnerability, was found to be associated with higher accumulated cases (β = 0.409; t=2.243; p=0.034), confirmed deaths (β = 0.498; t=2.874; p=0.008), and the social distancing index (β = 0.544; t=3.242; p=0.003). Detailed values illustrating these relationships can be found in Table 4.
Health inequities represent a global challenge. While the COVID-19 pandemic impacts all segments of society, its consequences vary depending on the level of equity within each social context. The results of this study corroborate this assertion by demonstrating that regions with distinct socioeconomic circumstances in Brazil are not experiencing the pandemic's effects in a proportional manner.
The study revealed a positive correlation between the number of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 and the variables GC and SVI, as shown in Table 3. States with moderate social vulnerability exhibited an average of 30 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants more than states with very low social vulnerability, as indicated in Table 2. Moreover, higher social vulnerability emerged as a predictor of increased deaths, as highlighted in Table 4. These results underscore the significant impact of socioeconomic vulnerability on COVID-19 mortality rates. Vulnerable communities are disproportionately affected by preexisting chronic conditions. Research conducted in Brazilian populations indicated that areas with higher poverty or inequality levels showed a higher prevalence of conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cancer, asthma, and multiple comorbidities, all of which pose an increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, the distribution of essential resources like diagnostic tests, intensive care units, and healthcare personnel is uneven across the Brazilian territory.
Risk communication plays a crucial role in any public health emergency response; however, vulnerable populations often lack the necessary language and literacy skills to comprehend and appropriately respond to pandemic messaging, as low health literacy is more prevalent among these groups. This can contribute to the challenges in controlling the spread of COVID-19, especially in regions with higher levels of social vulnerability. Factors such as lower sanitary standards and the inability to maintain social distancing due to the necessity of seeking work and income outside the home further increase the exposure risk for individuals in socially vulnerable situations. The current study revealed a positive correlation between income inequality, social vulnerability, and the cumulative cases of COVID-19, as demonstrated in Table 3. Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) emerged as a predictor of increased cases per 100 thousand inhabitants in Brazilian states, as indicated in Table 4. These findings align with existing research highlighting the importance of addressing health inequalities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Social distancing measures implemented globally to combat the spread of COVID-19 are anticipated to have significant impacts on public health and health disparities. These measures, aimed at reducing close contact to curb transmission, have far-reaching socioeconomic and health implications. The current study conducted in Brazil reveals a correlation between Social Distancing Index (SDI) and socioeconomic status, as evidenced in Table 3. Moreover, the research indicates that higher levels of social vulnerability predict increased SDI in Brazilian states. Given that socioeconomic disparities exacerbate health crises, it is likely that regions with higher rates of cases and fatalities, as highlighted in this study, will face more stringent social distancing protocols in the future.
Social distancing measures have significantly reduced the workforce across various economic sectors, leading to widespread job losses and subsequent income reductions for workers unable to work. This situation has also contributed to a rise in long-term unemployment, particularly if companies are unable to sustain operations. It is imperative that isolation measures are carefully planned and implemented, with policymakers taking into account the broader implications on health and health equity. Failure to do so may result in a further widening of pre-existing socioeconomic disparities, ultimately deepening issues of local health inequity in areas affected by epidemics.
The pandemic is expected to have enduring socioeconomic repercussions on disadvantaged communities, in addition to its immediate health implications for vulnerable populations. It is imperative that public health policy responses prioritize health equity and social justice principles to prevent the exacerbation of health disparities for future generations amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
The correlation between COVID-19 outcomes and Social Development Index (SDI) in Brazilian states highlights the impact of socioeconomic conditions. States characterized by moderate social vulnerability exhibited a higher number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants compared to those with very low social vulnerability. The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) emerged as a significant predictor of accumulated cases, confirmed deaths, and social distancing indices across Brazilian states during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that health authorities could leverage this data to enhance disease control efforts, directing interventions and allocating resources more effectively to improve outcomes within vulnerable communities.
