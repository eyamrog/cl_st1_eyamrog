Lianas, as woody climbers, face various environmental pressures, including mechanical damage and dehydration, impacting the stiffness, bending, and toughness of their stems and leaves. While the relationship between physical resistance and moisture in plant organs is well-established in woody plants, it remains uncertain and unexplored in lianas. This study aimed to experimentally assess the impact of dehydration on the structural Young’s modulus in stems and fracture toughness in leaves of Amphilophium crucigerum (Bignoniaceae) over time. Ten samples of stems and leaves were collected and subjected to two conditions: one group kept moist, and the other gradually dehydrated through air exposure. Measurements of Young’s modulus and toughness were taken every 4 hours over 48 hours. Dehydrated samples exhibited increased bending stiffness and fracture toughness, while moist samples showed no significant changes in biomechanical properties. These findings highlight the critical role of moisture in determining the biomechanical characteristics of lianas' stems and leaves.
Plants face various environmental challenges throughout their lifecycle, including damage resistance, stress resilience, and the maintenance of structural integrity. The stiffness, bending capacity, and toughness of stems and leaves in woody plants serve as key biomechanical indicators for evaluating their ability to withstand these pressures (Niklas 1992, Speck 1994, Rowe & Speck 1996, Speck & Rowe 1999, Niklas et al. 2006, Rowe et al. 2005). Intriguingly, research has delved into the biomechanical properties of plant structures in relation to animal feeding behaviors, exploring potential correlations between the physical characteristics of plant parts consumed by animals and the animals' masticatory structures (Strait 1997). This line of inquiry has suggested a coevolutionary relationship between animals and plants (Thiery et al. 2017). Biomechanical assessments of plant structures typically involve mechanical testing methods. For instance, the structural Young’s modulus quantifies bending stiffness relative to the geometric properties of the sample (Niklas 1992). Conversely, toughness represents a material's or plant tissue's resistance to fracture, reflecting the energy needed to break an object. The area under a stress-strain curve offers a measure of toughness in terms of work done per unit volume (Vincent 1992, Niklas 1992). These properties are influenced by the composition, shape, and hydration status of the material (Niklas 1992, Vincent 1990a). While the mechanical properties of homogeneous materials like plastic or iron are well understood, the same cannot be said for the heterogeneous nature of biological materials like plant structures.
In plants, stems and leaves consist of intricate tissues with diverse functions (Niklas et al., 2006; Vincent, 1992; Wegst & Ashby, 2004). Fibers and sclerenchyma in various tissues provide mechanical support, while parenchyma primarily serves for storage and influences the flexibility of woody stems (Niklas, 1992; Speck & Rowe, 1999; Ménard et al., 2009; Gerolamo et al., 2020). The combinations and arrangements of different tissue and cell types in stems, roots, and leaves result in a range of mechanical properties tailored to the stresses experienced by each plant organ (Niklas, 1992). The water content within complex tissues plays a crucial role in determining their mechanical characteristics (Niklas, 1992; Vincent, 1990a). Dehydration of biological materials induces structural alterations in tissues and organs, thereby affecting their mechanical attributes (Caliaro et al., 2013; Niklas, 1992; Niklas et al., 2006; Vincent, 1990b). For instance, grass leaves exhibit increased stiffness and toughness as water content diminishes (Vincent, 1983). Similarly, in self-supporting species, the bending stiffness of stems rises with decreasing wood tissue moisture, leading to increased brittleness and easier fracturing in dry branches compared to moistened ones (Niklas, 1992). Recent experiments have demonstrated that petioles of Caladium bicolor lose bending stiffness under water deficit, resulting in wilting (Caliaro et al., 2013).
It is widely recognized that dehydration of stems and leaves enhances the stiffness and toughness of these structures in self-supporting species (Boldrin et al., 2018; Caliaro et al., 2013; Niklas, 1992). To prevent dehydration in plant structures of freshly collected samples, such as stems, roots, and leaves, they are typically transported to the laboratory promptly for biomechanical testing (Gallenmüller et al., 2004). However, there is a scarcity of experimental data demonstrating the extent of the impact of dehydration on biomechanical properties, particularly in lianas. Lianas, or woody climbers, are significant components of tropical forests globally, representing approximately 25% of woody stem species diversity (Gentry, 1991; Schnitzer & Bongers, 2011). They play crucial roles in forest dynamics and serve as food sources and canopy pathways for various animals (Putz & Mooney, 1991). In disturbed areas and forest edges, liana stems are abundant, characterized by their thin and flexible nature, forming dense tangles (Schnitzer & Bongers, 2011). Lianas possess unique stem anatomies that contribute to their flexibility and ability to resist damage, often featuring abundant parenchymatous tissue aiding in torsion (Rowe et al., 2004; Read & Stokes, 2006; Rocha et al., 2020). Our hypothesis posits that maintaining fresh liana stem and leaf samples in a moist state will preserve their original bending stiffness and fracture toughness, while gradual dehydration of samples exposed to air will lead to increased stiffness and toughness over time. To address this research gap, we selected a specific liana species as a model to investigate whether the structural Young's modulus of stems and fracture toughness of leaves increase with gradual dehydration, and to determine the duration for which biomechanical properties remain stable post-field sampling.
The plant species and study site for this research involved the collection of stems and leaves samples from the neotropical widespread liana species Amphilophium curcigerum (L.) L.G.Lohmann (Bignoniaceae; commonly known as Monkey’s comb) within the Forest Reserve of the Institute of Biosciences at the University of São Paulo (23° 33’S, 46° 43’W), located in São Paulo, Brazil. Subsequently, these samples were promptly transported to the Plant Anatomy Laboratory at the Institute of Biosciences, where controlled environmental conditions were maintained (average temperature: 25.35 ±SD 0.03 °C; relative humidity: 55.23 ± 0.53%).
Ten straight stem segments, approximately 20 cm long and 5-10 mm in diameter, were carefully chosen for biomechanical testing, excluding those with a tapering percentage exceeding 10% as per Rowe et al. (2005. Additionally, ten mature sun leaves devoid of herbivory marks or damage were collected from the same plant. Both stem and leaf samples were initially weighed using a precision balance and subsequently subjected to tests to determine the structural Young’s modulus and fracture toughness at time 0 (under natural conditions). To explore the impact of dehydration on the biomechanical characteristics of stems and leaves, a 48-hour experiment was conducted, manipulating the hydric status of the samples. The stem and leaf samples were randomly allocated to two distinct hydric conditions: (i) samples maintained moist in a tray covered with damp tissue paper, and (ii) samples gradually dehydrated through natural moisture loss to the air. Throughout the experiment, the samples were weighed every four hours and underwent biomechanical testing to assess any changes.
Biomechanical parameters were assessed by determining the stem bending stiffness using a universal testing machine (MBioI, Biopdi, São Paulo, Brazil) equipped with a 5 N force transducer and operated at a constant speed of 1 mm min-1. A three-point bending test was conducted on each stem segment following the established protocols by Vincent (1990b) and Rowe & Speck (1996). To minimize the shear effect during testing, a span-to-depth ratio greater than 20 was deemed necessary for this wood species, as indicated in previous analyses (Supplementary material Figure S1). Therefore, we standardized the span-to-depth ratio to 30 to ensure accurate bending measurements, in line with Vincent (1990b) and Gerolamo et al. (2020). The displacement-force curve for each measurement interval per sample was analyzed using the MBioI software connected to the universal testing machine. Stem samples were positioned on two vertical supports with minimal displacement (2 mm) to ensure measurements were within the elastic range of the stem and to reduce potential shear influence. The average duration for bending tests was approximately five minutes. The flexural stiffness (EI; in N mm²) of each segment was calculated using the formula [EI = l3ß / 48], where l (mm) represents the distance between the two vertical supports and ß is the slope (N mm-1) of the best-fitting regression of the displacement-force curve (R2 > 0.98). The axial second moment of area (I; in mm4) was determined by measuring the diameter of each segment at three positions - the middle and approximately 15 mm from both ends. The cross-section shape of each segment was approximated as an ellipse using the formula [I = πa3b / 4], where a (mm) denotes the vertical radial diameter and b (mm) the diameter perpendicular to the direction of the applied force. Finally, the structural Young’s modulus (E; in M Nm-2) was calculated as [EI / I] for each sample at each sampling time (every 4 hours), resulting in a total of 13 measurements for each stem sample.
The fracture toughness of leaf lamina was determined by utilizing the Lucas Scientific FLS-1 portable mechanical tester (FLS-1, São Paulo, Brazil) through a standard scissors test method as described by Lucas and Pereira (1990) and Lucas et al. (2001). At intervals of 4 hours, a fresh flat portion from the center of the leaf lamina, situated parallel and between secondary veins, was excised using a razor blade. Strips of leaf lamina measuring 2.5 mm in length and 1.5 mm in width were then perpendicularly mounted between the blades of a pair of scissors connected to the testing equipment. The crosshead of the tester lowered the blade handle with the load monitored at the cutting point, resulting in a specific displacement (work done - Wc) within the leaf section. Subsequently, the scissors were reset to their original position, and the leaf sample was removed. The scissors were then lowered again over the same displacement, recording the work done against friction between the blades (frictional work - Wf), referred to as an "empty pass." The frictional work in the empty pass was derived from the work done with the leaf sample, providing the fracture work. Prior to each test, the scissor blades were meticulously cleaned to eliminate any remnants from previous tests. The length (L; mm) and thickness (t; mm) of the leaf lamina sample were measured using a precise dial caliper, and the cleaved area was determined by multiplying the leaf thickness by the length of the slit. The fracture toughness (R; J m-2) of each leaf lamina sample was then calculated by dividing the work of fracture by the cleaved area, following the formula [R = (Wc - Wf) / Lt].
To determine the relative water content (RWC; %), five samples of stems and leaves matching the dimensions used in biomechanical tests were utilized. The RWC (%) at each dehydration level i was computed as: [(wi - wd) / (wt - wd)] x100, where wi represents the mass (in g) of the stem or leaf sample at dehydration level i, wt is the mass of the sample at full hydration, and wd is the mass of the dry stem or leaf (Scoffoni et al., 2014). Full hydration and dry mass of the stems and leaves were obtained by immersing samples in distilled water in a tray with damp papers for 24 hours and weighing them at least thrice until mass stabilization. Following the imbibition period, samples were subjected to oven-drying at 60 ˚C for 24 hours and weighed repeatedly until mass stabilization to determine the dry mass (Turner, 1981). For anatomical procedures and analyses, stem and leaf samples were sectioned transversely using a sliding microtome. Prior to sectioning, samples were gradually embedded in polyethylene glycol- PEG 1500 (Rupp, 1964). To prevent damage to phloem and xylem during sectioning, expanded polystyrene dissolved in butyl acetate was applied to the stem samples, and an adhesive tape was affixed before cutting a section (Barbosa et al., 2010). The stem and leaf sections were double stained with 1% w/v Astra blue and 1% w/v safranin to differentiate cells with cellulose from those with cellulose and lignin (Bukatsch, 1972; Kraus & Arduin, 1997), and permanent slides were prepared using Canada balsam.
Statistical analysis was conducted to assess the impact of gradual dehydration over time on structural Young’s modulus, fracture toughness, and relative water content in stems and leaves. Linear and nonlinear mixed models were constructed, with parameters estimated using restricted maximum likelihoods (REML). Time was utilized as an independent variable in these models, with samples included as a random term to account for the repeated measurements of each sample over time. Nonlinear mixed models were also developed to examine the direct influence of relative water content on the structural Young’s modulus of stems and fracture toughness of leaves during gradual dehydration. Exponential nonlinear models were employed to depict the best-fitted curves, following the approach of Boldrin et al. (2018) and Scoffoni et al. (2014). Residual analysis was performed to assess model assumptions graphically, as outlined by Crawley (2007). Subsequently, the models underwent analyses of variance (ANOVA), with a significance threshold set at P-value ≤ 0.05, in line with Zar (1996). All statistical analyses were carried out using R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team 2019) and the R packages lme4 (Bates 2010).
Anatomical structure - In Amphilophium curcigerum (L.) L.G.Lohmann (Bignoniaceae), the stems exhibit slender dimensions (average = 8.4 mm ±SD1.35) and a cylindrical form (Figure 1a). These stems possess a unique cambial variant characterized by xylem interrupted by phloem wedges (Figure 1b). The secondary xylem showcases wide vessels and broad rays, distinctly visible in macroscopic transverse sections (Figure 1b). The leaves of this species are slightly asymmetrical, featuring a cordiform shape, pinnate venation, and a dorsiventral leaf mesophyll comprising two layers of palisade parenchyma and approximately three layers of lacunose parenchyma (Figures 1c-d).
Biomechanical structure - The structural Young’s modulus in stems kept moist remains relatively stable over time, with an average value of approximately 4360 ± SD 316 MNm−2 and a median close to 4331 MNm−2 (Fdf(59) = 0.001; P = 0.96; figure 2 a). In contrast, stems undergoing gradual dehydration exhibit an increase in structural Young’s modulus as time progresses (Fdf(59) = 21.54; P < 0.001; figure 2 b; Supplementary material table S1). The relative water content in dehydrating stems decreases exponentially with time (Fdf(59) = 215.3; P < 0.001; figure 2 c; Supplementary material table S2), and there is a negative exponential relationship between structural Young’s modulus and stem relative water content (Fdf(59) = 11.46; P = 0.001; figure 3; Supplementary material table S3). For instance, at 12% moisture content, the average structural Young’s modulus of A. crucigerum stems is 4500 MNm-2, which decreases to 4400 MNm-2 (a 4% reduction in bending stiffness) at 24% moisture content. Initially, the structural Young’s modulus of stems under gradual dehydration conditions is around 4034 MNm-2, maintaining this value for the first 12 hours (figure 2 b) and up to 80% moisture content (figure 3 a).
The fracture toughness of leaf lamina kept moist remains relatively stable over time, with an average value of approximately 206 ± 53 Jm−2 and a median close to 197 Jm−2 (Fdf(59) = 1.71; P = 0.19; Figure 2d). Conversely, leaves undergoing gradual dehydration exhibit an increase in fracture toughness over time (Fdf(59) = 12.57; P < 0.001; Figure 2e; Supplementary Material Table S4). Furthermore, leaf relative water content demonstrates an exponential decrease with time in samples undergoing gradual dehydration (Fdf(59) = 208; P < 0.001; Figure 2f; Supplementary Material Table S5), while leaf fracture toughness exhibits a negative exponential correlation with stem relative water content (Fdf(59) = 9.35; P = 0.003; Figure 3b; Supplementary Material Table S6). For instance, at 12% moisture content, the average fracture toughness of leaf lamina in A. crucigerum is 270 Jm-2, whereas at 24% moisture content, the average fracture toughness decreases to 230 Jm-2, representing a 15% reduction in leaf fracture toughness.
Our study reveals that dehydration has a significant impact on the biomechanical properties of both stems and leaves in the commonly found liana species, Amphilophium curcigerum (L.) L.G.Lohmann (Bignoniaceae), despite not being previously documented for lianas. Specifically, dehydration leads to an increase in bending stiffness and fracture toughness in the plant. This heightened bending stiffness renders liana stems more susceptible to rupture, thereby restricting their ability to flex and twist. It is worth noting that maintaining samples in a moist state post-fieldwork is crucial for accurately estimating the biomechanical properties, a point that will be further elaborated on in the subsequent discussion.
It is widely acknowledged that the temperature and humidity levels in the environment have a direct impact on the hydric conditions of plant structures, with both anatomical composition and hydric condition influencing the biomechanical properties of each plant structure (Niklas 1992, Vincent 1992, Rowe et al. 2005). Consequently, most studies in plant biomechanics maintain samples in a moist state immediately after collection to ensure results closely resemble those of living plants in their natural habitat. However, prior to this current study, the extent of the dehydration effect on the values of bending stiffness and fracture toughness in lianas stems and leaves, respectively, remained unknown.
The dehydration effect in plant organs primarily composed of parenchymal tissues has been recently elucidated (Caliaro et al., 2013; Kampowski et al., 2018). These studies have shown that the reduction in water content in petioles and hypocotyls leads to a decrease in bending stiffness. Conversely, in self-supporting plants with stems and woody roots predominantly comprised of fibers and conducting cells (vessels and/or tracheids), dehydration results in an increase in bending stiffness, rendering branches more brittle (Niklas, 1992; Wang & Wang, 1999; Niklas & Spatz, 2010; Boldrin et al., 2018). For instance, in Picea sitchensis, a 23% decline in bending stiffness occurs when moisture content rises from 12% to 24% in woody stems (Niklas, 1992). Our findings align with previous research on trees and extend this investigation to liana stems. The impact of stem dehydration on bending stiffness in A. crucigerum is six times smaller than that observed in Picea sitchensis stems. This lesser effect on liana stems may be attributed to their anatomical structure, characterized by wide vessels, few fibers, and a higher proportion of parenchyma cells and soft tissue, enhancing water storage capacity (Tyree & Yang, 1990; Campanello et al., 2016) and resulting in more flexible liana stems (Rowe, 2018; Gerolamo et al., 2020). Notably, the species A. crucigerum exhibits phloem wedges, large vessels, and wide rays (as depicted in Figure 1), promoting stem flexibility and mitigating the impact of dehydration.
The fracture toughness of mature leaves of A. crucigerum (average 206 ±SD 53 Jm-2) was found to be significantly lower than that of mature leaves from other dicotyledonous species (Lucas & Pereira, 1990), yet comparable to values reported for Piper kadzura, Morus australis, and Trema orientalis (Hill & Lucas, 1996). This reduced toughness may be attributed to variations in leaf anatomy and thickness. Research indicates that fracture toughness tends to increase with leaf thickness and the percentage of fibers present, while it decreases with a higher proportion of parenchyma cells in the mesophyll (Vincent, 1990a; Lucas et al., 1995; Darvell et al., 1996). In the case of A. crucigerum, the leaf lamina is thin and predominantly composed of parenchyma cells, as illustrated in Figure 1, likely contributing to its comparatively lower toughness among lianas.
Our findings regarding lianas indicate that the fracture toughness of leaf laminas increases with drying, mirroring previous studies on grass leaves (Niklas 1992, Vincent 1990b, 1983). As leaves dry out, they tend to become more brittle and notch sensitive. For instance, A. crucigerum exhibits an average leaf fracture toughness of 280 Jm-2 at 10% moisture content, which decreases to 200 Jm-2 at 50% moisture content, marking a 30% reduction in fracture toughness. While the impact of leaf dehydration on fracture toughness has been extensively studied in grasses (Vincent 1983, 1990b), such analysis is limited for other species, prompting our exploration of this phenomenon in liana leaves.
The findings presented in this study could have significant implications for the evolution and dietary habits of non-human primates. The physical characteristics of plants that are utilized or consumed by these primates may exert selective pressures influencing their morphology and behavior (Lucas et al., 2012; Youlatos, 1999). Lianas, as integral structural components of forests, possess resilient and pliable stems that span the canopy, serving as pathways for the locomotion of various animals (Rowe, 2018; Lambert & Halsey, 2014; Yanoviak, 2015; Arroyo-Rodríguez et al., 2015). These lianas can significantly impact the lives and evolutionary trajectories of non-human primates, as suggested by Youlatos (1999) who proposed that the locomotor anatomy of pygmy marmosets may be influenced by their feeding and travel patterns in liana-rich environments. Furthermore, many primate species rely on various liana species as crucial food sources, particularly during periods of food scarcity (Marshall & Wrangham, 2007). Hence, the relatively low toughness of liana leaves could be a key factor in the dietary choices of non-human primates. Consequently, understanding the physical properties of liana structures could provide valuable insights into the evolutionary implications for the feeding and locomotor morphology of non-human primates (Youlatos, 1999; Lucas et al., 2012).
In conclusion, the dehydration response of liana A. crucigerum stems and leaves, following 48 hours of field sampling, exhibited a significantly increased stiffness when compared to hydrated samples. Furthermore, the magnitude of the dehydration effect was found to be relatively smaller in lianas as opposed to other plant habits, attributed to the distinctive anatomical structure of lianas. As a result, we suggest that researchers aiming to evaluate the biomechanical characteristics of plant organs in their natural state should conduct experiments using consistently moist samples or immediately after field collection. These findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of the biomechanical attributes of liana stems and leaves, reinforcing the validity of current protocols utilized in plant biomechanics research.
