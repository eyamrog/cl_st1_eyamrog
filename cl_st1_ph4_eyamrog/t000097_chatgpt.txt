Objective: This study sought to identify and characterize the protocols of physical activity and/or exercise interventions in the treatment of breast cancer. The study focuses on elucidating the types, frequencies, durations, intensities, and timings of therapeutic interventions involving physical activity, while also presenting the outcomes obtained from these interventions.
Methods: Following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across five databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed Central®, ScienceDirect, Scopus Elsevier, and Web of Science. No restrictions were imposed on language or publication year. Identified studies underwent manual evaluation and were screened using Rayyan software by two researchers independently and in a blinded manner. The search strategy included keywords such as 'breast cancer' AND 'physical activity' OR 'physical exercise', AND 'protocol study' OR 'study protocol'. Inclusion criteria encompassed study protocols of randomized clinical trials focusing on physical activity and/or exercise interventions in women undergoing breast cancer treatment and post-treatment phases.
Results: A total of 806 articles were initially identified, with subsequent exclusion of duplicates and those not meeting the inclusion criteria, resulting in 17 articles remaining for review. The methodological evaluation of the studies deemed to have a 'low risk' of bias was conducted using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool, revealing a commendable level of methodological rigor. Various forms of physical activities were emphasized, including aerobic exercises, endurance training, dance, Pilates, and exercises guided by applications and internet software. These activities were typically of moderate intensity, performed three times a week for 30 minutes each session. The majority of participants in the interventions were found to be in disease stages 0 to III. The study protocols demonstrated notable improvements in physical aspects such as physical fitness, activity levels, cognitive function, and body composition, as well as psychological aspects like quality of life, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. These findings underscore the potential benefits of physical activities for this particular demographic.
Discussion: Study protocols play a crucial role in ensuring research transparency, thereby enhancing the reproducibility and comprehension of interventions, ultimately fostering scientific progress.
Impact: This scoping review offers a comprehensive overview that will facilitate future research on physical activity and/or exercise interventions for women diagnosed with breast cancer.
Since 2018, breast cancer has been recognized as the most prevalent form of cancer among women globally, constituting over 24% of all cancer diagnoses in the female population, totaling around 2.1 million new cases. Additionally, it stands as the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Recent research indicates that engaging in physical activity serves as a viable therapeutic option, offering numerous health advantages for women navigating breast cancer treatment or post-treatment phases. Furthermore, these activities have been shown to have a substantial impact on the postoperative stage of these women.
Randomized clinical trials examining interventions involving physical activity in women with breast cancer have demonstrated effectiveness in alleviating fatigue, enhancing quality of life, reducing body mass index (BMI) and body weight, boosting muscle endurance and strength, alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety, enhancing shoulder range of motion, addressing sleep disorders, improving body image, managing pain, and enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness.
The search across databases such as PubMed Central®, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (main collection), Scopus, Elsevier, and ScienceDirect revealed a wealth of international literature dating back to 1983, notably with Metzner et al.'s seminal investigation. This study highlighted the positive impact of physical activity on reducing the risks associated with chronic diseases. Delving further into the realm of study protocols, an early milestone can be traced back to 1955 with Sakheim's pioneering work aimed at validating a study protocol within a psychiatric hospital setting. It wasn't until 1989, however, that Dickhuth et al.'s investigation marked a significant shift, linking study protocols with physical activity.
The significance of publishing study protocols is widely recognized for enhancing transparency in research and mitigating publication bias. These protocols serve as crucial research tools once made available, facilitating the reproducibility of interventions by fellow researchers and aiding the scientific community in understanding the advancements within a specific field. Despite the evident advantages they offer, not all clinical trials prioritize the publication of physical activity intervention protocols that have proven effective.
This scoping review aims to enhance the understanding of randomized clinical trial protocols involving physical activity for women with breast cancer, offering fresh insights into interventions for healthcare professionals. It also seeks to contribute to the enhancement of physical and mental well-being among women with breast cancer through complementary therapies. The primary objective of this review is to identify and describe study protocols focusing on physical activity and/or exercise interventions for breast cancer treatment. It highlights the various types, frequencies, durations, intensities, and timings of therapeutic interventions involving physical activity, while also presenting the outcomes of these interventions.
The current scoping review adheres to the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The guiding question was formulated using the PICOS acronym: what are the characteristics of physical activity and/or exercise intervention protocols for breast cancer treatment?
A search across five databases, namely Cochrane Library, PubMed Central®, ScienceDirect, Scopus Elsevier, and Web of Science - main collection, was conducted. The descriptors utilized are detailed in Table 1. Subsequently, all titles and abstracts retrieved from the electronic search were meticulously evaluated by two researchers (JS, VBL) in a blind and independent manner between January and February 2021. These researchers are affiliated with the Brazilian laboratory known as Laboratório de Pesquisa em Lazer e Atividade Física – LAPLAF/CNPq (Leisure and Physical Activity Research Laboratory). Additionally, the Rayyan software (Intelligent Systematic Review) was employed to facilitate the reference selection process. Any discrepancies that arose were resolved by a third researcher (ACAG). Furthermore, the reference lists of all pertinent articles were scrutinized to identify additional eligible studies.
The eligibility criteria for the studies were determined based on the PICOS acronym, which considers the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design (refer to Table 2). This review included randomized clinical trials involving adult women (aged 18 years and above) undergoing treatment for breast cancer and those in the post-treatment phase.
The studies should explore interventions incorporating physical activities and/or exercise for breast cancer treatment. Abstracts and full texts were accessible from January to February 2021, with no restrictions on language or publication year.
The researchers, JS and VBL, conducted searches on the specified databases and subsequently organized the selected articles based on their titles and abstracts. Articles that did not align with the study's objectives were excluded from further consideration. Following this initial screening, the researchers thoroughly read the remaining articles to finalize the selection process for inclusion in the study (see Figure 1).
In conducting this scoping review, studies focusing on physical activity and/or exercise protocols for the treatment and post-treatment of women with breast cancer were specifically sought out. The variables under investigation included study protocols related to breast cancer and physical activity/exercise.
Study protocols serve as essential guidelines for conducting research, serving not only as a framework for data collection but also as a means to streamline the evaluation process. These protocols outline specific steps and sequences to ensure that investigations can effectively address the primary research questions and any additional inquiries that may arise during the study.
Breast cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal breast cells and stands as the most prevalent type of cancer among women globally. The earliest articles on this subject trace back to the 1880s, notably with Snow's study and Cheyne's work in 1889. Presently, there exists a burgeoning body of research on breast cancer, with over 500,000 articles available in databases. The prominence of these investigations began in the 1960s with clinical trials, which have progressively heightened and broadened the exploration for early detection methods and treatment modalities aimed at enhancing the quality of life for affected women.
Physical activity is characterized as any bodily movement generated by skeletal muscles that necessitates energy expenditure. Krebs, Berling-Ernst, and Halle have highlighted physical activity as a therapeutic approach and a form of support for individuals battling cancer. Numerous studies have explored the benefits of engaging in physical activity or exercise both during cancer treatment and in the post-treatment phase, with a particular focus on breast cancer. Recommendations from these studies suggest that cancer patients, including those with breast cancer, should aim for a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week.
The study protocols were analyzed and discussed by extracting data pertaining to the authors, year of publication, journal, country of study, number of citations from the Web of Science database (up to February 7, 2021), number of databases used, search period, and adherence to the 27-item PRISMA checklist (yes or no). Furthermore, details such as objectives, total sample size, intervention and control groups, participant ages, study location, investigated variables (both physical and psychological), specifics of the physical activity intervention, duration, number and frequency of sessions, and intervention duration were meticulously evaluated and scored.
The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. Criteria such as random sequence generation, allocation sequence hiding, participants and researchers' masking, and selective reporting were evaluated. However, masking items related to outcome evaluation and incomplete data were excluded due to the absence of intervention results in the study protocols. The researchers' (JS, ACAG) judgment on the review was categorized as low, unclear, or high risk of bias.
In the initial database search, a total of 806 articles were identified, with 290 from Science Direct, 46 from Web of Science, 87 from Scopus, 170 from Cochrane, and 213 from PubMed. Following the removal of 102 duplicate articles, the titles and abstracts of the remaining 704 articles were reviewed, resulting in the exclusion of 686 articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria or focused on individuals with different conditions. This left 18 articles for full-text assessment, during which one additional article was excluded from the final analysis.
This scoping review encompassed a total of 17 articles, all of which were identified as study protocols involving randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (references 35–51).
The study participants included women diagnosed with breast cancer, including those with metastatic breast cancer, overweight or obese individuals with breast cancer, and elderly women with breast cancer. The age range varied among participants, with some being over 18 years old, between 18 and 65, between 18 and 75, between 19 and 70, between 20 and 59, between 30 and 75, between 40 and 75, and finally, between 65 and 70 years old.
The women included in the study ranged from stages 0 to III of the disease, with some individuals exhibiting metastasis or severe cancer. However, one study did not provide information on the disease stage of the participants.
In terms of treatment, several studies involved women undergoing various treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or adjuvant therapies, while others focused on those who had completed adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Additionally, one study examined individuals receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Furthermore, four studies included women scheduled to undergo chemotherapy, and one study did not specify the treatment period for the female participants.
In the realm of included studies, the oldest contributions hail from Carayol et al (47) and Schmidt et al (38), alongside more recent investigations such as those by Andersen et al (35), Boing et al (36), Pudkasam et al (37), Smith-Turchyn et al (39), Foulkes et al (46), and Meier-Girard et al (50). The impact factors of the journals hosting these studies ranged from 1.552 (40) to 3.150 (45, 46, 51). Among the 17 articles identified, only twelve were indexed in the Web of Science, with varying citation counts as follows: one (36, 38, 41), two (45, 46, 51), four (42), five (40), six (43), seven (44), eight (48), and twelve (47) citations up to April 12, 2021.
The studies were conducted in various locations around the world. Nine of them took place in Europe, including Spain, Holland, Denmark, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Switzerland. Three investigations were carried out in North America, specifically in the United States and Canada. One study was conducted in South America, in Brazil, while two were carried out in Oceania, specifically in Australia. Additionally, two studies took place in Asia, in China and Japan.
All the studies were registered on various clinical trial registry platforms, including Clinical Trial, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR), UMIN Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN-CTR), German Clinical Trials Register (GermanCTR), and the Clinical Trials Registry from Australia and New Zealand. These registrations were documented in the following references: 35, 36, 50, 52, 38–40, 42, 44, 45, 47, 48, 43, 41, and 51, as indicated in the study.
Among the selected studies, 15 incorporated a control group with various approaches. These approaches encompassed usual and routine care, general health advice, and guidelines for weight reduction, the provision of physical activity monitoring devices, active control interventions such as CoordiFit, guidance on postoperative recovery exercises and breast cancer treatment, supervised myofascial release training, as well as instructions for aerobic activity and achieving a daily step count of at least 10,000.
Two of the selected studies included a comparison group. In one study, the comparison groups consisted of an immediate intervention group and a late intervention group, both engaging in self-directed physical activity. The other study involved comparison groups participating in a progressive endurance training program and a supervised program focusing on muscle relaxation training.
Physical activity and/or exercise interventions in study protocols encompass a range of approaches, including home walking, supervised exercises, aerobic and strength/endurance exercises, eurythmy, coordfit therapy, Pilates, belly dance, guided exercises through applications and internet software, monitoring activity through watches, Qigong, self-directed exercises, rehabilitation exercises, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), personalized exercises with a diet program, motivational meetings, and dietary interventions with activity monitoring through watches. These diverse interventions highlight the multifaceted nature of physical activity promotion in research settings.
The interventions varied in duration across the studies included in this research. Specifically, the durations ranged from 12 weeks to 48 weeks. Some interventions lasted for 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 20 weeks, 24 weeks, 26 weeks, and 48 weeks, while others spanned a range of 12 to 24 weeks or 12 to 18 weeks. One study was conducted in three phases lasting 12 weeks, 14 weeks, and 26 weeks, while another study did not specify the duration of the intervention.
The frequency of the proposed interventions ranged from 1 to 3 times a week in several studies (35, 36, 38–40, 42, 43, 45, 46, 50), 4 to 5 times a week in others (47, 49), with 6 meetings spread over 6 months in two studies (41, 48). Additionally, two studies did not specify the frequency at which the interventions took place (37, 44).
The duration of each intervention session varied across studies, ranging from 20 to 25 minutes (Study 51), 20 to 40 minutes per session (Study 45), 30 minutes per session (Studies 35, 39, 41, 43, 49), 30 to 45 minutes per session (Study 47), 45 minutes per session (Study 50), 30 to 60 minutes per session (Study 46), 60 minutes per session (Studies 36, 38, 40, 48), and 60 to 120 minutes per session (Study 42). However, two studies did not specify the session duration of the interventions (Studies 37, 46).
The intensity of the interventions in the included studies exhibited a range of levels, including light (40, 35, 50), light to moderate (35, 50), moderate (37–39, 47, 48), light to vigorous (51), and moderate to high/vigorous (42, 45). However, six studies did not specify the intensity of the interventions (36, 41, 43, 44, 46, 49).
The interventions were carried out by professionals in Physical Education or individuals specializing in physical exercise (39, 40, 45, 47), as well as by physiologists (46), physiotherapists (35, 42–44), professionals in Physical Education and/or physiotherapists (36, 38), clinical staff comprising doctors, physiotherapists, Physical Education professionals, and nurses (41, 48), therapists or eurythmy specialists (50), or by the researcher (49), with one professional involved per application (37). One article did not specify the professionals involved (51).
Interventions were conducted at universities (38, 42, 45, 46), hospitals (35–37, 43, 47, 51), at home (41, 49, 50), physiotherapy clinics, city hall exercise rooms (40), research centers (39), and in the presence of support groups (48).
Physical and psychological outcomes were evaluated through various study protocols that aimed to assess female participants at baseline, post-intervention, and at different intervals during and after the intervention. Some studies conducted assessments at the 6th week, 15th week, 8th and 14th weeks, and the 12th week of the intervention. Additionally, follow-up evaluations were included in certain investigations, such as at 24 weeks, 6 months, 6, 12, and 24 months post-intervention, as well as at 24 and 36 weeks, 12 and 18 months, and 24 months after the intervention.
The physical outcomes evaluated in the protocol studies are depicted in Figure 2, encompassing a range of parameters. These include assessments related to physical fitness, physical function, body composition (total, regional, and mineral bone), physical activity level, functional status, muscle strength, flexibility, inflammatory biomarkers, hospitalization, survival, upper limb mobility, arm, shoulder, and hand function, range of motion, lymphedema, pain, work performance, memory, brain function, executive function, attention, spatial visual skills, cognitive function, self-perceived cognitive performance, food intake/diet, health condition, use of health services, biological assessments, neutrophic levels, cardiac reserve, cardiac structure and function, central vascular stiffness, blood pressure, sedentary behavior, side effects related to cancer, and immune function.
Figure 3 displays the array of psychological variables under evaluation, encompassing quality of life (references 35, 36, 45, 46, 48, 50, 37–44), welfare (reference 35), fatigue (references 36, 38, 40–42, 46, 47, 49, 50), anxiety (references 37, 42, 47, 49, 50), depression (references 36–38, 40–42, 47, 49, 50), stress (reference 37), mood (references 46, 49), self-esteem (references 36, 49), body image (reference 36), sexual function (reference 36), sleep quality (references 36, 41, 50), suffering (reference 50), life satisfaction (reference 40), psychological health (reference 45), and fear of cancer recurrence (reference 41).
Overall, the study protocols were predominantly categorized as having a 'low' risk of bias across most of the assessed items. Only one study received a 'high' risk of bias classification, while two studies were deemed 'unclear' in terms of the random sequence generation item. Five studies exhibited an 'unclear' classification regarding the allocation sequence hiding. When considering participant and researcher masking, three studies were classified as 'unclear'. Notably, twelve studies demonstrated a 'low risk' of bias across all items, indicating a higher level of methodological rigor in those cases.
This scoping review aimed to identify and characterize the protocols of physical activity and/or exercise interventions for breast cancer treatment, focusing on the types, frequency, duration, intensity, and timing of the therapeutic interventions along with the outcomes. Seventeen protocol studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this review, comprising randomized clinical trials registered on official platforms. Given the nature of protocol studies not displaying results, the assessment of bias risk was adjusted accordingly. The identified study protocols adhered to the SPIRIT checklist standards, demonstrating a low risk of bias due to clear indications of random sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, participant and researcher masking, and selective reporting, aligning with the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool.
The study protocols examined in this scoping review encompassed a variety of physical activities and exercises, including aerobic exercises, endurance training, dance, Pilates, and exercises guided by applications and Internet software. This diverse range of modalities investigated in the context of breast cancer highlights the potential interventions available. These protocols offer a spectrum of intervention options, outlining possibilities and structures for further randomized clinical trials. Previous studies have explored some of these modalities, such as aerobic and endurance exercises, which have been deemed safe and effective for women undergoing breast cancer treatment. Notably, randomized clinical trials conducted by Paulo et al, García-Soidán et al, and Sweeney et al demonstrated significant improvements in strength, flexibility, musculoskeletal health, body composition, and reduction of treatment-related side effects in women with breast cancer following interventions involving aerobic and endurance exercises. These interventions also positively impacted the quality of life and emotional well-being of the participants.
The study protocols have demonstrated that walking can serve as an effective intervention to enhance cardiorespiratory fitness and physical performance, while also being deemed safe and beneficial for women experiencing lymphedema as a result of breast cancer. Furthermore, walking is highlighted for its accessibility, low cost, and potential for mobility, making it a compelling option particularly in low and middle-income countries. On the other hand, High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) exercises, as recommended in the protocols by Tsuji et al and Oberste et al, offer a different approach. This emerging modality has shown promise for breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, yielding positive outcomes.
In this scoping review, two study protocols examined interventions involving dance. Additional studies by Loo et al and Ho et al demonstrated that engaging in dance practice led to increased physical activity among breast cancer survivors. Furthermore, it was found that dance contributed to enhancing quality of life by boosting vigor, addressing obesity-related issues, and alleviating stress and pain in these individuals. Regarding Pilates interventions, research conducted by Eyigor et al indicated that this form of exercise is both safe and effective for breast cancer patients, as it aids in enhancing functional capacities, reducing fatigue, improving quality of life, and alleviating symptoms of depression. Findings from the study by Alpozgen et al further supported the benefits of Pilates, showing improvements in pain management, muscle strength, and its efficacy as a rehabilitation exercise for women with breast cancer. Consequently, Pilates emerges as a viable alternative treatment option for this demographic.
Current modalities in research protocols, involving home-based exercises with electronic interventions like activity-monitoring watches, internet software, and smartphone applications, have gained traction for enhancing living standards, particularly amidst the pandemic-induced shift towards remote work. Previous studies, exemplified by Dong et al., have demonstrated the positive impact of interventions combining exercises with internet software on muscle strength and quality of life in postoperative breast cancer patients. Similarly, Galiano-Castillo et al. highlighted the efficacy of a physical exercise program utilizing internet software in enhancing the quality of life, reducing pain and fatigue, improving muscle strength, and enhancing daily functionality in breast cancer patients. These strategies, leveraging online tools and home-based interventions, offer viable alternatives benefiting researchers and participants by expanding participant networks. The current emphasis on home-based activities has underscored the importance of digital tools, prompting a greater appreciation for their utility. While challenges like software limitations, user proficiency, internet accessibility issues, and participant engagement may arise, these strategies serve as valuable tools for behavior modification, fostering closer collaboration between researchers and participants.
It was noted that the interventions primarily focused on moderate intensity exercises, aligning with Spence et al's recommendation of at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week for breast cancer patients, as demonstrated in randomized clinical trials by Ligibel et al, Arem et al, and Mijwel et al. However, some study protocols lacked information on the intensity of the interventions, highlighting a limitation. Researchers should suggest these recommendations to ensure proven benefits and facilitate the implementation and performance of future intervention study protocols.
The study protocols primarily focused on the physical outcomes related to the physical conditions and limitations experienced by women with breast cancer, including decreased upper limb function, reduced range of motion, diminished muscle strength, and cardiovascular implications. The investigations in nearly all studies centered on the factors that restrict these individuals due to the disease, with a particular emphasis on facilitating their return to daily activities. Consequently, the most frequently utilized assessment tools in the reviewed studies were the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) test, the 30-second Sitting-Rising Test (30s-SRT), and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). These instruments were preferred due to their cost-effectiveness and efficiency in application.
The repercussions of treatments on the psychological well-being of women undergoing breast cancer treatment and post-treatment can manifest in issues such as anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Consequently, there is a significant emphasis on ensuring quality care. Numerous studies prioritize quality of life as a primary outcome, with depression and anxiety also receiving considerable attention likely due to the distressing nature of the disease.
In terms of the instruments utilized, it is important to note the wide array of options available, which can complicate comparisons across studies. For instance, in the context of quality of life assessments, a common primary outcome in many research protocols, instruments such as the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EuroQol Five-dimensional Instrument (EQ-5D-5L), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B) were frequently employed. These instruments are validated and commonly utilized in studies involving cancer patients. Additionally, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) stands out as a widely used tool for evaluating levels of depression and anxiety.
The study protocols outlined various intervention options involving physical activity and/or exercise; nevertheless, some are constrained by insufficient details, such as intensity, frequency, or timing of sessions, crucial for optimizing these interventions. Notably, the initial study protocol identified in this scoping review originates from 2013, indicating a historical absence of protocol publications in prior clinical trials and a growing trend towards protocol dissemination. It is worth noting that not all scientific journals accommodate such studies, and certain authors of randomized clinical trials opt against protocol publication.
In this scoping review, a variety of interventions involving different modalities of physical activity and exercise were identified, including endurance training, aerobic exercises, dance, Pilates, HIIT, Qigong, and technology-assisted activities utilizing software, applications, and wearable devices for activity monitoring. The frequency of interventions varied from one to five times per week, lasting between 12 to 48 weeks, and encompassing a range of intensities from low to vigorous. The study protocols predominantly focused on disease stages ranging from 0 to III, with participants undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or other adjuvant therapies. Key outcomes assessed included physical fitness, activity levels, cognitive function, and body composition, while psychological outcomes of quality of life, fatigue, depression, and anxiety were also prominently evaluated.
Despite the variety of modalities available, additional study protocols are essential to ensure research transparency, enhance reproducibility, and improve the comprehension of interventions. These protocols serve as valuable tools for future research endeavors, ultimately aiding in the progression of scientific knowledge.
The current study offers valuable insights into the features of study protocols within randomized clinical trials, shedding light on which protocols may be better suited for specific studies and identifying the most commonly utilized instruments for assessing physical and psychological outcomes. The survey conducted as part of this scoping review will serve as a valuable resource for future research focusing on physical activity and exercise interventions for women diagnosed with breast cancer.
