ABSTRACT 
Objective: The aim of this study was to carry out the translation and present the evidence of 
validity of the Brazilian version of the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP). 
Method: this is a cross-sectional study conducted in a municipal hospital in the metropolitan 
region of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. A total of 161 patients were evaluated in the first 
24 hours of emergency arrival using ESP. Exploratory factor analyses of the sections of the 
instrument and reliability analyses were conducted using Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's 
Omega. Results: the analyses suggested an appropriate structure to the purpose of the 
instrument, two sections containing two factors instead of the expected one-dimensional 
structure. However, sections with two factors have interpretability and theoretical 
consistency. The factors presented internal consistency. Conclusion: the Brazilian version of 
the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP) demonstrates adequate psychometric 
properties through the internal structure of the instrument. Future studies should investigate 
the relationship of the scores produced by the instrument with clinical diagnosis and with 
covariates relevant to mental health outcomes.

Introduction 
         Emergency services in general hospitals are part of the Psychosocial Care Network 
(Brasil 2011) supported by the Psychiatric Reform Law (Brasil, 2001) and Ordinance MS/GM 
No 2048, November 5, 2002 (Brasil, 2002) which specify that psychiatric emergency care is 
the responsibility of emergency rooms (ER) in general hospitals. The search occurs 
spontaneously or by referral of other psychosocial care services to attend crises, anxiety 
disorders, 
mental 
disorders 
and 
intoxication 
or 
withdrawal 
of 
psychoactive 
substances. Patients with primary complaints of mental health issues represent a substantial 
proportion of people seeking emergency services. A study (Moulin, Evans, Xing, Melnikow, 
2018) conducted between 2009 and 2014 showed that 28.2% of the demand for care in 
emergency departments (ER) in California, United States were frequent users of mental health 
units, thus deeming those who seek ER more than four times in the period of one 
year. Another survey (Matsumoto, O'Driscoll, Lawrance, Jakubow, Madden, Kelly, 2017) 
conducted at a hospital in Ontario, Canada showed that mental disorders and additions 
account for 10.3% of emergency room, 8.7% of admissions and 20% of inter-hospital 
transfers. The research identified that respiratory problems, mental disorders and 
abdominal/pelvic complaints are the three most common diagnostic groups in RE. 
Patients with substance use disorders, suicidal ideation, or those who have attempted 
suicide are the most common users of mental health emergency services. The next most 
frequent are those with psychosis, altered mental status and acute anxiety disorders. Suicide

attempts require in-depth screening, evaluation and recommendations on subsequent follow-
up (Hashmi, Czelusta, Jabbar, Siddiqui, Shah, 2018). National data from the Canadian 
Institute for Health Information (Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2017)                        
show that 32% of people seeking emergency departments (ER) are for mental health issues 
only (e.g., anxiety and mood disorders), 18% are due to substance use disorders and 50% seek 
care for both mental health disorders and addictions. In 2017-2018, 81% of patients admitted 
to general hospitals with mental disorders and addictions occurred through emergency 
departments (Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2019). However, emergency 
physicians spend relatively little time during residency training learning to evaluate and 
manage psychiatric patients in general, and especially suicide cases. Reasons include 
prioritizing more medically severe patients, not feeling comfortable with psychiatric 
complaints, and prejudice (Williams, Shepherd, 2000). Among the different reasons, the 
stigma of non-specialist professionals in general hospitals is evidenced in the literature                        
(Noblett, 
Lawrence, 
Smith, 
2015; 
Giandinoto, 
Stephenson, 
Edward, 
2018;                        
Staton et al., 2018;  Wu et al., 2020). 
In the care of patients in emergencies it is necessary to determine whether the cause of 
the complaint is functional or organic, if there are associated medical comorbidities and 
whether there is a need for psychiatric evaluation or hospitalization (Williams & Shepherd, 
2000). However, there are no interdisciplinary uniform guidelines or algorithms that 
constitute a clear difference between psychiatry and emergency medicine (Tucci, Siever, 
Matorin, & Moukaddam, 2015).  Prior research (Shepard et al., 2015; Benziger, Roth, & 
Moran, 2016; World Health Organization, 2013) demonstrates the correlation between mental 
disorders and organic diseases and the coexistence of these diseases may not be recognized 
initially in this population.

 Evidence indicates that a complete history and physical examination, including vital 
signs and mental status examination, are the minimum elements needed in the evaluation of 
psychiatric patients in emergencies (Wilson et al., 2017). On the other hand, there is no 
screening tool for the release of patients with psychiatric symptoms standardized in 
emergencies. The validity of a screening algorithm proved to be effective for psychiatric 
diagnosis as an evaluation method for the exclusion of acute disease. In a study of the 
application of the Triage Algorithm for Psychiatric Screening (TAPS) no patient received 
diagnosis or treatment for acute medical disease (Miller et al., 2012). 
In hospitals with organized psychiatric services, the need for systematic training of 
supervisors and resident physicians in diagnostic criteria and structured interviews for greater 
accuracy of diagnosis, has been defended when performed under indirect supervision (Del- 
Ben et al., 2005). Other measures include the use of standardized diagnostic instruments, the 
rational use of complementary tests and a minimum period of observation for the diagnosis of 
the 
first 
psychotic 
episode 
(Del-Ben, 
Rufino, 
Azevedo-Marques, 
& 
Menezes, 
2010). Psychiatric emergency services in general hospitals go beyond the need for 
stabilization of acute psychiatric conditions or referrals for full hospitalization, but are key 
points in prevention programs, therapeutic improvement and psychosocial interventions 
(Barros, Tung, & Mari, 2010). However, it is necessary to consider that most general 
hospitals do not have psychiatrists on duty in their staff in the emergency service. In this 
sense, a standardized instrument can qualify emergency care and assist professionals in 
clinical decision-making. 
The interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP) is an instrument designed for 
the use of health and mental health professionals dealing with urgent mental health situations: 
physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers and family physicians 
(Rabinowitz, Hirdes, Curtin-Telegdi, Martin, & Smith, 2013). The principles of  interRAI

mental health assessment systems include the evaluation of the person in order to maximize 
functional capacity and quality of life, identify physical and mental health problems and 
improve the level of independent functioning (Hirdes et al., 2020;  Hirdes et al., 2002; Hirdes, 
et al., 2009). interRAI is a collaborative network of researchers, clinicians and policy experts 
in over 35 countries committed to improve care for persons who are disabled or medically 
complex. The interRAI mental health instruments represents the results of rigorous research 
and testing to establish the reliability and validity of items, outcome measures, assessment 
protocols, and quality indicators.  
The ESP focuses on acute mental health crises but is designed to articulate with other 
instruments like the interRAI Community Mental Health, which may be used by mental 
health case managers. To achieve these objectives there is a need to identify the purpose of 
the evaluation; the identification of psychiatric, functional, medical and social issues that are 
considered current problems or that may constitute important problems for the person; the 
identification of strengths and the integration of what the evaluator sees for accurate coding 
of  the interRAI ESP Assessment (Rabinowitz, Hirdes, Curtin-Telegdi, Martin, & Smith, 
2013). Thus, considering the lack of specific instruments developed for the purpose of 
psychiatric evaluation in general hospital emergencies, the present study aimed to translate 
and evaluate the use of the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry instrument in the 
Brazilian context. 
 
Method 
Adaptation of the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP) to Brazilian

literature were followed (Mocking et al., 2020). After the consent of the authors of the 
instrument, two independent and bilingual translators did the Brazilian Portuguese version of 
the instrument.  Two authors of this article built a synthesized version of the two 
translations. Next, back-translation was performed by two bilingual translators with 
experience in the health area. After that, two professionals with expertise in the area (a 
psychologist and a psychiatrist) evaluated the versions and suggested modifications that were 
incorporated into the final version of the back-translated instrument. There were suggested 
modifications in 44 items of the instrument regarding the semantic aspects and the name of 
health services in Brazil. The final back-translated version was evaluated and approved by the 
authors of the original instrument. This version was used by four professionals from different 
backgrounds (two nurses, a psychologist and an occupational therapist) and there were no 
problems in understanding the instrument. 
 
Participants 
The sample consisted of 161 participants, 67 (42%) men and 94 (68%) women, with a 
mean age of 39.8 (SD = 16.1) years, all from a medium-sized municipal hospital in the 
metropolitan region of Rio Grande do Sul State. The exclusion criteria of the sample 
were patients with moderate to severe impairment at the time of evaluation, namely: acute use 
of psychoactive substances, impairment of consciousness - delirium, psychomotor agitation 
and difficulty in controlling aggressiveness, unaccompanied by a family member 
and/or guardian. 
  
Instrument and procedures 
Data were collected using a custom made software with the Portuguese version of 
the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP instrument version 9.1 (Rabinowitz,

Hirdes, Curtin-Telegdi, Martin, & Smith, 2013). The instrument has 13 main sections with 
sub-items and evaluates different mental health indicators such as mood disturbance, anxiety, 
psychosis, negative symptoms, sleep problems related to hypomania or mania, time since the 
use of the following substances, use of injectable drugs, tobacco use, withdrawal symptoms, 
causes of harm to oneself and others, ideation or attempt at self-harm, behavior, cognition and 
communication, functional status, medications, relationships, support and life events, 
environmental assessment. In the end, the software provides the results of calculations of 
specific triggers for risk algorithms (risk to themselves, risk to others and self-care 
index). Data exportation complies with the internationally coding used by the interRAI 
research group, allowing the use of this data in multicentric research. The average time to 
complete the ESP is thirty minutes; however, the acute nature of the disease may be a barrier 
to completion if other informants are not present (Hirdes et al., 2020).  
 
Data analysis 
Descriptive analysis (central tendency and dispersion) were conducted to diagnose the 
distribution, frequency and summaries of the variables. Subsequently, parallel analysis were 
conducted in order to identify the number of factors interpreted (Timmerman & Lorenzo-
Seva, 2011) by comparing empirical eigenvalues with simulated values. Two data simulation 
techniques were used, considering a parametric (Monte Carlo) and non-parametric 
(permutation of sample values) distribution. Then exploratory factor analyses were conducted 
in order to identify the variance of the items explained by the underlying dimension, through a 
semiparametric approximation (Shapiro & Berge, 2002), considering the ordinal level of the 
responses to the instrument. Standardized factor loadings above 0.3 are expected to indicate 
adjustment between the item and factor. This squared value indicates the correlation between 
the item and the latent dimension, which must be close to or greater than 10%. For the

analysis of consistency and reliability, Cronbach's Alpha index and the McDonald's omega 
index (Trizano-Hermosilla & Alvarado, 2016) were used. The alpha index indicates the level 
of common variance based on the intercorrelations between the items while the omega index 
performs the same estimate based on the standardized factor loads of the items. For both 
indexes, values above 0.7 are indicative of reliability. In section K (Summary psychiatric 
information) only risk indicators were analyzed, totaling four items. Finally, with the factorial 
scores modeled on each factor, its contribution to the overall ESP score was calculated by 
means of an analysis of principal components. The componential loads indicate which 
subscales (sections) are most determinant for the general mental health of the participants.

Table 2 shows the descriptive data and the componential loads of each subscale in relation to 
the overall score. Through the principal component analysis technique, a single component 
was extracted that explained 32% of the total variance of the scores. This main component is 
nothing more than a general index of mental health problems assessed by ESP. The 
componential loads, presented in Table 2, indicate the association between the scores of each

Discussion 
The sections demonstrated, in general, good psychometric properties. With the 
exception of sections B and D, all the other ones demonstrated evidence of a one-dimensional 
structure, according to the theoretical expectation of the instrument. Although both sections 
can be represented in a one-dimensional continuum of mood and aggressiveness changes, the 
analysis indicate that empirically there is a distinction because of a different pattern of 
changes in these components. Sections B (mental state indicators) and D (causing damage to 
oneself and others) demonstrated a structure with two factors, indicating a differentiation 
between depression and mania, and between self-harm (self-aggression) and damage to others 
(heteroaggression), respectively. It is important to note that the correlations between the 
factors of sections B and C are close to zero, indicating that behaviors may or may not occur 
concomitantly, without a previous expected pattern. Precisely the absence of correlation 
indicates that any combinations between behaviors are plausible.

The factor loadings of the items were adequate, all with values equal to or greater than 
0.30. This indicates that the items are sensitive to detect changes in the latent dimensions 
indicated by the ESP sections. Even in the sections in which a two-factor solution was 
observed, the factor loadings of the items in the factors remained within the expected 
values. The reliability measures were also satisfactory. With the exception of section H 
(medicines), all measurements are above the expected cut-off point. This means that the 
answers are consistent, and the presence or absence of one of the indicators correlates with the 
response to the other items. In section H Cronbach's alpha has acceptable value and 
McDonald's omega is slightly below expectations, probably due to the small number of items 
in this section. In this way, you can consider your level of trust appropriate. 
The analysis of the main components of the sections (and subsections) of ESP 
revealed that the areas investigated by the instrument have different weights in the 
composition of the general mental health index. The most influential sections to designate 
mental health status were, in order, B (mania), E (Behavior), F (Cognition and 
Communication) and K (Psychiatric Summary Information). These changes are common to 
more severe and debilitating disorders, such as bipolar disorders and schizophrenia. In one 
study of 200,000 people, schizophrenia was significantly correlated with most other disorders, 
such as bipolar disorders3. Some psychiatrists have put forward a radical hypothesis. If 
disorders share symptoms, or co-occur, and if many genes are implicated in multiple 
disorders, then maybe there is a single factor that predisposes people to psychopathology. In 
2013, Caspi and Moffitt used data from a long-term study of 1,037 people and found that most 
of the variation in symptoms could be explained by a single factor called this the 'p factor' 
(Marshall, 2020). Others (Lahey, Krueger, Rathouz, Waldman, & Zald, 2017) have proposed 
that the p factor is a general predisposition to psychopathology, but that other factors such as 
stressful experiences or other gene alterations drives a person towards different symptoms. In

this sense, the use of ESP in large-scale multicenter studies may show evidence of common 
symptoms in different mental disorders and the correlation between the disorders. 
It should be noted that impairments in interpersonal relationships, as indicated 
in sections D (Harm to Self and Others) and I (Unsettled Relations, Supports, and Life 
Events) also contribute to the overall worsening in mental health assessment. These results 
may support shorter and trace versions of ESP. It is noteworthy that the completion of the 
software provides decision support to the emergency professional on three important scales: 
Severity of Self-harm Scale; Risk of Harm to Others Scale and Self-Care Index.  
 
Conclusion 
The Brazilian version of the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP) 
demonstrates adequate psychometric properties through the internal structure of the 
instrument. Future studies should investigate the relationship of the scores produced by the 
instrument with clinical diagnosis and with covariates relevant to mental health outcomes.
