The Amazonian phlebotomine fauna is widely recognized as one of the most diverse in the world, with the region being particularly prevalent for leishmaniasis in Brazil and South America. Acre, a state within this region, stands out for its rich sand fly fauna diversity and the occurrence of American tegumentary leishmaniasis. This Dataset presents a comprehensive bibliographic review of sand fly species documented in Acre State, located in the Amazon region of Brazil. A total of 1,096 observations, including Material Citation type and two preserved specimens, were meticulously analyzed using 32 variables based on Darwin Core terms. The review encompassed searches in PubMed, Google Scholar, SciELO, BVS (Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde), and relevant bibliographic references from scientific articles. This study serves as a robust foundation for future research on sand fly populations in Acre and other Amazonian states, providing valuable insights for further investigations in this field.
A total of 22 articles and books spanning from 1964 to 2022 were utilized to gather the data, resulting in the recording of 1,096 observations (including two from preserved specimens) for the state of Acre. These records were sourced from eight municipalities: Acrelândia, Assis Brasil, Brasiléia, Bujari, Cruzeiro do Sul, Feijó, Rio Branco, and Xapuri, where a total of 116 species belonging to 15 genera of sand flies were identified. Consequently, based on the comprehensive studies conducted on phlebotomine fauna, the state of Acre has reported a total of 116 species.
The genera with the highest number of species were Evandromyia (18), Psychodopygus (18), Psathyromyia (17), Lutzomyia (10), Nyssomyia (9), Trichophoromyia (9), Micropygomyia (9), Pintomyia (6), Pressatia (4), Sciopemyia (4), Bichromomyia (3), Brumptomyia (3), Trichopygomyia (2), Viannamyia (2), and Migonemyia (1). It is important to note that 12 observations were reported as Trichophoromyia sp. due to the fact that the record combines the number of specimens and distribution for two species, Trichophoromyia auraensis and Trichophoromyia ruifreitasi, as their females cannot be distinguished based on morphology.
In terms of biodiversity, the municipalities with the highest number of recorded species were as follows: Assis Brasil (78), Rio Branco (68), Xapuri (58), Bujari (50), Cruzeiro do Sul (30), Brasiléia (20), Feijó (14), and Acrelândia (12) as shown in Table 2.
It is important to note that the number of species for Rio Branco and Xapuri may differ from what is presented in Table 2, as one of the articles combined the results for both municipalities. Consequently, all species records for this specific article were grouped under the name "Bujari/Rio Branco/Xapuri" in Table 2. Another issue pertains to Psychodopygus corossoniensis, which is the only species recorded for the state, with the author failing to specify the municipality where the specimens were collected (the sole location reference being "AC Highway Km 22"). As a result, the county for this observation is labeled as NA.
We have incorporated a chronological table in Table 3, which presents the scientific data utilized in compiling the dataset, organized by municipality, author, and species names.
Phlebotominae sand flies (Diptera, Psychodidae) are of significant medical importance due to their ability to transmit diseases such as leishmaniases, bartonellosis, and certain arboviruses. In the Americas, a total of 547 sand fly species have been documented, with the majority being found in tropical regions. Among these areas, the Amazon region stands out for its exceptional diversity and abundance of these insects. Within this region, the state of Acre has been identified as particularly rich in phlebotomine species, with recent reports detailing new records and the description of previously unknown species.
The initial study conducted by Martins and Silva (1964) focused on the sand fly fauna in Rio Branco, identifying 30 species, with Pintomyia nevesi (Damasceno & Arouck, 1956) as the dominant species. Subsequent research in the early 1980s by Arias and Freitas expanded the scope to include Cruzeiro do Sul, Feijó, and Rio Branco, revealing 50 species, with Trichophoromyia auraensis (Mangabeira, 1942) as the most prevalent. Azevedo et al. (late 2000s) further investigated in Rio Branco, Bujari, and Xapuri, highlighting Nyssomyia whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho, 1939), Ny. antunesi (Coutinho, 1939), and Th. auraensis as predominant species. Silva-Nunes et al. (late 2000s) found a similar prevalence of Ny. whitmani and Ny. antunesi in rural areas of Acrelândia. Comparable findings were observed in peri-urban and forest regions of Rio Branco. In Assis Brasil, 67 species were documented, including three new records for Acre: Evandromyia georgii (Freitas & Barret 2002), Lutzomyia evangelistai Martins & Fraiha 1971, and Psychodopygus complexus (Mangabeira, 1941), with Trichophoromyia spp. (Th. auraensis / Th. ruifreitasi) and Ps. davisi (Root, 1934) being the most abundant, both associated with Leishmania braziliensis Vianna 1911 and L. guyanensis Floch, 1954 through molecular techniques. Notably, two new species were described in Assis Brasil: Lutzomyia naiffi Teles et al. 2013 and Th. ruifreitasi Oliveira et al. 2015, with the female of the latter being indistinguishable from several others in the Trichophoromyia genus. Recent studies in Assis Brazil have also unveiled new records of sand fly species.
Recent studies conducted on the Brazilian-Bolivian border, specifically in the municipalities of Brasiléia and Xapuri, have shed light on the abundance and variety of sand fly species present in the region. Among these species, Ny. shawi (Fraiha, Ward & Ready, 1981) and Trichophoromyia sp. were identified as the most prevalent, with evidence of Leishmania DNA infection. Furthermore, these investigations revealed a wide array of vector species, captured both in domestic settings and forested areas. Of particular significance in this area was the discovery of a new species and the revalidation of certain taxonomic classifications.
The state of Acre is recognized as a hotspot for American tegumentary leishmaniasis in the Amazon region, affecting individuals of all genders and age groups. However, there has been a noticeable increase in notifications among women and children, indicating the presence of different transmission cycles in the area. In terms of the parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania found in human cases in this region, all species of the subgenus Viannia have been identified, except for L. lindenbergi Silveira, Ishikawa & de Souza, 2002, and L. amazonensis from the subgenus Leishmania, as reported in previous studies [12, 20, 21].
The state of Acre, located in the northern region of Brazil, encompasses approximately 1.92% of the country's territory. With a population of around 900,000 inhabitants, its economy primarily relies on the extraction of forest resources, notably rubber and Brazilian chestnuts for export. Acre boasts a tropical forest vegetation and experiences a humid, hot equatorial climate. The average annual temperature in the region is 31.5 °C, with an annual rainfall of 2100 mm [22].
Geographically, the state is divided into two meso-regions known as Juruá and Acre Valley, each further subdivided into five micro-regions. These micro-regions include Rio Branco, Sena Madureira, and Brasiléia within the Acre Valley, and Cruzeiro do Sul and Tarauacá within the Juruá Valley [22].
Two preserved sand fly specimens were included in the Dataset, having been captured using CDC/Shannon traps. Following capture, the insects underwent screening, separation, and proper identification along with noting the capture location. The insects were clarified utilizing the method outlined by Forattini (1973) [23]. Post-clarification, the specimens were mounted between a slide and cover slip in Enece medium (Cerqueira, 1943) [24] and identified in accordance with Galati [2].
To conduct a comprehensive review of the literature, the researchers utilized various online databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, SciELO, and BVS - Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde. The search terms employed were "Acre" AND ("sand fly" OR "sandfly" OR "sandflies" OR “sand flies” OR “Phlebotominae”), with the requirement that the term "Acre" must be present while the others could appear in any of the specified variations. Additionally, bibliographic references cited in scientific articles were consulted as supplementary data sources for this study.
All scientific articles and books were evaluated to gather data on 32 standardized variables of Darwin Core Terms (Darwin Core, 2022) as outlined in Table 1. These variables were categorized into four types to delineate the Dataset, providing crucial details on specimen condition and quantity, capture location and methods, as well as taxonomic status for each observation (Table 1).
Data collection was conducted and verified with the assistance of additional bibliographical references (Galati EAB. Phlebotominae (Diptera, Psychodidae): Classification, Morphology and Terminology of Adults and Identification of American Taxa. In: Rangel EF, Shaw JJ, editors. Brazilian Sand Flies: Biology, Taxonomy, Medical Importance and Control [Internet]. Cham: Springer International Publishing; 2018).
The names were verified by seasoned taxonomists.
We have compiled the most comprehensive scientific data on sand flies in Acre, Brazil that has been published to date. This dataset serves as a crucial source of information regarding the distribution, identification, and taxonomic status of the sand fly species documented in the state. Consequently, it will enable forthcoming studies to establish a solid foundation for research on sand fly ecology, epidemiology, and taxonomy in the region.
