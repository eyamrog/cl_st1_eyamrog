This study aimed to identify articles focusing on the role of dentists in administering the Oral Rapid HIV Test (ORHT). The search was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019, scouring databases such as PubMed, Cochrane, Lilacs, and Scopus for English language articles published between 2015 and 2019. Initially yielding 89 references, the list was refined by eliminating duplicates and irrelevant articles, resulting in 11 articles for detailed analysis. Among these, five articles discussed the direct clinical involvement of dentists in administering the test, while the remaining articles centered on research related to the oral rapid test. The findings underscored the significant contribution dentists can make to public health by aiding in the identification of individuals infected with HIV.
Over the past four decades, the global prevalence of HIV and AIDS has underscored the significant and enduring public health implications of these infections.
Every day, seven thousand individuals worldwide contract HIV. Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of this epidemic, with 60% of those living with HIV residing in this region, of which 58% are women. The Caribbean, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia have a prevalence ratio of 1% of the population, with certain areas within these regions significantly impacted by the HIV epidemic.
According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, the number of individuals living with HIV/AIDS in Latin America reached 1.9 million in 2018. There was a 7% increase in the number of new cases between 2010 and 2018, indicating Latin America's significant challenges in combating HIV, with an estimated 100,000 individuals acquiring HIV during this period. Chile experienced the highest increase at 34%, followed by Bolivia at 22%, and Brazil and Costa Rica both at 21%. In Brazil, between 2007 and June 2018, the Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação (Sinan) reported 247,795 cases of HIV infection.
Identifying individuals who are infected with HIV but have not yet shown clinical symptoms of AIDS poses a significant challenge. Projections suggest that by 2030, the mortality rate associated with the disease will decrease by 80%, accompanied by a rise in the number of diagnosed infections receiving prompt treatment.
An alternative for early HIV diagnosis and preventive treatment, the Oral Fluid Test or Oral Rapid HIV Test (ORHT) was developed in 2006. Originally designed to cater to individuals encountering barriers to laboratory access and testing, as well as those seeking to maintain privacy and identity, it provided an alternative to conventional blood collection tests and needle-based rapid tests. Over time, it has become more widely available through health services and even commercial outlets.
In 2005, Regulation No. 34/05 was implemented in Brazil to regulate the use of rapid anti-HIV tests in specific situations. This legislation aimed to enhance access to HIV infection diagnosis, citing the importance of knowing serological status and early diagnosis in breaking the transmission chain. The nationwide expansion began with the implementation of Regulation No. 29 on December 17, 2013. The test involves collecting oral fluid from the upper and lower buccal gingival sulcus four times with gentle friction. It boasts a 99% accuracy rate for positive results with an immunological window of up to three months, the period between potential infection and a positive test result, which should be repeated after another three months of potential exposure to HIV contagion if necessary.
In Brazil, starting from 2017, the ORHT has been regulated by Anvisa and is utilized within the Unified Health System (SUS). HIV testing can be conducted at various facilities including Centers for Testing and Advice (CTA), Basic Health Units (UBS), specialized services for sexually transmissible diseases, and hospitals. Rapid tests can be performed through venous puncture or oral fluid samples to detect HIV antibodies. Self-tests have been available for purchase in private pharmacies and through the SUS network since January 2019, allowing individuals to conduct the test themselves either through a blood collection using a lancet provided in the kit or an oral fluid test, which is non-invasive and painless. These tests are user-friendly and provide quick results, enabling individuals to initiate treatment available through the public health network upon confirmation of a positive result. Both tests yield results in approximately 20 minutes, and in cases of a negative result, retesting after 30 days is recommended. Positive results should be confirmed at a healthcare facility.
The Department of Surveillance, Prevention, and Control of Sexually Transmissible Diseases, HIV/AIDS, and Viral Hepatitis provides remote training on Oral Rapid HIV Testing (ORHT) through instructional videos supplied by the Ministry of Health. Dental surgeons are among the professionals eligible to participate in this training and perform ORHT, given their crucial role as prevention agents in this context.
In the United States, dental assistants are trained to administer the OraQuick Rapid HIV Test (ORHT) and to identify individuals who are unaware of their serological status. This is due to their expertise in HIV knowledge and their proficiency in welcoming and assisting individuals who are seeking HIV testing services.
A research project conducted with dental surgeons in the USA in 2010 and 2011 revealed that most of them viewed the dentist's office as a suitable location for HIV testing, considering it a strategic approach to combat the HIV epidemic. However, they identified several barriers hindering the implementation of this initiative in dental practices, including cost implications, the stigma surrounding the disease, the professionals' lack of experience in such activities, and their insufficient skills to handle positive test results. Despite these challenges, the dental surgeons acknowledged the significant value of offering HIV testing to the population.
Dentists in Australia are aware that 14% of individuals living with HIV, both domestically and internationally, are unaware of their serological status. Dental surgeons can play a crucial role in reducing this percentage, primarily through the implementation of Oral Rapid HIV Testing (ORHT) for populations lacking access to regular infection monitoring.
In an initial review of the literature concerning the involvement of dental surgeons in Oral Health Teams (ORHT), no national studies were identified. Consequently, the primary aim of this study is to investigate and analyze the current status of dental surgeons in relation to ORHT as documented in scientific literature.
This integrative review study focuses on exploring the literature concerning the involvement of dental surgeons in the implementation of Oral Health Therapy (OHT) for HIV patients. A comprehensive online search was conducted to identify relevant scientific articles published in English between 2015 and 2019.
The following databases were accessed between October 2018 and August 2019: a) PubMed/MEDLINE, a comprehensive source of multidisciplinary biomedical literature indexing articles from global journals; b) LILACS (Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde), a database housing technical-scientific literature in the health domain and serving as a repository for scientific output from Latin America and the Caribbean; c) Scopus, a database of peer-reviewed data equipped with tools for tracking, analyzing, and visualizing bibliographic research, featuring abstracts and interoperability with various other databases offering full-text access; and d) Cochrane Library, a compilation of databases containing high-quality independent evidence to inform decision-making in the health sector.
The search was conducted in two stages. In Stage 1, Health Terminology was employed after consulting the Descriptors in Health Sciences (DeCS), utilizing the descriptors Routine Diagnostic Tests, Diagnostic Reagent Kits, and HIV. However, no articles corresponding to these descriptors were identified, prompting a second stage search using the keywords "oral rapid test" and "HIV". Stage 2 involved a more detailed search conducted automatically through the information source PubMed, as outlined in Table 2, providing insights into the indexing bases and strategies utilized.
The selected articles have been visually represented through a flowchart (see Figure 1). The identification process led to the selection of a total of 11 articles, denoted by capital letters from A to K.
A spreadsheet was created using Excel to organize the identified publications. Initially, repetitions were removed as an exclusion criterion, followed by a review of titles and abstracts to select articles of particular interest. Articles not aligned with the main theme or outside the specified timeframe were then excluded. Inclusion criteria focused on articles related to the primary theme, specifically those involving dentists and dental clinics utilizing ORHT, presented in full and in English. The spreadsheet included details such as article title, database source, study country, objectives, study design, dentist's clinical involvement in ORHT application, results, and final conclusions. The methodology employed in each article was determined based on the study design.
The studies highlighted in the review demonstrate that the Occupational Health Risk Assessment (ORHT) is conducted in both private offices, clinics, and public services across multiple countries (references 14, 16, 21-26).
Users of dental clinics generally agree that the Oral Rapid HIV Test (ORHT) is both easy to administer and practical for HIV testing in these settings. The close relationship between dental surgeons and their patients, coupled with the privacy of the clinic environment, facilitates the discussion and implementation of ORHT. A study conducted by Alves Rezende et al. in 2015 highlighted the significance of empathy in healthcare promotion, directly correlating with improved treatment outcomes.
For the LGBTQ+ community and their allies, the dental clinic serves as a suitable and confidential setting for testing, ensuring respect for gender identity. Two studies, conducted in American clinics, highlight that dental surgeons are willing to assist in administering the ORHT to individuals unaware of their serological status and at risk of HIV. These professionals acknowledge the significance of oral hygiene practices in facilitating and conducting the ORHT effectively.
In a study funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the USA, Bradley et al. (22) acknowledge that dental clinics present significant opportunities for administering oral rapid HIV tests and engaging in discussions about HIV prevention, particularly in communities with a high prevalence of HIV. The research involved 600 patients with a median age of 43 years, with 85% of them consenting to undergo the ORHT, of which 14% had never previously been tested. Interestingly, among those who declined the test, many expressed comfort in discussing HIV prevention with their dentists. Notably, the study identified 119 patients who engaged in unprotected sexual activities with either a seropositive partner or individuals of unknown serostatus.
The Orthodontic Research and Health Technology (ORHT) is currently being utilized in both dental schools and dental clinics to facilitate the study and practical application of this diagnostic technique. Research conducted in China and the USA suggests that dental schools play a crucial role in instilling new values within the dental sector, potentially enhancing preventive measures. These institutions serve as ideal environments for the integration of such technologies into future practices, addressing existing barriers and biases to streamline the educational process. By doing so, they play a pivotal role in advancing public health initiatives.
The research conducted by Shifu et al. (21) in dental clinics in China revealed that dentists diagnosed oral diseases by considering initial symptoms associated with AIDS, including oral candidiasis, herpes zoster, herpes simplex, oral bacterial or fungal infections, and recurrent mouth ulcers. Subsequently, treatment was administered following the completion of these diagnostic tests.
Since 2006, dental clinics have been recognized as suitable venues for conducting Oral Rapid HIV Testing (ORHT) in the United States. A study conducted in a dental clinic in Kansas City, Missouri, catering to a diverse population, offered the test free of charge during routine dental visits. Patients exhibited positive attitudes towards the test, particularly when no additional fees were incurred alongside their treatment. Reasons for declining the test often stemmed from prior testing experiences elsewhere and a perceived low risk of HIV. Overall, patients acknowledged the dental office as a feasible setting for ORHT and a means to learn about their serological status.
In the research conducted by Suarez-Durall et al. (24), it was observed that 60.2% of the individuals studied did not comply with the scheduled rapid test, citing undisclosed reasons. Within the same study, four potential undiagnosed infections were detected using a structured algorithm. The initial screening revealed a 0.31% incidence rate of HIV seropositivity, highlighting the significance of dental clinics in identifying individuals with previously undiagnosed HIV. Additionally, the study by Moreschi et al. (32) indicated a level of concern among dental practitioners regarding the risk of accidents involving sharp and cutting instruments and the potential for infection.
One challenge in implementing the TRO is the apprehension and bias expressed by some dentists towards incorporating ORHT alongside dental procedures in their clinics, particularly when faced with a positive HIV diagnosis. Despite over three decades since the onset of the HIV epidemic, prevalent reasons for this reluctance include a dearth of knowledge, inadequate training to manage infections, unsuitable healthcare facility setups, uncertainty, and concerns about potential transmission risks.
Discrimination and prejudice within the dental profession can impede dentists' adherence to treating oral health issues, directly impacting the quality of life for seropositive patients. Dentists who undergo continuous training through Permanent Education and possess experience in managing dental care for HIV-positive individuals are more equipped to effectively address the needs of this patient population.
The study conducted by Bradley et al.22 in southern Florida raises concerns regarding the financial implications of implementing the ORHT, particularly due to its unavailability in the public sector. The burden of this cost falls on the dental clinic, ultimately transferring it to the client, thereby creating a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of ORHT in clinics. Research by Davide et al.26 indicates that a substantial portion of patients (72.2%) in New York City were willing to undergo HIV testing at a dental hygiene clinic, with over 30% agreeing to testing in a dental setting if there were no extra charges involved.
Dental professionals, in collaboration with public health experts, can enhance the implementation of HIV testing by participating in training programs that enhance their knowledge and willingness to treat patients with HIV. This collaboration can facilitate the utilization of Oral Rapid HIV Tests (ORHT) and potentially lead to reimbursement for these tests, thereby promoting their widespread use and application in dental settings.
The same article also addresses the notion that in addition to financial benefits, professionals may experience an increase in their workloads.
Siegel et al. (35) suggest that a cultural shift, starting within dental schools, may be necessary to actively involve dentists in primary prevention and the HIV screening process using oral rapid tests. In this qualitative study, 174 professionals participated, with only 40 dentists responding to the questionnaires, indicating concerns about the time required for HIV testing not being adequately compensated financially. They noted that conducting the test could prolong patient chair time, potentially impacting their productivity negatively. Conversely, some colleagues viewed HIV testing as a valuable service they wanted to provide, regardless of compensation levels. Additionally, participants observed a general resistance among dentists towards taking on new responsibilities.
Feinstein-Winitzer et al. (36) identified the odontological setting as an optimal environment for conducting preventive HIV exams, despite the challenges faced by healthcare professionals in terms of reimbursement from insurance companies. While preventive exams like those for oral cancer were assured reimbursement, the same was not true for the oral rapid HIV test administered during dental procedures. The obstacles to reimbursement included a scarcity of trained personnel to conduct the test, limited evidence of its effectiveness, concerns regarding the financial viability within dental practices, and insufficient training for test providers, all of which hindered the integration of the test in dental offices.
Parish and Santella (28) conducted a study in collaboration with a dental association, selecting dentists as participants to investigate the application of the oral rapid test (ORHT) on the attitudes and behaviors of the LGBTQ+ population. The study aimed to explore the relationship between the ORHT and oral health within this demographic group.
In Brazil, the utilization of the Oral Health Risk Assessment Tool (ORHT) remains uncommon within private dental practices. Nevertheless, counseling is routinely conducted within public health services by multidisciplinary teams. An instance of this is when a dentist addresses the challenges associated with a potential positive outcome from an HIV test.
The most recent studies on the ORHT theme in Brazil were conducted in the 2000s, with no subsequent updates. Telles-Dias et al.'s study on injectable drug users demonstrated the effectiveness of rapid tests, particularly oral tests, due to their painless nature, reliability, and ability to help users determine their serological status promptly, enabling them to initiate appropriate treatment if they test positive.
In Brazil, it has been observed that dental surgeons continue to harbor fear and prejudice towards individuals with HIV/AIDS, which consequently impedes their willingness to provide care to such patients. There remains a notable deficiency in their understanding of the disease's progression, treatment modalities, and preventive measures. Furthermore, there is a concerning inconsistency in the utilization of personal protective equipment among these professionals, which is crucial for safeguarding against potential contamination during their clinical practices.
Strategies for involving dental surgeons in HIV prevention have been identified in Fortaleza, where a collaborative effort between the Oral Health Department of the Municipal Bureau of Health and the Coordination of Viral Hepatitis and STD/AIDS was implemented. This initiative aimed to enhance the knowledge of dental professionals and their care for individuals living with HIV/AIDS. A study detailing this endeavor revealed that professionals felt ill-equipped to cater to this demographic, citing reasons such as insufficient information and training, inadequate infrastructure at health facilities, feelings of insecurity, and fear of contagion. The authors suggest that altering this mindset requires enhancing facility infrastructure, providing ongoing education, emphasizing biosecurity concepts, and humanizing healthcare practices to combat the stigma associated with AIDS and ensure proper oral health treatment.
Rocha et al. (37) highlight the limited involvement of dentists in Oral Rapid HIV Testing (ORHT) due to their perceived lack of readiness to cater to user needs, leading to the delegation of testing responsibilities to the nursing team. The research underscores the absence of rapid testing within the purview of the health team, underscoring concerns regarding risk management and emotional support in handling seropositive outcomes.
In Brazil, the Code of Dental Ethics, specifically article two, mandates that dentists must practice their profession in a manner that prioritizes the health of individuals, communities, and the environment without any form of discrimination.
Continuous education and humanization in dentistry enable a more comprehensive approach to clinical care for individuals living with HIV, ensuring the practice of the profession is free from bias, stigma, and undue stress.
It is hoped that the diagnosis of AIDS would not result in excessive caution or behavioral changes in the dentist-patient relationship, given that biosecurity protocols train professionals to ensure the physical well-being of both individuals. This study revealed that the stigma associated with AIDS caused 55% of participants to deny their seropositive status to safeguard the integrity and efficacy of dental treatment. Patients noted a shift in the quality of care after disclosing their seropositive status, likely attributed to a lack of information on the part of the professional (20%) and fear of HIV transmission (7%).
Dentists play a crucial role in HIV diagnosis due to their provision of oral health care to individuals who may not regularly visit healthcare facilities, as well as their ability to administer oral rapid tests with ease and confidence. This contributes significantly to the reach and effectiveness of dental surgeons in combating the spread of HIV.
VanDevanter et al. (42) conducted a qualitative study on patient attitudes towards HIV testing in a dental office. The study revealed that patients displayed a high level of acceptance towards the test, citing its accessibility, ease of use, and overall approval. Despite its potential for widespread testing and annual reach to millions through rapid kits, which fall outside the typical scope of dental practice, the integration of HIV screening remains limited among dentists and academic dental centers.
Technological and scientific advancements have significantly enhanced the ease of application and reliability of rapid tests, particularly those designed for detecting HIV infection. These tests typically detect the response to HIV antigens present in oral secretions or total blood. In May 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sanctioned the first at-home in vitro test kit for diagnosing HIV (both HIV-1 and HIV-2) using oral fluid, known as OraQuick® In-Home, developed by OraSure Technologies. This oral test involves swabbing the gum fluid for samples and employs ELISA screening for analysis. However, there have been instances of false negative results in acute cases and when tests are not administered by adequately trained individuals. Reactive tests necessitate confirmation of their outcomes, as is standard practice in all diagnostic examinations. Over the past 25 years, HIV testing protocols have significantly evolved and expanded, driven by advancements in technology, the evolving nature of the epidemic, and the increasing acceptance of testing among individuals living with HIV.
Hutchinson et al. (43) have emphasized the potential of implementing routine HIV testing in dental settings to effectively reduce HIV infection rates. Practical limitations, including financial considerations, can be addressed in light of the significant benefits to both clients and healthcare professionals. Those with comprehensive knowledge of HIV are likely to contribute to enhancing community health outcomes.
According to Pollack et al. (15), diagnosing HIV is crucial for public health. Recent recommendations provide guidance on incorporating HIV testing into routine healthcare practices across all settings, including the use of oral tests that can be self-administered at home. Health services offer significant benefits for HIV diagnosis by providing patients with a welcoming environment, education, and general support. Dental health professionals play a pivotal role in HIV diagnosis, given their regular interactions with individuals who may not frequently visit traditional healthcare facilities but regularly access dental services. Therefore, the use of oral rapid HIV tests is deemed suitable for implementation in dental offices (Pollack et al., 15).
While barriers, such as dentists' reluctance to provide screening and their perceptions of patient acceptance, must be acknowledged, it is crucial to assess these attitudes prior to implementation to prevent them from hindering progress.
Pollack, Metsch, and Abe (48) revealed that 70% of individuals at risk of HIV infection had visited a dentist in the preceding two years. Routine testing offers significant personal, professional, and social advantages and has the potential to lead to substantial decreases in HIV transmission.
The utilization of HIV screening through oral fluids has been recognized as advantageous for patients, dentists, and the broader public health landscape. Overcoming obstacles to the widespread adoption of this testing method can be effectively addressed through comprehensive training initiatives and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations.
The literature review revealed the involvement of dental surgeons with the ORHT, highlighting ongoing initiatives in Brazil's public health services within a multi-professional framework. These efforts could be further extended to enhance outreach by incorporating the application of ORHT in dental offices and clinics, thereby increasing dentist participation in these activities.
The dental office offers a conducive environment for this purpose, given its focus on healthcare. A well-trained dentist can redefine the behavioral paradigms of both HIV-positive and negative patients, thereby facilitating the implementation of the Oral Health Related to HIV/AIDS (ORHT) approach. Through accurate diagnoses that honor each patient's unique characteristics and the essential follow-up care provided, the dentist can effectively lower comorbidity rates associated with AIDS.
The dental surgeon plays a crucial role in the implementation of ORHT in dental offices and clinics, with the 90-90-90 target in mind. This initiative not only expands treatment options but also significantly contributes to public health by enabling early diagnosis and treatment, ultimately enhancing longevity and improving the quality of life for individuals living with HIV-related infections.
