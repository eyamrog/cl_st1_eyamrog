The effectiveness of Social Distancing Strategies (SDS) in garnering public support in São Paulo State and Brazil has become increasingly crucial. However, the delayed processing of PCR tests and the limited availability of testing resources have significantly hindered the ability of health authorities to provide accurate data on the number of COVID-19 cases and related fatalities. This limitation underscores the importance of finding alternative methods to demonstrate the impact of SDS on controlling the spread of the virus and ultimately gaining public trust and compliance.
Methodology: In this study, we employ a time series analysis focusing on deaths attributed to COVID-19, with reference to the actual date of death rather than the date of test result confirmation.
Results: Our study illustrates that the Social Distancing Strategies (SDS) implemented in São Paulo City and State have significantly contributed to slowing down the progression of COVID-19 cases. Through the utilization of time series analysis, we have been able to discern distinct patterns in various regions, enabling more focused and tailored interventions. Furthermore, employing a death-centric time series approach has allowed us to pinpoint the impact of the SDS in São Paulo City, particularly in conjunction with the Social Isolation Index (SII) enforced at the state level. This methodology has facilitated a rough estimation of the SII's effectiveness in curbing the spread of the virus.
In conclusion, employing a time series analysis of COVID-19-related deaths aligned with the date of occurrence offers a more comprehensive insight into the impact of social distancing measures on the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak in São Paulo State, Brazil.
Social Distancing Strategies (SDS) are recognized as effective tools for controlling the spread of pandemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. Countries such as China, Italy, Spain, various European nations, New York State, and others have successfully implemented SDS. This article focuses on analyzing indicators that illustrate the effectiveness of the SDS implemented in São Paulo State, Brazil, since March 16th. The data indicates that these strategies have resulted in saved lives and prevented the state's health system from becoming overwhelmed by the epidemic. However, recent data from the end of April suggests that the number of cases is on the rise, potentially due to a decrease in population adherence to SDS.
The challenge in evaluating the efficacy of the SDS implemented in São Paulo lies in the limited number of tests conducted in the state, with only 91,552 PCR test kits supplied by the Brazilian Ministry of Health until May 1st, 20206. Instituto Butantan, the entity overseeing testing in the state, reported 35,600 PCR tests conducted on April 22nd7. With a population of 42 million in the state, this equates to 85 tests per 100,000 individuals; on a national scale, Brazil ranks 133rd among countries testing for COVID-198. Furthermore, there was a significant delay between sample collection and result acquisition during the initial phase of the outbreak. Notably, Brazilian authorities, in their daily updates, disclose the number of COVID-19 cases and fatalities based on the date of test result receipt, rather than the onset of symptoms or date of death.
In this study, we employ a time-series analysis focusing on deaths linked to COVID-19, with each death being correlated to the actual date of occurrence rather than the date when the COVID-19 test results were finalized. The dataset utilized is sourced from the Civil Registry in Brazil, and our analysis reveals a noteworthy reduction in the number of deaths in São Paulo State due to Social Distancing Strategies (SDS). Furthermore, we calculate the decrease in mortality rates attributed to SDS and determine the level of social distancing required to effectively curb the transmission of the disease.
To evaluate the impact of Social Distancing Measures (SDS) in São Paulo City and State on the daily progression of COVID-19 related fatalities, we utilized public data sourced from the National Association of Registrars for Natural Persons (Associação dos Registradores de Pessoas Naturais — ARPEN), an entity that represents all Public Notaries in Brazil. The ARPEN website provides information on the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19, correlated with the date of occurrence. In Brazil, Public Notaries are legally mandated to issue and maintain records of vital events such as births, deaths, marriages, and other legal occurrences. A death certificate, an official document, includes a section where a qualified physician specifies the cause of death. Additionally, ARPEN's platform offers data on suspected COVID-19 related deaths, as determined by a certified medical professional. The designation "Confirmed COVID-19 deaths" is assigned to cases where a PCR test yielded a positive result for COVID-19, while "Suspected COVID-19 deaths" refers to instances where COVID-19 is cited as a cause of death based on clinical diagnosis.
Some uncertainty arises due to COVID-19 being a novel disease with limited availability of biochemical tests, potentially leading to deaths being erroneously attributed to other causes besides COVID-19 in certain instances. Adhering to the guidelines set forth by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, our approach involved incorporating deaths directly linked to COVID-19 (both suspected and confirmed cases) along with the surplus deaths associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2020 compared to 2019, as indicated by the ARPEN data. This calculation involved subtracting the total number of deaths in 2019 from those in 2020, which we established as a baseline for our analysis in this article.
To ensure consistency and enhance visual clarity, each data point in the study represents a five-day average: encompassing two days prior to the displayed date, the specific data point, and two subsequent days.
Figure 1 illustrates the daily death toll in São Paulo State, Brazil, ascribed to COVID-19, encompassing suspected and confirmed cases, alongside the daily deaths attributed to SARS.
Three distinct trends can be observed in the data presented in Figure 1, depicting the number of daily deaths attributed to COVID-19. Initially, there is a sharp increase in recorded fatalities from March 17th to April 5th, with an average rate of approximately 5.2 deaths per day. Subsequently, a period of stabilization is noted until April 19th, followed by a second surge in numbers. The analysis is confined to April 27th due to a presumed 14-day lag between the occurrence of a death and the finalization of data on the website. It is important to note that more recent data beyond this date was not included in our study at the time of completion.
It is hypothesized that the sudden shift in the upward trajectory noted around April 5th may be linked to the implementation of Social Distancing protocols in São Paulo State from March 16th to March 22nd. During this timeframe, official mandates were put in place, requiring remote work arrangements and the closure of non-essential businesses and educational facilities across the state. The approximately 17-day lag aligns with existing data indicating a delay of 17.8 days, on average, between symptom onset and mortality as an endpoint.
The contrast between the evolutionary trends depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2 is notable. Figure 2, based on daily data provided by the Ministry of Health and the State Secretary of Health, is referenced to the date of test results rather than the date of death, as previously mentioned. It is crucial to bear in mind that the configuration of the plot in Figure 2 is influenced by:
The mortality rate at a specific date can be determined by analyzing the number of deaths recorded.
The quantity of tests conducted;
The time lapse between conducting the tests and receiving the results is a critical factor that warrants attention.
The time evolution depicted in Figure 1 differs significantly from that shown in Figure 2. Specifically, the total number of deaths reported in Figure 2 is 1,825, whereas in Figure 1, which is based on death certificates, the total number stands at 3,293.
Further insights into the disease's evolution can be gleaned through the disaggregation of data.
Figure 3 illustrates the progression of daily death tolls in São Paulo City. The sharp incline observed until April 5th indicates a daily increase of 3.1 deaths. Similar to the trend observed in the state's population, there is a plateau in cases post-April 5th. However, the subsequent rise in cases after April 19th is less pronounced in this context.
In the case of São Paulo State, excluding São Paulo City, the evolution is depicted in Figure 4. There is a notable steep increase in the figures until April 5th, with a rate of 2.1 deaths per day (which is two thirds of the value observed for São Paulo City). Subsequently, there is a period of flattening until April 18th, after which a new rising stage emerges.
The evolution of daily death tolls in Brazil exhibits a distinct pattern, as illustrated in Figure 5. While there is a noticeable flattening trend in São Paulo State (Figure 1) and São Paulo City (Figure 3), this plateau is considerably shorter when considering the entire country of Brazil, lasting only three to four days before the curve resumes an upward trajectory (Figure 5).
The data presented above illustrates that SDS has the potential to alter the trajectory of disease spread. Furthermore, the significance of timestamping events in relation to their occurrence is highlighted by the data. It is evident that considering events in real-time is crucial for comprehending the temporal dynamics, providing insights into disease propagation rather than solely focusing on testing speed or announcement timing, which is particularly pertinent to the approach taken by Brazilian authorities in managing and predicting data trends.
Consider, for instance, the distinct behaviors depicted in Figures 3, 4, and 5, underscoring the significance of localized data for devising strategies to combat the pandemic. While the Social Distancing Strategy (SDS) in São Paulo City appears to yield positive outcomes in disease containment, the efficacy of the approach in São Paulo State appears comparatively weaker, with data from Brazil painting a bleaker picture. In São Paulo City, the SDS led to a stabilization (or even a slight decrease) in the number of deaths between April 7th and April 20th, albeit with a slight uptick post-April 21st (Figure 3).
The ability to track the spread of the disease over time, even with some delay, is crucial for gaining a deeper understanding of how to analyze, develop, and implement strategies to combat the epidemic. In the case of São Paulo City, Table 1 presents data on the spread of the disease in terms of additional deaths per day, along with the corresponding social distancing index measured 15 days prior. This data allows for a rough estimation of the SDI value that could potentially slow down the spread of the disease. It is observed that an SDI between 52% and 56% marks a critical threshold: an SDI of 56% results in a decrease of 0.40 deaths per day, while an SDI of 52% leads to an increase of 0.82 deaths per day. Prior to March 16th, during the normal-life period, the disease progressed at a rate of 3.18 deaths per day. However, it is important to interpret these estimated values cautiously, as the spread of the disease is influenced by various factors beyond the SDI. The specific relationship between the SDI and the transmission rate of the virus remains unclear, and similar SDI values may yield different transmission rates in diverse environments, such as those with varying temperature, humidity, population density, and mask usage.
In the context of São Paulo State, the control over the spread of the disease appears to be more challenging, as illustrated in Figure 4. With the exception of São Paulo City, an overview of the state is detailed in Table 2. In this instance, we have omitted the SDI value, as averaging an index across the 645 distinct municipalities, each with varying populations and social characteristics, would not yield meaningful insights. It is noteworthy that between April 6th and April 19th, the number of municipalities reporting at least one COVID-19 related death surged from 33 to 91. This surge suggests that the spread of the disease likely involved inter-city or inter-regional transmission in numerous instances, especially considering the absence of a lockdown policy in Brazil until May 11th. Consequently, the local SDS's significance, as measured by the SDI, appears diminished during this period.
To garner public support for the necessary measures in Social Distancing Strategies (SDS), it is crucial to showcase the effectiveness of the strategy. Utilizing data linked to the date of death, as depicted in Figure 1 or Figure 3, proves to be more impactful in illustrating success compared to data tied to the date of test results (Figure 3).
Utilizing a time series analysis aligned with the date of death rather than the date of COVID-19 testing, our study illustrated the effectiveness of the Social Distancing Strategy implemented in São Paulo State in significantly curbing the number of infections. This impact was particularly pronounced in São Paulo City, where the transmission rate of COVID-19 notably decreased, particularly during the period from April 5th to April 20th.
An approximate calculation based on data from São Paulo City suggests that a Social Distancing Index exceeding 55%, as defined and recommended by the State Government, could potentially lower the mortality rate.
When comparing the data for São Paulo City to that from other regions of the state, distinct trends in the spread of the disease were observed, highlighting the necessity of localized data to establish specific targets for the SDI.
A limitation in our approach, particularly for prompt decision-making, is the delay between death and the issuance of the Death Certificate, which can extend up to 15 days before being filed in the Civil Registry database. Utilizing the available time series data, which correlates the number of deaths with the date of death, we aimed to underscore the significance of referencing deaths to their actual occurrence. We suggest that authorities consider utilizing primary data that specifies the cause of death and directly references it to the date of occurrence, rather than linking it to the availability of PCR test results. Our argument does not advocate for the use of ARPEN data for policy-making; rather, we employed it to showcase that referencing deaths to their actual dates can provide valuable insights into the disease's progression and the efficacy of control measures. Presenting information on COVID-19-related deaths based on test result dates appears to distort reality and needlessly obstruct the advancement of knowledge regarding the disease's spread in Brazil.
