The research conducted in the Núcleo Curucutu, Parque Estadual Serra do Mar, São Paulo State, Brazil, focuses on a taxonomic survey. This study includes an identification key, morphological descriptions, illustrations, geographic distribution, and phenology. Within the study area, the order Zingiberales is represented by four species belonging to three families: Goeppertia monophylla (Vell.) Borchs. & S.Suárez (Marantaceae), Heliconia farinosa Raddi (Heliconiaceae), Hedychium coccineum Buch.-Ham. ex Sm., and Renealmia petasites Gagnep. (Zingiberaceae).
Zingiberales, an order of tropical plants within monocotyledons, comprises eight families: Cannaceae Juss., with one genus and 10 species; Costaceae Nakai, encompassing six genera and 143 species; Heliconiaceae Nakai, consisting of one genus and 200 species; Lowiaceae Ridl., with one genus and 20 species; Marantaceae R. Br., including 31 genera and 550 species; Musaceae Juss., with three genera and 91 species; Strelitziaceae Hutch., comprising three genera and seven species; and Zingiberaceae Martinov, with 56 genera and 1,600 species, totaling 102 genera and 2,621 species (Stevens, 2017).
Seven of these families have been identified in Brazil, with one being introduced (Musaceae); encompassing 31 genera and 319 species, 131 of which are endemic. São Paulo specifically hosts seven families, 20 genera, and 65 species, as documented by various researchers (André 2020a, b, c, Almeida & Antar 2020, Braga 2020, Ferreira 2020, Saka et al. 2020).
These plants vary in size from a few centimeters to up to 10 meters in height. They are characterized by a rhizomatous stem that typically stores starch, the presence of a pseudostem rather than a true stem, parallel-pinnate leaf venation, and terminal or basal inflorescences usually surrounded by colored bracts. Their flowers are complete and bisexual, with the exception of Musaceae which may have unisexual flowers, featuring 1-6 fertile stamens and 1-5 sterile stamens that resemble petals (staminodes). The ovary is inferior with three locules, each potentially containing one or more ovules. The fruits of these plants can be fleshy or dried, with seeds typically possessing an aryl (Costa et al., 2011).
From an economic perspective, the order presents a variety of species with different types of significance. For instance, Musa paradisiaca L. (banana tree) yields parthenocarpic fruits that are edible (Souza & Lorenzi, 2005), while Zingiber officinale Roscoe (ginger) is utilized in the production of beverages and confectionery (Elpo & Negrelle, 2004). Additionally, there are species like Goeppertia ornata (Lem.) Borchs. & Suárez (pin-stripe calathea) known for their aesthetically pleasing leaves (Vieira et al., 2012), Heliconia bihai (L.) L. (firebird), Canna indica L. (canna lily), and Strelitzia reginae Banks (bird-of-paradise flower) recognized for their striking inflorescences (Lorenzi & Souza, 2001; Souza & Lorenzi, 2005; Castro et al., 2011). Lastly, there are species like Curcuma longa L. (turmeric) that hold medicinal value, particularly in the treatment of respiratory ailments (Santiago et al., 2015).
The current study is a component of the Flora study of the Núcleo Curucutu, a significant yet relatively obscure region within São Paulo City (Garcia & Pirani, 2005). This research collaboration was conducted in conjunction with the Universidade Santo Amaro and the Herbarium PMSP. Additionally, investigations focusing on monocots, specifically Iridaceae (Takeuchi et al., 2008) and Orchidaceae (Rosa & Affonso, 2009), were also undertaken within this region.
In order to enhance the taxonomic study of Zingiberales in the Núcleo Curucutu, comprehensive collections, identifications, descriptions, an identification key, illustrations, and data on the geographic and phenological distribution of the species were conducted. This effort significantly contributes to the understanding of the local flora, the State of São Paulo, and the Atlantic Forest ecosystem.
The Núcleo Curucutu, situated at coordinates 23°59'09.7"S and 46°44'32.5"W, was established in 1977 alongside the Parque Estadual Serra do Mar. It encompasses the municipalities of São Paulo, Itanhaém, Mongaguá, and Juquitiba, with its roots tracing back to the Fazenda Curucutu, a coal producer. The State acquired the property in 1958 and converted it into a Forest Reserve (Bellato & Mendes, 2002; PESM, 2021a).
The area is characterized by predominantly fields and high-altitude forests, covering a total expanse of 37,512 hectares. The altitude in this region reaches up to 870 meters, with a temperate climate featuring hot and rainy summers and milder winters, as documented by Bellato and Mendes (2002), Garcia and Pirani (2003), and Infraestrutura e Meio Ambiente (2021).
From its inception, one of the primary goals of the Núcleo has been the conservation of springs and water sources in the metropolitan region of São Paulo, focusing on the Capivari and Embu Guaçu rivers, as well as the Mambu/Rio Branco system in Itanhaém. In terms of ecosystem services, the Núcleo plays a crucial role in various aspects, including the regulation of air and climate quality, the protection of hills, slopes, and soils, and the preservation of biodiversity, among other important functions (PESM 2021a, b).
The specimens utilized in this study originate from the plateau sector and are housed in the scientific collection of Universidade Santo Amaro and the Herbarium PMSP. Field collections were conducted in February 2018 and November 2020, corresponding to the duration of this research. Herborization procedures adhered to the methodology outlined by Fidalgo & Bononi (1989).
For the analysis and identification of the samples, we consulted specialized literature including works by Maas (1977), Santos (1978), Forzza & Wanderley (1999), Catharino (2002), Kamer & Maas (2003), Souza et al. (2007), Wongsuwan & Picheansoonthon (2011), Vieira et al. (2012), and Saka (2016). Additionally, we utilized the Zingiberales collections of the PMSP, SPF, and SPSF, along with virtual herbariums such as BHCB, CEPEC, E, FURB, HUFU, IBGE, ICN, JBRJ, K, MBM, NY, P/PC, R, RB, UPCB, and S (acronyms as per Thiers, continuously updated).
The flowering and fruiting data were acquired by analyzing the exsiccates, field observations, and literature. The morphological terms adhered to the descriptions provided in Gonçalves & Lorenzi (2011). The illustrations were meticulously hand-drawn with the assistance of a stereomicroscope and finalized by the illustrator Klei Rodrigo de Sousa.
In the Núcleo Curucutu, four species from the Zingiberales order, representing three distinct families, were identified: Goeppertia monophylla (Vell.) Borchs. & S.Suárez (Marantaceae), Heliconia farinosa Raddi (Heliconiaceae), Hedychium coccineum Buch.-Ham. ex Sm., and Renealmia petasites Gagnep. (Zingiberaceae).
The herbaceous plant grows to a height of 1-1.5 meters, characterized by leaves with sheaths measuring 21-37 cm in length, pubescent with denser trichomes along the margin and sericeous at the base. The leaves lack a ligule, with a petiole of 13-18 cm in length that is puberulous, and a pulvinus measuring 2-5 cm in length that is glabrous. The blade is elliptic, 37-60 x 12-22 cm in size, with an acute to acuminate apex and a slightly attenuated to acute base, puberulous on the abaxial face. The terminal inflorescence is simple, 6-10 x 2-4.5 cm in size, ellipsoid and green, with the internode below the last leaf being oblong or not. The peduncle is 19-45.5 cm long and minutely pubescent, with the basic component of the inflorescence consisting of 5 pairs of flowers. The bracts are 2-3 x 2-3 cm, monomorphic, obovate or widely obovate, with an erect, rounded apex that is sometimes emarginate and has a slightly wavy margin, turning from green to dark brown at the apex. The prophyll is approximately 1.8 x 0.4 cm, elliptic to ovate, 2-3-carenate, with membranous carenes and sparse puberulous, while the interphyll is about 1.5 x 0.3 cm, elliptic to ovate, concave, membranous, and sparsely puberulous. The bracteole is around 1.8 x 0.4 cm, one per flower, asymmetrical, lanceolate, carenate, glabrous, with a darker apex. The flowers are approximately 3 cm long, grayish-white or pale-yellow, with an elliptic-lanceolate calyx measuring 1.8-2 x 0.4 cm, concave, and with tiny trichomes on the abaxial surface, longer than the corolla tube. The corolla tube is 2 cm long, with lobes measuring 0.8-1.1 cm long and elliptic in shape, lacking a labellum. The external staminode is 0.7-0.8 cm long, obovate, with an emarginate apex, while the stamen has a lateral petaloid appendix of about 0.4 x 0.2 cm, an anther measuring 0.2 cm long, a white style of 0.8-1 cm in length, and a stigma of 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The ovary is globose, approximately 0.3 x 0.2 cm, puberulous and grayish-white, with one ovule per locule. The capsule is bi-trilocular, pink, measuring 0.8-1.5 x 0.7-1 cm, while the seeds are yellow, 0.7 x 0.4 cm in size, with a white aril.
Goeppertia monophylla, an endemic plant species in Brazil, is primarily located within the Atlantic Forest across various states including Bahia, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul (Saka et al., 2020). Within the Núcleo Curucutu region, this species predominantly thrives in humid, shaded habitats near watercourses.
In the study area, the plant blossoms from December to March and produces fruit in February. Forzza and Wanderley (1999) noted that beyond the Núcleo Curucutu, the species blooms consistently throughout the year, although there is a lack of recorded data on fruiting patterns.
Throughout this research, there were limited fruiting records observed for the species. Specifically, the fruits of G. monophylla were only observed once and were found in a small number of individuals. The scarcity of fruiting records could potentially be attributed to challenges in collection methods, as the fruits typically mature within bracts that undergo a blackening process, making them difficult to visually identify.
The materials collected from Rio de Janeiro (J.M.A. Braga 7416 and F.A. Silva 103) indicated flowering in February and fruiting from February to March, coinciding with our observations in the study area. It is plausible that the species' reproductive processes are more pronounced during the hottest period of the year.
Goeppertia monophylla demonstrates the ability to establish extensive populations, surpassing 30 individuals, as noted by Saka (2016). This phenomenon was observed within the Núcleo Curucutu. Saka (2016) further describes the species as potentially bearing flowers in shades of purple, grayish-white, and pale-yellow, with particular focus on the latter two hues in the context of this study.
When the species is preserved in 70º alcohol or herborized, both in its vegetative and reproductive states, it undergoes a blackening process. This transformation is crucial as it facilitates the collection of accurate descriptive data regarding the plant's color in its natural habitat.
Goeppertia monophylla and G. fatimae (H.Kenn. & J.M.A.Braga) Borchs. & S.Suárez exhibit striking morphological similarities, differing primarily in the distribution of hair on the peduncle. Specifically, G. monophylla displays a minimally pubescent peduncle, whereas G. fatimae features a hirsute one, as noted by Saka in 2016.
It is distinguishable from all species within the order Zingiberales located in the Núcleo Curucutu due to its distinctive pulvinus, the green hue of its inflorescence, and the existence of flowers displaying grayish-white or pale-yellow tones.
Among the native species examined in this study, G. monophylla stands out as the sole species that has never been listed as a threatened species. It holds a conservation status of "Least Concerned," as indicated by CNCFlora (2012a).
A robust herb reaching 2-3 meters in height, characterized by distichous, glabrous leaves numbering 4-6 per pseudostem, lacking a ligule, with petioles measuring 1.13-1.36 meters in length and absent pulvinus. The blade, ranging from 47.5-67.5 x 18-27 cm, features an acute to acuminate apex, obtuse base, mostly lacerated, asymmetric shape, with a prominent central vein on the abaxial surface and canaliculated on the adaxial surface, displaying a green color on both sides. The terminal inflorescence stands erect at 22.4-34 cm in length, with a red rachis, thyrsoid cincinnate arrangement, glabrous, and an apparent internode measuring 1-4 cm. The 6-10 distichous bracts are internally green, yellow, and red, externally red, transitioning to yellowish and slightly greenish at the apex, boat-shaped, showy, persistent, with an acuminate apex and slightly auriculate base, the lower ones being generally more foliose, fertile or sterile, with the first fertile basal bracts measuring 12-16 x 2-3 cm at the base and narrowing towards the apex. The flowers are arranged in a fascicle at the internal base of the bracts, with only part of the perianth visible, pedicellate, 6-16 in the lower fascicle decreasing towards the apex, featuring white bracteoles that are slightly greenish or reddish, oval-lanceolate, glabrous, with a marked median vein, measuring 2-2.3 x 1-1.5 cm at the base, and glabrous pedicels measuring 0.8-1 cm in length, larger in the fruits. The bent perianth, measuring 4-4.5 cm in length, consists of boat-shaped sepals that are glabrous, with the upper ones free up to the base and the lower ones connate, appearing green-yellowish or yellow, lacking a labellum. The staminode is lanceolate, measuring 0.8-1.2 x 0.1-0.2 cm at the base, with an acuminate apex, while the stamen features a partially exserted anther, measuring 1.1-1.4 cm when mature, cream-colored when new, with a 2.8-3.5 cm long white filament, a 3.5-4.5 cm long angulose cream-colored style, and a 0.1 x 0.1 cm stigma. The ovary, approximately 1 x 0.5 cm, is glabrous and white-greenish, with one ovule per locule. The drupe measures 1.5-2 x 1-1.3 cm, slightly triangular, glabrous, and dark blue when mature, containing 3 seeds measuring 0.8-1 x 0.4-0.8 cm, brown-greenish in color, and lacking an aril.
Endemic species in Brazil are predominantly located within the ombrophilous regions of the Atlantic Forest, specifically in the States of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul (Braga, 2020). The specimens collected were observed within a secluded population, thriving in moist soil near watercourses and sheltered by dense tree vegetation.
In the Núcleo Curucutu, H. farinosa blooms from December to February and bears fruit from January to March. According to Catharino (2002), the species blooms between April and December and bears fruit between May and August. Additionally, there are records of flowering in January and fruiting in September as documented by Andersson (1530) and H.V.M. Gomes (23).
The specimens from Núcleo Curucutu exhibit tricolor bracts, displaying shades of red, yellow, and green. The occurrence of three distinct colors in the bracts is seldom documented, with limited references in both literature and exsiccates descriptions. It is noteworthy that in numerous instances, only the dominant red color is documented, overlooking the presence of a secondary color in the analysis.
According to Simão & Scatena (2004), the bracts of the material collected from Núcleo Picinguaba exhibit a red-orange coloration both internally and externally, distinguishing them from the material examined in this study despite their shared origin. These findings suggest that the species likely displays bracts that are either bicolor or tricolor, with the latter being less common.
Among the Heliconia species found in the State of São Paulo, H. farinosa bears resemblance to H. subulata Ruiz & Pav., but can be distinguished by its elliptical or oblong blade, fertile basal bract, and elliptical bracteole, whereas H. farinosa is characterized by elliptical blades, foliate basal bract (fertile or sterile), and oval-lanceolate bracteole (Braga, 2020). This particular species stands out from other Zingiberales in the Núcleo Curucutu due to its boat-shaped bracts and predominantly lacerated leaves.
The species is currently classified as "Least Concern" according to CNCFlora (2012b). However, due to its dwindling presence outside of protected areas, its registration in the Núcleo Curucutu offers a glimmer of hope for the species' survival (Braga 2008).
The pseudostem measures 1.2-2 meters in height. The leaves have sheaths with 2-3 bladeless sheaths; the ligule is oblong, measuring 1.3-2.5 x 0.9-1.5 cm, with an obtuse to shallowly bilobed or acute apex, green with a brownish margin. There is an absence of petiole and pulvinus, with the blade being oblong, measuring 33-47 x 2.5-4.5 cm, with an acuminate apex, cuneate base, glabrous upper surface, and pubescent lower surface. The terminal inflorescence is erect, 10-21 cm long, and hairy, with a peduncle measuring 10-15 cm long and also hairy. The bracts are lax, measuring 2.5-3.9 x 0.7-1.7 cm, folded, oblong, with an obtuse-acute apex, hairy, and green, each subtending a cincinnus of 3-6 flowers. The tubular bracteoles consist of the first bracteole measuring approximately 1.6 x 1 cm, with an acute apex, hairy, and greenish; the second bracteole measuring about 1.2 x 0.5 cm, with an acute apex, membranous, hairy, and greenish; and the third bracteole measuring around 1 x 0.4 cm, membranous, hairy, and greenish. The flowers are orange, with a tubular calyx measuring 2-2.7 x 0.5-0.7 cm, 2-dented apex, and hairy surface. The corolla tube is slender, measuring 2.8-3.2 x 0.2-0.3 cm, 3-lobed, with linear lobes measuring 2.9-3.2 x 0.3-0.4 cm. The labellum is suborbicular, measuring 2.2-2.4 x 1.8-2 cm, 2-lobed, with an attenuate base measuring 0.7-1 cm long, and a deeply divided apex measuring 0.9-1.2 cm long. The lateral staminodes are oblanceolate, measuring 2.2-2.4 x 0.5-0.7 cm, with an attenuate base measuring 0.7-1 x 0.3-0.4 cm. The anther is dorsifixed, measuring 0.8-1 x 0.3 cm, red; the filament is 4.5-5.2 cm long, red; the stigma is approximately 0.1 cm wide, densely ciliate, and green; the epigynous glands are slender, measuring 0.3-0.4 x 0.2 cm; the ovary is 0.3-0.5 x 0.3-0.4 cm, 3-loculed, pubescent, and orange, with multiple ovules per locule. Fruits were not observed.
Hedychium coccineum, the sole species of Zingiberales present in Núcleo Curucutu and cultivated in Brazil, originally hails from Asian countries like Bhutan, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand (Wongsuwan & Picheansoonthon 2011). In Brazil, this species can be found in regions such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina, with a potential presence in Pernambuco (André 2020c). Records also indicate its occurrence in Distrito Federal and Rio Grande do Sul (Pereira B.A.S. 163 and Baptista L. 673).
In the study area, flowers were observed in the species from February to March. Despite being monitored for a duration of two years, no fruiting events were recorded during this period.
Flowering occurrences in Brazil were documented in the Distrito Federal and Paraná in January (Pereira B.A.S. 163 and Griep I. 51), Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina in December (Baptista L. 673 and Funez L.A. 5940), and in Rio de Janeiro, it blooms and bears fruit from January to February (IRC/RCC 696 and L.C. Giordano 31). According to Wongsuwan & Picheansoonthon (2011), the species typically blooms between June and August in its native regions, with fruiting occurring from July to September.
The fruits of this plant species are uncommonly documented in both Brazilian and international herbarium collections. Within Brazil, only two specimens have been located, both housed at the Herbarium RB. As for foreign collections, only specimens from the P/PC and E herbariums have been identified to contain fruits.
Gao et al. (2012) highlighted that H. coccineum is pollinated by three species of Lepidoptera (Butterflies) that are not found in Brazil. Furthermore, despite being a self-compatible species, spontaneous self-pollination was not observed.
Hedychium coccineum and H. gardnerianum Sheph. ex Ker Gawl. can be easily mistaken for each other when observed in a herborized state due to their similar yellowish to brownish flowers. However, distinguishing between the two species is possible based on specific characteristics. For instance, H. coccineum typically has a blade width ranging from 2.5 to 4.5 cm, while H. gardnerianum's blade width falls between 4 and 12 cm. Additionally, the shape of the labellum serves as a distinguishing feature, with H. coccineum having a deeply divided labellum and H. gardnerianum displaying an apex division. These distinctions are supported by references such as P. Feliz 178, Souza V.C. 2145, and S.L. Marçon 43.
In the study area, Hedychium coccineum can be differentiated from other species in the Zingiberales by its distinctive characteristics, including sessile leaves, 2-3 sheaths lacking blades, and an orange terminal inflorescence. This plant species is specifically located in a secluded population that experiences high solar exposure.
The pseudostem reaches a height of 1-2 meters, characterized by leaves with striated sheaths and a truncated ligule measuring 0.1-0.25 cm in length, appearing brown. The leaves are subsessile, lacking a pulvinus, with a narrowly elliptic blade ranging from 13 to 54.4 cm in length and 3.5 to 12.5 cm in width, featuring an acuminate apex, cuneate base, and being glabrous on both surfaces. The basal raceme inflorescence emerges in aphyllous scapes measuring 3-7.2 x 3.5-8.5 cm, with the scape itself extending from 8.5 to 37.4 cm in length, displaying a pink hue. The flowers exhibit pink pedicels measuring 0.5-1.5 cm, accompanied by narrowly elliptic-obovate bracts ranging from 1.5 to 8 cm in length and 1-2.5 cm in width, also pink in color. The bracteole measures 1.5-2.3 x 1-1.5 cm, while the calyx appears pinkish-red at 1-2 x 1-1.9 cm. The corolla tube measures 0.6-1.4 cm, with lobes narrowly elliptic and 0.8-1.1 cm long, 3-lobed, and white. The labellum, also 3-lobed, exhibits a slightly pink target, with a pubescent base measuring 0.6-1.2 cm in length, featuring involute rounded lateral lobes and an entire or bilobulate middle lobe measuring 1-1.5 cm. The linear lateral staminodes are approximately 0.3 cm long, with a claw of about 0.1 cm in length, an anther measuring 0.6-0.8 x 0.3-0.4 cm, a filament of around 0.2 cm, a red style measuring 1.7-2 cm, and a cordiform, puberulous, red stigma measuring 0.2-0.3 cm wide. Nectaries are approximately 0.3 x 0.3 cm, the ovary measures 1-1.3 x 0.5-0.7 cm, appearing glabrous and red, with multiple ovules per locule. The capsule ranges from 1-2 x 1.2-2 cm, initially dark red and turning black upon maturation. Seeds are 0.3-0.5 cm long, bright brown, with an orange aril.
Renealmia petasites, an endemic plant species in Brazil, is primarily found in the Atlantic Forest, spanning across the states of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, and Santa Catarina as documented by André in 2020. Additionally, its presence in Bahia has been confirmed through recorded sightings by L.A. Mattos Silva 3673, M.M.M. Lopes 312, and D. Cardoso 1668.
In the Núcleo Curucutu, flowering occurred in the species from August to May, with fruiting observed between March and September. Beyond the study area, flowering was documented from August to December, with fruiting occurring from October to February. Kamer & Maas (2003) reported flowering taking place throughout the year.
The fruits of R. petasites were meticulously examined both in the field and laboratory settings. It was noted that the seeds were released when they reached a state of extreme maturity, with the opening process commencing at the base and progressing towards the apex.
Renealmia petasites closely resembles R. chrysotricha Petersen, with subtle distinctions. The former is characterized by a leaf blade width of 4-13 cm, a shorter calyx measuring 1-2 cm, a larger pedicel spanning 0.5-1.5 cm, a white labellum tinged with pink, and around 50 seeds per fruit. In contrast, R. chrysotricha features a leaf blade width of 4.5-9.5 cm, a longer calyx ranging from 1.8-2.5 cm, a smaller pedicel measuring 0.2-0.6 cm, a completely white labellum, and up to 25 seeds per fruit (Maas 1977, Lima et al. 2018).
Maas (1977) highlighted the considerable variability of R. petasites as a species, noting significant differences in inflorescence size based on the collection site. This variability becomes evident when comparing specimens from the study area to those from other locations. Specimens from the study area exhibited scapes ranging from 8.5 to 37.4 cm in length and inflorescences measuring between 3 and 7.2 cm, relatively small in comparison to specimens from other locations where scapes could reach up to 50 cm in length and inflorescences up to 30 cm long (as documented by H. Mosén 2966, Reitz & Klein 4027, and L.A Mattos Silva 3673).
Another notable characteristic observed was the more compact and globular inflorescence of the specimens from Núcleo Curucutu, contrasting with the more lax inflorescence of those analyzed from other locations such as Bahia (referenced as L.A. Mattos Silva 3673), Rio de Janeiro (referenced as R. Mello-Silva 1230), and Santa Catarina (referenced as Reitz & Klein 4027).
Renealmia petasites stands out among other Zingiberales species in the Núcleo Curucutu due to its unique characteristics of subsessile leaves and diminutive staminodes. The scarcity of this species is evident as only four adult specimens were located, making it the least populous species along the surveyed trails.
The species was deemed extinct in Minas Gerais as a result of the lack of collections over a 30-year period, leading to its removal from the list in 2008 (Diário do Executivo 1997, Diário do Executivo 2008). Subsequently, in 2012, it was reclassified as "Least Concern" (CNCFlora 2012c).
In São Paulo, the species did not face a critical situation as observed in Minas Gerais. However, since it is part of a species found within a Conservation Unit in the state, it consistently maintains a status of "Least Concern."
We express our gratitude to the team at Núcleo Curucutu for their invaluable support during the collections, to Instituto Florestal for granting permission for the execution of this project, and to the curators of the herbariums visited, namely Ricardo José Francischetti Garcia (PMSP), João Batista Baitello (SPSF), and Renato de Mello-Silva in memoriam (SPF). Special thanks to Pedro Resende (UnB) for his meticulous English review and to Universidade Santo Amaro for their unwavering assistance throughout this endeavor.
