The research article aimed to identify and categorize information related to COVID-19 and eye care based on the level of evidence across four key areas: the presence of the virus in tears and on the ocular surface, potential infection through the conjunctival route, ocular manifestations, and best practice recommendations. A comprehensive review was conducted across various databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, LILACS, SciELO, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Quality assessments were performed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence worksheet. From the search, a total of 1018 items were initially identified, with 26 records meeting the criteria for qualitative synthesis. These records comprised 6 literature reviews, 10 case series or cross-sectional studies, 4 case reports, and 6 intervention descriptions. Within the Oxford CBME methodology grading system, 65% of the records were classified as level 5, with the remainder falling under level 4. The current evidence on COVID-19 and ophthalmology is limited, which is expected given the circumstances. Controversies exist regarding the presence of viral particles in tears and the conjunctiva, as well as the potential for conjunctival transmission. Ocular manifestations are infrequent and may resemble viral infections of the ocular surface. Recommendations are largely based on strategies employed by Asian countries during previous coronavirus outbreaks, highlighting the need for further studies to evaluate these strategies in the context of SARS-CoV-2. In the interim, caution should be exercised in implementing these measures, considering the unique circumstances of each country, and regular evaluations should be conducted.
The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been associated with ophthalmology since its inception. Dr. Li Wenliang, a Chinese ophthalmologist, raised concerns about a SARS-like outbreak in Wuhan and its potential connection to a local market on December 30, 2019, through the social network WeChat. Subsequently, on January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially recognized the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern, and on March 11, 2020, it was declared a pandemic.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to cause infections in humans and other mammals. They gained public attention during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in East Asia in 2003 and the spread of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA virus. The main method of transmission is human-to-human through direct contact and droplets; transmission from asymptomatic carriers has also been reported. Viral stability in aerosols on different surfaces has been demonstrated, supporting evidence on indirect viral acquisition from fomites, through the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes. At present, conjunctival transmission of CoVs has not been confirmed and remains controversial.
Among the seven types of human coronaviruses (HCoV), HCoV-NL63 stands out as the sole virus known to cause ocular disease, specifically conjunctivitis. However, the pathogenic mechanism behind ocular infection remains unclear. Notably, ocular symptoms have not been reported in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, despite their similarities in respiratory manifestations to SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, during the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV RNA was detected in tears of three out of 36 patients with SARS, although subsequent studies were unable to replicate these findings.
Reports on SARS-CoV-2 conjunctival transmission, viral shedding through tears, and ocular manifestations in COVID-19 patients have surfaced in recent literature. As the current pandemic evolves, there is a growing demand for reliable information to support evidence-based recommendations. However, the rush to produce scientific findings and positive outcomes can inadvertently result in the dissemination of poorly substantiated evidence, potentially inundating the public with uncertain or false information. This review aims to consolidate the existing knowledge on COVID-19 and eye care, categorizing it into four primary areas of interest: the presence of the virus in tears and on the ocular surface, potential infection through the conjunctival route, ocular manifestations, and recommended best practices.
A search strategy was devised utilizing MeSH terms and free-text terms across various databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, LILACS, Scielo, and the Cochrane Library. Additionally, a verification search was conducted on Google Scholar to locate relevant articles pertaining to archival services such as bioRxiv, medRxiv, and other related platforms.
The search strategy was meticulously crafted to pinpoint studies that offer insights into the intersection of COVID-19 and ophthalmology. The final search was executed on April 21st. Table 1 delineates the keywords integrated into the search strategy, encompassing terms such as "ophthal*," "ocular," "vision," "visual," "eye," "conjunctiv*," and "tear," in conjunction with terms like "COVID-19," "COVID19," "2019-nCoV," "coronavirus," "coronavirus19," "coronavirus-19," "SARS-CoV-2," "severe acute respiratory syndrome 2," and "SARS2." Additionally, we meticulously combed through the reference lists of the identified screened publications.
The study's results were confined to publications released in 2020 due to the Chinese authorities' report to the WHO being submitted on December 31, 2019. There were no language restrictions imposed, and all types of publications were gathered. For articles not in English, Spanish, Portuguese, or French, translation was conducted using three distinct online platforms: Google Translator速, DocTranslator速, and DeepL速. All selected articles had a minimum of an abstract accessible in English, and any duplicates were removed from the analysis.
Two reviewers autonomously extracted data utilizing a predefined template in a Microsoft速 Excel spreadsheet. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion or with the involvement of a third reviewer. For all articles necessitating an online platform translation, three reviewers conducted the assessment.
The appropriateness of the publications was assessed using previously validated methods, including the CARE guidelines checklists for case reports and case series, as well as the STROBE checklists for observational studies. A narrative approach was employed to synthesize the extracted data, while quality assessments were conducted using the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2011 Levels of Evidence worksheet. The risk-of-bias assessment utilized a qualitative approach, which considered factors such as study design, methodological limitations, and the rigor of execution.
During the selection phase, it was observed that the identified articles were predominantly authored by a limited number of individuals. To ascertain the extent of their influence in the field, a reference list was compiled to quantify the number of citations attributed to each author in relation to the topic under investigation.
Ethics approval was deemed unnecessary for this review, given that it solely utilized publicly available data. The study adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (23).
A total of 1018 records were retrieved from databases, with an additional ten identified through referencing. Following screening based on title and/or abstract, 918 records were excluded. Duplicates and grey literature were subsequently eliminated, resulting in 80 records that satisfied the eligibility criteria. Among these, correspondence and editorials comprised 43 records (54%), which were further evaluated and subsequently excluded.
A comprehensive evaluation was conducted to determine the eligibility of the remaining documents. Upon further analysis, three publications were excluded as they were identified as opinion pieces, four due to incoherent translation, and three others for focusing on topics beyond the scope of this review. Additionally, one case report was omitted for not meeting the CARE checklist guidelines. Ultimately, 26 records were deemed suitable for qualitative synthesis, comprising 6 literature reviews, 10 case series or cross-sectional studies, 4 case reports, and 6 intervention descriptions categorized as miscellaneous (Figure 1).
The studies are displayed in tabular format in Table 2, offering details on the author, journal, study type, primary question, and supplementary comments. Among the 26 records, 17 (65%) were classified as level 5 according to the Oxford CBME methodology grading system, with the remaining falling under level 4.
The six reviews examined various topics: 1) the ocular involvement of coronaviruses in humans and animals(6), 2) variations in ocular manifestations(24), 3) preventive strategies in hospital-based ophthalmology departments(25), 4) recommendations for contact lens practices(26), 5) suggestions for eye care facilities(27), and 6) evidence of ocular manifestations and PCR positivity in COVID-19 patients(28). Among the ten case-series or cross-sectional studies, findings related to ocular manifestations were reported, with six studies focusing on conjunctival and tear samples tested for viral material. Nine studies were conducted in China, while one was carried out in Singapore. Additionally, four case reports provided detailed descriptions of ocular manifestations in COVID-19 patients. The six intervention descriptions offered recommendations for ophthalmology departments and healthcare workers (HCW) to reduce the risk of transmission. Three of these interventions were sourced from Chinese literature and included recommendations from the Society of Public Health Ophthalmology and the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association. The remaining three papers were authored by individuals from India, Iran, and Italy, with the publication from India incorporating recommendations from the All India Ophthalmological Society.
The publications under scrutiny are characterized by a purely descriptive nature, leading to a notable lack of internal validity and a heightened risk of bias. Through qualitative assessment, it was discerned that numerous confounders and covariates were present, potentially exerting an influence on the outcomes and, by extension, the ultimate analyses conducted.
Eight case series or cross-sectional studies and four case reports included testing for the presence of viral particles or genetic material from SARS-CoV-2. Ten studies collected samples using conjunctival swabs and performed reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the detection of viral RNA. One cross-sectional study utilized tears collected via Schirmer strip and conducted viral isolation through Vero-6 cell inoculation. Another study employed conjunctival swabs for RT-PCR and Vero-6 cell inoculation. The four case reports observed positive results for RT-PCR of conjunctival swabs; one of them reported on a patient with repetitive positive conjunctival swabs from day 3 to 21 with samples taken almost daily. The results are summarized in Table 3.
In all the aforementioned studies, the proportion of patients exhibiting viral particles in tears or conjunctiva consistently remained at a low level, ranging from 0 to 7.14%. Variations were observed across studies in terms of testing methodologies and the demographic characteristics of the patients under examination. Furthermore, there was notable diversity in the timing of sample collection, with reports indicating samples being taken as early as day 2 following the initial onset of symptoms. Notably, four studies did not specify the precise timing of sample collection. Case reports highlighted a total of five instances where ocular manifestations were observed, with all cases testing positive through conjunctival RT-PCR.
In their review, Sarma et al. conducted a meta-analysis of pooled patients from five studies, with four items included in the current revision and one discarded during the screening process. Their conclusion indicated that the proportion of conjunctival/tear samples testing positive for the virus was 1.95% (95% confidence interval: 0.74 to 4.11).
Seah et al.'s literature review highlights the parallels between SARS-CoV-2 and other Coronaviruses, suggesting the potential for viral shedding in the conjunctiva and tears. Yu A et al. discuss the confirmed aerosol generation via air puff tonometry and the potential for transmission through conjunctival contact. Both studies ultimately assert that the information regarding the presence of the virus in tears and on the ocular surface is still a subject of debate and uncertainty.
Several anecdotal reports have highlighted non-specific ocular symptoms as the initial indication of COVID-19. Among these reports, a case study documented keratoconjunctivitis as the primary presentation. Furthermore, Li et al. detailed two instances of healthcare workers (HCWs) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in both nasopharyngeal (NP) and conjunctival swabs, despite adhering to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols, except for eye protection. The first case involved an anesthesiologist who conducted an intubation procedure on a COVID-19 patient without eye protection, subsequently experiencing red eye and viscous conjunctival discharge before developing respiratory symptoms and receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis three days later. The second case involved a nurse exhibiting respiratory symptoms, pruritus, and conjunctival congestion. Both cases lend support to the hypothesis that the conjunctival mucosa may serve as an entry point for the virus.
The ten case series or cross-sectional studies reported ocular manifestations, particularly conjunctival congestion. Four case reports presented signs compatible with follicular conjunctivitis and one with unilateral keratoconjunctivitis. The timing of onset of ocular manifestations varies across the studies, with these symptoms appearing most prominently in the early stages of the disease. Most manifestations are bilateral and appear to cause minimal discomfort. Only the study by Chen et al. focuses on patient-reported ocular symptoms, while the remaining case series concentrate on observable signs. The results are summarized in Table 4.
Ocular manifestations in COVID-19 patients are generally uncommon. Among the case series reviewed, six studies indicate that less than 5% of patients exhibit any ocular signs, with two studies reporting no manifestations at all. However, Wu et al. present findings from hospitalized patients with moderate to severe pneumonia, revealing that 31.6% of these patients displayed ocular signs. Furthermore, their analysis suggests that patients with ocular symptoms were more prone to experiencing severe manifestations of the disease, as indicated by univariate analysis.
The timing of ocular manifestations during the evolution of COVID-19 remains unclear. Six studies have documented ocular findings in eight patients occurring before day 5 of the disease. A case report highlights conjunctival congestion becoming more prominent from day 8 onwards. Another study details a patient experiencing ocular symptoms between days 8 and 12, characterized by congestion and tearing. Additionally, a series of cases describes manifestations occurring on average from day 7 to day 25. Two studies do not specify the onset of ocular manifestations, while the remaining studies report no ocular findings.
Sarma et al. conducted a meta-analysis pooling data from six studies (five items were included in the current revision, with one being discarded during the screening process) to investigate ocular manifestations. Their analysis revealed that the proportion of patients presenting with conjunctivitis or red eye was 3.17% (95% confidence interval 1.16 to 6.13) (28).
Nine articles outline strategies that can be implemented within ophthalmology departments and practices to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among these, three are literature reviews (25-27), while the remaining six present intervention protocols with limited levels of evidence (41-46).
In the four intervention descriptions provided by Chinese authors, recommendations are founded on general strategies structured around a three-level hierarchy system utilized in mainland China and Hong Kong: administrative control measures, environmental control measures, and the utilization of personal protective equipment (refer to Table 5).
The review conducted by Lyndon et al. presents evidence regarding contact lens practices, ultimately concluding that asymptomatic contact lens wearers should not discontinue the use of contact lenses as there is no indication of an elevated risk of contracting COVID-19. Furthermore, the review highlights that there is no evidence to support the notion that wearing prescription glasses offers protection against SARS-CoV-2.
Among the screened records, 47% cited the case series conducted by Xia et al. (5), where only 1 out of 30 patients exhibited positive RT-PCR results in conjunctival secretions (1.3%), making it the most frequently cited source. Additionally, 40% of the records referenced a letter authored by Lu et al., which proposed the hypothesis of transmission through the conjunctiva (47). The remaining documents that were screened were cited at an average rate of 3%.
Current recommendations regarding COVID-19 and ophthalmology are primarily based on levels of evidence 4 and 5 as per the Oxford CBME methodology grading system. The limited amount of research conducted thus far is attributed to the challenging circumstances posed by the nature of the disease and the scarcity of cases with ocular involvement. As the pandemic progresses, the necessity for additional data to enhance our comprehension of COVID-19, its implications for eye care, and the effectiveness of implemented strategies will become increasingly apparent. In a minority of patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the tear film, with reported positive findings ranging from 0 to 7.14% across various studies. Sarma et al. specifically noted the presence of the virus in 1.95% of samples (95% C.I. 0.74 to 4.11). Several potential reasons have been proposed to explain the absence of viral particles on the ocular surface, including test sensitivity, timing of sample collection, antimicrobial properties of the conjunctiva, collection techniques, and the potential washing away of viral particles by tears, leading them to pass to the nasopharynx through the lacrimal duct.
The reviewed publications exhibited significant methodological heterogeneity. Firstly, the timing of sample collection, measured from the onset of symptoms, ranged from 2 to 18 days on average, with some studies failing to specify this crucial detail. Secondly, the number of samples obtained varied not only between studies but also within them; for instance, some studies, like case reports, conducted only a single test, while others conducted up to four. Lastly, the methodologies for sample collection and processing predominantly involved conjunctival swabbing and RT-PCR, although one study utilized Schirmer strips for tear collection and two studies additionally conducted viral isolation via cell culture. Consequently, data pooling was considered inappropriate. Given the current lack of conclusive evidence, the potential presence of viral particles in tears and the conjunctiva cannot be definitively ruled out, underscoring the importance of maintaining precautionary measures until further research sheds more light on the subject.
Possible conjunctival transmission is primarily supported by anecdotal reports of healthcare workers (HCWs) who did not utilize eye protection, early conjunctival congestion symptoms in some patients, or the detection of viral RNA in the tear film. Various theoretical transmission mechanisms have been postulated. Firstly, the virus may adhere to ACE2 receptors present on the conjunctival and corneal epithelia. Secondly, the nasolacrimal duct could act as a conduit from the conjunctiva to the upper respiratory tract, facilitating viral infection. Nonetheless, some scholars argue that the existing evidence is insufficient to confirm the conjunctival route of transmission and present counterarguments: a) the ACE2 protein levels in the conjunctiva are lower compared to the lungs; b) lactoferrin and secretory IgA in tears might eliminate the virus; and c) the presence of the virus in tears could be attributed to fomites reaching the conjunctiva through splashed droplets or direct contact with contaminated hands. Qiao et al. documented an overall COVID-19 incidence of 2.52% (95% CI: 1.68-3.63%) among eye professionals in 10 hospitals, with a similar disease incidence observed in ophthalmologists and general practitioners. Despite the absence of confirmed conjunctival transmission, the authors align with the recommendations of the WHO and other organizations, advocating for the inclusion of eye protection, such as goggles or face shields, in personal protective equipment (PPE).
A wide array of non-specific ocular manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been documented; however, a distinct characteristic presentation remains elusive. The most frequently observed ocular manifestations include conjunctival hyperemia and watery discharge. Notably, the presentation varies, as evidenced by Cheema et al.'s report of a patient with keratoconjunctivitis. Methodologies employed in these reports also exhibit significant diversity, exemplified by the differing approaches of Wu et al. and Chen et al. Wu et al. focused on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly those in critical condition, and found that individuals with ocular manifestations tended to exhibit more severe systemic disease or abnormal blood test results. In contrast, Chen et al. gathered data through various means such as telephone interviews, face-to-face surveys, or smartphone applications. Sarma et al. suggest that conjunctivitis or red eye is present in approximately 3.17% of patients, with potential confounding factors such as the normal prevalence of dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis, as well as issues like poor hygiene or misuse of face masks. Notably, severe ocular manifestations have not been widely reported, underscoring the need for more specific observations to delineate a distinct pattern of findings.
Due to a lack of interventional studies, the recommendations found in current publications are primarily based on lower-level evidence, with many stemming from the experiences and general strategies developed during the SARS outbreak from 2002 to 2004. It is advised that administrative, environmental, and personal protective equipment (PPE) measures be promptly implemented, with a focus on safeguarding both healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients. While there is a pressing need for studies to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of these intervention measures in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, prioritizing safety precautions is currently imperative. As more robust evidence emerges, it will be crucial to continually revise and adapt these measures to effectively respond to the rapidly changing landscape.
The authors found it particularly intriguing that a significant portion of the literature they analyzed referenced an anecdotal account involving a Chinese respiratory expert who contracted COVID-19 despite wearing suitable PPE, with the exception of eye protection. This specific report was cited in 40% of the screened publications and likely served as the primary source for numerous recommendations regarding ocular protection. This instance highlights the rapid dissemination of information with limited evidential support.
This review represents the first comprehensive evaluation of the level of evidence for ophthalmology recommendations in the context of COVID-19. The review was conducted by five independent reviewers, providing a thorough analysis of the available literature. It is important to note that the study focused solely on SARS-CoV-2, potentially excluding valuable insights from previous coronavirus outbreaks. The work by Seah et al. on ocular involvement in coronavirus cases could have complemented this review. Another limitation of the study was the reliance on third-party translations for Chinese publications, which was mitigated by utilizing multiple translation platforms and involving an additional reviewer for these papers. To address publication bias, a comprehensive search strategy was employed, encompassing grey literature, editorials, opinion pieces, pre-published works, non-peer-reviewed articles, and traditional publications, without language restrictions.
The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique challenge in modern medicine due to the novel nature of the disease and the rapid dissemination of information. As research on the pandemic is still in its early stages, the limited availability of medical evaluations, randomized controlled trials, and case control studies is to be expected. In our structured review, we have organized and assessed the existing evidence and guidelines pertaining to ophthalmology in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. It is noteworthy that the quality and quantity of evidence supporting current recommendations are steadily increasing.
At present, the existing evidence does not definitively dismiss the potential presence of viral particles in tears and the conjunctiva. Several theoretical mechanisms have been posited, suggesting the conjunctiva could serve as an entry point for SARS-CoV-2. However, the debate surrounding conjunctival transmission remains contentious due to the varying levels of supporting or contradicting evidence. While ocular manifestations are not prevalent among COVID-19 patients, indications point towards similarities with viral ocular infections, characterized by hyperemia and watery discharge. The bulk of the literature available comprises anecdotal accounts, editorials, and opinion pieces with extensive cross-referencing, resulting in a predominance of low-level evidence documents. Recommendations regarding ocular involvement in COVID-19 are largely drawn from strategies employed during past CoV outbreaks in Asian nations, which are likely to persist and establish new benchmarks for preventive measures in healthcare systems. As the global situation evolves, the dissemination of reliable information will be pivotal in formulating effective recommendations to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It will be imperative to scrutinize the level of evidence in new studies and cases to accurately assess recommendations and tailor them to local contexts.
