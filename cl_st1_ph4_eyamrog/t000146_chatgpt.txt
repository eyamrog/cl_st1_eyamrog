The objective of this study is to examine the correlation between the scientific output published in a native language and its level of exposure and influence on Public and Collective Health.
Methods: This bibliometric study focused on analyzing the scientific output of the most productive countries within the SciELO Network in the field of Public and Collective Health between 2011 and 2015. Data was gathered from the SciELO Citation Index database (SciELO CI), and citations were scrutinized based on language and source.
Findings: Brazilian publications in Portuguese exhibited the highest citation impact within the same language at 55.7%, with 47.9% of impact in Portuguese and 34.4% in Spanish publications for English publications. The influence on the national language is also notable in Colombian and Spanish publications. In the case of Spain, the percentage of citations in Spanish for papers in the same language surpasses twice the impact in English. For US-American articles, 42.5% of citations are in the native language when published in English. Cuban and Peruvian publications displayed over 90% of their impact in the national language. Conversely, the USA and Brazil demonstrated a greater citation impact in other languages, particularly when publishing in Spanish.
Conclusion: The exposure of a publication language is contingent upon the scientific output of a country. For Brazilian and US-American publications, the impact on audiences in different languages can be gauged through citation impact. Additionally, the level of exposure provided by SciELO CI proves valuable for assessment, especially for publications in the native language.
The language of publication plays a crucial role in facilitating communication within the global research community, impacting the accessibility and reach of the study at hand. English, being the predominant language in scientific discourse, offers a wide audience base due to its widespread understanding among the educated populace. However, it is important to acknowledge that a considerable portion of research from Latin America is disseminated in local languages, contributing to the limited visibility of its scientific contributions. Furthermore, certain disciplines focus primarily on issues of local importance, evident in the high volume of research addressing national concerns, a lower prevalence of English-language articles, predominantly national authorship, limited international collaborations, and publication in local journals with restricted readership.
These well-known questions in the social sciences and humanities are central to the ongoing debate on effectively managing the unique characteristics of various scientific communities while also meeting the research standards expected by an international audience. The social sciences and humanities not only analyze but also engage with culture and society, making it preferable for their research outcomes to be disseminated in languages beyond English. Furthermore, this challenge is amplified in an era where science is becoming more accessible, and the societal impacts of its discoveries are increasingly evident, especially on a local scale.
In addition to the social sciences and humanities, the field of Public and Collective Health also exhibits similar national and centralized characteristics. Consequently, practitioners in this field encounter a moral quandary regarding the dissemination of crucial research findings. They must decide whether to publish in their native language to cater to the needs of the local community, including professionals, researchers, and citizens, or opt for English publication to enhance global accessibility and reach an international audience.
Previous studies have shown that the predominant language of scientific papers in the esteemed international database Web of Science is English, accounting for 95.87% of publications, with Spanish trailing at 3%. When considering European Union member countries, English remains dominant at 93%, followed by German (2.64%), French (1.71%), and Spanish (1.36%). In Latin American (LAC) countries, English publications make up 86% of the total, with Portuguese at 7.35% and Spanish at 6.77%. This data suggests that English serves as the primary language for collaboration between European Union and Latin American countries (EU-LAC), with a notable presence of Spanish publications. This trend can be attributed to Spain's significant role in scientific collaboration with Latin America and the increasing number of Spanish-language scientific journals indexed in Web of Science (WoS), particularly those from Latin American nations. The expansion of WoS coverage between 2005 and 2010, as noted by TESTA (2011), led to a surge in the number of indexed journals, with Brazil seeing an increase from 27 to 132, and Argentina, Chile, and Mexico having 15, 35, and 26 indexed journals respectively. Collazo-Reyes [12] highlights that this growth in Brazilian journals propelled Portuguese to become the second most utilized language in the region's journal output for the first time.
Lucio-Arias, Velez-Cuartas, and Leydesdorff (13) conducted an analysis of 79,924 items within the broader domain of SciELO and WoS to examine international cooperation, highlighting that papers in Spanish and Portuguese from LAC countries remain predominant in communication. This linguistic dominance may contribute to the limited participation of researchers from LAC nations in collaborative networks, as suggested by the authors. Furthermore, as noted by Luukkonen, Persson, and Sivertsen (14), countries with stronger scientific infrastructures tend to engage in lower levels of international collaboration. Consequently, countries like Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic exhibit international collaboration rates exceeding 80%, while more prolific nations such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico fall within the 30-40% range (15). Overall, there is a universal push for countries to enhance their international collaboration rates.
In a recent study, Velez-Cuartas, Lucio-Arias, and Leydesdorff [16] conducted a comparison of the visibility of publications from Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) in Web of Science (WoS) and SciELO to assess the dissemination of scientific knowledge in the region. The study revealed that scientific communications from LAC continued to be predominantly in Spanish and Portuguese, reflecting the primary languages spoken in the region due to the geographical distribution of collaborators. Collaborative efforts in LAC often involve partnerships with developed countries, particularly in Europe. Notably, researchers from LAC countries frequently assume the role of first authors in a majority of multi-authored papers, indicating their significant integration into the global scientific landscape. Analysis of scientific publications from Latin American countries indexed in WoS under Open Access (AA) showed a prevalence of English (70.37%), followed by Portuguese (17.86%) and Spanish (11.63%) [17]. Other languages like French, Italian, and German accounted for a minimal fraction (0.19%). The distribution of languages within the total LAC publications indexed by WoS highlighted a higher presence of Spanish and Portuguese in the AA subset (11.63% and 17.86%, respectively) compared to the total sample (7.40% and 7.44%), resulting in a lower dominance of English (70.37% versus 84.96%). Conversely, papers indexed in SciELO CI were predominantly in Spanish (39.60%), followed by Portuguese (33.30%) and English (27.07%), with other languages representing a negligible percentage (0.03%) [17].
The data reveals that the prevalence of English-language papers is primarily observed in WoS. Within WoS, Portuguese emerges as the second most significant publication language, with Spanish playing a smaller yet noteworthy role. It is important to highlight the stark contrast in the distribution of publication languages within SciELO CI, where Spanish takes precedence, constituting approximately 40% of the papers, while Portuguese holds a more prominent position compared to English. Science, being a global endeavor, holds universal significance, theoretically catering to a worldwide audience. This characteristic has been identified as the 'Fourth Age of Research', transitioning from individual, institutional, and national levels to international collaboration. Such collaborations can aid in addressing global challenges, providing access to suitable infrastructure and funding opportunities. Moreover, international collaborations can amplify research impact, particularly in terms of citations. Studies have delved into researcher mobility based on bibliographic data and extensively examined international collaboration networks, which are strongly bolstered by research funding. Notably, research originating from one region or country can hold significant relevance for other geographical areas, particularly in fields like Public and Collective Health. Given that English serves as the lingua franca of science, it facilitates communication beyond national boundaries, essential for engaging with researchers and societies worldwide. However, conducting research in national languages is equally crucial to effectively influence and engage with local communities.
The significance of language in scholarly communication was underscored in the Helsinki Initiative on Multilingualism[27]. Additionally, it is crucial to recognize that bibliometrics is not impartial[28], as the selected indicators shape the context in which research is conducted. English often serves as the lingua franca for international research endeavors, a trend evident in the global strategies embraced by various countries and universities[29]. Among its aims is the attraction of international talent[29], with the internationalization of research also rendering it an appealing career path for certain students[26]. Proponents suggest that future universities will possess an international character[29], with funding initiatives like the African University of Science and Technology and the European Universities program being established to bolster these institutions[31].
One method used to gauge the reach of research audiences across national borders is by examining citations originating from a specific country. This approach not only reveals the nature of research being carried out in different geographical regions but is also reflected in certain university rankings such as the Leiden Ranking indicators. Citations can convey both positive and negative sentiments as they may either endorse or critique statements and findings of other authors. Criticism has been directed towards the generalization of a country's publication outcomes. International publications often serve as focal points for publicly-funded research initiatives, particularly within entities like the European Union. While the impact of citations can be assessed for international publications, it can similarly influence the reputation of the country where the research is published. Various studies have delved into the number of publications in different languages, shedding light on how publications are cited across linguistic boundaries.
A bibliometric study of an exploratory nature was conducted using a descriptive approach. The sample was characterized through a descriptive statistical analysis, and the relationship between variables was analyzed using Simple Linear Regression.
The SciELO Citation Index (SciELO CI) database was utilized as the primary source of data for gathering and categorizing scientific output in the fields of Public and Collective Health across various countries. This data collection and categorization process spanned from 2011 to 2015, providing a comprehensive overview of research contributions in these specific areas.
The selection of these areas was determined by two primary factors: their local significance and the broader coverage offered by SciELO CI in the Health domain, compared to the limited focus on Public and Collective Health within SciELO Spain. The utilization of SciELO CI holds significance due to its status as a relatively recent citation index and one of the few regional indexes that have yet to be extensively employed in bibliometric analyses. Additionally, exploring the citation patterns across languages within a regional citation index offers substantial value in understanding the flow of citations.
The dependent variables in this study are denoted by relative impact indicators:
In terms of citations, it is essential to consider the language used by authors affiliated with institutions in their respective countries, commonly referred to as the "national language" or "native language." This is particularly important when assessing the overall number of citations across different languages.
In terms of citations in SciELO CI, it is essential to consider the overall number of citations across all WoS citation sources, which encompass SciELO CI as well.
In each article, the number of citations accrued was recorded without establishing a specific citation range. The percentage of publications in the national language was considered as an independent variable in the analysis. The unit of analysis for this study was the author's country of institutional affiliation.
The sample was carefully chosen to represent the most productive countries in the field of Public and Collective Health within the SciELO CI database. Percentages were computed solely for countries that had produced a minimum of 50 articles in a particular language.
Table 1 illustrates the distribution of research output by authors affiliated with institutions in countries that are prominent publishers in SciELO CI journals. Notably, the publication rate in the national language exceeds 80% for countries within the SciELO Network, with the United States (USA) being the outlier at 73.6%. It is worth mentioning that the USA does not have its own journals in SciELO CI; however, researchers from this country frequently collaborate as co-authors in studies conducted in Latin America, as evidenced in a majority of the articles.
On the other hand, in the case of Brazil, there is a notable presence of publications in languages other than Portuguese, with 17.8% in English (IN), 16.1% in Spanish (ES), and 10.5% in Portuguese (PT), showcasing the significant contribution of US-Americans. Brazil has been actively working towards internationalizing its journals, a fact that is clearly reflected in its current publication output. In contrast, Peru and Colombia predominantly publish articles in their respective national languages.
When examining the acquired citations, two variables enabled us to evaluate their respective influences by considering the ratio of article citations in relation to the total number of citations: a) citations in the national language versus citations in any language (see Fig. 1-A); and b) citations from the SciELO CI database in contrast to all the WoS databases (refer to Fig. 1-B).
The percentages depicted in Figure 1 were exclusively computed for instances where a country had published a minimum of 50 articles in the respective language. Notably, Brazil emerged as the sole country meeting this threshold for publications in Portuguese. Furthermore, Figure 1-A illustrates that Brazil attains the highest impact in its native language at 55.7% when publishing in Portuguese. Conversely, when articles are published in English, the impact on the native language decreases to 47.9%, with a further decline to 34.4% when published in Spanish.
The impact on the native language is particularly pronounced in Colombia and Spain. In Spain, the percentage of articles cited in Spanish, when the cited paper is in the same language, exceeds that of papers cited in English by more than double. Similarly, in the USA, 42.5 percent of citations are in English when the paper is published in that language, compared to only 14.7 percent when it is published solely in Spanish.
In the instances of Cuba and Peru, over 90 percent of their impact is observed in their native language, with limited evidence of their work gaining visibility beyond. Conversely, the United States demonstrates a significant impact across various languages, particularly in Spanish publications. Similarly, Brazil garners its highest impact in a different language when publishing in Spanish, owing to the substantial Spanish-speaking audience in the database. Spain, on the other hand, exerts a notable influence in other languages when publishing in English. As depicted in Fig. 1-A, the language in which a publication is released evidently affects the reach and engagement of the target audience.
Turning our attention to Fig. 1-B, we observe that the specific audience under consideration is sourced from SciELO CI. Notably, Brazil emerges as the sole case permitting a comparison of citation percentages within SciELO CI across the three publication languages. The SciELO CI domain holds significance due to its audience, encompassing approximately two-thirds of the databases on the WoS platform when publications are in Portuguese. Following closely is the Spanish language, with an impact on SciELO CI slightly below 60.8%. Conversely, the influence of the English language appears to be less pronounced within the SciELO CI domain, standing at 40.8%.
The impact of countries on SciELO CI is more representative when they publish in Spanish, including the USA. In contrast to the language of cited articles, the SciELO CI regional database serves as a valuable resource and a platform for showcasing impact, especially for publications in Spanish or Portuguese. Conversely, the influence of English publications is more pronounced in the WoS database, notably for Brazil, Colombia, and Spain. It is worth mentioning that citations to the USA, when published in English, account for less than 9% of the total, as their impact primarily lies outside SciELO CI.
When examining both variables together, the percentage of publications in the national language is analyzed. Figure 2 illustrates that the linear relationship between the percentage of publications in the native language becomes more significant when considering its impact on the national language, measured in percentage terms.
The non-linearity observed in the relationship with the representativeness of the SciELO CI domain appears to be influenced, to some extent, by the countries it encompasses, namely Brazil, USA, and Spain (Fig. 2-B). Brazil stands out with a higher number of journals, exerting a significant influence on SciELO CI despite not publishing a proportionate percentage in its native language, unlike countries such as Colombia, Cuba, and Peru. The domain's significance for the USA is minimal, as previously noted. In the case of Spain, the lack of representation seems more tied to production-related factors rather than its impact. It is worth noting that SciELO CI is a well-regarded database suitable for analyzing the research output impact of LAC countries on Public and Collective Health. Additionally, all LAC countries have some impact within the broader scope of the WoS platform.
The establishment of the SciELO Citation Index represents a recent initiative that has supplanted the older global reference database, WoS Core Collection. Initially, the rationale behind this transition primarily centered on enhancing the visibility and accessibility of scientific output through open access, a pivotal development that significantly amplifies the exposure of domestically published journals. Moreover, a distinguishing factor that bolsters the credibility of the SciELO compilation is its discerning nature, stemming from the rigorous evaluation processes and criteria enforced by the scientific advisory committees of each participating country within the SciELO Network. Regrettably, numerous prior investigations have indicated that research disseminated through "high-quality" national journals tends to garner fewer citations compared to commercially acclaimed "high impact" journals.
The SciELO Network, operational for over two decades, has facilitated an examination of its scientific contributions to the fields of Public and Collective Health, shedding light on the most productive countries in the region. This assessment hinges on citation flow, considering factors such as the language of cited articles and the representation of SciELO CI within the WoS platform databases. Such an analysis underscores the significance of databases like SciELO CI in research domains focused on local issues, ideally explored by researchers with national affiliations, evident in regional or local communities, and where native languages hold substantial importance.
The examination of citation patterns in the authors' native languages revealed a direct correlation between the proportion of publications and their influence within their respective linguistic communities. Notably, Brazil and the USA exhibit a lower volume of research published in their native languages, indicating a broader readership in other languages. In contrast, countries like Colombia, Cuba, Spain, and Peru demonstrate a higher prevalence of publications in their native languages, predominantly impacting the Spanish-speaking audience. It is worth mentioning that Spain and the USA show diminished impact within the SciELO database, suggesting that their citations predominantly originate from sources beyond the SciELO CI domain. Conversely, Latin American nations stand out for their substantial impact within this research field, garnering approximately two-thirds of their citations from the WoS platform.
The dominance of English in scientific discourse has led to its widespread adoption as the primary language for communication in the field. Nevertheless, the necessity of utilizing native languages for disseminating research findings within specific local and regional contexts, particularly in disciplines like Public and Collective Health, remains paramount. Recent years have witnessed a surge in interest within the scientific community regarding the scrutiny and advocacy for the judicious application of metrics in evaluation processes. This burgeoning trend has culminated in the publication of several influential documents [37-41], some of which underscore the significance of disseminating research outcomes in the native language.
Excellence in research is often linked to publishing in English, a trend that poses challenges for fields like Social Sciences, Humanities, and Public Health, which focus on national or regional issues. Research indicates that publishing in English and prestigious journals garners more citations and a greater impact compared to native languages. Our analysis at SciELO CI reveals that Brazil receives significant citations even when research is published in the native language or Spanish. This regional impact underscores the importance of acknowledging non-English publications in scientific policy decisions. Recognizing the dynamics of citations and native language publications can inform more equitable and inclusive scientific policies that avoid marginalizing valuable contributions.
It is imperative to acknowledge and incentivize the scientific contributions of research communities with local or regional significance, aiming to achieve a more equitable distribution between publications in English. The presence of regional citation indexes within extensive databases like the Web of Science facilitates enhanced visibility and integration of this knowledge into the worldwide scientific discourse, while also guaranteeing linguistic accessibility for local or regional audiences.
