COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, poses a significant threat due to its high contagion rate and widespread transmission within the population. Early detection of the pathogen is crucial for effectively targeting infection control measures. The World Health Organization recommends sample collection from upper respiratory specimens such as nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs or washes in ambulatory patients, as well as lower respiratory specimens like sputum, endotracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage, in addition to blood and feces. While various methods have been explored, saliva has emerged as a potential diagnostic source. This study aims to assess the current landscape by reviewing recent literature on the use of saliva as a means of detecting SARS-CoV-2 for diagnosing COVID-19.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a respiratory illness recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus classified as such by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and initially identified as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This novel pathogen is characterized as an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome, falling under the realm Riboviria, order Nidovirales, suborder Cornidovirineae, family Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus, and the species of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. Among the four genera of coronaviruses, Alpha- and Beta- are capable of infecting mammals. The virus initiates infection by binding to host cells, leading to viral RNA replication, virion production, and release through exocytosis for further infections. Structural proteins are essential for virion assembly, with the spike glycoprotein on the virion surface facilitating binding to the host receptor. Consequently, susceptibility to infection and disease progression can also be influenced by host-related factors.
As per the World Health Organization (WHO), suspected cases require laboratory tests utilizing samples obtained from the upper respiratory tract, including nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs or washes in ambulatory patients, along with lower respiratory specimens like sputum and/or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with severe respiratory conditions, in conjunction with blood, feces, and urine [5]. Nevertheless, these diagnostic approaches come with drawbacks, such as patient discomfort and the occasional occurrence of bleeding or coughing, the potential for contamination by healthcare professionals, the necessity for specific equipment, and the limitation of sputum samples due to their infrequent presence [1,6].
Saliva has been identified as a non-invasive method with several advantages, including lower cost, ease of sample collection, self-collection potential, reduced risk of contamination, and the absence of a requirement for trained personnel for sample collection [1]. Given the high rate of contagion and rapid spread of the virus within the population, early pathogen detection is crucial for effectively targeting infection control measures. Among the various sample collection methods, saliva has emerged as a promising source for diagnosis. Therefore, our study aims to assess the current landscape by reviewing recent literature on the potential of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva as a diagnostic tool for Covid-19.
Nasopharyngeal samples are considered the most effective specimens for identifying viruses responsible for respiratory tract infections, serving a dual purpose in both diagnostic procedures and research endeavors, often utilized as a comparative tool alongside saliva samples [7,8].
Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, saliva had been a focal point of research for its potential in diagnosing respiratory infections. In 2004, amidst a dearth of understanding regarding SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in oral droplets, researchers at the University of Taiwan scrutinized samples of throat wash and saliva from suspected patients. Employing the quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, they confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV RNA in all available specimens, with saliva exhibiting the highest viral RNA levels. Furthermore, through immunofluorescence assays, the pathogen was discernible in epithelial cells from the throat wash, indicating potential dissemination to the oropharynx and oral cavity post viral replication. Despite the study's limitations in sample size, the findings supported the viability of these samples as a diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, the ability to detect the virus in early samples prior to the emergence of lung lesions suggested potential transmission via oral droplets from asymptomatic carriers [9].
Previous studies have highlighted the efficacy of saliva in detecting respiratory virus infections, showing a strong correlation with nasopharyngeal samples [7,8,9]. This approach was assessed in two cohorts to compare the viral loads between nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens. The initial detection rates were 91.8% for nasopharyngeal samples and 57.1% for saliva. Interestingly, upon reevaluation, nine patients initially negative in the nasopharynx tested positive in saliva, suggesting the potential impact on infection control strategies. Consequently, saliva should be recognized as a valuable diagnostic tool [7].
The diagnostic validity of saliva was found to be 93% equivalent to nasopharyngeal aspirate in identifying respiratory viruses, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, with a sensitivity of 90.8% and specificity of 100% for saliva. Additionally, saliva testing was determined to be 2.26 times faster and 2.59 times cheaper in terms of time and cost. This suggests that saliva testing could be a viable option not only for diagnosis but also for research purposes [8].
The literature highlights the strong affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor found in the host cell membrane. This interaction occurs through a layer of surrounding proteins, facilitating the virus's entry into human cells. Consequently, the expression of ACE2 in cells plays a crucial role in determining the potential pathways for viral entry into the human body. Notably, the presence of ACE2 in the epithelial cells of the salivary gland has been confirmed, rendering them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite their lower abundance compared to other tissues like the gastrointestinal system, renal, and cardiac muscles. This finding underscores the possibility of identifying the virus in saliva, posing a significant risk of transmission.
Analysis of public bulk-seq RNA datasets across various tissues expressing ACE2 revealed high expression levels of ACE2 in the oral mucosa, particularly in the oral tongue, floor of the mouth, and base of the tongue, as well as among epithelial cells, T cells, and fibroblasts. Interestingly, minor salivary glands exhibited higher ACE2 expression compared to the lungs, indicating the oral cavity's susceptibility to infection and its potential role as a target for the virus, with salivary glands potentially serving as a significant source of the virus in saliva. Understanding the pathways of SARS-CoV-2 contamination within the human body is crucial for comprehending disease pathogenesis and enhancing preventive measures. However, the lack of histological assessment poses a limitation to these evaluations. Human-to-human transmission typically occurs through infected respiratory droplets, aerosols, sneezing, coughing, or direct contact with contaminated surfaces that may come into contact with the mouth, nose, or eyes.
Saliva poses a transmission risk to dentists and other health professionals due to the potential presence of the virus during replication, potentially in its contagious form. Consequently, saliva could serve as a diagnostic tool for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2, opening avenues for proteomics, metabolomics, and antibody detection. This highlights the potential of saliva as a valuable resource in the fight against the virus [13,14].
With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the simplicity of acquiring samples, coupled with the advantages of reducing the risk of contagion among healthcare professionals as previously documented in studies, has made saliva-based diagnosis increasingly relevant in the current scenario. New studies have emerged to assess this method, with To et al. (2020) detecting SARS-CoV-2 in 91.7% of cases, corresponding to 11 out of 12 patients evaluated. Their study suggests that saliva can serve as a means of transmission in positive cases for viral culture, as it can be expelled through droplets during coughing or even in asymptomatic individuals. This finding raises the possibility of salivary gland infection, although the authors highlight the diverse composition of saliva, which includes secretions from the nasopharynx or lungs.
A discussion on the likelihood of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva highlighted that the findings from the aforementioned study should not be generalized to suggest a 90% identification rate in infected individuals, but rather a range of 60% to 99% due to the limited sample size. Despite this limitation, the researchers acknowledged the significance of the data and emphasized the necessity for further research with a larger cohort to address uncertainties regarding the sensitivity of this diagnostic approach [15].
The diagnostic method using saliva is presented in a highly advantageous manner, with ongoing research aimed at validating the detection of the virus in saliva. Consequently, it is imperative to compare the test results with diagnoses made by laboratories and confirmed through established collection methods, such as nasopharyngeal rRT-PCR swabs. The Polymerase Chain Reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) stands as the primary test for identifying SARS-CoV-2 [16].
Azzi et al. (2020) conducted a study involving the collection of samples using the drooling technique from 25 patients. This method was chosen due to the feasibility of obtaining oral fluids rather than mucous secretions from the oropharynx or lower respiratory tract. The researchers proposed two hypotheses regarding the presence of the virus in saliva: either it migrated from the nasopharynx or respiratory tract, or it was secreted by the salivary glands. They also emphasized the reliability of saliva as a means of detecting SARS-CoV-2 and suggested its potential use in rapid testing. Furthermore, they highlighted the ability to measure viral load in asymptomatic individuals to determine a sensitivity threshold for the test.
In a recent study that assessed the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in 23 Covid-19 patients, utilizing self-collected posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples, it was found that 87% of the patients had detectable virus in their saliva. The study also highlighted the viral load dynamics during the first week post-symptom onset, showing a subsequent decline over time. Moreover, viral RNA presence was monitored in these samples for over 20 days in 7 patients, indicating the potential utility of such samples for both initial diagnosis and ongoing viral load monitoring. The study suggested a potential correlation between high viral loads post-symptom onset and disease transmission during this period, irrespective of symptom severity [17].
In contrast, Chen et al. linked the detection of the virus in saliva to the severe manifestation of the disease. By directly collecting samples from the salivary glands to exclusively obtain saliva samples, they found a positive rate of 12.90% among patients, with 3 of them being in a critical condition. This suggests a higher disease severity when SARS-CoV-2 is present in saliva originating from the salivary glands [4].
It is crucial to monitor the viral load and antibody profile even after the remission of symptoms, as the two may not be directly proportional. This becomes particularly relevant in cases where the virus is not detectable by RT-PCR due to a low viral load. In such instances, serological diagnosis can indicate the levels of IgG or IgM antibodies present. Zhang et al. conducted a study evaluating oral swabs for virus detection at the disease's onset but concluded that it is not a reliable diagnostic method, as negative results do not definitively rule out the virus's presence. Therefore, serological tests for IgG and IgM antibodies are recommended to confirm the infection.
In a recent study involving 39 patients who tested positive for PCR, 33 individuals were successfully identified with SARC-CoV-2 in saliva. This finding underscores the potential of saliva as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, particularly valuable for screening purposes. The cost-effectiveness of saliva testing, coupled with the challenges associated with obtaining nasopharyngeal aspirates due to the scarcity of appropriate personal protective equipment, further emphasizes the practicality and utility of saliva-based testing methods for a broader population, beyond just highly suspected cases [19].
The method of collecting saliva varies significantly among the studies evaluated, leading to differences in the data obtained. These variations include techniques such as coughing out saliva from the throat, expectorating saliva, using the drooling technique or a pipette, collecting saliva directly from the salivary gland, and sampling from different locations such as the deep throat, oral cavity, or salivary glands [4,6,16].
Variations in saliva collection methods impact the composition of the saliva being evaluated, consequently affecting virus detection in the sample. Depending on the technique employed, there may be a blend of saliva and secretions from the nasopharynx and lower respiratory tract, potentially complicating result interpretation as it becomes challenging to discern the virus's precise origin—whether from the salivary glands, nasopharynx, or lower respiratory system. Some studies acknowledge this as a limitation [17], while others opt for saliva-only collection [4], considering it an advantage due to the potential for increased virus detection irrespective of the sample's origin or composition, all while minimizing patient discomfort [6].
Irrespective of the collection method employed, all the reviewed studies underscored the advantages of this diagnostic approach, which can be conducted without the need for specialized collection equipment. The findings of these studies suggest that, when considering the potential for virus detection in various samples, saliva obtained from the deep throat region offers a higher likelihood of virus identification, thereby enabling early disease diagnosis [12]. Furthermore, a study that compared the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients revealed that the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva was comparable to that of nasopharyngeal swabs during early hospitalization and remained more consistent over an extended period of hospitalization [20].
There is a consensus regarding the potential for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva, yet research lacks a standardized parameter for collection techniques. While the prospect of detecting the virus through saliva appears promising, challenges such as variations in collection techniques, sample sizes, and collection locations may hinder its widespread adoption. Despite the advantages it offers as a diagnostic tool, the use of saliva as a standalone diagnostic method is not yet universally endorsed and should be complemented with other confirmatory methods.
The present situation highlights saliva as a dependable method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, attributed to its ease of sample acquisition, potential for self-collection, cost-effectiveness due to the absence of specific equipment requirements, and the reduced risk of transmission for healthcare workers [1,6]. Research assessing saliva has demonstrated strong concordance with the established gold standard, nasopharyngeal aspiration, suggesting its capacity to supplant other biological samples in use. Despite these findings, the World Health Organization has not yet endorsed saliva as a recommended collection method.
