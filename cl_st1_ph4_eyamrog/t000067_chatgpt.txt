Text mining and related analytics have emerged as a technological approach aimed at supporting human activities by extracting valuable knowledge from texts in various formats. From a managerial perspective, this approach can assist organizations in their planning and decision-making processes by providing insights that were previously hidden within textual materials, whether generated internally or externally. Particularly within the public/governmental domain, public security agencies stand to benefit significantly from the tools associated with text mining, spanning applications from crime prevention to gauging public sentiment towards welfare initiatives. This article presents findings from a systematic literature review that delves into the primary areas where text mining is applied in public security, the prevalent technological tools utilized, and potential future research directions. The review encompassed searches across four major article databases (Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library), identifying and analyzing 194 relevant materials published between 2014 and the first half of 2021, sourced from journals, conferences, and book chapters. The results of this study shed light on the key themes and insights gleaned from the literature review.
Text mining and analytics represent a popular field of study and practical application within organizations, focusing on extracting knowledge from textual data and conducting subsequent analyses on text collections. These tools offer benefits to organizations, irrespective of their private or public nature. In public and governmental settings, managers can leverage these tools to aid in planning and decision-making processes. For instance, they can extract information from texts sourced from the social web, which may include direct opinions from service users.
In this context, text mining tools can be utilized to enhance public security measures by aiding in investigative processes, detecting or predicting criminal activities, preventing harmful public events, and gathering citizen opinions on existing security measures. These text mining-related approaches encompass various techniques and methods, including information retrieval and extraction, document clustering and classification, natural language processing, and web mining, as outlined by Talib et al. (2016) and Zainol et al. (2018).
Each approach encompasses various applications concerning public security issues. For example, information retrieval and extraction tasks are utilized in the mining process of digital investigation systems to acquire the most pertinent texts or documents pertaining to a specific investigational subject (Gowri et al., 2014). Another instance involves the selection of unstructured criminal judgment texts to extract essential information that aids lawyers and judges in their respective activities (Iftikhar et al., 2019).
The process of clustering and classifying texts involves the application of techniques that can group texts or assign labels based on similar classes or categories (Park et al., 2019). Kuang et al. (2017) utilized both tasks in their text mining application to identify meaningful latent crime classes using textual records of crime events. Similarly, Das and Das (2019) employed a graph-based clustering technique to identify labels for crime reports by extracting paraphrases from extensive untagged crime corpora. Thao et al. (2017) implemented an approach to classify landing and distribution domains, crucial components for analyzing different types of cyberattacks.
Natural language processing is a broad field focused on the analysis and synthesis of spoken and written language through computer systems (Jackson & Moulinier, 2002). An alternative perspective on natural language processing is that it aims to derive a more comprehensive meaning from texts by leveraging linguistic elements like part-of-speech and grammatical structures (Kao & Poteet, 2007). This domain encompasses a variety of techniques commonly utilized in text mining to facilitate various tasks. Nonetheless, as highlighted by Sankar et al. (2020), the core objective of natural language processing lies in recognizing the language within a text and applying predefined rules to identify and extract pertinent information.
In their study, Gravanis et al. (2019) present an illustration of fake news detection, suggesting a natural language processing strategy that integrates linguistic-based features with machine learning. Their findings indicate that such an approach offers publishers a framework for identifying content that warrants closer scrutiny, thereby preventing the dissemination of false information. This observation by the researchers underscores the assistance that text mining offers in situations where human analytical abilities may fall short in identifying potentially harmful elements or events. Furthermore, this application is particularly relevant to cybersecurity concerns, especially in the context of individuals utilizing online platforms for communication and information sharing.
Web mining encompasses a collection of text mining techniques aimed at understanding the distribution of information across the Internet by characterizing and classifying web pages, thereby facilitating the exploration of their interrelationships (Han et al., 2011). Kavita et al. (2016) and Kumar and Palanisamy (2008) have examined three primary types of web mining: content mining, structure mining, and usage mining. These classifications were further supported by de la Torre et al. (2018), who equated web mining, or "web data mining," to the practice of "text mining on web documents." Moreover, within this framework, the social web presents a vast array of data for investigation, allowing, for instance, sentiment analysis by users on specific topics (Costa et al., 2012). Anwar and Abulaish (2014a) and Anwar and Abulaish (2014b) have demonstrated instances of web mining applications dedicated to extracting pertinent information from webpages to identify namesakes, a crucial cybersecurity task that aids in disambiguating individuals sharing the same name.
The literature outlined in this introduction showcases the diverse range of applications that text mining provides for public security and its associated domains, bolstering the need for a methodical literature review to pinpoint avenues for further research.
This text aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the findings from a systematic literature review on text mining in the context of public security, highlighting the significance and relevance of the tools associated with aiding decision-making and operational strategies within public security agencies. The subsequent sections of this article are organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the methodology employed in conducting the systematic literature review; Section 3 delves into the specifics of the review findings; and Section 4 encapsulates the concluding remarks of this study.
This section elucidates the systematic literature review process, encompassing search criteria, filtering, assessment of full papers, information extraction, and the software employed to facilitate analysis. The review process adhered to the guidelines outlined by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), following the workflow delineated in Figure 1.
The procedure outlined in this study focused on extracting and selecting literature to identify the primary areas of application of text mining in public security, the prevalent text mining technologies used in public security-related issues as indicated in the selected literature, and the potential opportunities and challenges for text mining in public security based on future directions highlighted in recent literature. Subsequent sections will elaborate on each component of the workflow depicted in Figure 1.
The literature search was constrained by specific criteria: a) inclusion of works solely in English, b) incorporation of journal articles, complete conference papers, and book chapters, and c) consideration of publication dates falling within the range of 2014 to 2021.
For selection criterion c), the period of eight years was determined by considering two key aspects from the literature. Firstly, it aimed to capture the most recent publications relevant to the themes under investigation in this study. Secondly, the decision was influenced by the distribution of works over time, with a significant concentration of 70.62% of the literature falling between 2017 and 2020. In contrast, the preceding three years (2014, 2015, and 2016) accounted for only 27.84% of the works, while the year 2021 contributed a mere 1.55% to the total selected works. It is worth noting that the literature extraction process was concluded before the end of 2021, hence the limited representation of works from that year.
The search queries were structured based on the following Boolean condition: ("text mining") AND ("public security" OR "crime" OR "terrorism" OR "piracy" OR "drug trafficking" OR "arms trafficking" OR "human trafficking" OR "sexual exploitation" OR "prostitution" OR "pedophilia" OR "rape" OR "homicide" OR "murder" OR "femicide" OR "infanticide" OR "bodily injury" OR "extortion" OR "theft" OR "robbery" OR "assault" OR "burglary" OR "property damage" OR "misappropriation" OR "money laundering" OR "embezzlement" OR "stellionate" OR "receiving" OR "kidnapping" OR "defamation" OR "cybercrime").
The crime-related terms in the query were extracted from the Brazilian Penal Code (Decree-Law No. 2848 / 1940), which remains the prevailing penal code in Brazil. This code has been periodically revised and supplemented by subsequent legal enactments, encompassing a comprehensive framework that delineates the full spectrum of potential penalties for the specified criminal offenses.
To substantiate these terms, the American Model Penal Code offers detailed descriptions of several of these terms, indicating that others are either variations or closely related, as evidenced in Robinson and Dubber (2007). Further validation of these terms can be found in the crime data provided by the Crown Prosecution Service1 (England and Wales), which categorizes offenses into domestic abuse, drug offenses, fraud, economic crime, hate crime, sexual offenses, terrorism, verbal abuse, violent crime, and cybercrime. Lastly, Brazilian Jurisprudence2 was consulted to reinforce the existence of these terms, drawing from court documents detailing criminal sentences.
This condition was applied to four databases, taking into account the specific formats of each: Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library.
After retrieving literature from each database, sequential filters were applied to remove duplicates, leading to the exclusion of 178 works. This process left only those directly related to the theme for subsequent analysis, identified through screening titles and abstracts. A further screening of titles and abstracts resulted in the exclusion of 376 works for the information extraction phase.
The information extraction strategy involved a manual search for objectives, methodology, applications, and other relevant details in the selected works. A spreadsheet was meticulously maintained to record information such as authorship, publication channel name, primary objectives, related problems, synthesis of methods, techniques, technologies used, key applications, keywords, type of work, publication year, and key terms associated with the techniques and technologies. Additionally, a final field was dedicated to identifying any proposals for future work outlined in the publication.
During the assessment of full papers for information extraction, 58 papers were excluded from the review due to being outside the scope of the study. These exclusions were based on several criteria: firstly, papers that were literature reviews, despite addressing themes related to text mining in public security, were deemed irrelevant as they did not contribute new information to the research. Secondly, papers written in languages other than English were excluded. Lastly, papers that utilized analysis methods other than text mining in the context of public security were also omitted from the review.
In this phase, a spreadsheet was created to summarize the 194 selected works, capturing pertinent information as per the outlined literature selection process. The extraction of information from these works was conducted manually, involving reading the texts and inputting the necessary data into the spreadsheet. Out of the 194 works, only 92 were included in the opportunities and challenges extraction process, as they provided insights and directions for future research.
The screening process in this research article utilized Elsevier's Mendeley software, which aided in the insertion of citations and creation of references. Additionally, a Python script was employed to count and generate charts and tables using information extracted from the literature. To visualize the most frequent terms related to the technologies and techniques found in the literature, the web application WordItOut3 was utilized to create a word cloud.
The data extracted from the 194 chosen works has been compiled into a spreadsheet, which is accessible in a publicly available repository on GitHub. This spreadsheet includes the pertinent information from each selected article, as outlined in Figure 1.
This section presents the findings of the literature review, categorized based on the three elements outlined in the preceding section:

This algorithm was utilized to identify named entities associated with drug trafficking and the illicit sale of weapons on the Darkweb.
In the realm of "Weapons' trafficking detection," the sole technology identified was the R Language, appearing once. Various techniques like Boosting, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines were also mentioned, each with a single occurrence. Novel terms such as Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient and Maximum Entropy, utilized by Saini and Bansal (2019), were introduced, each appearing once. Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient was employed to assess agreement between two experts, while Maximum Entropy, in conjunction with the aforementioned techniques, was utilized for classification purposes.
In the last two areas, namely "Armed conflicts solution" and "Violence against women analysis," only a few techniques were identified, each with a single occurrence due to the limited number of studies in these specific areas. The sole technology that emerged in both domains was the R language. Within the "Armed conflicts solution" category, two terms associated with techniques were identified: Document-Term Matrix and SMOG Index Calculation. The SMOG Index pertains to the observation that adults tend to employ more sophisticated and intricate language in their writing compared to children. In the realm of "Violence against women analysis," two additional terms surfaced: Sentiment Analysis and Term Frequency. Figure 2 presents a word cloud illustrating the most frequently used words in connection with technologies and techniques from the literature reviewed, categorized by uni-grams.

One study on weapons trafficking detection was conducted by Saini and Bansal (2019), who introduced a fresh methodology for identifying the acquisition of modern weapons by terrorists through dark web forums. Their proposal involved improving the illegal weapon procurement model to accommodate various languages utilized by violent extremists in these forums, alongside the application of social network analysis. Additionally, they recommended the utilization of topic modeling to unveil concealed patterns within the dark web, thereby enhancing the detection of illicit activities.
Civil unrest detection represents a crucial domain within public security applications for text mining, offering avenues for future research. In their study, Wei et al. (2020) delved into the shifts in Twitter users' behaviors concerning biases against immigrants in the aftermath of recent protests in the United States focusing on immigration-related issues. Their proposed directions for future investigation include enhancing the accuracy of predicting individual-level changes through more comprehensive data annotations and expanding the scope to encompass diverse populations across various countries. Additionally, they suggest exploring the enduring impact of protests on online prejudices over an extended period.

It is crucial to address the ethical implications of employing text mining in public security to conclude this discussion. In numerous instances where text mining techniques are applied, ethical concerns arise regarding the utilization of sensitive and personal data, despite the necessity of such data for ensuring people's security. Several articles have raised concerns about the ethical handling of data pertaining to individuals, including victims of abuse or crimes, as discussed in the literature reviewed.
Hultgren et al. (2018) underscored the challenge associated with utilizing data pertaining to victims of sexual exploitation, a significant limitation in their research for data acquisition. Due to ethical considerations, direct contact with individuals in such circumstances was unfeasible. This predicament underscores the sensitivity of the issue at hand, as victims are reluctant to disclose information for their own safety, and law enforcement agencies refrain from disseminating detailed textual records to protect the identities of these individuals, hindering scientific research in this area.
Karystianis et al. (2018), Karystianis et al. (2019), and Karystianis et al. (2020) utilized domestic violence case data for their research endeavors. However, they acknowledged the ethical concerns associated with the data source, which comprised police narratives. To address these concerns, a stringent security protocol was implemented, mandating that the text mining of the case narratives be conducted on-site at the police department headquarters in the relevant region. Moreover, only de-identified outputs were permitted to be extracted for use in their studies. In essence, the ethical use of text mining tools is contingent upon their alignment with the promotion of social welfare, safeguarding the anonymity of individuals referenced in texts, and adherence to the information security protocols mandated by public security authorities.
The article provides a comprehensive overview of the selected literature, categorizing it based on the research's focus areas: (i) primary application domains, (ii) utilized techniques and technologies, and (iii) current opportunities and challenges as per recent literature (spanning from 2018 to 2021), while also highlighting potential avenues for future research. The review delved into 194 works for (i) and (ii), whereas a subset of 92 works was specifically analyzed for (iii). To enhance accessibility, a GitHub repository was established (refer to Section 3.4 for details) alongside a spreadsheet containing all pertinent information extracted during the systematic review process.
Nineteen application areas pertaining to public security were identified and discussed. The relevant literature was showcased in Tables 1 to 10, with the final two tables consolidating multiple application areas with limited literature (typically one or two works). Following the delineation of application areas, the most commonly employed techniques and technologies were outlined for each identified area, with additional data provided in a series of tables found in Appendix A.
The research article provides an overview of future research directions based on the analysis of the 92 most recent works, categorizing them into seventeen application areas. These directions are succinctly summarized in a paragraph. Additionally, a concluding remark is made concerning the ethical considerations surrounding text mining in public security. Emphasizing the significance of safeguarding sensitive data, especially personal information, to prevent any potential harm to individuals' physical and social well-being, the article highlights specific studies that exemplify limitations in this aspect.
