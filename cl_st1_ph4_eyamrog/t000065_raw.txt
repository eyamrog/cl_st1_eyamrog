Abstract 
 
Corpus compilation is a challenging research endeavor that many researchers decide to pursue. 
Few learner corpora, however, can be easily accessed (e.g.,the International Corpus of Learner 
English), and none of them carry a variety of text registers written by English learners at 
different proficiency levels studying in the Brazilian university context. Therefore, the aim of 
this paper is to present the compilation of a learner corpus, much needed in our research and 
teaching context, pointing out the advantages of building this type of corpus for the 
understanding of learners’ needs as well as for pedagogical decision-making based on sound 
data. Presenting a detailed rationale of the corpus compilation, this article reveals the various 
decisions made in order to guarantee that fair comparisons can be made. To exemplify the value 
of building a carefully designed corpus, results of previous studies are compared. Some of the 
conclusions reached refer to the need for discipline-specific tasks to propel writing proficiency 
and for authorship skills to be developed in English for Academic Purposes classes to foster 
academic success.

Resumo 
 
A compilação de corpus é uma empreitada de pesquisa desafiadora que muitos pesquisadores 
decidem realizar. Poucos corpora de aprendizes, entretanto, podem ser facilmente acessados (por 
exemplo, o International Corpus of Learner English), e nenhum deles carrega uma variedade de 
registros textuais escritos por aprendizes de inglês de níveis diferentes de proficiência e que 
estudam no contexto universitário brasileiro. Nesse sentido, o objetivo deste artigo é apresentar a 
compilação de um corpus de aprendiz, muito necessário em nosso contexto de pesquisa e ensino, 
evidenciando as vantagens de construir este tipo de corpus para a compreensão das necessidades 
dos aprendizes, bem como para as tomadas de decisões pedagógicas baseadas em dados sólidos. 
Apresentando a fundamentação detalhada para a compilação do corpus, este trabalho revela as 
várias decisões tomadas, a fim de garantir que comparações justas possam ser feitas. Algumas 
conclusões obtidas referem-se à necessidade de tarefas específicas por área para impulsionar a 
proficiência na escrita, e para o desenvolvimento das habilidades de autoria nas aulas de Inglês 
para Fins Acadêmicos para fomentar o sucesso acadêmico.

1. Introduction 
 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-460x202149731
When linguists select their research questions and choose how to investigate what they are 
interested in, so many decisions have to be made. Undoubtedly, the methodology has to be 
appropriate for the study. Using a corpus linguistics methodological perspective may be the best 
choice if the questions are related to how people use language in different contexts, as Crawford 
and Csomay highlight: 
 
 
While understanding variation and contextual differences is a goal shared by 
researchers of other areas of linguistic research, corpus linguistics describes 
language variation and use by looking at large amounts of texts that have been 
produced in similar circumstances. (Crawford & Csomay, 2016, p.5) 
 
This empirical approach allows results to be generalized, as a well-designed corpus will 
adequately represent a register, which can be understood as “a variety associated with a 
particular situation of use (including particular communicative purposes)” (Biber & Conrad, 
2009, p. 6). The researcher, then, should consider the situational characteristics of a register: the 
participants, the relations among participants, the channel used, and the production 
circumstances (Biber & Conrad, 2009). Having established clear research questions to answer 
and the characteristics of the register or registers the linguist is interested in investigating, it is 
time to choose the corpus to be used. Would a readily available corpus be suitable, or would a 
corpus compilation be necessary?  
 
In our research area, learner language, there are few corpora that can be accessed, for instance, 
the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE)1, the Louvain International Database of 
Spoken English Interlanguage (LINDSEI)2, Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays 
(LOCNESS), the Michigan Corpus of Upper-Level Student Papers (MICUSP)3 and the British 
 
1 ICLE, released its third version in 2020 (Granger et al., 2020) is a corpus of argumentative essays written by 
learners of English from upper intermediate to advanced levels of English and from 25 different language 
backgrounds. It has over 5.5 million words and is hosted on a web-based interface. https://uclouvain.be/en/research-
institutes/ilc/cecl/icle.html.  
2 LINDSEI is a corpus of interviews gathered from learners of English speakers of 11 different native languages. 
(Gilquin et al.,2010). https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ilc/cecl/lindsei.html.  
3 MICUSP, a written corpus, has about 2.6 million words. Corpus information is available at 
http://micusp.elicorpora.info/ 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-460x202149731
Academic Written English corpus of English texts (BAWE)4. Each of these corpora was 
designed with a specific purpose. While ICLE and LINDSEI were compiled to allow access to 
English learners’ interlanguage5, MICUSP and BAWE focused on high grade written papers of 
different genres and LOCNESS on essays written by American and British university students. 
However, there are several similarities regarding the situational characteristics involved in the 
compilation of these corpora. The participants are all students at higher education institutions. 
They are authors who write or speak, either in a context where what is produced is being 
assessed or not being assessed, including or excluding time constraints. Besides the fact that the 
production circumstances may vary, the addressors are students and can be considered novice or 
apprentice writers.6  The main difference among these corpora is that participants have different 
first language backgrounds. After reflecting on these characteristics, a researcher may wonder 
how suitable such corpora would be for their study. In our case, our research context is a 
Brazilian university; consequently, some questions would remain unanswered if our studies are 
limited to these corpora. Despite the two facts that the corpora are all quite large and that 
ICLEV3 has a subcorpus of essays written by Brazilian students (Br-ICLE7), we ultimately 
found them insufficient for our needs, particularly to deeply investigate linguistic variation 
across text genres, across academic levels (undergraduate and graduate), across disciplines and 
across proficiency levels to understand the users’ choices with cross-sectional or longitudinal 
data perspectives. Such aspects cannot be fully covered with Br-ICLE data. Furthermore, making 
a new corpus available to other researchers has also been one of our goals. A CQPweb 
framework will soon be available for searchers on our corpus8 with tools such as keyword 
 
4 The BAWE corpus contains 2761 pieces of proficient assessed student writing. It can be accessed through the 
Oxford Text Archive  https://ota.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12024/2539.   
5 The term interlanguage was coined by Selinker (1972, p. 214): “… the existence of a separate linguistic system 
based on the observable output which results from a learner’s attempted production of a TL norm. This linguistic 
system we will call ‘interlanguage’ (IL).” 
6 Scott and Tribble (2006, p.133) prefer to use the terms ‘apprentice’ and ‘expert’ writers rather than ‘learner’ and 
‘native speaker’. “Expert texts may most easily be identified on the crude basis of their having been published, or 
their having been disseminated to specific readeships within bureaucratic, commercial, professional or other 
organizations”. 
7 Br-ICLE, coordinated by Tony Berber-Sardinha, has 200.000 words. 
8 Besides the university learner corpus described in the article, we will also make available other corpora organized 
by our CNPq research group, Grupo de Estudos de Corpora Especializados e de Aprendizes (GECEA), such as 
CALIEMT:Corpus de Aprendizes da Língua Inglesa do Ensino Médio Técnico (Xavier et al., 2019; Oliveira et al., 
2017)  and CorAChem (Corpus of Articles in Chemistry) and CorAAL(Corpus of Articles in Applied Linguistics)  
(Dutra et al., 2020).

search, collocate list, with different association measures, and visualization of occurrence 
dispersion.   
 
To the best of our knowledge, there was no comprehensive learner corpus of Brazilian university 
learners’ English written texts compiled in the classroom context and available for the studies 
our research group was aiming at. Therefore, in 2013, as Section 3 lays out comprehensively, a 
Brazilian learner academic English corpus was designed (CorIFA9). Our efforts were motivated, 
fundamentally, by our desire to improve learners’ use of academic English. Corpus analysis 
allows the studying of a particular group and the corpus compilation seemed to be a great 
challenge to be pursued as, ultimately, it would be the basis for developing appropriate materials 
and new courses. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to present the compilation of a learner 
corpus, much needed in our research and teaching context, pointing out the advantages of 
building this type of corpus for the understanding of learners’ needs as well as for pedagogical 
decision-making based on sound data. The following sections will deal, firstly, with the 
literature, which is the basis of our work, secondly, with the methodological paths taken to 
compile the academic English learner corpus and thirdly, with studies based on CorIFA. 
 
2. Theoretical background 
 
Types of English spoken as an additional language10 far outnumber native-speaker varieties11 
inspiring the study of non-native spoken or written English. This is the focus of ‘learner corpus 
research’12 (LCR), an umbrella term (Granger et al., 2015) to refer to interlanguage 
investigations that are based on corpus linguistics. A corpus is a “collection of pieces of language 
text in electronic form” (Sinclair, 2005: 19) compiled according to some criteria, and 
representing a language or language variety. Corpus compilation requires establishing precise 
and broadly-inclusive criteria for the consideration of the mode (e.g.,written), the type (e.g.,a 
 
9 CorIFA stands for Corpus de Inglês para Fins Acadêmicos. 
10 An additional language is understood as the language someone learns and uses which is not their first language.

12 Other research areas, such as second language acquisition (SLA) (i.e. Mitchell et al., 2013) and psycholinguistics 
(i.e., Fernández et al., 2017), also investigate English non-native speakers’ production (oral/written).   
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-460x202149731
research article) and the domain (e.g., academic) of the texts, the language or language varieties 
(e.g.,learner English), location of texts (e.g.,compiled in Brazil) and text production dates (e.g., 
from 2015-2020), according to Sinclair (2005). With a focus on description of language use, 
corpus linguistics, using a range of linguistic software tools, allows both quantitative and 
qualitative approaches to learner language. Among its advantages are the capacity to deal with a 
considerable amount of data, and generalizability of results across similar groups. A well-
designed corpus, therefore, is representative of a population. As Biber points out:   
 
Any selection of texts is a sample. Whether or not a sample is 'representative', 
however, depends first of all on the extent to which it is selected from the range of 
text types in the target population; an assessment of this representativeness thus 
depends on a prior full definition of the 'population' that the sample is intended to 
represent, and the techniques used to select the sample from that population. 
(Biber, 1993, p. 243) 
 
A careful corpus design enables generalizations of results, as statistical tests are often used to 
treat data. In this section, we will highlight some learner corpus research, focusing on their 
design characteristics and how they have coped with representativeness to be able to make 
comparisons across registers or groups, for instance.  
 
The design of two of the largest learner corpora compiled in the 1990s (Granger, 1998) are worth 
mentioning: the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) and the Longman Learners’ 
Corpus (LLC), especially due to how they have dealt with language, task and learner-related 
features (Tono, 2003). Language-related features are mode, genre, style and topic. These corpora 
encompass texts in the written mode with slight differences in the other features: mostly 
argumentative essays on a previously defined list of topics in ICLE and essays and exam scripts 
on a variety of topics in LLC. Task-related characteristics concern (a) data collection: sectional 
rather than longitudinal, (b) type of elicitation: spontaneous as contrasted to prepared or edited 
texts, (c) production time: either fixed or timed or untimed and done as homework, and (d) use of 
references allowed, for instance, dictionaries, with such information recorded. As for learner-
related features, ICLE is a corpus with texts produced by university level students, while LLC 
allows for participation of different academic level groups.  Both corpora have texts written by 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-460x202149731
learners from a variety of first language backgrounds. While ICLE has high-intermediate to 
advanced material, LCC allows for the submission of texts at all levels. ICLE was “the first large 
collection of computerized learner data to be made available for research” while LLC “has been 
commercially available for research” (Tono, 2003, p. 800). Whereas ICLE has recently released 
a new version presenting over 5.5 million words (Granger et al., 2020); LLC, with 10 million 
words (Tono, 2003) does not have such updated information on their website.13  
  
Several learner corpus studies use Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA), which can be 
understood as analysis that “involves the comparison between learner language and the target 
language” (Granger, 2015, p. 13). Learner language has been called ‘Interlanguage Varieties’ 
(ILV), especially highlighting “the highly variable nature of interlanguage” (Granger, 2015, p. 
18).  This approach may compare students’ oral or written texts with native speakers’ texts (ILV 
vs. NS) (De Cock et al., 1998, on word combinations in a English learner corpus of French as a 
first language vs. an English native speaker corpus), interlanguage variety with learners’ first 
language and with native speakers’ (ILV vs. L1 vs. NS) (Altenberg & Taper, 1998) on adverbial 
connectors in Sw-ICLE14, in a Swedish as L1 corpus and in LOCNESS) or  two interlanguage 
varieties or more (ILV vs ILV) (Bohórquez, 2015, on lexical bundles on Ch-ICLE and Dt-
ICLE).15 
 
 
CIA study results can enhance practitioners’ understanding of their students’ needs; nevertheless, 
teachers may choose to collect their own class corpus as a Do-It-Yourself Corpus (DIY corpus)16 
or create data-driven learning (DDL) (Johns, 1991) activities based on ready-made corpora 
(e.g.,COCA, BNC17) or on their DIY corpus.  It is worth mentioning that DDL (Johns, 1991, 
1994) allows students access to corpus data and concordancing softwares as part of their 
language-learning process. Using the figure of Sherlock Holmes as a metaphor, Johns (1997) 
explains that learners are seen as detectives as they are encouraged, for example, to search and

17 There are several online corpora that can be sources of real language use (e.g., https://www.english-
corpora.org/coca/; https://www.english-corpora.org/bnc/).  
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-460x202149731
identify grammatical rules, vocabulary meaning, collocations and lexico-grammatical patterns, to 
name a few. Following Johns' (1991, p. 4) DDL format "identify-classify-generalize", learners 
who participated in Lee’s research (2011) had the opportunity to learn and practice prepositions 
through the analysis of concordance lines. They explored a corpus comprising texts from 
J.K.Rowling's book Harry Potter and the Philosopher' Stone,  concentrating on verb-preposition 
collocates. DDL activities raised students' awareness of the use of prepositions while it helped 
them to figure out the uses and functions of certain phrasal verbs. DDL contributed to students' 
language acquisition, proving to be a good way to prepare for exams, as it created a learning 
context with more enthusiasm and student autonomy (Lee, 2011).  
 
Researchers compiling their own corpus need to adopt strict design criteria. According to Gilquin 
(2015, p. 16), in the case of learner corpora creation, the rules adopted are “even more crucial, 
given the highly heterogeneous nature of interlanguage” and such design criteria will be fully 
addressed in the next section. Moreover, few studies investigated students’ texts produced in 
their own class writing contexts (Staples & Reppen, 2016), a gap that CorIFA studies serves to 
fill as the corpus is compiled from class activities in “English for Academic Purposes.” With 
detailed gathering of learner metadata, and careful consideration of task and language variables, 
as described in the next section, CorIFA allows for thorough studies on classroom contextualized 
learner writing. 
 
3. CorIFA: a learner corpus  
  
According to Reppen (2010, p. 33), building a corpus requires a significant time investment as it 
involves a set of highly interconnected procedures. From collecting the texts to saving, storing, 
marking-up and adding metadata, the researcher is faced with a vast number of decisions that 
need to be considered when compiling a corpus. CorIFA was originally created in 2013 at a 
Brazilian public university. An overview of its compilation history, challenges and shifts is 
presented in this section. Above all, the corpus objective has remained the same: to describe 
Brazilian university students’ written English interlanguage, as produced in a pedagogical 
context.  
 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-460x202149731
Data collection was inspired, at first, by the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE). 
CorIFA and ICLE carry similarities regarding task variables, such as, task medium, genre, topic 
and task setting. CorIFA compilation started with written tasks: argumentative essays, such as 
those in ICLE. Students were asked to write essays based on previously chosen topics, such as 
the internet, feminism, science and technology. Teachers asked the students to write their essays 
in class or at home, submitting them by email. Essay length, another task variable, was different 
from ICLE, since the latter required texts to be from 500 to 1000 words; whereas CorIFA 
allowed, at that time, 200 to 300-word essays. Regarding the learner variables, ICLE and CorIFA 
participants' age range and learning context are similar; the data for both corpora come from 
university students who have learned English in a non-English speaking country. The main 
differences between the two corpora, however, entail first language, academic level, discipline 
and language proficiency. At this point, we will refer only to first language as the other 
characteristics will be fully discussed in the following section. ICLE encompasses subcorpora 
with English texts from speakers of a variety of languages (e.g.,Chinese, Turkish, Portuguese, 
French, etc.) while CorIFA’s participants are mainly Portuguese speakers18. Finally, the consent 
forms were in printed format when the corpus started being collected with basic information 
from the students, for instance, name and enrollment number. As consent forms were modified 
later on by the research group to collect more metadata, the texts collected in 2013 were 
discarded. 
 
In 2014 another attempt to collect student texts and compile a learner corpus was made. As the 
primary goal of having students write texts was pedagogical, many decisions were taken by the 
subject teachers and, thus, most essays were handwritten. The time and effort demanded to 
transform the written texts into a digital format led the research group not to include 2014 texts 
into CorIFA. The group considered that, despite transcriber training, there were risks of 
misspelling or grammar errors being modified by the person digitizing the documents or by 
computer spell checkers, leading to texts that would not reflect students’ real English level. Since 
the experience of receiving paper-based texts did not facilitate the process of corpus compilation, 
 
18 CorIFA has a subcorpus of a few texts written by speakers of other languages, such as Spanish, French, that were 
written by foreign students in exchange programs in Brazil. This subcorpus is not included in the issues addressed in 
this article. 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-460x202149731
from 2015 on, the texts have been collected only in digital format, where students fill in an 
online form. 
 
In 2015, there was a compilation of texts written in controlled and uncontrolled time settings. 
First, students submitted texts as part of in-class mock tests, to capture students' skills in writing 
under time constraints and with a proposed topic. Three were mock tests for B1 and B2 level 
students. All of them presented the same instructions regarding text production. Students had to 
write a 300-word essay (minimum) based on a set topic in 30 minutes. Since digital text 
collection worked well, the compilation process became standardized, and, from 2016 on, 
students have submitted texts with distinct registers through online forms, according to their 
proficiency level, as described in Table 1. Systematic corpus compilation has allowed the 
research group to keep a sound learner corpus, which will be described in the following section. 
Before sending their texts, learners are asked to fill in a digital form through Google Forms with 
their information and to read a consent form for their participation in the research, with which 
they may choose to agree or disagree. This form comprises students’ information in a way that 
helps researchers keep better records of participants’ social and linguistic backgrounds, and 
specificities of the task. Such a consent letter is provided in the Appendix. 
 
CorIFA is composed of texts written by undergraduate and graduate students from different 
courses at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. These students are registered in one of the 
five English for Academic Purposes (IFA)19 subjects created in 2012 as part of a set of initiatives 
to expand and enhance the internationalisation process of the university. Students register 
according to proficiency levels, ranging from intermediate to advanced (B1-C1), following the 
Common European Framework of Reference20 for Languages. As part of each subject’s 
assessment, students from each level are required to write to a specific academic register (Table 
1). Before being accepted in one of IFA subjects, students' proficiency level must be checked. 
Students may either submit scores on a standard proficiency test, such as TOEFL or IELTs, or 
take an internal placement test.

The corpus carries an array of academic registers from statement of purpose to research paper. 
Students write their texts as course requirements, following the teachers’ instructions in terms of 
number of words and topics. The registers have been gradually distributed, starting with, for 
example, statement of purposes or summaries in IFA I and, ending with a research paper or 
literature review for IFA V. After students turn in the first draft text, teachers adjust the teaching 
of that register to their students’ needs. Each subject design includes several exercises on each 
register and the opportunity for text editing. Students then submit a second and/or third draft that 
is edited and graded. For the corpus compilation, these texts are categorized into unedited and 
edited versions. 
 
One of the text variables for CorIFA is length in words. IFA teachers may determine text word 
ranges based on their experience with the students’ level and on register characteristics. Average 
word length is kept as presented in Table 2, which also shows the total number of words per 
register and in the whole corpus.

The corpus shows (Table 2) great differences among registers as far as word average length.  It 
consists of six written registers, each ranging in length from 225.39 to 1,564.50 words. The one 
which surpasses all the others in terms of length in words is the research article. This reflects the 
reality of the linguistic features among registers, especially related to their nature, which includes 
physical mode, setting, production circumstances, etc. (Biber & Finegan, 1994), in which some 
registers do require more words than others. Moreover, since writers must include several 
sections in a research article, which Biber and Finegan (1994, p. 131) call “standard four-part 
organization (Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion - IMRD)” the number of words will 
certainly surpass other registers in our corpus. The shortest type of text produced by CorIFA 
participants was the abstract. This register, which could also be understood as part of a research 
article, has a clear communicative purpose to sum up the article, presenting its aims,

methodology, results, and conclusion. Oftentimes, journals and conferences limit the number of 
words in an abstract (Swales & Feak, 2009) imposing on the writer the need to be concise. 
 
Another essential aspect carefully planned during corpus compilation was to account for texts 
per academic level, a learner variable, since participants may either be undergraduate or graduate 
students (see Figure 1). As the IFA subjects are elective, students at both academic levels can be 
registered.  
 
Figure 1 − Students per academic level and area 
 
 
From the first semester of 2016 on, the number of collected samples was quite higher than in the 
previous year, a situation that remains. The reason that 2015 had the smallest number of samples 
is due to the compilation process, which were through mock tests, as previously mentioned. Not 
all students produced the task, many did not give consent to have their texts included in the 
corpus and some texts did not achieve the minimum words. Therefore, fewer texts remained to 
be part of the corpus. 
 
The greatest number of samples in the corpus comes from students enrolled in courses from the 
following areas: Physical Sciences and Engineering and Biological and Health Sciences. 
Humanities and Arts, on the other hand, constitute the discipline area with the smallest number 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-460x202149731
of samples (see Figure 2). This corpus characteristic is very likely due to the total number of 
students from Humanities and Arts and Social Sciences and Education enrolled in English for 
Academic Purposes disciplines being considerably lower than those in the Biological and Hard 
Sciences fields. 
 
Figure 2 − Texts per students’ discipline area 
 
 
 
Another characteristic related to the corpus design is its potential for longitudinal studies, as its 
data can help researchers better understand the relationship between students’ writing 
development and proficiency level. There is a paucity of learner corpus studies from a 
longitudinal perspective (except for Biber et al., 2020; Goutéraux, 2013; Littré, 2015; Meunier & 
Littré, 2013). Up to 2019, 217 students submitted texts for more than one semester. Among 
these, 197 submitted them for a period of one year (two semesters), and 20 for more than one 
year (3 semesters or more). Interestingly, CorIFA data may come from students who started 
taking IFA classes as undergraduate students and continued to register after starting a graduate 
program.  
 
Compiling a learner corpus in a pedagogical context has been challenging, since, for a couple of 
years, data collection procedures changed, as described. After establishing consistent 
compilation parameters, the corpus grew steadily. Its task and learner variable complexities 
allow for a multitude of investigations, some of which will be shown in the next section.

4. Studies based on CorIFA 
 
In this section, we survey the backdrop of studies that employ CorIFA in their research.  In the 
past six years, since the beginning of its compilation, the corpus has been a rich linguistic 
database for Brazilian researchers. Hitherto, research has mainly centered on learners’ language 
description and on contrasting learners’ written interlanguage with data from other corpora using 
CIA (as pointed out in section 2). Relying on two main academic genres: argumentative essays 
and abstracts, the studies focus on the understanding of learners' use of English as they are at 
different proficiency levels and also on detecting their underuse or overuse of specific linguistic 
features. Most studies use a reference corpus composed of well-evaluated non-native speakers’ 
essays or native-speakers’ texts. The topics encompass linking adverbials, collocations, that-
clauses, conjunctions, noun phrases, and passive constructions. For organizational reasons, first, 
we bring an overview of one descriptive study and five investigations that fall under the CIA 
perspective. This section ends with a CorIFA-based study that highlights a pedagogical 
intervention, leading to reflections on applications of learner corpus research.   
 
Focusing on the interlanguage itself, Queiroz (2019) explores CorIFA deeply to shed light on 
novice writers’ use of noun phrases. These phrases have been regarded as a common linguistic 
feature in expert academic texts, mainly research articles (Biber et al., 2009; Parkinson & 
Musgrave, 2014; Gray, 2015; Biber & Gray, 2016). To investigate the grammatical complexity 
of noun phrases (NPs), the study analyzes general topic essays and specific topic essays21 from a 
CorIFA subcorpus and provides a thorough description of pre and post-modification of the types: 
adjective + noun and noun + prepositional phrase. Two of the study's findings are particularly 
noteworthy. First, surprisingly, the subcorpus analysis of upper-intermediate level texts revealed 
a higher use of complex NPs (59.3%) than simple ones (35%).  Second, NPs were more frequent 
in the specific topic essays, which is interpreted as quite positive writing practice as complex 
 
21 “General topic texts were those in which the EAP instructor presented a topic or question, e.g., Does technology 
make us more alone? to all students to write an argumentative essay about. Many of these topics were similar to the 
ones used in English proficiency tests. On the other hand, specific topic texts were those in which students were 
allowed to choose a topic of their preference to write about. Many wrote essays about their graduate studies, such as 
one dentistry student who wrote about periodontal disease and premature delivery.” Queiroz (2019, p. 57). 
. 
 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-460x202149731
NPs are characteristic of academic registers: “it can be assumed that Brazilian learners due to 
their proficiency level [B2], the academic context of writing, and the probable contact with 
specialized texts in English from their own disciplines, are capable of using structurally complex 
and compressed phrasal structures, often characteristic of professional academic writing” 
(QUEIROZ, 2019, p. 112). Above all, this last result shows that discipline-specific tasks can 
propel writing at the university level that is more suitable to the academic context. This research 
makes evident the potential of descriptive corpus-based research to contribute to applied 
linguistics, in this case, EAP. The corpus design allowed a task variable (specific topic versus 
general topic task) to emerge as the one that affected NP use by Brazilian upper-intermediate 
level university novice writers.     
 
Three of the CIA studies carried out based on CorIFA are on learners’ use of conjunctions, 
which have been considered key features in text coherence (Halliday & Hasan, 1976; Chen, 
2006; Liu, 2008; Zihan, 2014). Yet, these linguistic features “are not always needed and (...) they 
have to be used with discrimination” (Altenberg & Tapper, 1998, p. 80), posing difficulties to 
learners as they “tend[s] to vary from one language and culture to another” (Altenberg & Tapper, 
1998, p. 81). Dutra et al. (2017 and 2019) and Santos (2008) used a CorIFA subcorpus of B1 
level argumentative essays, contrasting it to LOCNESS. Despite the fact that these investigations 
dealt with different conjunctions; Dutra et al. (2017) studied addition words (besides and also), 
Dutra et al. (2019) result markers (thus, so and therefore) and Santos (2018) contrasting 
connectors (but and however), they all detected either substantial quantitative differences 
(underuse or overuse as compared to LOCNESS or MICUSP), sentence position disparities, as 
well as discourse function inadequacies on the part of the learners. For instance, the marker so is 
used three times more in CorIFA than in LOCNESS, assuming beginning sentence functions of 
initiating a topic or announcing that an idea is going to be presented again (DUTRA et al., 2019), 
which have been attested as oral discourse markers (Carter & McCarthy, 2006).  An 
interpretation shared by the three CorIFA investigations based on learners’ overuse of 
conjunctions in sentence initial position is that register awareness needs to be better addressed in 
the Brazilian university context.

The use of verbs was the focus of two other CorIFA CIA studies. While Guedes (2017) 
concentrates on the most frequent academic verbs present in argumentative essays in CorIFA, 
comparing verb usage to that in British Academic Written English corpus (BAWE), Nunes and 
Orfanò (2020) analyze verbs in research abstracts within the system of transitivity in passive 
that-clauses, contrasting the learner corpus results to a Lingua Franca Corpus22 composed of 
abstracts from soft and hard sciences. Little action verb variation and low frequency of adverb + 
verb collocations in CorIFA essays as compared to BAWE showed Brazilian learners' lack of 
familiarity with the academic register (Guedes, 2017). As for the verbs used in abstracts, Nunes 
and Orfanò (2020) also found the learners’ choices of verbs inadequate. They use more mental 
verbs (conclude, verify and assume) while expert writers show preference for relational verbs 
(show, demonstrate and reveal). Another observed result is that learners delete the conscious 
agent and thus remain distant from the findings they discuss. Researchers, on the other hand, 
seem to be more actively conscious of the object of study they investigate, showing more 
intellectual authority. Developing authorship is a skill that needs to be included in EAP classes; 
corpus-driven linguistic analysis like this one and the study on verb variation and collocations 
can inform teachers in their practice.  
 
The studies with our learner corpus described up to this point show the extent to which specific 
corpus analysis can shed light on the understanding of learners’ linguistic needs, considering the 
register they wrote, their proficiency level and type of tasks. The ultimate general goal of 
developing such studies is catering to learners’ exact difficulties because more precisely 
designed activities can be prepared and the course syllabus redesigned. A good example of a 
combination of interlanguage analysis and classroom activities was developed by Alves and 
Pinto (2018). First, the study investigated how results and conclusions were reported in abstracts 
in two apprentice corpora: CorIFA and MICUSP. CorIFA analysis provided real examples of 
learner language and the access to MICUSP allowed students to experience a corpus linguistics 
pedagogical practice: Do-it-Yourself (DIY) corpora (McEnery et al., 2006). Students compiled 
their own study corpus and were able to raise their awareness on how to improve the final two 
 
22 The reference corpus called English Lingua Franca Corpus (Nunes & Orfanò, 2020) consists of abstracts taken 
from journals belonging to three main areas: Life Sciences, Exact Sciences and Human Sciences.  
 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-460x202149731
rounds of abstracts. MICUSP was a suitable corpus for DIY since they are formed by well-
evaluated university papers and the online framework allows for the user to choose discipline-
specific texts.   
 
The agenda for the future is promising and shall contemplate among other issues, advances in 
research methodologies, granting better access to students' interlanguage, longitudinal studies 
and description variation across registers and discipline. Furthermore, it is of utmost importance 
that DDL activities (Johns, 1991) are more present in the language classroom, providing 
information on their advantages and limitations, and thus transferring research data into direct 
application, as in Almeida et al. (in press).   
 
5.  Conclusion  
 
The overall aim of this paper was to present the rationale behind building an academic learner 
corpus, making the case that such a process is paramount for revealing traces of learners' written 
interlanguage. The main principles regarding corpus compilation were presented associated with 
the design criteria adopted for CorIFA. After that, we outlined the methodological procedures 
that were followed in the compilation process. The texts included in the corpus and the register 
associated with the students’ proficiency level were also explained indicating a vast range of 
topics for future studies.   
 
Subsequently, descriptive and CIA research based on data from CorIFA were presented to 
illustrate the contributions that the corpus has already provided for researchers interested in 
learner interlanguage. The studies pinpointed in this paper serve to reinforce the claim that 
compiling and observing a learner corpus can be an invaluable resource for language teachers 
keen to enhance their understanding of learners' output, enabling them to make more accurate 
pedagogical decisions for their classes.
