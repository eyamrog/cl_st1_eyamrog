Accurate diagnosis and proper management of cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) are essential to prevent the unnecessary prescription of infant formulas. In this study, our objective was to utilize the oral food challenge (OFC) for confirming CMPA and evaluating the development of natural tolerance to milk in children diagnosed with clinical CMPA. Additionally, we examined the economic implications on public health-care costs by reducing the prescription of infant formulas (supplied by the public health service of São Paulo State, Brazil, up to two years of age) following the exclusion of CMPA diagnosis in children with negative OFC outcomes.
Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the medical records of 76 children who underwent Oral Food Challenge (OFC) between January 2016 and June 2018. Among these children, 41 were male, with a median age of 2.0 years (range: 0.8-5.0), and 30 were aged ≤2 years. Results: Prior to OFC, 52 children (68.4%) were diagnosed with non-IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA), 20 (26.3%) with IgE-mediated CMPA, and five (5.3%) with mixed CMPA. The majority of children were receiving amino acid-based formulas (n=29, 38%). OFC results indicated a negative outcome in 58 children (76%), effectively ruling out CMPA. Among the 18 children (24%) with positive OFC results, the majority (n=10, 56%) presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. Following the exclusion of CMPA diagnosis, each child saved an average of 152.3 formula cans (equivalent to 2,161.14 US dollars) through the public health service, resulting in a total savings of 64,834.27 US dollars.
Conclusions: The utilization of Oral Food Challenge (OFC) was found to be crucial not only in accurately diagnosing Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA) and avoiding misdiagnoses, but also in curbing the unnecessary prescription of infant formulas. This practice, in turn, yielded positive outcomes by reducing public health costs associated with unnecessary medical interventions.
Cow's Milk Allergy (CMPA) stands as a prominent food allergy in childhood, boasting a global prevalence of 2%-3% within the pediatric age group and 1.8%-7.5% during the first year of life. In Brazil, estimates place the incidence and prevalence of CMPA at 2.2% and 5.4%, respectively, with recent escalations in these figures positioning CMPA as a pressing public health concern. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that the current prevalence rates may be inflated, given that CMPA diagnosis predominantly hinges on medical history alone.
The diagnosis of Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA) is challenging due to the diverse clinical presentations and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. CMPA can be categorized based on clinical and laboratory features into Non-IgE mediated (proctocolitis, enteropathy, enterocolitis), IgE-mediated (urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis), and mixed mechanisms involving both IgE and T cell-mediated responses (atopic dermatitis, gastroenteritis, eosinophilic esophagitis). The gold standard for diagnosing CMPA, irrespective of the mechanism, is the Oral Food Challenge (OFC) test, which serves to confirm the diagnosis and monitor the development of natural tolerance to milk. The OFC involves administering incremental doses of the allergen to the patient at specified intervals, following a period of elimination diet, and is conducted under controlled conditions. However, in the Brazilian clinical context, OFC is not routinely performed for CMPA diagnosis. This procedure is typically not covered by health insurance companies and is limited to specialized clinics, private hospitals, and university research centers.
The Public Health Service of the São Paulo State in Brazil offers monthly provision of infant formulas to patients diagnosed with CMPA until they reach two years of age. A clinical diagnosis of CMPA suffices for patients to access this benefit, without the routine requirement of an OFC result. Consequently, a significant number of children may be misdiagnosed, leading to unnecessary and restrictive diets, including the costly use of infant formulas, potentially escalating public health-care expenses. These circumstances underscore the critical need for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of CMPA to mitigate public health-care costs. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OFC in confirming CMPA diagnosis in children, as well as to analyze the economic implications within a public health service by reducing the prescription of infant formulas following the exclusion of CMPA diagnosis in children with negative OFC outcomes.
This study was an observational, descriptive investigation that involved a review of medical records of 76 children between the ages of 0 and 12 who had been diagnosed with Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA) based on clinical manifestations. All participants underwent an open Oral Food Challenge (OFC) with cow's milk at the University of Campinas Teaching Hospital (HC Unicamp), a tertiary-care facility situated in Campinas, São Paulo State, Brazil, during the period spanning from January 2016 to June 2018. The OFC procedure served the dual purpose of confirming the diagnosis of CMPA and monitoring the development of tolerance to cow's milk in these patients.
The Oral Food Challenge (OFC) was conducted in accordance with our institutional protocol, necessitating an eight-week elimination diet period prior to the OFC to confirm the diagnosis of Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA) or to assess the development of natural tolerance to cow's milk. Children aged one year and above were administered Type A pasteurized cow's milk, while those under one year received a milk formula containing intact milk protein, with doses increasing every 15 minutes over five stages, totaling 120 mL. Throughout the process, patients were closely monitored by a pediatric immunologist or pediatric gastroenterologist to identify any objective or subjective adverse reactions to cow's milk, which could prompt cessation of the OFC if persistent or severe. Symptoms of CMPA, including skin, mucosal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory manifestations, as well as anaphylaxis, were meticulously observed. A week post-OFC, patients were assessed for delayed adverse reactions. Any adverse reactions, whether immediate or delayed, were considered indicative of CMPA.
The medical records of patients who underwent Oral Food Challenge (OFC) were meticulously examined to identify key variables including sex, age at symptom onset, feeding habits at symptom onset, clinical manifestations of Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA), allergy mechanism, specific milk formulas used during the elimination diet phase, age at OFC, rationale for conducting the test, and symptoms in patients with positive results. To evaluate the economic impact on public health-care costs post-exclusion of CMPA diagnosis following a negative OFC outcome, the study considered the price per can of infant formulas provided by São Paulo State's Public Health Service, categorized by formula type (amino acid-based, extensively hydrolyzed, or soy-based), and the monthly availability of formula cans for children diagnosed with CMPA based on their age. Parameters such as money saved (number of cans saved multiplied by price per can), average monthly savings (total saved amount divided by months without formula intake), and total savings per child were calculated. The number of cans saved was determined by estimating the cans that would have been provided until the child turned 24 months old if OFC had not been conducted. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies, while numerical variables were expressed as means and standard deviations for normally distributed data or as medians and interquartile ranges for non-normally distributed data, with normality assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Data analysis was carried out using IBM® SPSS® Statistics software version 24 and Microsoft® Excel 365.
The study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Campinas (Unicamp) under the reference number 2932486 on October 2, 2018.
The characteristics of the 76 evaluated patients are detailed in Table 1, where it is noted that the majority of patients were male and began exhibiting clinical symptoms before the age of one year. Following the onset of CMPA symptoms, a significant portion of infants were given a standard cow’s milk-based formula containing intact milk protein, with 16 (21.1%) children exclusively breastfed and 29 (38.2%) patients either consuming whole milk (or its derivatives) or a combination of breast milk and infant formulas. Non-IgE mediated CMPA emerged as the most prevalent type diagnosed within the study cohort. Amino acid-based formulas were predominantly prescribed during the elimination diet phase, preceding oral food challenges (OFC). In cases where symptoms persisted, some patients had their extensively hydrolyzed formula replaced with amino acid-based alternatives. Notably, twelve children utilized more than one type of infant formula during the elimination diet period. The outcomes of OFC testing were...
The median age of the children at the time of oral food challenge (OFC) was 2.0 years [0.8-5.0]. OFC was primarily conducted to assess the development of tolerance to cow’s milk. The results of OFC, in conjunction with the symptoms exhibited by patients with positive outcomes, are detailed in Table 2. Among the patients who tested positive during OFC, eight (44.4%) displayed symptoms indicative of IgE-mediated cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA) and were managed with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators. Of these cases, seven individuals responded well to treatment, while one experienced an anaphylactic reaction necessitating administration of adrenaline. The anaphylactic symptoms were promptly alleviated, leading to the patient's discharge following a 48-hour observation period. In total, 10 patients reported gastrointestinal symptoms during OFC, with eight exhibiting delayed symptoms such as diarrhea or bloody stools, and two presenting with acute Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES), characterized by prolonged vomiting that required hospitalization. These patients showed improvement and were discharged within a short period. The majority of patients did not manifest immediate or delayed symptoms post-OFC, resulting in a classification of OFC-negative and subsequent suspension of the elimination diet.
Among the children who tested negative for OFC, 30 were under 24 months of age, with the majority receiving a clinical diagnosis of non-IgE-mediated CMPA, and predominantly utilizing amino acid-based formula during their elimination diet period (refer to Table 3). Following the exclusion of CMPA, the average number of cans saved per child by the public health service was calculated at 152.3 cans, with a range of 40 to 226 (see Table 4). The mean cost saved per child was estimated to be 2,161.14 US dollars, with a range of 225.82 to 3,509.78 (refer to Table 5). The collective amount saved within the study population totaled 64,834.27 US dollars (refer to Table 6).
Concerns have been raised regarding the overdiagnosis of Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA) in childhood, both in Brazil and internationally. Our study results support these concerns, as a significant majority of children clinically diagnosed with CMPA at our hospital were found to be misdiagnosed, as evidenced by negative Oral Food Challenge (OFC) results. Such misdiagnoses can have severe implications not only for patients' growth and nutrition but also for the overall costs of public healthcare. Despite evaluating a limited number of patients, our findings demonstrate substantial cost savings for a state public health system by avoiding the unnecessary provision of expensive infant formulas. This underscores the necessity of a comprehensive diagnostic approach for CMPA and the potential pitfalls of relying solely on clinical criteria.
Most children assessed in the current study were clinically diagnosed with non-IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA), a concerning finding given that symptoms in this condition manifest more gradually and are not specific to CMPA or other food allergies. Consequently, diagnosis can only be confirmed through an elimination diet followed by reintroduction. Allergy specialists have recently expressed apprehension regarding the potential for patients with non-IgE-mediated CMPA to inadvertently consume infant formulas unnecessarily due to these complexities. A population-based study revealed that 243 out of 381 children with suspected adverse reactions to cow's milk were misdiagnosed with CMPA, exhibiting symptoms distinct from those with IgE-mediated CMPA. In our study, the majority of patients had CMPA ruled out following oral food challenges (OFC), with less than half of those with positive OFC results displaying symptoms of IgE-mediated CMPA. Immunoassays detecting serum allergen-specific IgE could serve as a valuable adjunct for screening and guiding clinical management in such cases, boasting good sensitivity and specificity, ease of use, and the ability to analyze multiple samples simultaneously. However, it is important to note that inconclusive results may arise due to the immature immune system in children, and elevated IgE levels in atopic cases could skew serological findings. OFC proved particularly essential for children with non-IgE-mediated CMPA, enabling them to reintroduce cow's milk more easily and in tolerable quantities into their diets. Regrettably, OFC is not routinely conducted in public health services in Brazil, with most patients in our study being referred to HC Unicamp from other public primary or secondary care units. Enhancing access to OFC in secondary care facilities could facilitate the identification of more misdiagnosed children.
There was a significant decrease in the costs associated with providing infant formula by São Paulo State's public health service following the exclusion of 58 (76.3%) misdiagnosed cases of CMPA, as indicated in Tables 4-6. This achievement is noteworthy, especially considering the relatively low patient volume in a single center. The issue of CMPA overdiagnosis and excessive expenditure on infant formula is not unique to São Paulo, as evidenced by the English National Health System experiencing a nearly 500% surge in prescriptions for these products between 2006 and 2016, with a corresponding 700% increase in NHS spending from 8.1 million to 60 million British pounds annually. Another study revealed that conducting Oral Food Challenges incurred an average cost of $4184 per child per year of delayed testing. In our investigation, amino acid-based formula emerged as the primary therapeutic choice for most patients, despite lacking clear indications for its use. This formula, while costly, may not always be the optimal solution for allergic children. Notably, a recent Cochrane review of 16 studies found no substantial evidence supporting the use of extensively hydrolyzed formula for preventing CMPA in children, compared to maternal breastfeeding or milk-based formula. While there is evidence of cow's milk protein transfer from mother to child through breastfeeding, the quantities transferred are unlikely to trigger CMPA symptoms, and the evidence supporting maternal elimination diets for treating nonspecific symptoms is weak. Misdiagnosed CMPA cases can lead to unnecessary concerns among mothers, potentially prompting them to discontinue breastfeeding in favor of formula feeding. This shift can have serious repercussions for infants who may struggle to tolerate formula, impacting their growth and nutrition, as well as for mothers who may experience postpartum depression due to breastfeeding cessation. These findings are particularly pertinent in a country like Brazil, where approximately 11 million individuals are diagnosed with CMPA, with four million new cases annually. Given that most diagnoses in Brazil are symptom-based, implementing measures for more accurate CMPA diagnosis nationwide could lead to significant cost savings for public health services and improve the health outcomes of both mothers and children.
While the importance of OFC is evident both in our study and in the literature, it is crucial to acknowledge that this test is not without risks. In our research, we observed reactions, including a case of anaphylaxis, in a significant number of OFC-positive children, with most reactions being confined to a single organ as detailed in Table 2. Fortunately, all cases were promptly and effectively managed without any further complications. Despite the limited literature on the safety of OFC, Anagnostou et al.24 conducted a study assessing the safety of OFC in children up to two years of age, noting that symptoms, if present, were predominantly skin-related. Their findings led to the conclusion that OFC in infants carries acceptable risks. Given that symptoms resulting from OFC are generally manageable, and considering its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and proven benefits for CMPA screening, we also believe that the risks associated with OFC are acceptable, provided that the test is conducted in strict adherence to the appropriate protocol.
Naturally, our study has limitations. Firstly, the low number of patients seen in a single center introduces a potential selection bias. Including a larger and more diverse population from multiple centers would enhance the reliability of our statistical analyses. Additionally, we were restricted to conducting only the open OFC, rather than the double-blinded OFC, which is considered the most robust method. Despite the small sample size, our findings demonstrate that OFC application successfully identified a significant proportion of patients previously misdiagnosed with CMPA. This enabled our clinical staff to discontinue several costly and unnecessary formula-based diets, resulting in a direct economic benefit for the public health service in São Paulo State.
We assert that the involvement of the Oral Food Challenge (OFC) is pivotal in the accurate identification of misdiagnosed cases of Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA), particularly in patients with non-IgE-mediated CMPA, facilitating the easier reintroduction of milk in tolerable quantities into their diets. The exclusion of CMPA leads to a significant decrease in the necessity for prescribing infant formulas, thereby potentially yielding favorable outcomes in terms of children's growth, nutrition, and overall development, while also enhancing the quality of life for both children and mothers. Our findings underscore that the cessation of unnecessary formula-based regimens can have a beneficial economic impact on public health systems, resulting in substantial cost savings that would otherwise be allocated towards the provision of these formulas. It is imperative to advocate for the wider implementation of OFC in secondary healthcare facilities to enhance public accessibility to this diagnostic test.
