In light of the swift dissemination of COVID-19, the scientific community has been actively seeking to identify factors that could impact the course of viral infections. While research on the novel coronavirus remains limited, it is well-established that maintaining optimal serum levels of micronutrients is crucial for the body's response to infectious diseases. Therefore, our objective is to examine the implications of deficiencies in vitamin A, D, iron, zinc, or folate on the prognosis of individuals with respiratory infections exhibiting symptoms akin to those of COVID-19. Additionally, we intend to explore the potential benefits of supplementing these nutrients in the context of the conditions discussed in this review.
METHODS: A systematic search was carried out across the databases PubMed, Lilacs, and SciELO to identify observational studies published between 2010 and 2020. The focus was on studies reporting findings related to individuals exhibiting respiratory tract infections with symptoms resembling those of COVID-19.
RESULTS: Six articles meeting the inclusion criteria focused on deficiencies of vitamins A and D. Vitamin A deficiency was commonly linked to symptoms such as cough, fever, and increased total respiratory resistance. Conversely, vitamin D insufficiency was associated with elevated rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation requirements, and mortality. However, the evidence establishing precise connections between nutritional deficiencies and COVID-19 is limited due to the scarcity of studies and variations in population subgroups.
In conclusion, deficiencies in vitamins A and D appear to have a detrimental impact on the prognosis of respiratory tract infections. When considering supplementation of these nutrients for the prevention or treatment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, it is crucial to take into account factors such as serum levels, nutritional status, and housing conditions (e.g., endemic location) of individuals.
The emergence of Coronavirus (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has posed a significant public health challenge due to its rapid global spread [1]. As per the World Health Organization (WHO) report [2], by April 30, 2020, the pandemic had led to 3,090,445 confirmed cases worldwide, with over 217,000 deaths attributed to clinical symptoms following infection, such as fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath [3,4].
Various risk factors that influence the disease prognosis in patients infected with the novel coronavirus encompass advanced age, the presence of chronic non-communicable conditions like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases [5,6], alongside immune dysregulation [7].
The significance of maintaining proper nutritional status to regulate the immune response and reduce susceptibility to infections is widely acknowledged in existing literature [8,9]. Micronutrients like vitamin A, D, iron, zinc, and folate are specifically noted for their involvement in various aspects of the immune response, encompassing the differentiation, proliferation, and functionality of innate immune cells, the control of cytokine levels, and the generation and maturation of antibodies [8].
In light of the dearth of scientific evidence concerning the impact of nutritional deficiencies on the prognosis of viral infections, particularly in the context of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, this study sought to evaluate the effects of deficiencies in vitamin A, D, iron, zinc, or folate on the prognosis of patients presenting with respiratory infections exhibiting symptoms akin to those of COVID-19. The aim was to conduct a literature-based analysis to explore the potential implications of these deficiencies and to discuss the potential benefits of supplementing these nutrients in the management of such infections.
The systematic review adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) [10] and the research protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) [11] under registration number CRD42020178982.
The methodological procedure was conducted between March and 30 April 2020, guided by the question formulated using the PECO acronym [12]: "Does a deficiency in vitamin A, D, iron, zinc, or folate in individuals with respiratory infections exhibiting symptoms akin to COVID-19 result in a poorer prognosis compared to those without deficiencies?"
The electronic search was conducted across the databases Publisher Medline (PubMed), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Resource (LILACS), and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO). The search strategy incorporated the following descriptors: "Nutritional Deficiency," "Vitamin A," "Vitamin D," "Zinc," "Iron," "Anemia," "Folate," "Folic Acid," "Respiratory Tract Infections," "Influenza," and "Coronavirus." These descriptors were sourced from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) available at the U.S. National Library of Medicine (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/) and the list of Health Sciences Descriptors (http://decs.bvs.br).
The search algorithm utilized for PubMed was as follows: (("malnutrition"[MeSH Terms] OR "malnutrition"[All Fields] OR ("nutritional"[All Fields] AND "deficiency"[All Fields]) OR "nutritional deficiency"[All Fields]) AND ("vitamin a"[MeSH Terms] OR "vitamin a"[All Fields])) AND ("respiratory tract infections"[MeSH Terms] OR ("respiratory"[All Fields] AND "tract"[All Fields] AND "infections"[All Fields]) OR "respiratory tract infections"[All Fields]). To broaden the scope, the keywords were modified to encompass articles related to other micronutrients and infectious conditions such as influenza or coronavirus.
The selection criteria for articles encompassed original observational studies conducted on individuals with respiratory infections exhibiting symptoms similar to COVID-19, published between 2010 and 2020 in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. The assessment of similarity between the manifestations of respiratory infections reviewed and COVID-19 symptoms was based on the Epidemiological Bulletin on 2019-nCoV [13], which highlights a wide clinical overlap between COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, encompassing symptoms such as coughing, fever, shortness of breath, and even severe pneumonia.
Studies such as reviews, letters to the editor, theses, and dissertations focusing on bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, conducted using experimental models, and employing analytical methodologies centered on assessing the connection between infections and nutritional deficiencies were excluded from this review. In order to enhance the search sensitivity for studies related to iron deficiency, the term "anemia" was incorporated as a descriptor. Nevertheless, studies that solely identified anemia through hematocrit and hemoglobin assessments, without evaluating iron status using ferritin and transferrin receptor measures, were deemed ineligible for inclusion in this study [14,15].
The article screening process consisted of three stages: initially reading the title, followed by reviewing the abstract, and finally examining the full-text articles. Upon completion of the initial screening, full texts were carefully assessed to determine compliance with the predetermined inclusion criteria outlined in the established protocol. The authors conducted independent evaluations of the articles, after which they convened to compare and confirm the gathered data, aiming to minimize bias and ensure consistency in the analyses.
The articles assessed in this review were scored between 0 and 22 points based on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines [16].
Data extraction was conducted in Microsoft Excel 2016, utilizing a protocol devised by the researchers. This protocol encompassed essential data points such as the article's title, authorship details, publication location and year, study objectives and type, sample size, demographic characteristics of the study population, diagnosis and clinical manifestations of the infection under scrutiny, prevalence rates of nutritional deficiencies, and the clinical repercussions linked to these deficiencies.
The search for articles yielded 1,691 entries related to the surveyed micronutrients. After removing 29 duplicates, 1,662 articles remained. Following the application of eligibility criteria based on title and abstract information, 1,615 articles were excluded. Subsequently, 47 articles were thoroughly reviewed, leading to the final inclusion of 6 studies for this review (Figure 1).
As per the STROBE guidelines, the median quality score of the articles stood at 17.7 (Interquartile Range=15.6-18.8), with individual scores spanning from 15.6 to 20 points. It is noteworthy that all studies encompassed in the analysis surpassed the 50% threshold of this quality indicator, as illustrated in Chart 1.
The studies selected for analysis spanned the years 2012 to 2018 and encompassed participants from various regions including Europe [17], South America [18–20], North America [21], and Asia [22] (Chart 1). The total number of individuals involved in these studies was 4,352, comprising 3,388 children and 964 adults and elderly individuals of both genders. These participants had been diagnosed with conditions such as community-acquired pneumonia [18,22], acute upper respiratory tract infections [20], or acute lower respiratory infections [17,21], and were being assessed for the prediction of clinical symptoms associated with viral infections, notably cough with fever [19].
The research encompassed four studies conducted at a hospital [17, 18, 21, 22], one in a specialized clinic [20], and one in primary schools [19] as depicted in Chart 1. These studies comprised two cross-sectional investigations [18, 20], two prospective studies [17, 19], one population-based observational study [21], and one with a retrospective design [22].
In the initial search phase, we identified articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria for vitamin A [19–21] and vitamin D [17,18,21,22] as the key nutrients under investigation.
Vitamin A deficiency among non-hospitalized children aged 0 to 12 years with respiratory tract infections was found to have a prevalence ranging from 12% to 46%, with severe deficits affecting 1.2% to 3.9% of the participants. Studies indicated that serum retinol levels were inversely correlated with cough accompanied by fever (p=0.05) and an increase in total respiratory resistance in individuals without wheezing (p<0.05). Children with vitamin A deficiency were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (p<0.05), although this association lost significance upon adjusted analyses. Those with severe deficits were 2.4 times more likely to experience cough with fever. Furthermore, an increase of 10mg/dL of plasma retinol was identified as a protective factor, leading to 10% fewer days of cough with fever (p<0.001) and 6% fewer visits to the doctor (p<0.05). Amaral et al. (20) noted that patients with infections lacking wheezing and suffering from vitamin A deficiency faced challenges in recovering respiratory resistance even after receiving clinical treatment for the infection (Chart 2).
All the studies included in the analysis that evaluated the impact of vitamin D were conducted on hospitalized patients, irrespective of age. Among children, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varied from 12% to 85%, with a significant positive correlation with a heightened risk of severe respiratory distress symptoms (OR: 5.065; 95%CI: 1.998; 12.842; p<0.001). Children with vitamin D levels below 20ng/mL exhibited a 117% increased likelihood of requiring oxygen support and a 217% increased likelihood of needing respiratory assistance. Furthermore, Hurwitz et al. (21) demonstrated that vitamin D insufficiency in the pediatric cohort was linked to higher odds of ICU admission (OR: 3.29; 95%CI: 1.20; 9.02; p<0.05) and mechanical ventilation (OR: 11.2; 95%CI: 2.27; 55.25; p<0.001). In hospitalized adults and the elderly, vitamin D deficiency was prevalent in 80 to 85% of the subjects. Brance et al. (18) did not find any significant association between disease symptoms and respiratory infection levels. Conversely, Kim et al. (22) noted that, following statistical adjustments, there was an elevated risk of mortality within 28 days in the group with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency (OR: 3.31; 95%CI: 1.17–9.39; p<0.05) (Chart 2).
Micronutrient deficiency emerges as a significant etiological factor contributing to the global burden of diseases, with deficiencies in vitamins A, D, iron, zinc, and folate prominently recognized as crucial public health concerns, particularly prevalent in developing nations [23–25]. This epidemiological landscape has consequently influenced the selection of these specific micronutrients as focal points for the current review.
During the search stages, analyses of iron, zinc, and folate did not meet the required criteria for inclusion in this study. As a result, the findings were restricted to those related to vitamin A and D. These findings suggest that deficiencies in these nutrients may serve as predictors of clinical complications during the progression of the evaluated respiratory infections.
Research has consistently shown that preserving nutritional status is closely linked to immune function [26–28]. The International Society for Immunonutrition emphasizes the significance of consuming a varied and balanced diet, abundant in antioxidant nutrients, to encourage healthy eating habits during times of a pandemic [29].
Among the nutrients exhibiting such characteristics, vitamin A is a key component of intervention strategies due to its ability to decrease susceptibility to pathogens in the mucosal epithelium of the digestive and respiratory tracts [8]. It plays a crucial role in regulating the growth, differentiation, and gene expression of airway epithelial cells [30].
The functions described could partially account for the findings concerning vitamin A in this study. It was observed that a deficiency of this nutrient in children was linked to outcomes including cough with fever, increased doctor visits, higher total respiratory resistance, and reduced response to clinical treatment for acute upper respiratory infections.
In a study conducted by Qi et al. [31], which involved 684 Chinese children ranging in age from 5 months to 12 years old, it was found that vitamin A deficiency (retinol<0.2mg/L) was identified as a risk factor for the onset of acute respiratory tract infections (p<0.05). However, it is important to consider the potential presence of non-causal effects in these results, given that vitamin A levels can decrease in response to infectious conditions as part of the acute phase response [32].
Barbosa et al. (33) observed that serum retinol levels in Brazilian children with and without pneumonia were significantly lower during the inflammatory process compared to after recovery (1.11±0.43 vs. 1.38±0.30μmol/L; p<0.05). The authors attributed this difference to the acute phase response, which led to reduced mobilization of hepatic nutrient reserves, and the increased demand for retinol due to enhanced immune cell activity in pneumonia.
While the findings concerning vitamin D exhibit heterogeneity, it is established that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among individuals diagnosed with respiratory tract infections [34,35]. In a hospital-based retrospective case study by Inamo et al. (2011) [36], it was noted that Japanese children (with a mean age of 14.03±11.43 months) suffering from bronchiolitis or pneumonia and exhibiting vitamin D deficiency (<10ng/mL) were the ones requiring oxygen and/or ventilation support to a greater extent (p<0.01).
In contrast, Xu et al. (2016) conducted a study involving 2,694 individuals in Hong Kong and found no significant association between the lowest serum concentrations of 25(OH)D (<50nmol/l) and the risk of influenza virus infections (RR: 1.15; 95%CI: 0.73;1.83; p=0.55) after adjusting for variables such as age, sex, chronic disease, and vaccination history. However, the researchers did observe a correlation with the occurrence of influenza-like symptoms, defined as the presence of fever (≥37.8ºC) along with cough or sore throat (RR: 1.70; 95%CI: 1.14;2.51; p=0.01).
In a case-control study by Mamani et al. (2017) [35], involving 149 adults diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, it was found that individuals with deficient levels of vitamin D (<10ng/mL) had a 3.69-fold higher risk of pneumonia compared to those with sufficient levels (>20ng/mL) (p<0.01). The study reported a 95% confidence interval of 1.46 to 9.31 for this increased risk.
The biochemical profile of vitamin D in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 remains largely unexplored. Therefore, it is recommended that assessing vitamin D levels in initial blood samples could serve as a means to examine the influence of vitamin D levels on the prognosis of COVID-19 and to support the potential therapeutic role of vitamin D in managing 2019-nCoV.
In a recent publication by Zhang and Liu [38], the authors explore potential nutritional interventions for 2019-nCoV. They posit that vitamin A could serve as a promising strategy for both the treatment and prevention of lung infections. However, it is important to note that the authors do not provide specific recommendations regarding dosages or supplementation protocols.
The Cochrane review conducted by Chen et al. [39] highlighted unexpected outcomes associated with both megadose supplementation (100,000-206,000 IU/day) and low doses (5,000 IU/day or 8,333-10,000 IU/week or 20,000-45,000 IU every two months) of vitamin A in children aged 0 to 7 years. The findings indicated a lack of significant impact, with some studies even indicating a worsening of clinical symptoms such as cough with fever, tachypnea, and a higher incidence of acute respiratory infections among children receiving vitamin A supplementation. The authors suggested that the potential benefits might be more pronounced in children with pre-existing malnutrition. They concluded that lower doses of vitamin A resulted in fewer adverse effects while still offering comparable benefits to those observed with megadose supplementation.
In a study conducted by Mawson [30], a comprehensive analysis of vitamin A supplementation in Influenza infection was presented, confirming that supplemental vitamin A appears to trigger Influenza-like symptoms. This hypothesis was developed based on the observed rise in respiratory symptoms documented in the studies reviewed. However, the author ultimately asserts that retinoids can serve dual purposes of combating infection and eliciting symptoms, with the concentration of serum vitamin D playing a crucial role in determining the effects of retinoids. It is suggested that prior vitamin D deficiency may lead to heightened toxicity of endogenous retinoids.
Clinical trials investigating the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of respiratory infections and disease severity have yielded varied results [40-44]. This variability can be attributed to the wide range of vitamin D doses administered (ranging from 400 to 100,000 IU per day, week, or single dose) and the duration of the protocols (spanning from 5 days to 8 months). Nonetheless, a meta-analysis comprising 25 randomized controlled trials with a total of 10,933 participants demonstrated a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in protecting against acute respiratory tract infections [45].
A recent literature review [46] examining the evidence on vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that in a hospital setting, both patients and staff should consider taking vitamin D supplements to elevate 25(OH)D levels to a range of 40–50ng/mL (100–125nmol/L). The authors recommend an initial intake of 10,000IU/d for a month, followed by a maintenance dose of 5,000IU/d. However, they emphasize the need for further investigation through trials to ascertain the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence and mortality rates of influenza and COVID-19. These trials should aim to determine the optimal dosage, target serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and any potential safety concerns associated with supplementation.
In conclusion, deficiencies in vitamins A and D can have adverse effects on the prognosis of respiratory tract infections. Therefore, when considering supplementation of these nutrients for the prevention or treatment of patients with COVID-19, it is crucial to take into account their serum levels, nutritional status, and the specific endemic areas they are in.
Several limitations should be taken into account when interpreting the data presented in this study. These include the inclusion of observational studies, which may interfere with establishing causality relationships. The heterogeneity among the selected studies prevented the calculation of a summary measure through meta-analysis. Nevertheless, employing strategies like assessing the quality of articles can aid in mitigating this bias. Additionally, the lack of original studies focusing on nutrition in COVID-19 patients limited the inferential aspects of the findings.
It is crucial to underscore the significance of identifying endemic nutritional deficiencies within communities affected by the 2019-nCoV pandemic. This recognition is essential for implementing targeted interventions aimed at addressing deficiencies in serum vitamins and minerals, which in turn can have a direct impact on the management and outcome of infectious diseases.
