Pleroma eglanduliferum, Justino & P.J.F. Guim. sp. nov., a newly identified species of Melastomataceae (Melastomateae) originating from the Atlantic Forest of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, is meticulously described and visually represented in this study, alongside a thorough discussion on its affinities and distinctive characteristics. This species exhibits a close relationship with P. heteromallum (D. Don) D. Don and P. tedescoi Meirelles, L. Kollmann & R. Goldenb.) P.J.F . Guim. & Michelang., evident through similarities in plant architecture, such as quadrangular branches and leaf shape, as well as indument. Nevertheless, discernible differences emerge in the morphology of stamens and the sizes of bracteoles. Notably, due to its limited presence within a singular population confined to a specific area, Pleroma eglanduliferum warrants classification under the Critically Endangered category.
The Mantiqueira Range region stands as a significant orographic group within the Brazilian southeast, spanning across portions of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. This region serves as a sanctuary for approximately 20% of the remaining Atlantic Forest in Minas Gerais, as highlighted by Costa and Hermann in 2006.
This mountain chain comprises a diverse array of grassland and forest environments with significant biological diversity and a high prevalence of endemic species, a characteristic commonly observed in tropical mountainous regions (Martinelli 2007, Salimena et al. 2013). The Serra Negra region, located in southern Minas Gerais and encompassing the municipalities of Lima Duarte, Rio Preto, Santa Bárbara do Monte Verde, and Olaria, features a distinctive vegetation mix of forests and grasslands, particularly cloud forests and rocky grasslands known as "campos rupestres," found at elevations ranging from 1,300 to 1,700 meters (Salimena et al. 2013). Furthermore, this area stands out for its inclusion in the southeastern corridor of the Mantiqueira Complex, characterized by remnants of primary vegetation exhibiting a high level of connectivity among them (Salimena et al. 2013).
Within the Atlantic Domain, the Melastomataceae family is notably prominent, boasting a total of 510 taxa (Flora do Brasil 2020). Pleroma D. Don, a genus within the Melastomataceae family, comprises approximately 160 species with a Neotropical distribution, predominantly inhabiting regions within the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado domains, with sporadic occurrences in the Caatinga (Guimarães et al. 2019). Only five species extend to the northwest and west of South America (Freitas et al. 2013; Fraga and Guimarães 2014, Oliveira et al. 2014, Guimarães et al. 2019). Historically, this group was considered synonymous with the Tibouchina Aublet genus according to Cogniaux (1885, 1891). However, through a combination of morphological, molecular, and geographical analyses, Tibouchina was subdivided into four distinct genera (Michelangeli et al. 2013, Guimarães et al. 2019). Among these, Tibouchina s.s. comprises only 35 taxa and is confined to Cerrado environments (Silva et al. 2014, Guimarães 2014, Guimarães et al. 2019). The Tibouchina species located in eastern Brazil were reassigned to two separate groups, Pleroma and Chaetogastra DC. (Guimarães et al. 2019).
The taxa included in Pleroma exhibit distinctive characteristics such as deciduous sepals in the fruits, a hypanthium lacking scale-like trichomes, stamens with anthers ranging from purple to lilac (occasionally cream or white), a well-developed pedoconnective below the thecae, and filaments typically covered by setose or glandular trichomes. These taxa are distributed across various habitats, ranging from forested areas, high-altitude fields, and rocky terrains to shrub-tree restinga formations (Fraga and Guimarães 2014, Guimarães and Freitas 2015). During a floristic survey conducted in Serra Negra, three species of Chaetogastra and ten species of Pleroma were identified (Justino 2016), with one of the Pleroma species being a novel discovery described in this study.
In this study, specimens housed at the CESJ herbarium (abbreviations as per Thiers 2020) were examined. These specimens underwent a comparative analysis of their macro and micro-morphological characteristics, along with the scrutiny of their geographical and ecological data. The taxonomic treatment was conducted in accordance with the most recent phylogenetic analysis of the Melastomateae tribe (Michelangeli et al. 2013, Guimarães et al. 2019). To differentiate between species of Tibouchina s.s. and related genera in Brazil, taxonomic keys provided by Silva et al. (2014) and Guimarães and Silva (2014) were utilized. The map was generated using ArcGIS software version 9.3 (ESRI 2008), while conservation assessments adhered to the criteria outlined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN 2019).
Pleroma eglanduliferum Justino & P.J.F. Guim. sp. nov. was discovered in Brazil, specifically in Minas Gerais at Rio Preto, Serra Negra, along the trail for the Burro de Ouro. The specimen was collected on February 25, 2015, at an elevation of 1,400 meters, with flowers observed. The collectors of this specimen were L.L. Justino, J.H.C Ribeiro, M.C.A Mota, and J.F.B Pastore, with the collection number 134. The holotype is housed at CESJ, with an isotype at RB. (See figures 1 and 2 for visual representations).
Diagnosis: Pleroma eglanduliferum is characterized by its larger bracteoles measuring 7-11 × 3-7 mm, which are notably larger than the hypanthia measuring 4-5 × ca. 3 mm. The hypanthia is covered with strigose eglandular trichomes, while the stamens are dimorphic with connective glabrous throughout, including the appendages.
Shrubs measuring 1-1.5 meters in height exhibit young branches, petioles, inflorescences, hypanthia, and sepals covered with strigose eglandular trichomes, while their stems and young branches are 4-angled. The leaves are chartaceous, with petioles ranging from 3-7 mm in length and blades measuring 0.8-4.5 × 0.5-3.2 cm, ovate in shape with a subcordate base and obtuse apex. The margins are entire and ciliate, the adaxial surface is strigose-sericeous, and the abaxial surface is velutinous, featuring hispidulous-sericeous trichomes above the midrib and lateral veins. The leaves are 5-veined, with a thinner pair of main veins just inside the leaf margin, and all nerves converge at the base of the blade. The thyrsus measures 5.5-11.5 cm in length, with caducous lanceolate bracteoles measuring 7-11 × 3-7 mm. The flowers are 5-merous, pedicellate with pedicels 1-3 mm long, and hypanthia that are campanulate, measuring 4-5 × ca. 3 mm. The sepals are lanceolate, 1-2 × 3-5 mm, with an acute apex and ciliate margins, becoming caducous in fruit. The petals are obovate, 1.8-2 × 1.9-2.2 cm, with a truncate apex and margin shortly ciliate, initially purple and white at the base, later changing to red. The stamens, 10 in number, are dimorphic, with filaments covered in glandular trichomes, subulate anthers with an apical pore of 0.1 mm diam, pedoconnective prolonged ca. 1 mm, and bilobed appendages measuring 0.2-0.5 mm, glabrous. The ovary, ca. 4 × 3 mm, is 2/3 fused to the hypanthium, with the apex free and densely covered with setoso-glandular trichomes, while the style is ca. 4 mm long and sparsely setose. The capsule is globose, measuring 4-5 × 4-4.5 mm, and the seeds are cochleate, approximately 1 × 0.5 mm, with a tuberculate testa.
Etymology - The term "epithet" pertains to the lack of glands on the stamen connective, encompassing the appendices of both whorls.
Pleroma eglanduliferum is endemic to the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, specifically found in the region of Rio Preto. This area is distinguished by rocky fields on sandy soil with outcrops that rise abruptly above the surrounding landscape, predominantly covered by the Atlantic Rain Forest. The habitat of P. eglanduliferum is marked by sparse herbaceous and shrubby vegetation, thriving on rocky outcrops exposed to high solar radiation throughout the day.
Based on the IUCN (2019) criteria B2a and D, we recommend classifying this species as 'Critically Endangered' (CR) due to its presence in a single population within a limited area, despite being situated in a protected zone (Minas Gerais 2018). This designation is warranted given the susceptibility of the region to human-induced impacts such as Pinus and Eucalyptus cultivation, speculative real estate development, unregulated tourism, illicit plant collection, and grazing activities. The recent legal designation of the area as a conservation unit offers hope for mitigating these threats and reducing the level of endangerment. Nevertheless, further field investigations are essential to ascertain distribution patterns, population size, and specific threats, as the species has only been observed within the confines of the Parque Estadual da Serra Negra da Mantiqueira.
Pleroma heteromallum (D. Don) D. Don and Pleroma tedescoi (Meirelles, 2010) are two species of flowering plants belonging to the family Melastomataceae. These species are native to South America and are known for their ornamental value. Pleroma heteromallum, commonly referred to as "Brazilian glory bush," is characterized by its vibrant purple flowers and glossy green leaves. On the other hand, Pleroma tedescoi, also known as "Tedesco's glory bush," features striking pink flowers and a compact growth habit. Both species are popular choices for gardeners and horticulturists due to their attractive blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements. Additionally, these plants have been studied for their potential medicinal properties, with some research suggesting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Further investigation into the phytochemical composition and biological activities of Pleroma heteromallum and Pleroma tedescoi could provide valuable insights for pharmaceutical and botanical applications.
L. Kollmann and R. Goldenb. as well as P. J. F. Guim. and Michelang. are closely related in terms of plant architecture, exhibiting quadrangular branches, similar leaf shapes and indument, thyrsoid inflorescences, 5-merous flowers, purple petals, and stamens with glandular trichomes on their filaments. Notably, all three species share a common habitat of rocky outcrops. However, P. heteromallum can be differentiated from P. eglanduliferum by the presence of glandular trichomes in the pedoconnective of the antisepalous stamens, along with bracteoles slightly smaller than the hypanthium. Furthermore, P. tedescoi can be distinguished from P. eglanduliferum by its hypanthia covered with glandular trichomes, isomorphic stamens within the whorl, and bracteoles slightly smaller than the hypanthia.
Pleroma heteromallum exhibits a broad distribution, primarily found in the southeastern and northeastern regions of Brazil, with less frequent occurrences in the western center of the country (Guimarães, 1997). In the State of Minas Gerais, P. heteromallum has been documented at elevations ranging from 700 to 1700 meters (Guimarães, 1997). In contrast, Pleroma tedescoi is restricted to Espírito Santo State, typically found at elevations between 1700 and 1800 meters (Meirelles et al., 2012). A comparative analysis of their key characteristics is detailed in Table 1.
