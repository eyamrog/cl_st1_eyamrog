This study aims to evaluate national variation in depression prevalence overall and in 
different socio-demographic groups, health behaviors and macro-regions of the country, 
between 2013-2019. Data were obtained from two nationwide Brazilian surveys – PNS 
2013 and 2019. Participants aged 18 years and older included 60,202 individuals in 
2013 and 88,531 in 2019. Depression was evaluated through the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Calculations were carried out population-weighted. Analyses 
were conducted to account for demographic changes. The results showed that in the six-
year period between the two surveys, the prevalence of depression in Brazil increased 
by 36.7%, going from 7.9% in 2013 to 10.8% in 2019, and this increase is more marked 
among young adults, 18 to 24 years old, who were not working, where there was a 
significant and almost three-fold absolute difference increase in the prevalence of 
depression (3.7 in 2013 and 10.3 in 2019), an increase of 178.4%. Those living in urban 
areas of the country had a greater increase in the prevalence of depression in the six-
year period (39.8%) when compared to residents in rural areas (20.2%). There was an 
increase in the prevalence of depression between 2013-2019 for the worst categories of 
the three health behaviors under study, for both sexes: heavy drinking, smoking, and 
lack of physical activity. Our results show a significant increase in the prevalence of 
depression over the six-year period between the two surveys, mainly among the younger 
and unemployed men. The country´s economic context of recession during this period 
may be an explanation for this finding. 

Depression is considered one of the main global public health issues. Data from 
the Global Burden of Disease Study show that depression is one of the three main 
causes for years lived with disability (YLD), especially among women 1.  Studies of 
trends in depression worldwide have produced mixed results. According to the World 
Health Organization (WHO), the total number of people with depression was estimated 
to exceed 300 million globally in 2015, an increase of 18.4% since 2005 2. However, a 
meta-analysis of 116 epidemiological studies showed that the prevalence of major 
depression was unchanged at 4.4% in 1990 (4.2–4.7%) and 2010 (4.1–4.7%); even 
though, 8 of the 11 GHQ studies found a significant increase in psychological distress 
over time 3. These studies have shown how inconsistent the empirical evidence can be 
for mental health outcomes, in particular depression, where cultural differences between 
countries and the definitions and assessments of depression can alter the prevalence of 
the disorder. More recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies focused on 
the change over time in depression incidence and prevalence in the general population 
showed a predominant increasing trend in the prevalence of depression within 
populations over time, which seems not to be explainable by study design differences or 
publication bias alone 4.  

There is now robust evidence that social, economic, and environmental 
inequalities, such as accelerated urbanization, impact the quality of life of populations, 
their health behaviors, access to health services, among others, influencing the 
development of chronic diseases, including mental disorders 5, 6, 7. Some studies have 
shown that financial crises can have an important impact on the mental health of 
populations. Worldwide, periods of major economic crises, which lead to 
unemployment, financial difficulties, and poverty, have been associated with an 
increase in mental disorders in the population, with a greater impact on the levels of 
depression and suicide 8, 9, 10. Two meta-analyses have shown that people experiencing 
unemployment are at greater risk for mental health problems than the general population 
11, 12. 

During the first decade of the 21st century, Brazilian economy thrived and the 
country became the sixth economy in the world 13. However, since 2013, Brazil has 
been facing a scenario of deterioration and economic recession, with successive 
financial crises, increased unemployment, precarious work, and an increase in poverty. 
In addition, young people have faced enormous difficulties in entering the labor market. 
These factors may have an impact in the Brazilian population's mental health, increasing 
the prevalence rates of depression in the general population, especially among those 
more vulnerable.     

Data from the National Health Survey of 2013, a population-based survey 
conducted in the Brazilian population aged 18 or over, showed a prevalence of 4.1% for 
major depression, 7.9% for depression and 21.0% for depressed mood, assessed with 
the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), being higher among women, individuals 
aged 40-59 years and 70 years old or more, those with lower educational level and those 
who lived in urban regions. Among those with depression, about 80% did not receive 
any treatment and 14% were treated only with medication 14, 15. 

The second edition of the National Health Survey, held in 2019, represents an 
opportunity to evaluate temporal changes of several health problems in the general 
population, for the first time in Brazil. The present study aims to evaluate the variation 
in the overall prevalence of depression, and to examine how changes in prevalence of 
depression may have happened in different socioeconomic and demographic groups, 
health behaviors, and macro-regions of the country, between 2013 and 2019. 

We used two cross-sectional population-based datasets drawn from the National 
Health Survey (PNS) carried in Brazil in 2013 and 2019 16, 17. The PNS is a household-
based nationwide survey conducted by the Ministry of Health, in partnership with the 
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2013 and 2019.  

Both surveys are representative samples of the Brazilian population and allow 
estimates for urban and rural areas, for the country’s five macro-regions, and for 
Federative Units, state capitals and metropolitan regions. The surveys were household-
based with stratified sampling and a three-stage design: In the first stage, the primary 
sampling units (PSU) were randomly selected from the master sample, from which the 
major surveys conducted by IBGE are sampled. In the second stage, households were 
randomly selected within each PSU. In the third stage, an adult resident (18 years old or 
older in the 2013 edition and 15 years old or older in the 2019 edition) was selected 
with equal probability among all adult residents in the household. Weighting factors 
were calculated for each of the three sampling units, considering the probabilities of 
selection and the non-response rate. For the selected resident, the weight was calculated 
considering the weight for the corresponding household, the probability of selection of 
the resident, the adjustment of non-response for sex, and calibration for the total 
population by sex and age groups estimated with the weight of all residents 18, 19.       

Despite the change in the age group of the household selected resident in PNS 
2019, which now includes the population aged 15 years old or over, in order to provide 
valid data for monitoring the indicators established by the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) 20, the indicators that have been used in the publications of IBGE and the 
Ministry of Health, are related to the population of 18 years or older 17. Thus, following 
this guideline and to allow comparisons between the two editions of the PNS, the 
present study uses data referring only to the population aged 18 or over. 

In the PNS 2013, a total of 69,954 occupied households were visited and 60,202 
individuals were interviewed, resulting in a response rate of 86.1%. In the PNS 2019, of 
a total of 108,525 households visited, interviews were conducted in 94,114 households, 
with a loss rate of 13.2%. The sample of households with a person aged 18 or over 
(selected resident), reached 88,531 individuals. 

The PNS 2013 and PNS 2019 surveys were approved by the National 
Commission of Ethics in Research (CONEP) of the National Health Council – CNS, in 
June 2013, Regulation No. 328.159, and in August 2019, No. 3.529.376, respectively. In 
both editions all participants signed an informed consent agreement. 
Assessment of depression 

Depression was assessed, in both editions of PNS, through the Patient Health 
Questionnaire PHQ-9, which evaluates the frequency of depressive symptoms over the 
two weeks prior to data collection 21. The instrument had previously been validated in 
Brazil 22, with good validity in diagnosing major depression at the cut-offs of > 9 and > 
10. Depression was described using the PHQ-9 score as recommended by Kroenke et 
al.21, which classifies depression severity according to the following thresholds: none 
(1–4 points), mild (5–9), moderate (10–14), moderately severe (15–19) and severe (20–
27 points). In the present study, depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of 10 or 
higher, which is considered the best cutoff point to detect the presence of clinically 
relevant depressive symptoms 23, 24. 

In both surveys, socio-demographic variables were assessed, including sex (male 
and female); age group (18-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70 years or over), 
race/skin color (white, black and others: yellow, brown and indigenous); level of 
education (uneducated or incomplete primary school; complete primary school or 
incomplete high school, complete high school or incomplete college/university, 
complete college/university); marital status (married or in cohabit with a partner vs. 
single) and work status (working / not working). Geographical areas were defined as 
macro-region of residence (North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, and South), and 
living in urban vs. rural areas. 

Health behaviors selected for analysis were: current smoker of any type of 
tobacco (yes, no); excessive alcohol consumption (heavy drinking) being defined as the 
weekly consumption of 15 or more alcoholic drinks for men and 8 or more for women 
25, a dose being considered equivalent to a can of beer, a glass of wine, or a dose of 
distilled drink; and leisure physical activity, assessed through the number of days per 
week that the person practiced physical exercise or sport in the last 3 months, in which 
those who practiced any activity for at least once a week were considered active.  
Data analysis 

Prevalence of depression was described according to socio-demographic 
characteristics and geographical area. Estimates were computed for both PNS 2013 and 
PNS 2019, with their respective 95% confidence intervals using the t distribution, given 
the large number of primary sampling units (PSU). The prevalence change between the 
surveys was expressed as the relative difference, as percentage, between the 2013 and 
2019, computed by Gaussian generalized linear models, with the prevalence in each 
group in 2013 as the baseline, i.e., without the intercept. The coefficients and standard 
errors of the interaction term, between the group variable and the survey indicator to the 
2019 survey, estimated the absolute differences, used to compute the relative changes, 
and the confidence intervals, respectively. The datasets from both surveys were stacked 
and an indicator variable was created to flag their respective survey iteration, then post-
stratification was carried out in order to adjust the weights. 

All statistical analyses were performed using survey-specific weighting factors 
adjusting the study samples to the demographic-geographic distribution of the 
population in Brazil. To estimate the prevalence of depression according to the 
correlates in each year, their variations between surveys, and confidence intervals we 
used R version 4.0.5 26 with the survey package version 4.0 27. 

Demographic features of PNS 2013 and PNS 2019 samples are shown in 
Table 1. Overall, the sample characteristics of PNS 2013 and PNS 2019 showed little 
change in the underlying population regarding the included variables, except for age 
distribution (shift towards older age) and increase in higher levels of education. 

Table 2 shows the prevalence of depression according to socio-demographic 
characteristics and health behaviors of the general population in 2013 and 2019. 
Overall, there was a 36.7% increase in the prevalence of depression between 2013 
(7.9%) and 2019 (10.8%), and this increase was greater among the youngest (from 18-
24 years old), the women, those living in urban areas, and those living in the Southeast 
region of the country. There was a significant sex difference in the prevalence of 
depression, with women having a higher prevalence in both periods of time; with an 
increase in prevalence between 2013 (10.7%) and 2019 (15.0%) greater than that 
observed among men (4.7% vs. 6.1%). Prevalence among women was significantly 
higher than among men in all age groups and at both time points.  

Although there was an increase in the prevalence of depression for all age 
groups, this increase was more marked among the younger age groups, especially 
among those aged 18 to 24 years old, where the prevalence of depression almost 
doubled, being 5.6% in 2013 and 11.1% in 2019. This pattern was repeated for women 
(8.3% vs. 15.6%) and men (2.9% vs. 6.6%) in this age group. In contrast, for those aged 
70 years or more, the prevalence remained almost constant in the whole population, 
changing from 10.2% to 11.1%, having an increase among women, but not among men.  

Those living in urban areas of the country presented a higher increase (of 39.8%) 
in the prevalence of depression (from 8.1% in 2013 to 11.3% in 2019), when compared 
to those living in rural areas (from 6,4% to 7,7% in the same period), a relative increase 
of 20.2%. When considering the country's macro-regions, the absolute differences 
between the prevalence of depression in 2013 and 2019 followed the 2-3 percentage 
points found for the whole country (Table 2). When stratified by sex, among women, 
the differences of 4-5 percentage points in the prevalence of depression between 2013 
and 2019 remained for all regions, except for the Southern region of the country, where 
it was less than one point percentage (13.4% in 2013 and 14.3% in 2019). In 2013, the 
prevalence of depression among women in the Southern region was higher than in the 
rest of the country, and remained stable after six years (Table 3). 

For other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, no significant 
variations were found in the prevalence of depression between 2013 and 2019 in the 
categories under study, with the changes generally accompanying the difference of 
about 3 percentage points between 2013 and 2019 for the overall population, and of 
about 4-5 percentage points for women and 1.5 percentage points for men (Tables 2 and 
3).  

There was a significant and almost three-fold absolute difference increase in the 
prevalence of depression in the group of men aged 18 to 24, who were not working 
(3.7% in 2013 and 10.3% in 2019), an increase of 178.4%, when compared to those 
who were working (2.6% vs. 4.9%), a relative increase of 90.5% (Table 4 and Figure 1). 

Regarding health behaviors, as can be seen in Table 2, in the general population, 
there was an increase in the prevalence of depression in all three categories, following 
the increase of about three percentage points in the general prevalence. Both in 2013 
and 2019, people who reported heavy drinking, who did not practice any physical 
activity and who smoked, had a higher prevalence of depression than those without such 
health risk behaviors. The variation in the prevalence of depression among smokers 
went from 10.8% in 2013 to 14.7% in 2019, a relative difference of 35.9%. A relative 
increase of 40.5% was found among those that were not engaged in physical activities at 
least once a week, higher than differences observed in the other categories of health risk 
behaviors. 

When stratifying by sex (Table 3), among women who reported heavy drinking, 
there was a greater variation in the prevalence of depression from 2013 to 2019 than 
among those who did not report this pattern of alcohol consumption in those years. 
Women who reported smoking in 2013 showed a higher prevalence of depression in 
2013 (17.7% among smokers vs. 9.9% among nonsmokers) and in 2019 (23.1% among 
smokers and 14.1% among nonsmokers); with a relative increase of 30.4% among 
smokers from 2013 to 2019. Among men, smoking showed a higher prevalence of 
depression in 2013 and 2019, with a relative increase of 41.9%, considerably higher 
than the variation among men in general. Regarding the practice of physical activity, 
women who did not practice physical activity in 2019 showed a higher prevalence of 
depression than those who practiced physical activity, as observed in 2013, with a 
relative increase of 46.5%. Conversely, among men, those who did not practice physical 
activity had a relative increase of 25.2% in the prevalence of depression as compared to 
those who practiced physical activity, moving from 5.9% in 2013 to 7,3% in 2019 
(Table 3). 

This is the first study to compare the prevalence of depression in the Brazilian 
population in two distinct periods in time. The study shows an increase in the 
prevalence of depression from 2013 to 2019, from 7.9% to 10.8%, mainly among 
women and the youngest. The change in the prevalence of depression was not 
homogeneous in all age groups, with a greater increase among those aged 18 to 24 years 
old. This increase among the youngest was even greater among those who did not work, 
and especially among young men. 

Overall, the current results differ from those in the initially presented meta-
analysis and from the findings of the Global Burden of Disease Study, which found no 
differences in the prevalence of depression over time 1, 3. A study in Chile, which 
compared the prevalence of major depression in 2003 and 2010, also found no 
significant variation (20.5% vs. 18.4%, respectively) 28. However, studies that assessed 
the impact of periods of financial crisis and economic recession on the prevalence of 
depression in adult populations from different countries, found results similar to ours. In 
Spain, a study conducted to assess the impact of the economic crisis that began in 2007 
on different health outcomes showed that, compared with the pre-crisis period of 2006, 
the 2010 survey revealed that the greatest percentage point rise in frequency was for 
mood disorders, major depression (19.4 percentage point increase) and dysthymia (10.8) 
29. In Greece, the prevalence of major depression increased from 3.3% in 2008 to 8.2% 
in 2011, and this increase was attributed to the economic crisis experienced by the 
country in 2008 30. A study conducted among representative samples of the working age 
(25–64 years) general population in England between 1991 and 2010, to assess short-
term differences in population mental health before and after the 2008 recession, 
showed an increase of common mental disorders, from 13.7% in 2008 to 16.4% in 2009 
and 15.5% in 2010 31. Some of these studies also found that financial crises and periods 
of recession and unemployment have higher impact in specific subgroups, especially 
among the youngest and among men 32. These groups are more likely to be affected by 
economic hardship, losing jobs or not being able to get one, which leads to a situation of 
disillusion and hopelessness. On the other hand, women, who have already a higher risk 
of depression, are also very affected by periods of economic crisis. However, none of 
these studies found differences in the increase in the prevalence of depression as large 
as those observed in the present study. Our findings, showing a 178% increase in the 
prevalence of depression among men aged 18 to 24 years who were not working, and 
89.8% among women in the same age group and work situation, is unparalleled in the 
literature. Brazil had a period of good economic growth since the beginning of the 21st 
century until 2014, which was followed by a period of deep economic crisis, with a 
significant increase in unemployment, which led to a dramatic drop in the population's 
standard of living, affecting mainly those who were at the age of entry into the labor 
market. As Brazil did not have effective governmental mechanisms for social protection 
in such crisis periods, it is possible that those more vulnerable groups suffered the 
consequences of economic hardship more intensively.   

The present study also found that residents in urban areas of the country had a 
higher prevalence of depression in both 2013 and 2019, and a greater increase in the 
prevalence of depression in the six year period (39.8%), when compared to residents in 
rural areas (20.2 %), and this pattern was similar for men and women. We did not find 
any other study that investigated living in urban vs. rural areas and the mental health 
trend in Brazil, but previous studies on the prevalence of common mental disorders / 
depression in urban and rural areas have shown inconclusive results, some showing an 
association and others not 33, 34, 35. Studies conducted in other countries, however, 
corroborate our findings and show that living in urban regions with high demographic 
density is associated with a greater risk of depression 36, 37. Among the studies that have 
investigated the trend of depression over time, some have observed a tendency towards 
an increase in the prevalence of depression in urban vs. rural regions, following 
accelerated urbanization processes 38, 39. Other studies, however, did not observe such a 
trend 28, 40. A recent study, conducted in Peru, to assess trends in the prevalence of 
depression between 2014 and 2018, found no significant differences in the prevalence 
of depression in the period, for urban and rural regions 41.  

Regarding health behaviors, the present study found an increase in the 
prevalence of depression between 2013 and 2019 for the worst categories of the three 
health behaviors under study, for both sexes: heavy drinking, smoking and lack of 
physical activity, following the pattern observed for the general population. However, 
when stratified by sex, the differences in the prevalence of depression are greater for 
women who reported excessive alcohol consumption than for men who also reported 
such behavior. The relationship between health risk behaviors and depressive symptoms 
is already well established in the literature 42, 43, 44, 45. Few studies, however, have 
evaluated the role of health risk behaviors on changes in the prevalence of depression 
over time. Overall, the current results are in line with those presented by a study based 
on the annually cross-sectional U.S. National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) of 
1997-2016, among individuals aged 18 years and older 46. They found that 
psychological distress became more strongly associated with smoking and physical 
inactivity, but less strongly associated with heavy alcohol consumption. Another study, 
also in the American population, examined changes in the prevalence of major 
depression in the U.S. between 1991-1992 and 2001-2002, and sought to determine 
whether these changes were associated with changes in substance abuse (including 
alcohol). They found that increases in the prevalence of depression associated with 
substance use disorders were consistent only for black men between 18-29 years of age 
47. The results of the present study are also in line with longitudinal studies which 
showed that women who were in a high-risk drinking group at baseline are under higher 
risk of developing depression disorder at follow-up 45, 48.  

One of the strengths of the present study is the fact that it is the first that 
assessed the trend in the prevalence of depression based in two nationally representative 
surveys, which allowed the assessment of changes in the prevalence of depression 
according to sociodemographic characteristics, region of residence and health 
behaviors. In addition, both surveys used the same standardized questionnaire (PHQ-9), 
widely used in national and international studies, for the assessment of depression 
according to internationally accepted criteria, allowing the comparison of results of the 
present study with those of other international studies. 

There are also some limitations that need to be considered. First, presence of 
depression was assessed with the PHQ-9 with the cut-off 10 to assess depression, and 
pooled estimates for such cut-off are 0.77 for sensitivity and 0.85 for specificity, 
implying that some degree of random misclassification must have occurred. This may 
have weakened the observed associations. Secondly, more severe cases of depression 
may have been underestimated due to selection bias (non-response), information bias 
and exclusion of institutionalized individuals in both surveys. A third limitation is that 
the primary sample units (PSU) identification use different code scheme across surveys, 
since it is likely to occur overlapping of PSU in both samples there may some 
variability not accounted for. Thus, the confidence intervals for the differences in the 
prevalence in 2013 and 2019 may be slightly underestimated, increasing the probability 
of type I error. So, confidence limits close to the null hypothesis should be interpreted 
with caution.  

In conclusion, our findings show evidence of a significant increase in the 
prevalence of depression over the six-year period between the two surveys. The finding 
that the group of younger and unemployed men showed the greatest variation in the 
prevalence of depression, draws attention and encourages us to seek explanations based 
on the literature and the country's socioeconomic context during this period. It is quite 
likely that such a subgroup is today one of the most vulnerable and that such a condition 
will have an impact on their mental health. Although economic crises tend to lead to 
reduced resources for health care, resources for mental health care must be maintained 
or even increased to allow faster and better results, both in terms of economic recovery, 
and mental health of the population.
