The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the management strategies implemented in three dental schools in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis.
Methods: The adopted strategies at the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB) in Brazil, the University of Pittsburgh (UP) in the USA, and Griffith University (GU) in Australia were comprehensively outlined.
Results: At the Universidade Federal da Paraíba (UFPB), in-person teaching was halted, and remote learning resources were established as an additional semester, with plans for eventual face-to-face classes. Clinical care adhered to safety protocols recommended by Brazilian health authorities, with ongoing discussions regarding the readiness of physical facilities, staffing, and procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the resumption of clinical activities. Meanwhile, at the Universidade do Porto (UP), educational activities transitioned to virtual platforms, incorporating recorded lectures and live sessions, while elective patient care was deferred. Urgent dental cases were managed through teledentistry. Modifications to the layout of dental clinics and pre-clinical labs were made to ensure safe distancing among students. Conversely, at the University of Gothenburg (GU), all clinical and pre-clinical engagements were canceled, with theoretical coursework continuing online. Various clinically oriented scenarios were developed and delivered through online problem-based learning formats. The reception area was reconfigured to promote social distancing, aligning with safety guidelines from the Australian Dental Association.
Conclusions: The approach to dental education is contingent upon the phase of the epidemic and the unique attributes of individual countries.
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a specific group of viruses that contain ribonucleic acid (RNA) in their genetic material. These viruses primarily target epithelial cells in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, facilitating transmission through various means such as fomites, airborne particles, or the faecal-oral route. In early January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as the causative agent of a human disease known as COVID-19. By late January 2020, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern, and in March 2020, a global pandemic was officially announced. As of June 4, 2020, COVID-19 had spread to 213 countries and territories worldwide, resulting in over 6 million confirmed cases and nearly 400 thousand deaths globally.
Nations have implemented various strategies to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Measures such as lockdowns, shelter-in-place orders, stay-at-home directives, travel restrictions, and social distancing have had profound social and economic repercussions worldwide. Recent research, including a systematic review and meta-analysis, has underscored the effectiveness of practices like maintaining a physical distance of at least one meter, wearing face masks by both healthcare professionals and the general populace, and utilizing eye protection as means to curb transmission [6].
The COVID-19 pandemic crisis severely disrupted the health education sector, particularly impacting dental education. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the disease's natural history and the imperative to safeguard the well-being of students, faculty, and patients, various measures were implemented, including the suspension of on-campus teaching, research, and other activities. These strategies varied depending on the country and the local stage of the epidemic curve. Additionally, significant efforts were made to enhance practice readiness, such as revising Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) protocols, organizing clinical environments, and adapting dental procedures. The challenges stemming from these adjustments are substantial and are expected to have enduring consequences. In light of this unprecedented situation in global dental education, it presents a valuable opportunity to exchange new insights, acquire knowledge, and foster growth.
This study aimed to delineate and contrast the approaches taken by three dental schools situated in distinct countries in managing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis within the realm of dental education. Notably, Australia, Brazil, and the USA encountered the pandemic at varying points in time and with differing levels of severity. At the time of drafting this article in early June 2020, the USA and Brazil held the unenviable positions of first and second in the global tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases, respectively [5]. In Australia, the incidence of new cases surged rapidly, reaching a peak in March 2020. However, from mid-April onwards, the country has consistently reported a relatively low number of new cases daily, with figures consistently below 20 new cases per day since April 22 [7].
Brazil, an upper-middle-income South American country, ranks as the fifth largest and most populous nation globally, boasting a population exceeding 212 million [8]. It stands as the ninth-largest economy in the world, holding the 79th position in the Human Development Index on a global scale [9]. The country hosts over 2,400 higher education institutions, comprising 199 universities and 2,020 colleges, with a significant majority (87.9%) being privately owned [10]. Merely 16.5% of young adults aged 25 years and above have attained a tertiary education level. Within Brazil, there are 542 dental schools, with 58 of them being public institutions that offer tuition-free education [11]. The Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), situated in Joao Pessoa in Northeast Brazil (Figure 1), provides both undergraduate and postgraduate programs in the dental field, catering to approximately 400 students.
Ranked as the world's largest economy, the United States is situated in central North America and boasts a population exceeding 300 million individuals [12]. With an HDI index of 0.924, it holds the 13th position globally [9]. In comparison to many other higher education systems worldwide, the U.S. system operates with a significant degree of independence from federal government oversight, characterized by a high level of decentralization. Funding for the educational system comes from various sources, including tuition fees, federal and state allocations, and endowments [13]. Dental education in the United States follows completion of a bachelor's degree, with students required to first obtain a university or college undergraduate degree before applying to one of the 66 dental schools across the country. The University of Pittsburgh is among the four institutions in the northeastern state of Pennsylvania that offer dentistry training (see Figure 1), with an enrollment of nearly 400 dental students.
Australia, the largest country in Oceania and the sixth-largest globally, boasts a relatively small population of nearly 26 million [14]. Highly developed, it holds the world's 14th largest economy and ranks third on the Human Development Index (HDI) with a score of 0.939 [9]. The education sector is pivotal to the Australian economy, with 43 universities, 40 of which are public, supported by loans and subsidies for citizen students. Notably, Australia houses 12 dental schools, 9 offering Dentistry programs, and 3 focusing on Oral Health Therapy. Among these institutions, the School of Dentistry and Oral Health at Griffith University stands out, situated in Gold Coast, Queensland, on the east coast of Australia (Figure 1). This school offers undergraduate degrees in Dentistry and Dental Technology, along with postgraduate training programs across various disciplines, including research degrees like MPhil and PhD. Currently, the School accommodates around 600 dental students, with 20% comprising international students.
Following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic by the WHO, the Federal University of Paraíba took the decision to suspend all on-site teaching, research, and service activities. In preparation for the resumption of teaching activities, the university recommended the utilization of information and communications technology (ICTs) resources for distance learning, emphasizing key considerations including student access to the internet and computers, teacher training in ICT usage, and the theoretical and practical aspects of the curricular components. Remote teaching of theoretical components across undergraduate programs was implemented, albeit as an additional semester. Various assessment formats, such as quizzes, essays, and video production, were utilized for online submissions. As the institution transitions back to face-to-face activities, recognizing the potential limitations faced by students with inadequate socioeconomic support for ICT usage, it is imperative that the online curricular components remain accessible in traditional classroom settings.
Following the suspension of face-to-face activities, a biosafety committee comprising academics and students from the dental school was promptly established to develop a proposal for the resumption of post-pandemic activities, particularly clinical care. A comprehensive protocol for clinical care was meticulously crafted, taking into account the safety guidelines advocated by Brazilian health authorities [15] and relevant scientific literature [16,17]. The protocol emphasized the use of essential personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks or PFF2 masks, safety glasses, disposable caps, shoe covers, waterproof surgical aprons, face shields, and procedure gloves, in addition to specific requirements outlined in table 1.
The response to the pandemic was initially slow, but once initiated, colleges and universities in the United States promptly suspended classes for a week. Subsequently, learning activities transitioned to virtual teaching in the following week, utilizing a blend of lecture recordings and live sessions where faculty and students engaged simultaneously. Within the School of Dental Medicine, all research endeavors were halted, except for projects deemed essential for the COVID-19 response or those reliant on unique materials or supplies that could not be interrupted. Administrative meetings and other services were swiftly shifted to a fully online format. Non-essential patient care was postponed to safeguard staff, conserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and preserve patient care supplies. Urgent dental cases were managed through teledentistry consultations until national guidelines were issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [18]. These urgent cases were addressed within weeks following the release of national protocols for urgent care (refer to Table 1).
The mandated period of isolation significantly impacted dental students at the University of Pittsburgh, with U.S. dental students generally being older than their Brazilian counterparts by an average of four years, leading to a considerable financial commitment to their education. The total cost of the dental program at the University of Pittsburgh amounts to US$300,000, exacerbating the stress caused by the shift to online learning necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While online teaching was provided along with additional support for guidance and emotional well-being, the changes in learning delivery also affected other aspects of the students' experiences, including research and service opportunities.
At the onset of the pandemic, Australia swiftly implemented stringent regulations encompassing social distancing, travel restrictions, and the testing and monitoring of infected individuals. Consequently, universities in the country commenced closure from mid-March, leading to the suspension of all clinical and pre-clinical activities while transitioning to online theoretical engagements like seminars, lectures, and journal clubs. This shift necessitated a rapid adaptation by both students and academics, with platforms such as Microsoft Teams® and BlackBoard Collaborate ULTRA® emerging as primary tools for teaching and learning at Griffith University. To facilitate learning, numerous clinically oriented scenarios were devised and presented through online problem-based learning (PBL) discussions, culminating in the delivery of all Semester 1 examinations through online means.
Throughout the pandemic, a robust collaboration was observed among key Dentistry regulatory bodies, including the Australian Dental Association (ADA), the Dental Board of Australia (DBA), and the Australian Council of Dental Schools (ACODS). The ADA spearheaded a staged approach to restrictions, ranging from level 1 to level 5, which was supported by the other entities and received endorsement from State and Federal Governments. Maintaining level 3 restrictions in March and April, only urgent dental cases, such as infection management, pain relief, and bleeding control without aerosol-generating procedures, were permitted (refer to Table 1). During this period, the School operated with a minimal roster comprising clinical dentists and academics exclusively, excluding students. By late-April, governmental approval led to a reduction to ADA level 2, eventually progressing to level 1 by the end of May. While these regulations were applicable nationwide, Dental schools have recently commenced their "return to clinic" strategies, with most institutions beginning at level 2 restrictions.
As of mid-June 2020, various countries were grappling with distinct epidemic scenarios amid the COVID-19 crisis. Brazil found itself nearing the apex of its epidemic curve, while the United States was witnessing a decline in cases, and Australia had successfully flattened the curve, achieving near-complete elimination of new infections. This divergence in circumstances underscores the significance of examining and contrasting the strategies adopted by each nation in resuming conventional clinical teaching practices in the field of Dentistry.
The resumption of face-to-face activities, encompassing both pre-clinical and clinical teaching, necessitates a thorough discussion and elucidation of protocols to establish a new routine. The Brazilian Dental Education Association (ABENO) spearheads a national dialogue, advocating for the formation of dental infection control or biosafety commissions within educational institutions to oversee diagnosis, infection control measures, and ongoing education for all stakeholders. In public institutions such as the Federal University of Paraíba, key challenges revolve around ensuring the adequacy of physical infrastructure, availability of human resources, and procurement of necessary materials for the personal protection of faculty, students, and oral health technicians. It is imperative to develop a strategic plan for the resumption of activities, taking into account epidemiological indicators and hospital bed occupancy rates for COVID-19 treatment.
Following the conclusion of the spring term, which spans from January to April, the summer term (April-July) proceeded with online classes, alongside preparations for facilitating clinical experiences for students in the treatment care phase of their training. A blend of recorded clinical procedures and in-depth discussions on clinical scenarios was provided to offer students some practical exposure while awaiting state authorization to resume clinical activities. Modifications were made to the physical layout of dental clinics and pre-clinical laboratories to mitigate COVID-19 risks, ensuring students can work at a safe distance from one another. The intention is to resume these activities within the next month.
Discussions surrounding the resumption of pre-clinical and clinical activities commenced in April, highlighting the necessity of adhering to key protocols regardless of the return timeline. These included social distancing measures, a review of infection control practices, and the implementation of specific COVID-19 assessments for both patients and staff. In Australia, social distancing guidelines stipulated a 1.5m distance between individuals, with a limit of one person per 4 sqm of room space. These fundamental principles necessitated a comprehensive overhaul of our timetables and clinical sessions, leading to the need for "double teaching" in most classes. The restructuring involved reducing clinic capacities from 6 chairs to 3, with one supervisor overseeing two clinics. Session durations were trimmed from 3 hours to 2 hours and 30 minutes, enabling the scheduling of four sessions daily from 7:30 am to 7:30 pm, as opposed to the usual three. Despite accommodating all students, there was an unavoidable decrease in the number of patients each student could see due to spatial constraints preventing the doubling of all sessions. This timetable adjustment impacted the entire school, necessitating modifications in the Prosthetics Lab and Simulation Lab to align with the new schedule.
Our dental school stands as one of the pioneering institutions globally to initiate clinical activities involving students. This process unfolded in stages, commencing with Professional Dentists on 25 May, followed by PG students on 1 June, and UG students on 8 June. To adhere to social distancing guidelines, the reception area underwent a redesign, reducing its capacity to one-third. A pre-entry checkpoint was established for all individuals - patients, staff, and students - encompassing temperature checks, inquiries regarding travel and COVID-19 history, provision of hand sanitiser, and wristband identification. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) protocols were intensified, mandating the use of scrubs overlaid with disposable gowns, goggles, head nets, and masks (with N95 options available) at all times. Prior to treatment, both patients and staff were required to use a mouthwash containing hydrogen peroxide, and the utilization of rubber dams and high-volume suction was reinforced. While the school initially operated at ADA level 2, a transition to level 1 is scheduled for 15 June, following the same phased approach. Encouragingly, the clinical operations have been running smoothly, with patients expressing satisfaction at their return and appreciation for the additional safety measures in place. Both staff and students have conveyed a sense of security and enthusiasm upon resuming activities on campus.
Numerous and significant challenges have emerged due to the pandemic, impacting individuals, communities, and institutions with enduring consequences. Students are grappling with disruptions to their education and career paths, professionals are facing the arduous task of rebuilding their practices, and staff across Dental Schools are encountering various hardships. Despite these obstacles, we view our response to these challenges as a valuable learning opportunity. The landscape of dentistry and dental education has undergone substantial transformations in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, prompting the need for sharing experiences and mutual learning. This period presents an ideal moment for a comprehensive review of our clinical practices, biosafety measures, and a perpetual drive to innovate in teaching the upcoming generation of dentists. It is imperative that the future of dental education integrates considerations for potential new pandemics into their accreditation standards.
