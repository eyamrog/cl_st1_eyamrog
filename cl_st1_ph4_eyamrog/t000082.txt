2. Abstract 
46 
A fundamental fact about mutualisms relies on the fact that partner species 
47 
often harbor some individuals that benefit from the use of resources and 
48 
services of the interaction without providing any positive feedback to the 
49 
other player. The role of these cheaters on the evolutionary dynamics of 
50 
mutualisms has long been recognized, yet their broader consequences to the 
51 
community level, and beyond species they interact with, is still poorly 
52 
understood. Because mutualisms form networks that often involve dozens to 
53 
hundreds of species in a given site, indirect effects generated by cheaters may 
54 
cascade through the whole community, reshaping trait evolution. Here, we 
55 
study how harboring cheating interactions can influence coevolution in 
56 
mutualistic networks. We combine a coevolutionary model, empirical data on 
57 
animal-plant mutualistic networks, and numerical simulations to show that 
58 
the higher frequency of cheating interactions lead to the formation of groups 
59 
of species phenotypically similar to each other and distinct from other groups, 
60 
generating higher trait disparity. The resulting clustered trait patterns, in 
61 
turn, change the patterns of interaction in simulated networks, fostering the 
62 
formation of modules of interacting species. Our results indicate that cheaters 
63 
in mutualisms contribute to generate phenotypic clusters in mutualisms, 
64 
counteracting selection for convergence imposed by mutualistic patterns, and 
65 
favoring the emergence of modules of interacting species.

Introduction 
70 
 
71 
Selection imposed by ecological interactions is one of the main forces 
72 
impacting phenotypic patterns observed across levels of biological 
73 
organization (Thompson 2005). Selection imposed by ecological interactions 
74 
partially shapes trait matching among interacting individuals (Zhang et al. 
75 
2012), trait distributions within interacting populations (Bronstein et al. 2003), 
76 
trait variation across populations of the same species (Thompson 2005), and 
77 
trait patterns at the community level (Strauss & Irwin 2004). At the 
78 
community level, ecological interactions can be a driving force leading to trait 
79 
convergence (Wilson et al. 2012) and trait disparity (Siepielski & Benkman 
80 
2010). In this sense, theory and empirical results indicate that distinct 
81 
ecological interactions (e.g., mutualistic, antagonistic) may favor different trait 
82 
outcomes at the community level (Thompson 1994). 
83 
Mutualistic interactions, for example, can favor trait matching, which is 
84 
the trait similarity between interacting species. Although mutualisms may 
85 
also generate other trait patterns, such as intensification of traits (Anderson & 
86 
Johnson 2008), trait matching is an observed pattern in a variety of 
87 
mutualistic systems, such as pollination by flies and bees (Zhang et al. 2012, 
88 
Santamaria & Rodríguez-Gironés 2007), seed dispersal by birds and bats 
89 
(Galetti et al. 2013, Mello et al. 2011), and Müllerian rings in velvet ants 
90 
(Wilson et al 2012). Hence, trait matching is an expected outcome of reciprocal 
91 
selection that could favor higher interaction efficiency in mutualisms 
92 
(Thompson 1994, Zhang et al. 2012). In contrast, antagonisms, such as 
93

parasites and hosts, favor trait mismatching between hosts and parasites, 
94 
leading to several coevolutionary dynamics such as coevolutionary 
95 
alternation and escalation, that favor the maintenance or the increase in trait 
96 
variation across and within species (Andreazzi et al. 2017). 
97 
Antagonisms and mutualisms are not isolated in nature but coexist in a 
98 
variety of ways. Studies have explored the effects of combining mutualisms 
99 
and antagonisms on population dynamics (e.g., Melián et al. 2009), 
100 
community stability (e.g., Wilson et al. 2003), and network structure (e.g., 
101 
Genini et al. 2010), highlighting the importance of considering the multiple 
102 
outcomes that interactions may have at a single community and assigning the 
103 
extremes of a gradient between mutualism and antagonism (Fontaine et al. 
104 
2011, Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al. 2017). Individuals of the same species can 
105 
function as antagonists or mutualistic partners of the same interacting species, 
106 
e.g., seed-caching rodents acting as seed predators and seed dispersers of the 
107 
same plant species (Loayza et al. 2014). In other scenarios, individuals may act 
108 
as antagonisms of some species and as mutualisms of others (Gómez et al. 
109 
2018, Gómez et al. 2014, Montesinos-Navarro et al. 2017). Finally, there are 
110 
species in which individuals are specialized cheaters, exploring mutualistic 
111 
interactions without providing any benefit in return like fig wasps and yucca 
112 
moths (Bronstein 2001). Thus, in mutualistic interactions, selection may favor 
113 
the evolution of life histories that exploit the resources and services provided 
114 
by mutualistic partners without providing benefits, hereafter, cheating 
115 
interactions (Bronstein 2001, Vieira et al. 2003).

We are beginning to understand how cheaters interactions could drive 
117 
evolutionary patterns in mutualisms, as species acting as a cheater or 
118 
mutualist may affect coevolution and local adaptation. For example, the 
119 
interaction between the plant Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae) and the 
120 
floral-parasitic moth Greya politella changes from parasitism to mutualism if 
121 
the legitimate pollinators of L. parviflorum are absent in the community 
122 
(Thompson & Cunningham 2002). A fundamental challenge to study 
123 
evolutionary consequences of ecological interactions at the community level is 
124 
that pairwise interactions affect each other within ecological networks. A 
125 
cheating interaction happen with a negative effect on one partner and positive 
126 
effect on the other one. In this context, evolutionary changes can cascade via 
127 
indirect effects (Guimarães et al. 2017), affecting how species traits evolve and 
128 
ultimately shaping how species interact in the community. As a consequence 
129 
of the non-random patterns of interaction networks, central species play an 
130 
important role in maintaining the structure of networks and, consequently, 
131 
increasing the stability of selection pressures between species in the network 
132 
(Martín Gonzáles et al. 2010). However, we still do not understand how 
133 
central cheaters affect mutualistic coevolutionary dynamics.  
134 
Here, we use a quantitative trait mathematical model, empirical 
135 
networks of species interactions, and numerical simulations to investigate 
136 
how cheaters interactions may affect coevolution in mutualistic networks. 
137 
Specifically, we explore three main questions i) How do different frequencies 
138 
of cheating interactions affect coevolutionary dynamics? Due to the arms race 
139

7 
 
dynamics favored by cheaters coevolution, we expect a higher trait mismatch 
140 
in scenarios with elevated frequencies of cheaters interactions. ii) Do central 
141 
cheater species amplify the effect of cheaters interactions on trait evolution? 
142 
Because central species can influence the trait evolution of several other 
143 
species, we expect that central cheater species will amplify the effect of 
144 
cheaters interactions on trait evolution in mutualistic networks. iii) What is 
145 
the effect of cheating interactions on the structure of mutualistic networks? By 
146 
assuming that cheaters interactions may favor arms race dynamics, one can 
147 
expect higher trait matching among species involved in arms races, but 
148 
increased trait mismatch with other partners, leading to the loss of 
149 
interactions. Thus, we expect that higher frequencies of cheaters interactions 
150 
will generate higher arms race dynamics and consequently, higher frequency 
151 
of interaction loss, generating networks with higher modularity (Figure 1b).

4. Methods 
154 
Evolutionary model  
155 
Our discrete-time, evolutionary model describes how the average trait of a 
156 
species i, Zi, evolves due to selection imposed by ecological interactions and 
157 
other environmental factors (e.g., abiotic conditions). In our model, the 
158 
selection differential, S, and the additive genetic variance of the trait governs 
159 
trait change across generations (Lande 1976). We assumed S has three 
160 
components potentially affecting the evolution of the trait Z: the selection 
161 
imposed by (i) mutualisms, (ii) cheating interactions, and (iii) other 
162

8 
 
environmental factors. As a first approximation, we assume that, for a given 
163 
interaction, species are either mutualistic partners or cheaters, but the same 
164 
species may behave as a cheater for species j but as a mutualistic partner to 
165 
species k. 
166 
The mutualism component, Smi is defined as the sum of selective effects 
167 
caused by all mutualistic partners of species i. We assume that selection 
168 
imposed by mutualism favors trait matching among mutualistic partners. We 
169 
also assume that perfect trait matching between partners i and j occurs if 
170 
|Zj(t)-Zi(t)| = 0 (Guimarães et al. 2011). A given species may have multiple 
171 
mutualistic partners and each partner may contribute differently to selection, 
172 
where the contribution of partner j to selection on species i is described by 
173 
mij(t). The total contribution of mutualistic partners to selection on Zi is 
174 
defined as: 
175 
𝑆𝑚𝑖= ∑𝑚𝑖𝑗
(𝑡)(𝑍𝑗
(𝑡) −𝑍𝑖
(𝑡))
𝑁
𝑗
 (1) 
176 
In the cheating component Sai, selection favors trait matching for the cheater 
177 
species j (as in equation 1) but favors trait mismatch for the victim species i, 
178 
defined as the species explored by the cheater. Like the mutualism 
179 
component, in our model, the magnitude of the trait change is dictated by the 
180 
evolutionary effect of species j on species i, vij(t). Selection for trait 
181 
mismatching between cheater on victim is dictated by 𝜀𝑖𝑗: 
182 
𝑆𝑎𝑖= ∑𝛿𝑖𝑗𝑣𝑖𝑗
(𝑡)(𝑍𝑗
(𝑡) ± 𝜖𝑖𝑗−𝑍𝑖
(𝑡))
𝑁
𝑗
 (2) 
183 
We assume if the trait difference between i and j is higher or equal to 𝜀𝑖𝑗, 
184 
|Zj(t)-Zi(t)|  ≥𝜀𝑖𝑗, then δij=0, and the cheater species imposes no selection on 
185

the victim. Thus, 𝜀𝑖𝑗 represents a trait barrier preventing the interaction due to 
186 
trait dissimilarity (e.g., Santamaria & Rodríguez-Gironés 2007). However, if 
187 
|Zj(t)-Zi(t)|< 𝜀𝑖𝑗, then δij=1 and selection on victim i will favor the increase or 
188 
decrease of trait values depending on Zj(t)-Zi(t). If Zj(t)-Zi(t) is positive, the signal 
189 
of 𝜀𝑖𝑗 will be positive. Contrarily, if Zj(t)-Zi(t) is negative, the signal of 𝜀𝑖𝑗will 
190 
negative (Andreazzi et al. 2017). Finally, we assumed that the environmental 
191 
component Sei is the combined effects of all other selective pressures favoring 
192 
an optimum trait value for each species, θi: 
193 
𝑆𝑒𝑖= 𝜃𝑖−𝑍𝑖
(𝑡) (3) 
194 
Combining the three selection components described above (equations 1, 2, 
195 
and 3), the evolutionary change of Zi in timestep t+1 is given by: 
196 
𝑍𝑖
(𝑡+1) = 𝑍𝑖
(𝑡) + 𝜑𝑖[(1 −𝛾𝑖)(𝑆𝑚𝑖+ 𝑆𝑎𝑖) + 𝛾𝑖𝑆𝑒𝑖] (4) 
197 
in which, φi is a compound parameter formed by additive genetic variance 
198 
and the slope of the adaptive landscape. The parameter ϒi dictates the 
199 
importance of ecological interactions versus environmental factors as selective 
200 
pressures. Thus, trait evolution, in our model, is defined as: 
201 
𝑍𝑖
(𝑡+1) = 𝑍𝑖
(𝑡) + 𝜑𝑖{(1 −𝛾𝑖)[∑𝑚𝑖𝑗
(𝑡)(𝑍𝑗

(𝑡)} (5) 
203 
The evolutionary effects mij(t)and vij(t) that affect the magnitude of trait change 
204 
due to the mutualism and cheating interactions, respectively, are defined as 
205 
the relative effect of species j on i, such that mij(t)=amijqij(t) and vij(t)=avijqij(t). amij 
206 
and avij depict, respectively, the presence of a mutualistic or a cheating 
207 
interaction between species i and j. The term qij(t) is defined as:

where the parameter α controls the sensitivity of the evolutionary effect due 
210 
to trait matching between species i and j and aik=1 if there is a mutualistic or a 
211 
cheating interaction between i and k and aik = 0, otherwise. 
212 
 
213 
Mutualistic networks 
214 
We use 24 empirical mutualistic networks available at the databases Web of 
215 
Life (http://www.web-of-life.es/) and Interaction Web Database 
216 
(http://ecologia.ib.usp.br/iwdb/index.html). These 24 networks include 
217 
eight plant-pollinator networks, eight plant-frugivore networks, and eight 
218 
ant-myrmecophyte networks. Each network is represented by an adjacency 
219 
matrix (A) in which each species is represented by a single row and a single 
220 
column of the matrix; each element of this matrix represents the presence or 
221 
absence of the corresponding animal-plant interaction. Ant-myrmecophyte 
222 
networks are commonly less connected, more modular, and less nested in 
223 
comparison to seed dispersal and pollination networks, while seed dispersal 
224 
networks are usually more nested and have a higher connectance than 
225 
pollination and ant-myrmecophyte networks (Supporting Information, 
226 
Guimarães 2020). 
227

Simulations 
229 
Our simulations describe how the mean trait Z evolves in time (Figure 1a). 
230 
The values and the description of the model parameters are depicted in Table

1. Each simulation ends after 1000 timesteps, an amount of time that is 
232 
sufficient to generate asymptotic trait values. In most simulations, however, 
233 
the equilibrium was reached before 1000 timesteps. To reduce computational 
234 
time, we assumed the equilibrium is achieved if |Zi(t+1) - Zi(t)|<10-4 for every 
235 
species i, ending the simulation. We run 72.000 simulations, 3.000 per 
236 
empirical network, where each simulation tracks how species traits change in 
237 
time due to coevolution and the selective pressures from the environment 
238 
(Figure 1a). All the simulations were performed in R v. 3.5.3 (R Core Team 
239 
2018). In what follows, we explain how we used this modelling approach to 
240 
explore each of our three questions. 
241 
 
242 
i) How do different frequencies of cheating interactions affect coevolutionary 
243 
dynamics? 
244 
We evaluated the impact of the emergence of cheating interactions on the 
245 
coevolutionary process. For each simulation, we define a probability p that an 
246 
interaction within a “mutualistic network” is not a mutualism per se but a 
247 
cheating interaction. We explore values of p ranging from 0.01 to 1 to test how 
248 
different frequencies of cheating interactions change the outcome of the 
249 
coevolutionary process. Thus, in this first analysis, we assume that cheating 
250 
interactions are randomly distributed across all interactions in the mutualism 
251 
network, whereas the frequency of cheating interactions in the network is 
252 
fixed in each simulation. This process of defining the outcome of interactions 
253 
based on p generates a network with both positive and negative effects, 
254 
merging the effect of mutualism and cheaters in a single network (Melián et 
255

al. 2009). Because we are defining a cheating interaction as interactions with a 
256 
negative effect on one partner and positive effect on the other one (i.e., an 
257 
antagonism), we prohibit the occurrence of double-negative effects between 
258 
two species. For this purpose, we only apply the transformation from positive 
259 
to negative effect based on p in the lower triangle of the adjacency matrix, 
260 
therefore maintaining cheating interactions as a combination of positive and 
261 
negative effects. We also assumed that the outcome of the interaction did not 
262 
change across time. Such an approach does not allow us to explore the effects 
263 
of conditional outcomes of many interactions, but it is a starting point to 
264 
unravel how cheating interactions changes the outcome of coevolution. We 
265 
performed a set of sensitivity analyses in which we relaxed the assumption of 
266 
fixed outcomes of interactions in time, allowing interactions to shift from 
267 
positive and negative outcomes during simulations. Our sensitivity analyses 
268 
suggest that temporal variability on the interaction outcome does not 
269 
influence our main results (Supporting Information). 
270 
We characterized the coevolutionary dynamics by describing patterns 
271 
in trait distributions across species. We first measure the average trait 
272 
distance between species as a proxy for trait disparity in the network. We 
273 
computed the mean pairwise distance (D), which is the sum of the Euclidean 
274 
distances of species traits between all possible pairwise combinations between 
275 
all species divided by the total number of pairwise combinations (Ciampaglio 
276 
et al. 2001):

to characterize the trait matching generated by the coevolutionary dynamics,

we used Ward's hierarchical clustering analysis (Ward 1963) along with the 
281 
GAP validation index, a pre analysis of the clustering algorithm for 
282 
evaluating the optimized number of clusters in a given dataset (Tibshirani et 
283 
al. 2001). We used this approach to compute the number of trait clusters 
284 
between interacting species. 
285 
ii) Do central cheater species amplify the effect of cheaters interactions on trait 
286 
evolution? 
287 
Some species do not provide benefit for any of their interaction partners, 
288 
relying exclusively upon cheating interactions (Bronstein 2001). We 
289 
hypothesize that exclusive cheaters species could amplify the effects of 
290 
cheating interactions, i.e., leading to effects on trait distributions that are 
291 
higher than observed in simulations with the same number of cheating 
292 
interactions in the network but randomly distributed across all ecological 
293 
interactions (see previous set of simulations). We expected that this effect 
294 
would be even stronger if the exclusive cheaters species are highly connected 
295 
or perform central roles in the network structure. To explore the role of these 
296 
exclusive, highly connected cheaters species in affecting the coevolutionary 
297 
outcome, we selected the most connected species of the network and assumed 
298 
these species are only involved in cheating interactions. To do so, we calculate 
299 
the degree centrality (Newman 2018), which is a standardized measure of the 
300 
number of interactions of a given species on the mutualistic network. The 
301

weighted degree centrality Ci for a species i from a given set (e.g., floral 
302 
visitors) is: 
303 
𝐶𝑖=
𝑘𝑖
𝑁0 (8) 
304 
in which 𝑘𝑖 is the number of interactions of species i and No is the species 
305 
richness from the opposite set of i (e.g., if species i is a floral visitor, the 
306 
opposite set is formed by flowering plants). We computed a z-score to detect 
307 
extreme values of species centrality and identify the most central species, 
308 
𝑆𝑖=
𝐶𝑖−𝐶̅
𝜎 (9) 
309 
where 𝐶̅ is the average value of degree centrality of the network and 𝜎 is the 
310 
standard deviation of the degree centrality values. To test the effect of central 
311 
cheaters species on trait evolution, we set all species with Si>1 as exclusive 
312 
cheaters. Thus, we will have a network with central species as obligate 
313 
cheaters - our Central scenario.  
314 
Finally, we compare the coevolutionary dynamics of the Central 
315 
scenario with the scenario in which cheating interactions were randomly 
316 
distributed across the network (the Random scenario). To create the Random 
317 
scenario, we measure the frequency of negative effects in networks (fCh) in the 
318 
Central scenario, as shown in Equation 10, and use this value of frequency as 
319 
a p in the networks of the Random scenario. We considered n(-+) as the 
320 
number of cheating interactions and n(++) as the number of mutualistic 
321 
interactions in the network. 
322 
𝑓𝐶ℎ=
𝑛(−+)
𝑛(−+)+𝑛(++) (10)

Thus, in the Random scenario, negative effects are not concentrated in central 
324 
species but distributed across the network. For each combination of empirical 
325 
networks (n = 24) and scenarios (Random and Central), we performed 1.500 
326 
simulations, leading to a total of 72.000 simulations. We ran all simulations 
327 
until the equilibrium. 
328 
iii) What is the effect of cheating interactions on the structure of mutualistic 
329 
networks? 
330 
In our baseline coevolutionary model, the trait barrier 𝜀𝑖𝑗 indicates that the 
331 
evolutionary effects of a cheater species on a victim became negligible. To 
332 
explore the effect of cheating interactions on the network structure, we 
333 
changed our baseline coevolutionary model to add an additional trait barrier, 
334 
bij, defining the maximum absolute trait mismatch between two species traits 
335 
so they can interact: 
336 
{
|𝑍𝑖
(𝑡) −𝑍𝑗
(𝑡)| > 𝑏𝑖𝑗, 𝑎𝑖𝑗= 0
|𝑍𝑖
(𝑡) −𝑍𝑗
(𝑡)| ≤𝑏𝑖𝑗, 𝑎𝑖𝑗= 1
 (11) 
337 
Note that 𝜀𝑖𝑗 represents a trait barrier which dictates if there is a 
338 
selection on a victim by a cheater species. In contrast, bij describes that a 
339 
potential mutualism or cheating interaction cannot occur because of a large 
340 
trait dissimilarity between partners. By incorporating bij in our model we 
341 
explored how network structure changes through time as an outcome of the 
342 
coevolutionary process. With this approach, in each simulation timestep, we 
343 
verified if there were interacting species with differences in trait values higher 
344 
than bij Following equation 11, we disconnected those interactions generating 
345

16 
 
an interaction loss. Since we are focusing on how the network changes due to 
346 
interaction loss, once the interaction is lost, it remains lost and cannot 
347 
reconnect during the simulations. Thus, at the end of a simulation, we may 
348 
have an interaction network with a different structure generated through the 
349 
removal of links. We then compared the initial and final network structure in 
350 
each particular simulation. 
351 
We characterize the structure of the networks calculating two common 
352 
measures of network structure: nestedness and modularity (Almeida-Neto et 
353 
al. 2008, Blondel et al. 2008). For each simulation, we computed the number of 
354 
interactions loss generated by the coevolutionary dynamics at the end of the 
355 
simulation, F. We computed the indexes describing structural change 
356 
between the final and initial network. We used two indexes of network 
357 
structure change: ΔNODF (Almeida-Neto et al. 2008) and ΔQ (Blondel et al. 
358 
2008). For each network, these measures are calculated as the difference 
359 
between the network nestedness (NODF) and modularity (Q) at the end and 
360 
at the beginning of the simulations: 
361 
{∆𝑁𝑂𝐷𝐹= 𝑁𝑂𝐷𝐹𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙−𝑁𝑂𝐷𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙
∆𝑄= 𝑄𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙−𝑄𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙
 (12) 
362 
Coevolutionary dynamics, in our model, therefore, may reduce the total 
363 
number of interactions, favoring specialization. We then explored if the 
364 
removal of interactions by coevolutionary dynamics deviates from random 
365 
removal of interactions from the initial network. To do so, for each 
366 
simulation, we created a third network generated by removing F interactions 
367 
from the initial network. This network, therefore, has the same number of 
368

17 
 
interactions than the coevolved network but the set of interactions removed 
369 
was randomly defined. We then compared how network structure changes 
370 
with random loss of interactions and loss of interactions due to trait 
371 
dissimilarity of coevolution outcomes. 
372 
 
373 
5. Results 
374 
i) How do different frequencies of cheating interactions affect coevolutionary 
375 
dynamics? 
376 
The higher the proportion of cheating interactions, the higher the trait 
377 
disparity observed across animal species and across plant species in the 
378 
network (Fig. 2a-c). The effect of cheating interactions is similar for the three 
379 
types of networks studied here, leading to increased trait disparity (Table 2). 
380 
Thus, cheating interactions increase the trait disparity across species (Fig. 2), 
381 
and this effect is not dependent on the structure of the ecological network. 
382 
Following our results, we develop an analytical approximation which relates 
383 
the importance of evolutive effects and the trait disparity of species. Both 
384 
simulations and analytical approximation points to an increase in trait 
385 
disparity due to cheating interactions (Supporting Information). 
386 
We observed that cheating interactions affect the number of species 
387 
trait clusters. At low levels of cheating interactions (p = 0.01, with p being the 
388 
frequency of cheating interactions in the networks), we found a low number 
389 
of clusters in simulations (2.43±0.62, Fig. 2d-f). At intermediate levels of 
390 
cheating interactions, the number of trait clusters increased (p = 0.5, 
391 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3289

18 
 
3.03±0.79). Finally, if most of the network is formed by cheating interactions 
392 
then, on average, we saw the formation of lower numbers of species trait 
393 
clusters, similar to when there is low frequency of cheating interactions (p = 
394 
0.9, Fig. 2d-f). Thus, increasing the frequency of cheating interactions fuels 
395 
trait disparity in mutualistic networks by promoting the emergence of trait 
396 
clusters. However, these trait clusters disappear under higher frequencies of 
397 
cheating interactions. 
398 
ii) Do central cheater species amplify the effect of cheaters interactions on trait 
399 
evolution? 
400 
Our results do not support the prediction that highly connected species 
401 
would have a stronger effect on trait evolution in mutualistic networks (Table 
402 
3). In fact, there is high variability in mean trait disparity within scenarios and 
403 
types of interactions across simulations shown by the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles 
404 
from our simulation results represented by the vertical bars in Fig. 3a-b. Thus, 
405 
highly connected cheaters species do not promote higher levels of trait 
406 
diversity than those promoted by cheating interactions distributed across the 
407 
network in our simulations (Fig. 3a). Similarly, the number of trait clusters of 
408 
species between scenarios are also variable (Fig. 3b). 
409 
iii) What is the effect of cheating interactions on the structure of mutualistic 
410 
networks? 
411 
In our simulations, coevolutionary dynamics assuming p = 0 (no cheating 
412 
interactions) led to almost no change in network structure [ΔQ ≅ 0; ΔNODF 
413 
≅ 0]. As we increase the frequency of cheating interactions, mutualistic 
414 
networks become more modular and less nested (Table 4). This increasing 
415 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3289

19 
 
modularity and reduced nestedness observed was not reproduced by simply 
416 
randomly removing interactions. Moreover, the increase in modularity and 
417 
reduction in nestedness was not equally distributed across mutualisms. In 
418 
mutualisms that the empirical network was initially very modular and not 
419 
nested (e.g., ant-myrmecophyte networks) changes in network structure were 
420 
weaker than in mutualisms showing higher nestedness (e.g., pollination and 
421 
seed dispersal). Hence, empirical networks under the effect of cheaters shift 
422 
its network structure towards high modular and low nested patterns (Table 
423 
4). 
424 
 
425 
6. Discussion 
426 
We explored the coevolutionary outcomes of cheating interactions in 
427 
mutualistic networks. Our results show how trait evolution and network 
428 
structure could change due to cheating lifestyles that emerge in mutualisms. 
429 
Previous studies already explored the effect of mutualisms and cheating 
430 
interactions on population dynamics (Law et al. 2001, Bronstein et al. 2003, 
431 
Wilson et al. 2003, Lee 2015) and phenotypic evolution (Ferriere et al. 2002). In 
432 
this context, our work contributes to further our understanding on 
433 
coevolutionary dynamics of multispecies assemblages in three different 
434 
ways.  
435 
First, cheating interactions promote higher community-level trait 
436 
disparity in mutualistic networks. By imposing selection favoring trait 
437 
mismatching, the presence of cheating interactions leads to an increase in 
438 
species trait disparity. This arms race dynamics partially offsets selection 
439 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3289

20 
 
favoring convergence and trait matching in mutualisms (Guimarães et al. 
440 
2011, Zhang et al. 2012). Therefore, cheating interactions may allow us to 
441 
understand one of the mechanisms preventing the perfect trait matching in 
442 
empirical mutualistic communities (Law et al. 2001); yet trait disparity cannot 
443 
increase indefinitely due to factors related to the environmental pressures and 
444 
distinct selection regimes (Andreazzi et al. 2017). For instance, limited genetic 
445 
variation or limited anatomical and physiological mechanisms restricts fruit 
446 
sugar content and flower size (Jordano 1995), which could limit the potential 
447 
for trait matching. Also, annual variation in soil nutrients limit the pulp 
448 
composition of fleshy fruits and, consequently, represents a restriction for the 
449 
development of sugar-rich fruits that are be highly attractive to frugivores 
450 
(Herrera 1998), limiting trait matching in plant-frugivore systems. 
451 
Cheating interactions promote, in a certain frequency, trait disparity in 
452 
mutualistic networks by generating clusters of species traits. In intermediate 
453 
frequencies of cheating interactions, the joint effect of mutualistic selection 
454 
favoring trait matching and cheaters interactions favoring trait mismatching 
455 
create clusters of species traits. There is theoretical evidence that the 
456 
proportion of positive and negative effects between species is close to 1:1 in 
457 
real communities (Dodds 1997). Thus, it is possible that our results showing 
458 
higher trait disparity due to the formation of trait clusters in intermediate 
459 
levels of cheating interactions could be empirically tested. The presence of 
460 
cheaters may be underestimated in empirical networks (Genini et al. 2010), 
461 
partially because there is great behavioral plasticity among interacting 
462 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3289

21 
 
individuals (Bronstein 2001). Thus, intraspecific variation generating 
463 
behavioral plasticity may play an important role in individual fitness and lead 
464 
to occasional cheating. This indicates that trait disparity may be higher than 
465 
expected in mutualistic interactions and future studies would benefit from 
466 
trait disparity measurements in empirical communities. 
467 
Second, the centrality of a cheater species does not change the trait 
468 
disparity pattern that results from mutualisms with cheating interactions. 
469 
Although species centrality is one of the best measures to identify important 
470 
species in ecological networks (Martín González et al. 2010), it is not the only 
471 
force driving the structure and dynamics of networks. For instance, the 
472 
distribution of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between component 
473 
species within a network has an impact in maintaining the network structure 
474 
when facing perturbations (Montesinos-Navarro et al. 2017). A next step for 
475 
our work is to explore how the position of certain cheating interactions could 
476 
change the coevolutionary dynamics. 
477 
Third, the presence of cheating species in mutualistic networks may 
478 
lead to the reorganization of network patterns due to the increased trait 
479 
dissimilarity. We found that cheating leads to increased modularity and 
480 
reduced nestedness in mutualistic networks. The emergence of modularity 
481 
was also observed as an outcome of coevolutionary dynamics in antagonistic 
482 
networks and depends on the selection intensity between victim and cheater 
483 
species (Andreazzi et al. 2017). Our results propose an alternative path to the 
484 
emergence of modularity in mutualistic networks, which depends on how 
485

22 
 
much cheating interactions the mutualistic networks support. The structure of 
486 
interaction networks is explained by several factors, such as species 
487 
abundance distribution (Dátillo et al. 2014), mismatch between traits of plants 
488 
and animals (Stang et al. 2007) and phylogenetic and phenology-based 
489 
constraints (Jordano 1995, Jordano et al. 2003). Here we show that cheating 
490 
interactions could also change the structure of mutualistic networks through 
491 
the coevolutionary process. Future studies could test the influence of cheating 
492 
interactions in cascading co-extinctions in mutualistic networks. 
493 
 
By now, our results suggest that the incorporation of the selection 
494 
imposed by the cheating interactions that naturally emerge from mutualisms 
495 
is pivotal to a deep understanding of the coevolutionary dynamics in species-
496 
rich mutualisms. Cheating interactions change the outcomes of mutualistic 
497 
coevolution, leading to increased interspecific trait variation and clustering. 
498 
We provide insights on the effect of multiple interaction types in a network 
499 
and how it may shape trait diversity by the contrasting selective forces 
500 
favoring convergence and disparity across interacting species (Sauve et al. 
501 
2016). The structure of simulated networks significantly changed when we 
502 
increased the frequency of cheating interactions, and this result opens new 
503 
questions on which is the balance of positive and negative effects that 
504 
maintains the structure of empirical networks. Our theoretical predictions 
505 
may also help us to understand how networks might evolve under a rapidly 
506 
changing world, in which interactions are vanishing due to several

positive effect between partner species, and cheating, as a positive effect for 
686 
the cheater and a negative effect for the victim species. The positive or 
687 
negative effect occurs from the species in columns to the species in rows 
688 
(respectively, i and j) and the effects that define those interactions are the 
689 
elements of the matrix (1 or -1). Then, we simulate how the species mean trait 
690 
value Z changes in time due to coevolution, as shown in the central plot. (b) 
691 
We show our expectations for trait matching considering i) the frequency of 
692 
cheating interactions, ii) species role, and iii) network structure and test these 
693 
predictions with numerical simulations using a trait-based coevolution model 
694 
and empirical mutualistic matrix of interactions.

710 
used to illustrate both scenarios; cheating interactions concentrated in a single 
711 
central species and randomly distributed in the network. Two points
