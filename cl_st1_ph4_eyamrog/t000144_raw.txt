ABSTRACT 
Objective: To analyze the spatial distribution of the four-year rates of mortality from 
cancer in Mato Grosso state, Brazil, in the period from 2000 to 2015. Methodology: 
Ecological design study, in which mortality from neoplasia was analyzed, from 2000 to 
2015, for the municipalities of the Mato Grosso state. Mortality rates due to cancer were 
calculated by the ratio of the sum of deaths by cancer in each quadrennium, divided by 
the average of the population in the two central years of the period, multiplied by 
10,000 inhabitants. Annual percentage change was calculated by the ratio of the linear 
regression coefficient to the cancer mortality rates in the Mato Grosso state at the 
beginning of the analyzed period (2000 to 2003). Thematic maps were constructed for 
each quadrennium using intervals of equal classes. Results: Cancer caused 31,097 
deaths in the Mato Grosso state in the period, 13,058 in women and 18,039 in men, with 
a male to female ratio of 1.38. The top five causes of cancer death in the period were 
lung (12.2%), prostate (8.7%), stomach (7.7%), breast (6.0%) and liver (4.7%). There 
was increase in the number of municipalities with rates greater than 23.67 deaths per 
100,000 inhabitants in the period. Conclusion: There was an increase in cancer 
mortality and an increase in the proportion of municipalities with higher mortality rates. 
Higher density of cancer mortality occurred in the municipalities located in the West, 
Center-South, Southeast and Center-North regions of the state.

INTRODUCTION 
Chronic noncommunicable diseases are responsible for most deaths worldwide. It is 
estimated that cancer is at the top of the basic causes of death and is the most important 
barrier to increasing life expectancy in the world1. 
In 2016, about 41 million deaths were due to chronic noncommunicable diseases and of 
these, 9 million (22%) had cancer as a basic cause1. Worldwide, projections for the year 
2030 indicate the occurrence of 26 million new cases and 17 million deaths from the 
disease2. These numbers express the importance of cancer as a leading cause of death 
worldwide3. 
In Brazil, between 1996 and 2010, 2,023,038 deaths from cancer occurred, with 53.9% 
affecting men and 46.1% women4. In the year 2017, the five primary locations with the 
highest death rates in the male population in the country were: bronchi and lung with 
15.60 per 100,000, followed by prostate with 14.24 per 100,000, thirdly the stomach 
with 8.82 per 100,000, in fourth the esophagus with 6.41 per 100.000 and in fifth place 
the liver and biliary tract with 5.71 per 100.000. In the female population, for the same 
year, the primary location that showed the highest rate was the breast with 13.22 per 
100,000, secondly that of the bronchi and lung with 9.20 per 100,000, followed by 
cervical cancer with 5.14 per 100,000, in the fourth place the colon with 4.62 per 
100,000 and in the fifth place the pancreas with 4.06 per 100,0005. 
The estimate of new cases of cancer in Brazil for the period 2020 to 2022 is 625 
thousand and for the state of Mato Grosso, were estimated crude rates of 252.04 per 
100,000 for men and 217.31 per 100,000 for women6. 
Spatial analysis of data allows the analysis of cases according to the distribution in a 
specific geographical area. However, it is worth mentioning that the spaces are not

homogeneous, because the spatial differentiation implies several other singularities, 
such as culture, education, income, genetic and housing characteristics7. 
In this way, the relevance of this study is unique, since the environment has 
characteristics that can act as risk factors for the occurrence of cancer. In addition, 
scientific production on the theme of cancer, using geoprocessing as an analysis tool, is 
still little explored, which further highlights the importance of this study, aiming to 
analyze the spatial distribution of the four-year rates of mortality from neoplasia, in the 
period from 2000 to 2015 in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil. 
 
METHODOLOGY 
Ecological design study, in which mortality from neoplasia (by municipality of 
residence) was analyzed, from 2000 to 2015, for the state of Mato Grosso. 
The Brazilian Legal Amazon corresponds to the area of operation of the 
Superintendence of Development of the Amazon - SUDAM, being formed by the states 
of Rondônia, Acre, Amazonas, Roraima, Pará, Amapá, Tocantins, Mato Grosso and the 
western part of the State of Maranhão. It has an area of approximately 5,015,067.749 
km², corresponding to approximately 58.9% of the Brazilian territory8. 
Data on the estimated population of the state were acquired from IBGE (Institute of 
Geography and Statistics, in portuguese)8 for the year 2018 (3,441,998 inhabitants, with 
a population density of 3.36 inhabitants per km2 and a territorial area of 903,206,997 
km²). The Mato Grosso state is divided into 7 geographic regions and 141 
municipalities (Figure 1). 
Mortality data were obtained from the databases of the Mortality Information System 
(SIM, in portuguese)9 provided by the Mato Grosso State Department of Health. Cancer 
deaths were analyzed under codes C00 to C97, according to the 10th ICD-10

(International Classification of Diseases). These deaths refer to individuals of all ages. 
Population estimates by age group were collected from the website of the Department of 
Informatics of the Unified Health System, the Brazilian public health system10. 
Mortality rates due to cancer were calculated by the ratio of the sum of deaths by cancer 
in each quadrennium, divided by the average of the population in the two central years 
of the period, multiplied by 10,000 inhabitants. The rates were adjusted by the direct 
method by age groups, with intervals of four years, considering as a standard population 
the distribution of the world population11. In order to reduce instability in the analysis of 
data on mortality by municipality, we sought to smooth out random fluctuations by 
grouping rates in four-year periods: 2000 to 2003; 2004 to 2007; 2008 to 2011; 2012 to 
2015. 
An annual percentage change was calculated by the ratio of the linear regression 
coefficient to the cancer mortality rates in the Mato Grosso state at the beginning of the 
analyzed period (2000 to 2003). Adopt a 5% significance level. 
To explore the spatial distribution of cancer mortality rates, thematic maps were 
constructed for each quadrennium using intervals of equal classes (0.00; between 0.01 
and 12.52; between 12.53 and 23.67; between 23.68 and 36.21; between 36.22 and 
48.00; above 48.00). The intervals were defined from the distribution of rates in the first 
quadrennium (2000-2003). The geographical unit of analysis were the 141 
municipalities of Mato Grosso. The municipalities of Itanhangá and Ipiranga do Norte 
were created in 2005, which made it impossible to calculate the mortality rate for the 
quadrennium from 2000 to 2003 and were declared as missings. The cartographic bases 
were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics12. The Kernel 
maps were built with an adaptive radius. Nine strata were used, divided into equal 
intervals.

For data analysis, the software STATA version 12.0 and the ArcMap Program version 
10.3 were used. The study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of Júlio 
Muller Universitary Hospital. 
 
RESULTS 
In the period from 2000 to 2015, cancer caused 31,097 deaths in the Mato Grosso state, 
13,058 in women and 18,039 in men, with a male to female ratio of 1.38. The top five 
causes of cancer death in the period were lung (12.2%), prostate (8.7%), stomach 
(7.7%), breast (6.0%) and liver (4.7%). The mortality rate in the state in the 
quadrenniums from 2000 to 2003, 2004 to 2007, 2008 to 2011 and 2012 to 2015 was 
30.0, 32.4, 32.8 and 33.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively, indicating an average 
annual increase of 8.3% (p = 0.030) (data not shown). 
Figure 2 shows the proportion of municipalities according to the intervals of equal 
classes defined in the maps. There is an increase in the proportion of municipalities with 
mortality rates between 23.68 to 36.21, between 36.22 to 48.00 and above 48.00. For 
the remaining intervals (0.00; between 0.01 and 12.52; between 12.53 to 23.67), there 
was a downward trend. 
Figure 3 shows the four-year trends in cancer mortality rates according to municipality. 
There is increase in the number of municipalities with rates greater than 23.67 deaths 
per 100,000 inhabitants in the period. The regions with the highest rate in the 
quadrenniums were West, Center-South, Southeast, Center-North and North, while the 
Northeast and Northwest regions had the lowest rates. 
The kernel intensity map (Figure 4) confirms that the highest density of cancer mortality 
occurred in the West, Center-South, Southeast and Center-North regions of the state and 
the lowest in the Northeast and Northwest regions. This pattern tends to be maintained

throughout the quadrenniums. For the North and Northwest regions there is a decrease 
in mortality densities over the four-year period. The Northeast region had the lowest 
densities in the entire period studied. 
 
DISCUSSION 
There was an average annual increase of 8.3% in cancer mortality rates and an increase 
in the proportion of municipalities with higher mortality rates. The municipalities 
located in the West, Center-South, Southeast and Center-North regions of the state 
presented higher density of cancer mortality. 
The results of this study identified space and time patterns that point to an increase in 
standardized rates of cancer mortality in the State of Mato Grosso from 2000 to 2015. 
According to IBGE data on the age distribution of the population, at least 80% of the 
state population is concentrated below 50 years of age. However, according to the Mato 
Grosso Oncology Care Action Plan, even though the state has a predominantly younger 
population, cancer has appeared as the second cause of death in mortality statistics 
(excluding external causes). In addition, there was also an increase in proportional 
cancer mortality, from 10.8% in 2001 to 14.3% in 201313. 
The pattern shown in the state was different from the national pattern, where general 
rates for the disease have been showing some stability4. A study that described the main 
groups of causes of death from chronic non-communicable diseases between 1990 and 
2015 according to estimates from the GBD (Global Burden of Disease) 2015 study, 
showed that, for Brazil, the standardized mortality rates for cancer went from 142.7 per 
100,000 inhabitants (1990) to 133.5 per 100,000 inhabitants (2015), considered stable 
for the analyzed period14.

The five main causes of death from cancer in the period for the state, considering the 
anatomical location, were lung, prostate, stomach, breast and liver. With the exception 
of liver cancer, which appears only in Mato Grosso, the others are also among the five 
main types of cancer that kill the most in Brazil, although not in the same order15. 
Estimates from Global Cancer Observatory show that, worldwide, lung cancer remains 
the leading cause of cancer mortality, with 1.8 million deaths predicted in 2018, 
representing about 1 in 5 cancer deaths. Prostate cancer is considered the fifth leading 
cause of cancer death in men, and breast cancer the first in women, accounting for about 
1 in 4 cancer cases in this group. Stomach cancer remains an important cancer 
worldwide, accounting for about 783,000 deaths, equivalent to 1 in 12 deaths from 
cancer, while liver cancer is considered the fourth leading cause of cancer death 
worldwide3. 
The profile of deaths presented in the state has been associated with more urbanized, 
industrialized regions with an aging population, in line with developed countries in the 
West. On the other hand, the state continues to live with deaths due to types of cancer 
associated with infections, such as stomach cancer, which have a high potential for 
prevention and tend to be more prevalent in countries of low and medium 
development16. 
Cancer is a multifactorial disease, however, according to the WHO (World Health 
Organization), some risk factors are related to most deaths from chronic 
noncommunicable diseases, including cancer, having an important contribution to the 
burden of diseases. Among these factors, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, 
inadequate diet and physical inactivity stand out17. 
Data from the National Health Survey for Mato Grosso18, showed that only 37.0% of 
the state's population aged 18 or over reported recommended consumption of fruits and

vegetables, while 52.9% were classified as insufficiently active (behind Rondônia state 
only), 24.3% reported weekly alcohol consumption and 12.8% as current users of 
tobacco products. 
There was also a higher proportion of deaths for men. This can be explained by the fact 
that the three main types of cancer were more present in this group. A study that aimed 
to analyze the temporal trend of cancer mortality in Brazil in the period from 1996 to 
2010, in addition to calculating the projection of mortality for the period from 2011 to 
2030, showed that 53.9% of deaths affected men and 46.1% were female. In addition, 
there was stability in female mortality and a significant increase in the trend for males 
between 1996 and 20084. 
Literature data have pointed out that men and women have different life expectancies 
and habits, with greater female demand for health services and, consequently, with 
women adopting greater preventive health care than men19. 
Spatial analysis of cancer mortality, through the use of maps, is an important tool to 
evaluate health risks, especially when this type of analysis considers environmental 
aspects, as the visualization of information allows a better understanding of how 
relationships occur, and can contribute to the identification of priority territories, as well 
as a better understanding of the health-disease process and health planning actions20. 
The use of geoprocessing also allows for a historical analysis of the demand for care in 
health services, helping to optimize care in health units and producing important 
changes in epidemiological and operational indicators21. 
The use of this analysis allowed us to identify that the regions of the state that had the 
highest mortality rates were the West, Center-South, Southeast, Center-North and North 
regions. These regions showed differences that can be expressed through socioeconomic 
indicators of the municipalities that integrate them, with also an inequality in installed

capacity and in public and private investments, especially in those with less economic 
dynamism22. Despite this diversity, what can be observed is that, in general, these 
regions have less availability of primary care services, and some also have low health 
care expenditures (West Region), low availability of specialized assistance 
establishments (West and North Regions) and low outpatient care per inhabitant in 
medium and high complexity (West, North and Center-North Regions)23,24. 
Specifically with regard to primary health care services, they serve as a gateway to the 
health care network. The low availability of these services may impair the identification, 
in the initial phase, of the first lesions suggestive of cancer and, consequently, 
determine the specialized services as the predominant places for the diagnosis of the 
disease, since the confirmation of the lesions requires procedures and supplies available 
only in medium and high complexity services25. 
Another characteristic of the state is that, with the exception of some municipalities in 
the Center-South region, agriculture and services are the economic base of practically 
all regions of the same23. 
Currently, Mato Grosso is the state that most produces soy, corn, cotton and cattle in 
Brazil, having become, for several years, a strategic territory for the expansion of 
agribusiness26, in whose model predominates large monoculture properties, intensive 
use of chemical and pesticide fertilizers to control unwanted species and use of 
biotechnology (transgenics)27. This issue was evidenced by the higher cancer mortality 
rates in cities close to BR-163 (a federal highway) (Figure 3), which can probably be 
explained by the relationship between soy production (with transgenics and use of 
pesticides, which have highly carcinogenic potentials) and the presence of the highway 
to transport production to other countries28.

The state has some municipalities that concentrate a large part of the national 
agricultural production, such as some municipalities located in the central and southeast 
regions. Consequently, due to the chemical-dependent production method, in these 
municipalities there are high rates of consumption of pesticides29. 
The relationship between exposure to pesticides and cancer development has been 
established in several studies30-33, being modulated by type of product used, time of 
exposure and amount absorbed by the body34. It is important to highlight that the entire 
population is susceptible to multiple exposures to pesticides, through the consumption 
of contaminated water and food, and not only farmers and workers in the pesticide 
production chain35. 
A possible limitation of the study concerns the incorrect or incomplete filling of 
information on death certificates in relation to the causes. There was no correction of 
rates for deaths from ill-defined causes. However, deaths from these causes have 
decreased in recent decades in all Brazilian regions, especially in cities outside the 
capitals36,37. This has indicated an improvement in the quality of the information 
recorded in the Mortality Information System, especially for the group of malignant 
neoplasms, where the quality of information about the basic cause registered in the 
system can be considered better than for other groups of causes38. 
In 2015, the UN adopted a set of 17 goals as part of a sustainable development agenda. 
One of the goals is related to the reduction of premature mortality due to 
noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment. It has therefore become a 
global priority to monitor trends in mortality due to these diseases, provided by quality 
information systems, in order to verify whether national and global commitments are 
being achieved39.

Thus, the description of cancer mortality can bring important contributions to 
epidemiological studies based on the person-space-time triad. Studies of this magnitude 
are necessary, especially in Mato Grosso, since studies on this topic are scarce, and 
knowing this reality can potentially contribute to the identification of priority regions 
for intervention aiming to reduce mortality rates.
