The recent declaration of the novel coronavirus pandemic by the World Health Organization has prompted various municipal and state health departments to issue decrees closing facilities designated for physical activity. Additionally, the Ministry of Health has developed a manual outlining numerous initiatives aimed at curbing the spread of the disease, along with advocating for social isolation and advising individuals to stay at home. These collective measures have significantly impeded the ability of the Brazilian population to engage in physical activity.
On the contrary, existing literature consistently presents evidence supporting the various health advantages associated with physical activity, particularly in relation to the cardiovascular/metabolic and immunological systems. In recent times, research has also started to indicate that health outcomes are not solely dependent on regular physical activity but also on minimizing sedentary behavior, defined as the time spent sitting, lying down, or reclining during waking hours, excluding periods of sleep.
There is a crucial necessity to maintain physical activity during the novel coronavirus pandemic, with certain precautions to ensure safety. It is noteworthy that even in Wuhan, China, the initial epicenter of the disease, individuals were advised to engage in physical activity within their homes. Additionally, it is essential to educate the population about the importance of decreasing sedentary behavior during this period of social isolation.
The primary objectives of this viewpoint are to underscore the significance of these issues and to offer recommendations for promoting the ongoing engagement in physical activity and mitigating sedentary behavior amidst the novel coronavirus pandemic in Brazil.
The extensive literature consistently highlights the advantageous impact of regular physical activity on cardiovascular and metabolic health. Numerous studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between physical activity and key health indicators such as blood pressure levels, diabetes, lipid profiles, and various cardiovascular events.
In terms of the duration and intensity of physical activity necessary to achieve these benefits, a recent publication proposed that men should engage in 180 to 300 minutes of moderate to intense activity per week, while women should aim for 150 to 300 minutes of similar activity to effectively promote cardiovascular and metabolic health benefits. These recommendations align with the primary physical activity guidelines put forth by international organizations.
The immune system serves as a crucial defense mechanism within the body, adept at identifying and eradicating a variety of invasive microorganisms. The initial line of defense comprises leukocytes such as neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes, alongside natural killer cells, acute-phase proteins, and enzymes. Following this primary defense, the secondary line of defense is constituted by T and B lymphocytes, as well as immunoglobulins.
The practice of physical exercise modulates the levels of these substances in the body, leading to both increases and decreases, with the extent of change being contingent upon the intensity and duration of the physical activity.
In the context of leukocytes, their concentration typically rises during physical activity and promptly decreases post-exercise, particularly after prolonged, high-intensity workouts that can induce immunosuppression. This phenomenon aligns with the "open window" theory, which suggests a temporary depression in the immune system following strenuous exercise, rendering the body more vulnerable to bacterial infections for a span of 3 to 72 hours. Importantly, the duration of immunosuppression is notably shorter after light to moderate exercise sessions that are not prolonged.
Sedentary behavior is typically described as engaging in activities with low energy expenditure, typically not surpassing 1.5 metabolic equivalents. These activities encompass specific behaviors such as sitting, reclining, or lying down while reading, studying, watching television, or using the computer, among others. It is important to note that sedentary behavior does not include hours spent sleeping.
A recent study has shown that decreasing sedentary behavior is linked to positive impacts on various factors related to cardiometabolic health in adults. Additionally, the authors of this study found that combining reduced sedentary behavior with consistent physical activity further enhanced these benefits.
Given Brazil's vast territorial expanse, it is crucial to monitor the directives issued by state or municipal health authorities as well as the Ministry of Health concerning the limited access to gyms, clubs, clinics, and other facilities designated for physical activity and exercise.
In instances where public spaces are inaccessible, it is advisable to engage in physical activity outdoors whenever feasible. Individuals should focus on solitary activities, ensuring they steer clear of gatherings or even small clusters of people. Should outdoor options be limited, it is recommended to maintain physical activity within the confines of one's home, utilizing technology like workout videos, fitness apps, or online coaching for guidance and support.
When outdoor physical activity is feasible, it is advisable to engage in aerobic exercises, particularly individual activities, while steering clear of crowded settings. Currently, it is imperative to refrain from participating in group sports, even in small gatherings.
In situations where home-based exercise is required, it is advisable to engage in muscle-strengthening routines like squats, push-ups, sit-ups, and other relevant exercises, along with stretches, balancing drills, and stair climbing, ideally with the aid of technology such as workout videos, apps, and online expert guidance. Additionally, it is crucial to underscore the significance of augmenting domestic physical activity through routine household chores like dishwashing, laundry, ironing, and comparable tasks.
During the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil, it is advisable to engage in physical exercise at a light to moderate intensity level. This recommendation is based on the understanding that engaging in very high-intensity exercise may result in a more pronounced immunosuppressive effect on the body, necessitating an extended period for recovery.
During the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil, it is advisable that individuals engage in exercise sessions lasting approximately 30 to 60 minutes each day. This recommendation is based on the understanding that prolonged exercise may lead to immune system suppression, necessitating longer recovery periods.
In addition to regular physical activity, it is crucial to minimize sedentary behavior for overall health. The following recommendations are suggested:
To adhere to recommended health guidelines, it is advisable to limit sedentary behavior to a maximum of 6 to 8 cumulative hours per day.
Limit screen time to a maximum of 2 to 4 hours per day.
An effort should be made to increase the frequency of interruptions or breaks in sedentary behavior, with the recommendation being to stand up for a minimum of 5 minutes for every hour spent sitting.
Based on the consulted studies, the evidence unequivocally underscores the significance of maintaining physical activity levels during the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic. It is recommended to engage in activities of light to moderate intensity and duration, preferably outdoors or within the confines of one's home. Furthermore, there is a crucial emphasis on the reduction of sedentary behavior, which includes minimizing time spent sitting, lying down, or reclining (excluding sleep hours), as well as limiting screen time in front of devices such as televisions and computers.
