ABSTRACT 
CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The current health crisis due to COVID-19 is forcing us to 
profoundly rethink our social organizations and practices in health. While there is no 
effective treatment for the virus, staying home and social isolation are the control 
measures recommended by health authorities. The aim of this study is to perform a 
scoping review in order to summarize the current evidence in telehealth for COVID-19. 
METHODS: This study is a protocol to describe the rationale, hypothesis and planned 
methods of our scoping review. We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 
observational cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, qualitative 
studies, and/or case series that describe telehealth interventions applied or developed to 
respond to COVID-19. We will search Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, 
Cochrane Library - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Portal 
Regional BVS - LILACS, and Scopus. We will include studies performed since December 
2019 with no language restrictions. We will use the Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale to perform the critical appraisal of included studies. We will assess the 
certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development 
and Evaluation (GRADE).

INTRODUCTION 
The world is currently under the threats of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic (1). The rapid spread of the disease has overwhelmed health care systems 
worldwide. The most important challenge in COVID-19 pandemic seems to be the high 
transmissibility. Therefore, reducing the speed of transmission may reduce the burden on 
health systems. Telemedicine emerges as a viable strategy that can expand access and 
bring medical attention to the needy and to people living in remote areas (2). It is an 
approach that may be useful for screening, diagnosing and monitoring patients with 
several conditions (3).  
As no treatment has been proven to be effective, social distancing is currently the best 
defense against COVID-19 (4). Social distancing measures have rapidly changed how 
physicians assess and interact with patients (5). Many providers have appropriately 
cancelled non-emergent procedures and converted ambulatory appointments to remote 
video visits or phone calls (5). Telehealth applications have also been developed, aiming 
at screening and monitoring people who are suspected of having COVID-19 (6). 
With the global emergency scenario, huge efforts have been made, also in the scientific 
world. New studies about COVID 19 are being published daily and scientific evidence is 
constantly being updated. This exponential production, however, has a contradiction: the 
development of inaccurate information or of low scientific reliability, hindering the 
decision-making process and the appropriate allocation of resources. As for the 
professionals who are on the front line fighting the pandemic and to health managers, 
synthesizing all this information may not be viable and is frequently not adequate. 
Therefore, we aim to perform a scoping review in order to summarize the current evidence 
in telehealth for COVID-19. 
 
 
 
METHODS 
Design 
This protocol aims to describe the planned methods of our scoping review. It will be 
reported in accordance with the Extended Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) (7). 
 
Eligibility criteria 
We will include randomized controlled trials (RCT), cohort studies, case-control studies, 
cross-sectional studies, and/or case series that describe telehealth applications for 
fighting COVID-19 pandemic. We will consider all patients using any category of 
telehealth applications, without any restriction related to modality of intervention, age or 
sex of the participants. Software, online programs, social media pages, video education, 
mobile applications, or other similar information and communication technology applied 
or developed to screen, diagnose or monitor COVID-19 patients will be considered. 
Outcome measures 
● 
Primary outcomes: Effectiveness of diagnostic and prognostic evaluation, 
Hospitalization rate  
● 
Secondary outcomes: Adherence; Feasibility; Users satisfaction; cost; self‐
management and self‐efficacy 
 
Data sources and searches 
We will search Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane Library - Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Portal Regional BVS - LILACS, and 
Scopus using relevant descriptors and synonyms, adapting the search to the 
specifications of each database to identify published, ongoing, and unpublished studies. 
We will include studies performed since November 2019. No language restrictions will be 
used in the selection. 
We will also search the following COVID-19 specific databases: Epistemonikos COVID-
19 L·OVE platform; ClinicalTrials.gov; The World Health Organization International 
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). 
Additionally, we will apply the technique of snowballing, searching the lists of references 
of the included studies 
 
Search strategy 
We will use the terms related to the problem of interest, the intervention and the filter the 
date of publication. The search strategy in Medline via Pubmed is shown in Table 1.

The search strategy above will be used in Medline via Pubmed and will be adapted to the specifications of 
each database. 
 
 
Study selection 
Two authors (FSAR and RRPS) will select the studies for inclusion in the review. When 
duplicated studies are found, only one of them will be considered for inclusion. If reports 
using the same participants and different outcome measurements or using different time 
points for the assessments are found, both reports will be included, but will be considered 
as parts of only one study. After removing duplicated studies and/or reports, the authors 
will read the study titles and abstracts. Studies that clearly do not fulfill the eligibility criteria 
will be excluded. The remaining studies will then be fully read and assessed for inclusion 
in the review. Disagreements between authors regarding the inclusion of studies will be 
solved by the third author (VFMT). We will present the reasons for exclusion of the 
studies. To optimize the process of screening and selection of studies, Rayyan application 
(8) will be used.  
 
 
 
Data extraction  
Two authors (FSAR and RRPS) will independently extract data. Discrepancies or 
disagreements will be solved by a third author (VFMT). We will use a predefined form to 
extract data from included studies. The form will include information on: (I) Demographic 
and clinical characteristics of the patients or participants; (II) Time points used for the 
assessments; (III) Approach for handling missing data (data imputation/how data 
imputation was performed, use of intention-to-treat approach); (IV)Outcome measures; 
(V)Sources of funding; (VI)Possibility of conflict of interests; 
 
Assessment of methodological quality in included studies and certainty of the 
body of evidence 
We will use the Risk of Bias tool as recommended by Cochrane Handbook for Systematic 
Reviews (9) to perform the critical appraisal of randomized clinical trials; for observational 
studies, we will use Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (10). The quality of evidence will be 
assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation (GRADE) (11). We will use the GRADE profiler software to summarize our 
findings on the quality of evidence (12). Assessment of risk of bias, and assessment of 
the certainty of evidence will be performed by two authors (FSAR and KMMM), and all 
the disagreements in the assessment of the risk of bias or quality of evidence will be 
solved through discussion or, if required, by consulting with a third author (VFMT). 
 
Data Synthesis and Analysis 
When at least two studies are sufficiently homogeneous in terms of design, participants, 
intervention and outcome measurements, we will assess the possibility of pooling their 
results into meta-analysis. All possible analyses will be performed following the 
recommendations of Cochrane Handbook (9). If insufficient information or heterogeneous 
studies are found, the results of the studies will be summarized only in qualitative 
synthesis. 
For evaluating prognosis, we will perform analyses according to the recommendations of 
Cochrane, and the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group. When the response of interest 
is provided by continuous variable we will perform the analysis in terms of mean difference 
(MD) or Hedge’s/Cohen’s (SMD). In case of dichotomous response will pool a hazard 
ratios (unadjusted (crude) or adjusted) or odds ratio with their standard errors for hospital 
admission, intensive care unit admission and/or respiratory support for adult inpatients 
with COVID-19 and mortality. All others parameters as standard deviation (for MD or 
SMD, for instance) and each number of events (RR or OR, for instance) will be pooled. 
In all cases we will use the generic inverse variance method with random-effects model. 
The package to be used is the “meta” (version 4.11-0). 
 
Dealing with missing data 
For studies that do not provide a mean and associated standard deviation (SD), we will 
use information and results reported in the text or tables, doing the correct inference. 
When the parameters established before are not available, the estimate based on other 
parameters will be made ensuring the correct information. 
We will contact the principal investigators of the included studies asking for additional 
data or to clarify issues about the studies. In the absence of a reply from the authors, we 
will expose the data in a descriptive manner avoiding imputation. 
 
Assessment of heterogeneity 
We will employ the Cochran’s Q test to assess the presence of heterogeneity considering 
a threshold of P value < 0.1 as an indicator of whether heterogeneity is present. In 
addition, we will assess statistical heterogeneity by examining the Higgins I2 statistic 
following these thresholds:   < 25%: no (none) heterogeneity; 25% to 49%: low 
heterogeneity;  50% to 74%: moderate heterogeneity;  ≥ 75%: high heterogeneity. 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
The strategies of social distancing, quarantine and isolation applied to reduce the COVID-
19 transmissibility are necessary nowadays. In this context, the importance of using 
telehealth to provide assistance can be an interesting alternative. With the great amount 
of information and communication technologies being developed, it is important to know 
their outcomes and gains that can be followed for other health issues. Thus, this scoping 
review aims to summarize the current evidence in telehealth for COVID-19. 
Potential limitations for this study include the possibility of finding biased studies which 
can make them unsuitable for providing precise estimates or reliable information.
