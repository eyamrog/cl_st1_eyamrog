The mandibular canal (MC), situated within the mandible, houses the inferior alveolar nerve and vessels. This neurovascular bundle is vulnerable during mandibular surgical interventions, emphasizing the importance of a thorough preoperative assessment of the MC. Such evaluations can significantly enhance the safety of treatments and reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications.
The objective of this study was to evaluate prevalent radiographic techniques used for the mandibular canal in dentistry to enhance preoperative planning.
Methods: This research article provides a comprehensive review of three radiographic techniques commonly used in dentistry: periapical, panoramic, and cone-beam computed tomography. Each technique is examined in terms of its advantages and disadvantages, with a particular focus on their practical utility in the daily practice of dentistry.
Discussion: Panoramic radiography and cone-beam computed tomography technology are highly regarded for their utility in evaluating the mandibular canal.
In conclusion, all techniques discussed in this paper, with the exception of periapical radiography, have demonstrated utility in enhancing the visibility of the MC.
The mandibular canal (MC), situated within the mandible, houses the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), a branch of the mandibular nerve, which is part of the trigeminal nerve's third division, along with the inferior alveolar vessels (artery and vein) [1,2]. The IAN is responsible for providing sensation to the mandibular teeth and gingivae, branching into two main components: a) the mental nerve, which exits the MC through the mental foramen to supply sensory innervation to the chin and lower lip, and b) the mylohyoid nerve, which offers motor innervation to the mylohyoid muscle [2,3].
The inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) is vulnerable during mandibular surgical procedures due to its location and trajectory. Any damage to the nerve bundle or its branches can result in a temporary or permanent loss of tactile sensation in the lower lip and chin. A study conducted by Robert et al. in 2005 revealed alarming findings, with 94.5% of California oral and maxillofacial surgeons reporting incidents of IAN injury during mandibular surgeries within a 12-month period. Understanding the dimensions and pathways of the mental canal (MC) is crucial for accurate planning, as it significantly influences the outcome of the procedure. Therefore, ensuring adequate preoperative visualization of the MC can lead to safer treatments and reduce the risk of IAN morbidity.
In a research study examining the vertical positioning of the Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) in 39 edentulous human cadaveric mandibles, Kieser et al. discovered that 30.7% (12 out of 39) of the IAN were situated in the superior region of the mandible's body, while 69.2% (27 out of 39) were positioned halfway or nearer to the inferior border of the mandible [8].
In contrast, Kane et al. conducted a study examining the bucco-lingual position of the mental foramen in 20 patients through computed tomography (CT). Their findings revealed that the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and its accompanying vessels are typically located approximately 4.7mm from the buccal aspect and 1.8mm from the lingual side of the mandible at the level of the mandibular first molar [9].
Kim et al. conducted a study on sixty-two mandible sides to investigate the bucco-lingual position of the MC and the topography of the IAN through three-dimensional reconstruction. Their findings revealed that 70% of the canals traced the lingual aspect along the ramus and mandibular body, with 15% positioned at the middle of the ramus behind the second molar and transitioning lingually through the second and first molars, while the remaining 15% followed the middle or lingual third of the mandible from the ramus to the body. Additionally, Kim et al. reported that the inferior alveolar vessels were situated above the IAN in 80% of cases and laterally to it in the remaining 20% [10].
The morphology of the mental canal (MC) typically presents as unique, although instances of bifid [6, 11, 12] or even more rarely trifid [13] configurations have been documented. Nasseh and Aoun highlight that while bifid MCs are considered uncommon, they are present in every patient to some extent and therefore necessitate thorough evaluation [6].
Several authors have investigated the bifurcation of the mental canal using various radiographic techniques. Nortje et al. [11] and Langlais et al. [12] utilized panoramic radiographs in their studies, revealing a prevalence of bifid mental canals of 0.91% (33 out of 3612) and 0.95% (57 out of 6000), respectively.
Other authors have utilized alternative imaging technologies, including CT and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) [14,15].
Typically, the mental nerve exits the mandible buccally through the mental foramen, which is situated at the apical region of the premolars [16-23].
The objective of this study was to examine various visibility techniques for the MC, analyzing their respective benefits and drawbacks, and exploring their practical implementation within the routine dental practice of professionals.
In routine dental practice, the radiographic assessment of the mental canal (MC) is commonly conducted using periapical, panoramic, and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images, with visibility percentages of 28%, 32%, and 98% respectively [24]. In traditional two-dimensional (2D) radiography, the MC presents as a radiolucent image with distinct radiopaque borders, situated below the roots of the mandibular molars and premolars [25]. This characteristic appearance primarily arises from the principles governing the formation of radiographic lines. A radiopaque line becomes apparent when the primary X-ray beam is perpendicular to the interface between two distinct densities. In the context of the MC, these differing densities stem from the trabecular bone and the inferior neurovascular bundle.
Periapical radiographs, despite their superior 2D image resolution, are not recommended for evaluating MC due to their limited size and coverage [25].
Unlike periapical radiographs, panoramic 2D X-rays provide a comprehensive view of the entire mouth, showcasing various structures including the mental canal (MC) as depicted in Figure 1. Liu et al. categorized the path of the MC into four distinct curves: linear, arc-elliptic, spoon-shaped, and turning [26].
However, the visibility of the MC diminishes when its borders are rendered undetectable as a result of poor bone density or a lack of perpendicularity between the canal and the principal beam [27]. This technique also presents drawbacks such as reduced resolution, increased distortion, and a heightened risk of phantom images [28].
Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is often regarded as the "gold standard" for maxillofacial imaging due to its ability to provide a more accurate three-dimensional representation of the maxillary sinus (MC) image. In a study by De Oliveira-Santos et al., it was found that 41% of the maxillary sinuses that were not detectable on 2D radiographs were actually visible on CBCT, highlighting the superior diagnostic capabilities of this technology [29].
On cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), the mental canal (MC) is identifiable and can be manually traced. It is imperative for the operator to exercise caution when delineating the reconstruction and tracking the path of the mental canal (MC), as illustrated in Figure 2.
Kim et al. introduced a novel automated method for isolating the MC without requiring user intervention. Initial experimental findings, based on the analysis of 10 clinical DICOM files, demonstrated the technique's ability to accurately identify the MC. Furthermore, this method exhibits exceptional segmentation precision, as highlighted in previous research [30].
Ba≈üa and Dilek noted that the average density and thickness of the bone surrounding the MC may not provide adequate resistance to drilling forces, particularly during implant placement. Therefore, it is imperative for the operator to exercise caution when approaching the canal [31].
The location and anatomical variations of the mental canal (including bifid canal, double and accessory mental foramina, and the incidence of an anterior loop) as observed on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) have been extensively evaluated in existing literature [5-8, 11-15].
Panoramic radiography is frequently utilized in routine dental practice due to its ability to provide a comprehensive overview of teeth and oral structures. When it comes to the mental canal (MC), it is typically easily detectable in most instances, enabling practitioners to assess the potential risk of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) injury during invasive procedures. Nevertheless, this two-dimensional technology falls short in providing three-dimensional information and may not adequately visualize the finer details of the mental canal [24].
While CBCT holds significant value in routine oral and maxillofacial practices, it is limited in its ability to visualize the nerve directly, focusing primarily on the mandibular canal (MC). Despite this limitation, CBCT remains the preferred method for pre-surgical radiographic planning, particularly for procedures like implant placement and surgical extraction of the third molar. The ability to precisely delineate the mandibular canal can greatly aid the surgeon in avoiding potential complications during procedures.
The neurovascular bundle situated in the mandibular canal is vulnerable to damage during invasive surgical procedures in the mandibular regions, highlighting the critical need for a comprehensive assessment prior to any intervention.
In this paper, three techniques are examined, with panoramic radiography and cone-beam computed tomography identified as potentially valuable tools for evaluating the mandibular canal.
