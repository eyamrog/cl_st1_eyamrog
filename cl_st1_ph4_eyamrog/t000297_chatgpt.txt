The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus strain in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China, has had a profound global impact. While resources are being mobilized to combat the spread of the virus, it is imperative to acknowledge the mental health implications of this epidemic to effectively address the crisis at hand. This outbreak has been linked to a range of mental health issues including stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger, and fear. These psychological challenges not only affect the afflicted individuals and the general populace but also have repercussions on the focus, comprehension, and decision-making abilities of healthcare professionals, potentially impeding the battle against COVID-19. Furthermore, these mental health issues could have enduring effects on the overall well-being of those involved.
In recent weeks, a significant volume of information has circulated regarding the emergence of a new strain of coronavirus in the People's Republic of China (PRC). This information, originating from a variety of sources ranging from freelance journalists to renowned epidemiologists, has provided diverse perspectives on the epidemic. However, a crucial aspect of this outbreak that has been overlooked is the profound impact it has had on mental health, affecting not only the patients themselves but also the medical personnel and society at large.
The city of Wuhan in the People's Republic of China has garnered global attention as the focal point of an outbreak of a febrile respiratory disease caused by a novel strain of coronavirus. In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia with an unidentified etiology occurred in Wuhan, located in Hubei Province, China, showing an epidemiological connection to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan.
The Chinese health authorities swiftly implemented comprehensive public health measures, such as intensive surveillance, epidemiological investigations, and the closure of the market on January 1, 2020. They ruled out severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus (MERS-CoV), avian influenza, and other common respiratory viruses.
Chinese researchers swiftly isolated a novel coronavirus, initially designated as 2019-nCoV, from a patient on January 7, 2020, and promptly conducted genome sequencing of the virus. The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was expeditiously shared with the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020, facilitating the development of specific PCR diagnostic tests in laboratories worldwide to identify the new infection. Unlike MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 represents a previously unidentified betacoronavirus and is the seventh member of the coronavirus family known to infect humans. The recent outbreak of viral pneumonia linked to SARS-CoV-2 in the Wuhan market poses significant global health risks and may be associated with the trade of bush meat sourced from wild or captive animals in the seafood market.
The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the name COVID-19 for this novel respiratory ailment. Predominantly affecting men, a majority of the infected individuals presented with underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Typical symptoms observed at the onset of the illness included fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue, while less common manifestations encompassed sputum production, headache, haemoptysis, and diarrhoea. Complications associated with the disease comprised acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, and secondary infections (9–11).
Numerous uncertainties persist regarding the novel coronavirus, particularly its transmission from animals to humans. It is imperative to pinpoint the exact animal sources and potential reservoirs, understand the transmission route, determine the incubation period, assess the characteristics of vulnerable populations, and ascertain survival rates. The swift identification and containment of this new coronavirus strain represent a significant undertaking by China's public health authorities, underscoring the increasing global capability to promptly detect, identify, characterize, and control emerging outbreaks.
One way to assess the psychological impact of the current epidemic is by examining past experiences with coronavirus infections. For instance, during the Korean MERS-CoV outbreak in 2015, patient groups undergoing hemodialysis treatment in isolation exhibited decreased hematocrit, calcium, and phosphorus levels after two weeks. A study on these patients revealed a significant delay in the normalization of circulating cell-free genomic DNA (ccf-gDNA) and circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) levels, which are indicators of stress, compared to the control group. This suggests that medical isolation during the Korean MERS outbreak induced extreme stress in hemodialyzed patients. It is crucial to consider this in light of the extensive lockdown measures being implemented by the Chinese government, resulting in near isolation conditions for a significant portion of the population. Such measures, akin to those seen post-disasters like terrorist attacks, have historically led to increased occurrences of various mental health issues. For instance, following the city-wide lockdown after the Boston Marathon bombings, there was a 3.4-fold rise in functional neurological symptom disorder incidence. Healthcare providers should be vigilant about such disorders post-stressful community events, especially in individuals with prior psychiatric diagnoses.
To mitigate mental health issues post-isolation, it is imperative to offer mental health assistance to individuals with pre-existing vulnerabilities, furnish accurate information, and supply essential resources such as food, clothing, and shelter (15).
When considering the well-being of medical staff, it is imperative to prioritize their mental health. For instance, during the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak in Singapore, 27% of healthcare workers reported psychiatric symptoms. Similarly, medical staff involved in MERS-related tasks during the 2015 Korean outbreak exhibited the highest risk for post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, a risk that persisted even after home quarantine. A mental health team that intervened during the Korean outbreak recommended early and continuous psychiatric intervention, emphasizing its necessity during high mortality infectious disease outbreaks. Furthermore, medical staff involved in the Ebola outbreaks in Sierra Leone in 2014 and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018 reported heightened levels of anxiety and experienced stigma, particularly among those in direct contact with infected patients.
During the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak in Taiwan, a significant portion of the emergency department and psychiatric ward staff experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with the emergency department staff exhibiting more severe symptoms compared to those in the psychiatric ward (16). The primary distinctions between these groups were feelings of interpersonal isolation and the fear of transmitting the virus to their loved ones. A critical challenge identified was the inadequate communication channels within the medical team, exacerbated by the cumbersome protective gear such as heavy suits and N95 masks, hindering effective interaction among staff (16). Notably, health personnel who had access to well-equipped and structured environments demonstrated better psychological adaptation during the crisis. In the context of the 2015 Korean MERS-CoV outbreak, stigma and hardiness were identified as direct influencers on the mental health of healthcare workers in public hospitals (19).
In the battle against COVID-19, medical workers in Wuhan have been under immense pressure, facing a heightened risk of infection, inadequate protection against contamination, excessive workloads, frustration, discrimination, isolation, dealing with patients exhibiting negative emotions, lack of contact with their families, and extreme exhaustion (20). This dire situation has led to mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger, and fear (21). These psychological challenges not only impact the attention, comprehension, and decision-making abilities of medical personnel, potentially impeding the fight against COVID-19, but they could also have long-term repercussions on their overall well-being (20).
In the general population, there has been a documented increase in mental health issues following other disasters or episodes of civil unrest. The prevalence of PTSD in the general population has been reported to range from 4% to 41%, with a 7% increase in the prevalence of major depression after such events. Several factors have been identified that elevate the risk of developing these conditions in the aftermath of such situations, including being female, having a lower socioeconomic status, experiencing interpersonal conflicts, engaging in frequent social media use, and possessing lower levels of resilience and social support (22).
During crisis events, individuals often seek event-related information to remain informed about ongoing developments. However, in instances where official channels fail to provide consistent or timely updates, individuals may become susceptible to rumors that emerge to fill the information gap. A study conducted during a university lockdown following a shooter incident in the United States revealed that individuals exposed to conflicting information about the lockdown reported higher levels of acute stress. Those who maintained direct communication with close contacts through phone text messages and relied on social media for crucial updates were more likely to encounter conflicting information. Furthermore, individuals who heavily used social media and trusted it for critical updates reported increased acute stress levels. This study underscores the significance of issuing substantive updates regularly during crisis events and monitoring social media platforms to counteract the spread of rumors and alleviate distress. The fear of the unknown can heighten anxiety levels in both healthy individuals and those with pre-existing mental health conditions, leading to manifestations of discrimination, stigmatization, and scapegoating of specific populations, authorities, and scientists. While research on mental health in COVID-19 patients remains limited, several authors suggest that it is feasible to anticipate the potential mental and physical health repercussions on the most vulnerable segments of the population.
Regarding potential responses to such situations, psychological therapies have demonstrated significant efficacy in alleviating symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety in adults experiencing crises. However, further research is warranted, especially concerning the effectiveness of these interventions on children and adolescents over extended follow-up periods. Additional studies are essential to comprehensively understand the impact of psychological therapies across different age groups and to inform more targeted and effective interventions for individuals in crisis (25).
People's emotional responses are prone to encompass extreme fear and uncertainty, leading to negative social behaviors fueled by fear and distorted risk perceptions. This experience can manifest in a spectrum of public mental health concerns, including heightened anxiety reactions such as insomnia, anger, and fear even among those not directly exposed to the threat. Additionally, individuals may exhibit health risk behaviors like increased alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as social isolation. Mental health disorders such as PTSD, anxiety disorders, depression, and somatization can also arise, contributing to a diminished sense of well-being. Therefore, it is imperative for mental health professionals to offer support to both those directly affected and those in caregiving roles.
Secondly, particular attention should be focused on vulnerable populations, encompassing: 1) Infected and ill patients, along with their families and associates, 2) Individuals and their interactions within the community, 3) Individuals with preexisting medical conditions, whether physical or mental, 4) Healthcare providers, particularly nurses and doctors directly involved with sick or quarantined individuals. Ultimately, the level of psychological strain that healthcare professionals and others may encounter, as well as the rights of vulnerable groups, should be guiding principles in decision-making during these critical periods.
The prevailing model that heavily emphasizes disease transmission overlooks the profound impact of trauma and the ensuing psychosocial repercussions on both individuals and the broader population during outbreaks. Neglecting the mental health implications of such disasters can lead to enduring health issues and stigmatization. It is imperative to adopt an integrated approach that recognizes and addresses the trauma inherent in these circumstances. Common measures implemented by health organizations during outbreaks, such as isolation, quarantine, and the utilization of biohazard suits by healthcare workers, can serve as significant psychosocial stressors.
Amid the emergence of novel virus strains and various health-related crises globally, it is imperative for healthcare providers to implement a thorough and all-encompassing response on the front lines. This response should encompass the mental health repercussions on patients, healthcare workers, and society at large.
