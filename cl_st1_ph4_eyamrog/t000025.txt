Terapia Tópica para el manejo del dolor en heridas neoplásicas malignas: revisión de alcance 
 
Resumen 
Objetivos: Mapear y sintetizar la literatura existente sobre las terapias tópicas para el manejo del 
dolor en heridas neoplásicas malignas y los vacíos en investigación. 
Introducción: La mayoría de los pacientes con heridas neoplásicas malignas sienten dolor 
relacionado con la herida, que afecta su calidad de vida. Desafortunadamente, apesar de que el 
dolor es un síntoma relevante tanto en el cuidado de personas con cancer como en cuidados 
paliativos, poco se sabe actualmente sobre la disponibilidad de tratamientos tópicos y su impacto 
en el manejo del dolor. 
Diseño: Revisión de escopo según la metodología de la JBI®. 
Métodos: fueron realizada búsquedas en las bases de datos CINAHL, LILACS, Embase, Web of 
Science, PubMed, Cochrane, NICE, Scopus, JBISRIR, y literatura gris; en inglés, español y 
portugués, sin límite de tiempo. Dos autores revisaron todas las citaciones independientemente. 
Estudios en adultos con heridas neoplásicas malignas que reportaran intervenciones tópicas para 
el dolor fueron incluidos. Adicionalmente, un instrumento para extracción de datos fue 
desarrollado para la síntesis y análisis del tema. Este estudio siguió la lista de chequeo para el 
reporte de revisiones de alcance PRISMA-ScR de la red Equator. 
Resultados: 70 Publicaciones fueron seleccionadas de 796 identificadas en las bases de datos. Los 
estudios incluyeron principalmente revisiones no sistemáticas y estudios de caso; solo seis fueron 
ensayos clínicos. Según la síntesis narrativa realizada, fueron identificadas veinte terapias, que 
incluyeron el uso de apósitos (58.6%), drogas analgésicas (55.7%), antimicrobianos tópicos 
(25.7%), protectores de piel (15.7%), crioterapia (5.7%), y terapia por presión negativa (4.3%). 
Las diversas terapias tópicas fueron recomendadas para el el lecho de la herida y el área 
perilesional. En el 68.5% de los estudios, no fue descrita la aplicación de instrumentos para la 
valoración del dolor. 
Conclusiones: fueron identificadas terapias tópicas aplicadas al lecho de las heridas neoplásicas 
malignas o al área perilesionar, para el manejo del dolor. Sin embargo, la efectividad de las 
intervenciones fue analizada por pocos estudios clínicos, indicando la necesidad por más estudios 
primarios que informen la prácica clínica basada en la evidencia.

Terapia tópica para controle da dor em feridas neoplásicas malignas: revisão de escopo 
 
Resumo 
Objetivos: Mapear e sintetizar a literatura existente sobre terapias tópicas para o manejo da dor 
em feridas neoplásicas malignas e as lacunas de pesquisa. 
Introdução: A maioria dos pacientes com feridas neoplásicas malignas sente dor relacionada à 
ferida, o que afeta sua qualidade de vida. Infelizmente, apesar da dor ser um sintoma relevante 
tanto no tratamento oncológico quanto nos cuidados paliativos, pouco se sabe atualmente sobre a 
disponibilidade de tratamentos tópicos e seu impacto no controle da dor. 
Desenho: Revisão do escopo de acordo com a metodologia JBI®. 
Métodos: CINAHL, LILACS, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane, NICE, Scopus, 
JBISRIR e bases de dados de literatura cinzenta foram pesquisados; em inglês, espanhol e 
português, sem limite de tempo. Dois autores revisaram todas as citações de forma independente. 
Estudos em adultos com feridas neoplásicas malignas relatando intervenções tópicas para dor 
foram incluídos. Adicionalmente, foi desenvolvido um instrumento de extração de dados para a 
síntese e análise do tema. Este estudo seguiu a lista de verificação do relatório de revisão de escopo 
PRISMA-ScR da rede Equator. 
Resultados: Foram selecionadas 70 publicações dentre 796 identificadas nas bases de dados. Os 
estudos incluíram principalmente revisões não sistemáticas e estudos de caso; apenas seis eram 
ensaios clínicos. De acordo com a síntese narrativa realizada, foram identificadas vinte terapias, 
que incluíram o uso de curativos (58,6%), analgésicos (55,7%), antimicrobianos tópicos (25,7%), 
protetores cutâneos (15,7%), crioterapia (5,7%). , e terapia com pressão negativa (4,3%). Várias 
terapias tópicas foram recomendadas para o leito da ferida e a área periferida. Em 68,5% dos 
estudos não foi descrita a aplicação de instrumentos para avaliação da dor. 
Conclusões: foram identificadas terapias tópicas aplicadas no leito de feridas neoplásicas malignas 
ou na área perilesional, para controle da dor. No entanto, a eficácia das intervenções foi analisada 
por poucos estudos clínicos, indicando a necessidade de mais estudos primários que informem a 
prática clínica baseada em evidências. 
Implicações para a prática: o uso de opioides, anestésicos e antimicrobianos se destaca pela 
aplicação clínica, com resultados positivos em ensaios clínicos randomizados. Este estudo não 
incluiu pacientes.

Aims and objectives: To map and synthesize the existing literature on topical therapies for 
Malignant Fungating Wounds  pain management and the gaps involved. 
Background: Most cancer patients with Malignant Fungating Wounds suffer from wound-related 
pain, affecting their quality of life. Unfortunately, even though pain is a relevant symptom in 
cancer and palliative care, little is currently known about topical treatments' availability and impact 
on pain management. 
Design: A scoping review following JBI® methodology 
Methods: Searches were performed in CINAHL, LILACS, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, 
Cochrane, NICE, Scopus, JBISRIR, and gray literature, in English, Portuguese and Spanish, with 
no time limit. Two authors independently reviewed all citations and a third was called in case of 
divergence, and studies in adults with Malignant Fungal Wounds reporting topical pain 
interventions were included. In addition, a data extraction tool for synthesis and thematic analysis 
was developed. This study followed the PRISMA-ScR Checklist. 
Results: 70 publications were selected from 796 records retrieved from databases. The studies 
mainly included non-systematic reviews and case studies with only six clinical trials. According 
to the narrative synthesis, twenty therapies were identified, including the use of wound dressings 
(58.6%), analgesic drugs (55.7%), topical antimicrobials (25.7%), skin barriers (15.7%), 
cryotherapy (5.7%), and Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (4.3%). Therapies were recommended 
to be applied to the wound bed or the periwound skin. In 68.5% of the studies, a standardized 
assessment for pain was not described.  
Conclusions: Topical therapies applied to Malignant Fungating Wounds or periwound areas had 
been examined for pain management. However, their effectiveness was analyzed in a few 
interventional studies, indicating the need for further primary studies to inform evidence-based 
practice.  
Implication for Practice: Highlighted topical therapies for clinical practice consideration are 
opioids, anesthetics, and antimicrobials, with positive results described in randomized clinical 
trials.  
This study did not include patients.

What does this paper contribute to the broader global clinical community? 
 
● Patients with Malignant Fungating Wounds experience physical, mental, social, and 
spiritual pain, as conceptualized by Cecily Saunders in "total pain". Pain may be related to 
tumor infiltration and be of a nociceptive, neuropathic origin, caused by moisture-
associated periwound skin damage or wound dressing manipulation. 
● Systemic treatments for pain management in patients with cancer ineffectively manage 
malignant fungating wound-related pain due to its etiopathogenic characteristics and poor 
superficial tissue perfusion. In addition, there is no clarity about available topical options 
for pain control in these wounds. 
● This scoping review found 20 potential topical therapies for Malignant Fungating Wound-
associated pain, documented mainly in non-systematic reviews, case reports, and a few 
interventional studies. Eleven studies recommended the use of topical therapies applied to 
the peri-wound skin that act by promoting a protective barrier.

● Topical products were categorized as anti-adherent, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, 
absorbent dressings, analgesic drugs (gel based on anesthetic, opioid, and oil with 
cannabinoids), negative pressure wound therapy or cryotherapy, and careful irrigation and 
removal of dressings. 
● Most of the included studies (69%) did not formally assess pain using the appropriate tools. 
● This study’s comprehensive mapping of the literature on topical MFW pain therapies 
highlights different treatments worldwide, opening the door for urgent primary research 
and evidence-based implementation projects. Furthermore, the results included herein may 
guide future studies and support the revision of local protocols.

Introduction   
According to the Globocan 2020 report, one in five people will develop cancer. The report 
estimated that 19.3 million people across the globe were living with cancer at the time of the 
publication, and 10 million had died from the disease (Sung et al., 2021). Advancements in cancer 
diagnosis and treatments have led to prolonged survival time in recent decades (Sung et al., 2021; 
Tsichlakidou et al., 2019); , putting cancer survivors at risk for chronic complications from the 
progression of the disease and treatments, including the emergence of Malignant Fungating 
Wounds (MFWs) (Hoshi et al., 2019; Tilley et al., 2020). 
MFWs are complex chronic wounds that originate from uncontrolled proliferation of 
infiltrating malignant cells, disrupting skin integrity. Over time, these wounds evolve and 
deteriorate, becoming more extensive and invasive (Hoshi et al., 2019; Tilley et al., 2020; Young, 
2017). Approximately 4% -15% of cancer patients develop this type of injury (Firmino et al., 2020) 
that predominately involve breasts (62 to 66%), head and neck (24%), and the chest due to the 
proximity of the compromised tissue to the skin (EONS, 2015; Firmino et al., 2020; Neves Duarte 
Lisboa, 2016; O'Neill et al., 2022). According to the Haisfield-Wolfe and Baxendale-Cox staging 
system, people with MFWs in their advanced stages are beleaguered by debilitating symptoms, 
including odor, exudate, itching, bleeding, and pain (Haisfield-Wolde ME, 1999). These symptoms 
can present significant challenges to patients, caregivers, and health professionals (Santos & Fuly, 
2015; Tilley et al., 2020).  
Pain is the most common concern of all symptoms related to people living with MFWs. 
However, pain is a subjective experience that is difficult to assess objectively; evaluation relies on 
self-reported measures (Raja et al., 2020). Therefore, using validated instruments to evaluate pain

systematically is essential to monitor and benchmark the efficacy of pain treatment over time 
(Caraceni & Shkodra, 2019). 
Mechanism involved in MFW-related pain is complex and multifactorial because of the 
omnipresence of infection due to high local microbial load (Vardhan et al., 2019), irritation of 
exposed nerve endings (trauma at dressing changes), tumor growth (pressure compressing on body 
structures), and edema (impaired lymphatic and capillary drainage). In consequence, patients may 
experience nociceptive, neuropathic, inflammatory, or mixed pain, depending on the trigger 
(EONS, 2015; Naylor, 2001). 
Current literature regarding topical interventions for the management of MFWs is 
inconsistent with the use of different topical substances with varying analgesic effects, such as 
opioids, anti-inflammatory drugs, anesthetics, and non-adherent dressings (EONS, 2015). Topical 
pain treatment may be preferred over systemic use of medication linked to many devastating side 
effects. In addition, the bioavailability of systemic pain medication can be unpredictable for 
controlling MFW-related pain due to altered circulation caused by malignant infiltration (LeBon 
et al., 2009). 
A previous systematic review examined the efficacy of topical MFW treatments for local 
infection, odor, and pain. The review included four studies, three randomized controlled trials, and 
a pre and post-test survey on odor and infection management; In the end, the authors recommended 
new intervention studies for the control of MFW-related pain (Finlayson et al., 2017a). 
Aims 
This study aimed to map and synthesize the existing literature on topical therapies for MFW pain 
management and identify the existing gaps.

Methods 
A scoping review was conducted according to the JBI® approach developed to map key 
concepts, clarify definitions, define boundaries of a subject, summarize information, and describe 
research and clinical gaps (Peters et al., 2020). Unlike a systemic review that focuses on treatment 
effectiveness, a scoping review is a rigorous undertaking to conduct a comprehensive search for 
all the available literature about a subject without stringent methodological restriction.  
The title of this review was recorded in the JBI® database (JBI, 2019). The protocol is on 
the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform (da Costa Ferreira et al., 2020) and was published 
in the Journal Wound Care (JWC) (Ferreira et al., 2021). 
This study entailed secondary methodology (review of the literature); therefore, an ethical 
review was not necessary.  
Review question 
What types of topical therapies and/or treatments are available for pain management in patients 
with MFWs? 
Inclusion criteria 
Participants 
This review considered studies of patients who were 18 years of age and above with painful 
MFWs. 
Concept 
The key concept of this review was to map any topical therapy for MFW-related pain 
management. Topical therapy was defined as applying a product to the wound and periwound skin, 
as previously described (Mayba & Gooderham, 2018). 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4518
Malignant Fungating Wounds: pain topical management 
11 
 
The secondary concept was to identify and describe how topical therapies are used for 
MFW-related pain management and the instruments used to assess pain. 
Context 
This study considered all types of care settings for patients with MFWs, such as 
hospitalization, outpatient and/or home care, long-term care, and palliative care support 
institutions. 
Types of sources 
For this review, we considered all qualitative, quantitative, and review studies describing 
the use of topical therapies to manage MFW-related pain in adult patients. 
Any study with a qualitative theoretical and methodological framework was considered for 
qualitative studies. Any experimental (controlled trials with or without randomization, quasi-
experimental, before and after) and observational studies (descriptive, cohort, cross-sectional, 
case, and case series) were considered for quantitative studies. Systematic, non-systematic, meta-
analyzes, meta-synthesis, and clinical practice guidelines were considered. In addition, 
unpublished studies (gray literature) in English, Portuguese, and Spanish without time limits were 
also considered. 
Search strategy 
Searches were performed in three steps: 1. An initial search was done on the MEDLINE 
and CINAHL databases using the terms "Wounds and Injuries; Neoplasms; Pain Management; 
Administration, Topical" to identify new keywords. 2. A new search was applied using all 
keywords and descriptors identified in the included databases. 3. Additionally, with the support of 
a librarian, a search equation was built for each database. The search strategy for CINAHL 
(EBSCO) is detailed in Table 1. No time limit was applied in the search equations conducted from 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4518

2019 to 2020 which was then updated in March 2022. Finally, an active search in the reference 
lists of selected studies was performed to identify additional studies of interest.

After conducting the searches, all identified records were grouped and registered on 
MendeleyⓇ (Mendeley Ltd., Elsevier, The Netherlands) for management and duplicate removal. 
Two independent reviewers reviewed titles and abstracts based on the inclusion criteria for 
evaluation. Potentially relevant documents were retrieved in full text. Two independent reviewers 
evaluated the full text of the selected citations in detail, based on the inclusion criteria. A third 
reviewer decided on disagreements between reviewers at any stage of the selection process. 
Data extraction 
Two independent reviewers extracted the data using a data extraction tool developed by 
the authors and previously tested on three articles to assess their adequacy. After the test, we added 
the variables: "trade name of the therapy," "formulation," and "application form" (Table 2).

current knowledge, and guide future primary studies that can respond to the challenges of topical 
MFW-related pain management.  
According to the objectives and the review question, the narrative synthesis is presented in 
suitable key conceptual categories and specific subgroups created after the data extraction process. 
The synthesis followed the guidelines of the EQUATOR checklist called the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
(Supplementary File 1) (Tricco et al., 2018). Results were categorized and refined to describe the 
characteristics of the interventions using figures and tables.

The selected studies presented the following characteristics: 54 (88.6%) were published in 
English, four (5.7%) in Portuguese, and four (5.7%) in Spanish. England was the country with the 
largest number of publications (18 / 24.3%), followed by the USA (16 / 22.9%). Twenty-two 
studies (31.4%) were published in the last seven years (2015-2022). Nurses were the professional

category that most published on the topic (54 / 77.1%), followed by physicians (15 / 24.1%) and 
pharmacists (1 / 1.4%). 
Regarding the types of studies, 32 (45.7%) were non-systematic literature reviews, 20 
(28.5%) case studies, and 18 (25.8%) the other methodologies (control trials, systematic reviews, 
cohorts, guidelines, and surveys) as detailed in the Table 4. Only seven MFW studies (10%) 
included pain management as a primary outcome. Study sample sizes ranged from 1 to 60 patients.

Finally, 20 proposals were identified for the topical management of MFW-related pain. 
These are presented according to two general categories: Topical therapies applied in the wound 
and Topical therapies applied to periwound skin. Figure 2 shows the distribution of topical 
therapies in the 70 studies. Figure 3 summarizes the identified topical therapies grouped by MFW-
derived sources of pain and the main research gaps.

Topical Therapies Applied in the wound 
         The topical therapies identified in this review included Analgesic Drugs, Antimicrobial 
Substances, Dressings, Negative Pressure Wound Therapy, and Cryotherapy. In addition, some 
studies presented more than one therapy, proposing an integrated approach for MFW-related pain 
management.  
Dressings 
This category included: Non-adherent dressings, Hydrogel, Absorbent dressings, and Anti-
inflammatory dressings.

Non-adherent Dressing  
Twenty-six (37.1%) articles proposed non-adherent dressings for MFW-related pain 
management. The studies were non-systematic reviews (65.3%), case studies (19.8%), randomized 
clinical trials (3.8%), a guideline (3.8%), prospective cohorts (3.8%), and a Survey (3.8%). 
Twenty-five studies (35.7%) did not include pain management as a primary objective. All studies 
used dressings with other therapies such as opioids, anesthetics, and antiseptics. None of the 
studies mentioned a standardized way of using them or described the pain-related specific results 
from non-adherent dressings alone.  
Hydrogel 
Eleven out of the 70 studies (15.7%) recommended using hydrogels to manage MFW-
related pain. The studies included non-systematic reviews (54.5%), case studies (36.3%), and 
systematic reviews (9.2%). Eight (72.7%) studies discussed hydrogel perfunctorily as an optional 
dressing for these patients to reduce pain by maintaining a moist wound environment. Discussions 
were brief without substantiation. The hydrogel was also mentioned as a vehicle to deliver other 
active substances such as opioids, anesthetics, and antibiotics in the included studies. None of the 
studies presented a standardized way of using this type of dressing, and no results were presented.  
Absorbent Dressing 
Ten (14.2%) studies used absorbent dressings to manage MFW-related pain. The studies 
included non-systematic reviews (50%), case studies (20%), a guideline (10%), randomized 
clinical trials (10%), and a survey (10%). None (90%) of the studies aimed to test the absorbent 
dressing to control MFW-related pain. Some studies only cite them as a dressing option for patients

with pain related to high exudate absorption, minimizing the possible dermatitis related-pain 
derived from periwound moisture. In all studies, these dressings are associated with other therapies 
such as opioids, anesthetics, and antiseptics. No study mentions a standardized way of using the 
dressings or of displaying their results on pain management without being combined with other 
products. 
Anti-inflammatory Dressing 
Anti-inflammatory dressings include absorbent polyurethane foam containing 0.5 mg/cm2 
of Ibuprofen homogeneously distributed throughout the foam matrix and a cream with essential 
oils. 
● Foam with Ibuprofen 
Eight (10%) out of 70 studies suggested using foam with Ibuprofen dressing as a therapy 
for MFW pain management. The studies were of the non-systematic reviews (87.5%) and 
survey (12.5%) types. None of the studies focused on evaluating the foam with Ibuprofen for 
MFW-related pain management, but only cited it as a dressing option for these patients. In 
addition, no study mentioned how to use the dressing or the results of its use. 
● Cream with essential oils 
Only one case study (1.4%) published in 2014 (Stringer et al., 2014) evaluated the use of a 
cream with essential oils in 12 patients (mostly women with breast cancer with ages between 40 
and 81 years) for MFW symptoms. The cream contained 3% essential oils (without specifying 
ingredients). Without standardizing the dressings and reporting the cream's form and several

applications on the wounds, the authors mentioned that six patients reported pain improvement 
(reducing the maximum score to zero on a Likert scale). 
Analgesic Drugs 
Topical opioids, topical anesthetics, and Medicinal Cannabis were categorized within 
analgesic drugs.  
Topical Opioids 
Thirty-one (44.2%) studies examined opioids applied topically to the wound bed to control 
MFW-related pain. The studies included non-systematic reviews (67.7%), case studies (16.1%), 
randomized clinical trials (.06%) (including a letter to the editor in which data from an unfinished 
trial was reported), guidelines (.03%), prospective cohorts (.03%) and systematic reviews (.03%). 
Of these 31 studies, just under a half mentioned specific opioids to treat MFW-related pain, 
specifically suggesting Morphine. Meanwhile, two of them also mentioned Oxycodone without 
describing its preparation or ways of applying these drugs, as shown in Table 5.

Topical Anesthetics 
Regarding analgesic drugs, 20 (28.5%) studies proposed using topical anesthetics to 
manage MFW-related pain. The studies were non-systematic reviews (75%), case studies (5%), 
randomized clinical trials (5%), guidelines (5%), prospective cohorts (5%), and surveys (5%). 
Nine studies (45%) presented dosages and application guidelines for various topical anesthetics 
that are grouped and detailed in Table 6. Additionally, 11 (55%) mention using lidocaine, 
prilocaine, benzocaine, and a tricyclic anesthetic, without describing the formulation or mode of 
use.

Medicinal Cannabis 
Only one case study (1.4%) (Maida, 2017) proposed using medicinal cannabis as topical 
and vaporized oil as part of the MFW pain management armamentarium. The case focused on a 
44-year-old male patient diagnosed with squamous cell cancer in the oral cavity, resulting in a 
MFW on the right hemiface. The patient rated the pain between 9 and 10/10 at baseline, and 
treatment included intravenous analgesia. After receiving the vaporized medicinal cannabis every 
2 to 4 hours, and before changing the dressing or digitally applying and spreading 1-2 ml of the 
oil throughout the wound, externally and intra-orally, the patient reported significant pain relief, 
with his pain score was reduced to 3 and 4, this improvement allowed for a modification of the 
analgesic regimen. This is the first case report demonstrating the potential of topical medicinal 
cannabis for effective MFW pain management. 
 
Antimicrobial substances 
This scoping review categorized antimicrobial substances as topical antimicrobials, honey, 
and antiseptics. We consider any implications of antimicrobial substances if they present the ability

to kill or inhibit the growth and development of a microorganism (bacteria, fungi, and viruses), 
including antibiotics, antiseptics, and disinfectants. 
 
Topical antimicrobials 
Ten (14.2%) studies proposed using topical antimicrobials such as Metronidazole, 
Nanocrystalline Silver, and Silver Sulfadiazine to manage MFW-related pain. These studies were 
case studies (40%), randomized clinical trials (20%), non-systematic reviews (10%), retrospective 
cohorts (10%), systematic reviews (10%), and surveys (10%). Six (60%) reported using 
antimicrobials, although pain was not their main focus, but did not present the form of use or the 
outcomes. 
One randomized clinical trial (Lund-Nielsen et al., 2011) included in a systematic review 
(Adderley & Holt, 2014) reported positive results when using antimicrobials to control MFW odor, 
exudate, and pain. Three studies tested antimicrobials to manage MFW symptoms, including pain. 
Two were randomized clinical trials, and one was a retrospective cohort that included 192 patients 
with MFWs, mainly women aged between 47 and 90 years and primarily with breast cancer. Of 
these clinical trials, two used a verbal numeric scale and a visual analog scale, demonstrating 
improvement in pain; the third found no statistically significant effect on the pain outcome (Table 
7).

Honey 
Five (7%) articles reported topical honey as a therapy for MFW-related pain management. 
None of the studies focused on pain management but on the general control of MFW symptoms, 
including pain. Two reviews (systematic and non-systematic) (Adderley & Holt, 2014; Praptiwi, 
2017) included two primary studies in which authors obtained positive effects of using honey to 
control MFW odor, exudate, and pain. These studies analyzed 384 patients, mainly women, with 
an average age of 44 to 90 years, primarily with breast tumors. A visual analog scale was used just 
in one of the studies (Lund-Nielsen et al., 2011). (Table 8).

Topical antiseptics 
Only three (4%) studies proposed topical antiseptics such as Polyhexamethylene 
Biguanide, Octenidine, and other non-specified degerming agents for MFW pain management. 
The studies included randomized clinical trials (66.6%) and non-systematic reviews (33.4%). 
None of the studies had pain control as the primary aim but the control of general symptoms,

including pain. The three studies analyzed 54 patients, predominantly women, between 24 and 92 
years old, with primary tumors, mainly of the breast. Pain was assessed using verbal classification 
and visual analog scales in two of the studies. The use of topical antiseptics resulted in pain 
improvement in two studies and no changes in pain intensity scores in one study (Table 9).

Negative Pressure Wound Therapy  
Three (4%) studies elucidated the use of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to 
manage MFW-related pain. The studies were case studies (66.6%) and non-systematic reviews 
(33.4%). None of the studies focused primarily on pain management but on the general direction 
of MFW-associated symptoms; however, one of the studies did not mention the main objective. 
These studies analyzed data from six patients, women aged 56 to 62, with different primary tumors 
(sarcomas, breast cancer, melanoma, and sigmoid cancer). There was no quantitative or qualitative 
assessment of pain in any of the studies. Nevertheless, the studies reported an improvement in 
odor, exudate, and pain, thus impacting patients' quality of life (Table 10).

Cryotherapy 
In four studies (5%), topical cryotherapy was applied to control MFW-related pain without 
this being the primary focus, but rather the management of symptoms which included pain. The 
studies were non-systematic reviews (50%), surveys (25%), and guidelines (25%). The studies did 
not show the forms of use or results.  
Topical therapies applied to periwound skin 
Eleven (15.7%) studies discussed therapies for pain management in the periwound skin 
area. The studies were non-systematic reviews (63.7%), case studies (18.1%), guidelines (9.1%),

and surveys (9.1%). The proposed therapies were zinc oxide (ointment and cream), silicone, 
dimethicone, petrolatum, acrylate and cyanoacrylate, hydrocolloid (paste and powder), and 
vitamin-rich ointment (A and D), all of which are part of pain-control protocols. All studies were 
coordinated by nurses and published in journals on wounds, palliative care, oncology, and general 
nursing. Two studies reported assessing pain, and one mentioned a Visual Analog Scale as the 
instrument used to measure pain. Positive results are reported, however, not further described

Technique 
        The dressing application and removal technique for MFW-related pain management was not 
categorized as a topical therapy. However, several studies alluded to various dressing application 
techniques and conditions and their effect on pain. Twenty-one (30%) studies proposed procedures 
related to the dressing technique to minimize pain. The studies were non-systematic reviews 
(66%), guidelines (14%), randomized clinical trials (10%), a case study (5%), and a survey (5%). 
In general, the authors proposed cleaning the wound with an appropriately warm solution, applying 
and removing dressings carefully, refraining from debridement due to the risk of bleeding,

maintaining a moist environment in the wound bed, cleaning with soap with an appropriate pH, 
reducing the frequency of dressing changes, and providing analgesia before applying the dressing. 
Discussion  
This scoping review aimed to map and examine the literature available on topical MFW-
related pain management, considering its relevance for oncology and palliative care clinicians. The 
synthesis of this body of literature may provide insights into treatments which could enhance 
quality-of-life, especially for patients with terminal cancer (Schmidt et al., 2020). This study is the 
first scoping review developed in its field to contribute to researchers seeking to advance research 
trends and elucidate the gaps in this field.  
Cancer patients experience multiple symptoms, including pain that involves 
neurophysiological and affective components (Wood, 2021). Pain can be exacerbated, amplified, 
and contribute to loss of body functions, grief, a sense of doom, and other feelings, including 
anxiety, fear, and uncertainty within this population (Brant, 2017). 
We reviewed 70 studies that explored 20 topical therapies such as dressings with different 
mechanisms of action, analgesic drugs, and antimicrobial substances, among others, with 
promising results to mitigate pain. However, only 31.4% of the studies applied standardized pain 
assessment tools: Visual Analogue Scale, Numerical Verbal Scale, McGill's Questionnaire, and 
the assessment by categories (no pain, weak, moderate, and severe). In addition, in a survey 
evaluating attitudes and knowledge about pain assessment and treatment among health care 
providers, demonstrated that nurses possessed a lower level of knowledge about pain assessment 
and management (Nuseir et al., 2016). 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4518
Malignant Fungating Wounds: pain topical management 
41 
 
In this review, the 20 topical treatments identified were grouped into five categories: 
dressings, analgesic drugs, antimicrobial substances, negative pressure therapy, and cryotherapy, 
with various products. 
Studies on the use of dressings predominated as a proposal for topical therapy for MFW-
related pain management. The treatment of pain that arises from changing dressings due to the 
adhesion of the product to the wound bed and the subsequent difficulty of removing it was 
highlighted. This demonstrates the benefits of protecting friable tissue in the wound bed in a 
malignant fungating wound. (Woo et al., 2015; Woo & Sibbald, 2010). 
Non-adherent dressings, such as polyurethane foam, silicone foams, silicone hydrocellular 
foam, fibers, and hydrofibers, were recommended for promoting painless removal. However, there 
is still a need to clarify the best non-adherent therapy applied to MFWs due to changes in 
circulation and the presence of non-viable tissue. Absorbent dressings were also mentioned for 
MFW-related pain management, including the Pain of periwound dermatitis caused by excessive 
MFW exudation and the irritating components present in the exudate (Gozzo et al., 2014; Tamai 
et al., 2016a).  
The use of a non-adherent and absorbent polyurethane foam covered with Ibuprofen was 
mentioned in 11% of the studies with positive results regarding MFW pain control. This was not 
surprising since this drug introduces anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties into the wound 
bed. However, new studies with the primary objective of evaluating this therapy to control MFW-
related pain with an adequate description of the methodology would allow for a safer indication, 
considering its additional properties of nonadherence and absorbency (Gottrup et al., 2008).

Topical opioids were another option. Opioid receptors are present in the peripheral nervous 
system, synthesized in the dorsal root ganglia, transported axonally to the peripheral terminals, 
and detectable after peripheral injuries and inflammation. An inflammatory process developed in 
the MFW beds could explain pain improvement using opioids (Vardhan et al., 2019). Future 
studies should consider more potent opioids such as fentanyl (Wang et al., 2017). 
Medical cannabis was also explored as a potential analgesic drug in a case study that 
reported a reduction in MFW-related pain. Cannabinoids are substances derived from the Cannabis 
sativa plant. The expression and identification of cannabinoid receptors in peripheral neurons has 
contributed to studies exploring topical formulations based on cannabinoids. In animals, alone or 
in association with other analgesics, the analgesic effect of cannabinoids has been demonstrated 
and has even attributed to an increased in the antinociceptive effects of Morphine (Maida et al., 
2021; Nielsen et al., 2017). 
Antimicrobial substances, including honey, Octenidine, polyhexanide, and metronidazole, 
showed promising results in MFW-related pain management through decreasing local microbial 
load which is responsible for triggering pain as a classic indicator of infection (Swanson & Angel, 
2022). In addition, the progressive nature of cancer makes MFWs sensitive to microbial growth, 
mainly with anaerobic microorganisms causing wound odor, exudate, and pain. Thus, the control 
of the microbial burden of MFWs through topical antimicrobial substances can explain the 
reduction of exudate, odor, and pain (Vardhan et al., 2019 ; Villela-Castro et al. 2018; Finlayson 
et al., 2017b;). 
Case studies included in this review used NPWT to manage symptoms of MFWs and 
reported favorable results, increasing patients' quality of life. Although NPWT is contraindicated

for MFWs, this therapy should be adequately studied in palliative care (Riot et al., 2015). Negative 
pressure creates a closed environment for the wound, thereby controlling moisture, removing 
excess exudate, reducing microbial load, promoting perfusion, stimulating mitosis, and granulation 
tissue formation. These latter actions are contraindicated for in patients with MFWs, because 
mitosis is not desired and granulation is not the primary objective for wound management (Cai et 
al., 2017). Furthermore, malignant cells can induce the formation of new blood vessels, which are 
friable, requiring careful evaluation and caution when using NPWT on MFWs due to the risk of 
bleeding (Firmino et al., 2021). 
Cryotherapy promotes cold-induced vasoconstriction and causes muscle spasms that slow 
down nerve conduction, reducing pain (Farah et al., 2021). However, no primary studies have been 
found evaluating the effectiveness of cryotherapy in the past five years. Therefore, it is not 
included in the guideline for patients with MFWs published by the European Oncology Nursing 
Society (EONS, 2015). The lack of primary studies in cryotherapy may be the result of the 
development of new therapies and coverage for pain in MFW which demonstrate greater 
effectiveness and ease of application. 
Wound-related pain is not limited to the wound bed area and may involve periwound skin. 
MFWs can evolve with high exudation, irritating to the periwound skin, and are characterized by 
inflammation with or without erosion, itching, pain, and potential skin damage secondary to 
infection (Tamai et al., 2016b). Due to constant moisture, periwound protection is recommended 
using a suitable barrier product that can repel excess moisture, protecting the skin from consequent 
damage (LeBlanc et al., 2021). However, there are few studies on using these products in patients 
with MFWs.

Malignant Fungating Wounds: pain topical management

Patients often experience pain during dressing changes. Careful application and removal, 
irrigation techniques, and the proper decision on the frequency of dressing changes can be easily 
modified to contribute to topical pain management (Woo, 2015). 
Review Limitations  
This review limited the languages for searching articles to Portuguese, English, and 
Spanish. However, search strategies brought up six articles in languages other than those cited, 
and they were not included in this review (supplementary table 3).  
Conclusions  
This scoping review of the available literature about topical therapies for topical MFW-
related pain management included 70 studies with 20 topical therapies categorized as dressings 
(non-adherent dressing, hydrogel, absorbent dressing, and anti-inflammatory dressing); analgesic 
drugs (topical opioids, topical anesthetics, medical cannabis); antimicrobial substances 
(antimicrobials, honey, and antiseptics); cryotherapy; and negative pressure wound therapy. For 
periwound skin interventions: zinc oxide (ointment and cream), silicone (adhesive remover), 
dimethicone, petrolatum, acrylate, cyanoacrylate, hydrocolloid (plate and powder), and a vitamin-
rich ointment (A and D) were identified. Some technical aspects related to MFW pain management 
included irrigating with a warm solution, careful application and the removal of the dressing, no 
debridement, maintaining a moist environment in the wound bed, cleaning with soap with an 
appropriate pH, reducing the frequency of dressing changes, and applying systemic analgesia 
before the dressing. However, there is a lack of studies describing the products' mode of use in 
detail and their effectiveness for evidence-based informed practice.

Pain was not formally assessed in 68.5% of the studies. However, the following specific 
pain assessment instruments were mentioned in 22 studies: Visual Analogue Scale, Numerical 
Verbal Scale, McGill Questionnaire, and assessment by category (no pain, weak, moderate, and 
severe).  
Relevance to Clinical Practice 
This scoping review contributed with a systematized summary of the available topical 
treatments for MFW-related pain management. Topical therapies were identified for 
considerations in clinical practice, highlighting opioids, anesthetics, and antimicrobials; however, 
few prospective interventional studies described effectiveness. In addition, none explored cost-
effectiveness or cost-benefits, which are relevant aspects for clinical implementation.  
The topical therapies with positive results reported by randomized clinical trials were 
lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5%, morphine gel 0.2% as analgesics, metronidazole 0.8% solution, and 
polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) with betaine 0.1% solution, octenidine solution, honey, 
and silver as antimicrobials. Moreover, the combination of topical therapies on the wound bed, 
periwound skin, and the application of techniques of dressing change aiming at pain prevention 
can potentially improve the painful experience in people with MFWs (Figure 3).  
This review did not critically appraise the methodologies and studies’ qualities due to the 
aims and method of a scoping review; consequently, the comments on the clinical practice should 
be considered carefully.

platforms, and Web sites. 
† A more inclusive/heterogeneous term used to account for the different types of evidence or data sources (e.g., 
quantitative and/or qualitative research, expert opinion, and policy documents) that may be eligible in a scoping review as 
opposed to only studies. This is not to be confused with information sources (see first footnote). 
‡ The frameworks by Arksey and O’Malley (6) and Levac and colleagues (7) and the JBI guidance (4, 5) refer to the 
process of data extraction in a scoping review as data charting. 
§ The process of systematically examining research evidence to assess its validity, results, and relevance before using it to 
inform a decision. This term is used for items 12 and 19 instead of "risk of bias" (which is more applicable to systematic 
reviews of interventions) to include and acknowledge the various sources of evidence that may be used in a scoping review 
(e.g., quantitative and/or qualitative research, expert opinion, and policy document).
