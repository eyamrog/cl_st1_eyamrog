The Cesarean section procedure was initially developed to mitigate maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality; however, its performance without scientific backing has been linked to complications. This study delves into the temporal trends and factors influencing Cesarean section rates in Brazil, examining its prevalence across regions and Federation Units from 2000 to 2017 through an ecological study design. Data on Cesarean sections and maternal variables were sourced from the Information System on Live Births. Time series analysis was conducted using the Prais-Winsten method. Over the study period, Brazil witnessed 53,497,303 births, with 48.4% delivered via Cesarean section. Notably, the average Cesarean section rate in Brazil surged from 39.7% (SD 9.8) in 2000 to 53% (SD 9.4) in 2017, with an annual increase of 1.7 percentage points (95%CI 1.6; 1.8) between 2010 and 2017. Despite this overall rise, stability was observed from 2010 to 2017, with a slight decline noted in the Southeast region starting from 2015, showing an annual decrease of -0.9 percentage points (95%CI -1.5; 0.0). Interestingly, Cesarean section rates have remained steady in most macro-regions, with a decrease observed in the southeast and among women with higher education levels, non-adolescents, and those with better prenatal care coverage. It is postulated that Brazil has reached a plateau in Cesarean section prevalence, hovering around 60% in most states, with a projected decrease in the coming years.
The cesarean section, a surgical intervention designed to mitigate the risks of mortality and clinical complications for both mother and child during pregnancy and labor, can be highly beneficial when supported by scientific evidence. However, when conducted without such evidence, the cesarean section significantly amplifies the risk of severe complications for the mother and fetus by six-fold.
In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the frequency and indiscriminate performance of cesarean sections worldwide, with rates escalating from 6.7% in 1990 to 19.4% in 2014. These rates exhibit significant variation, ranging from 0.6% in South Sudan to a staggering 58% in the Dominican Republic, which is 14 times higher than the average observed in countries within Western and Central Africa.
In 2009, Brazil witnessed a significant shift as cesarean sections outnumbered vaginal deliveries for the first time, reaching 50.1%. By 2017, this trend had escalated further, with a national prevalence of 55.7%. This rate stands at nearly four times the 15% recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), even though adjustments were made for the Brazilian population, setting the reference at 25-30% due to population characteristics. Data from the Brazilian National Agency of Supplementary Health (Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar – ANS) in 2018 revealed that a staggering 83% of deliveries in the private sector were conducted abdominally.
Several maternal risk factors have been linked to the prevalence of cesarean sections. These include higher levels of education, extreme ages, being of white ethnicity, having a partner, increased prenatal care consultations, multiple gestations, and gestation periods of less than 37 weeks.
The public health community has long been concerned about the unprecedented growth of cesarean sections and their associated consequences. The global unease surrounding this uncontrolled increase is well-founded, as various studies have linked cesarean sections to negative effects on the health of both women and children in the short- and long-term. These effects encompass a higher prevalence of maternal death, puerperal infection, premature birth, increased likelihood of allergies, and reduced diversity of the intestinal microbiome in infants. Furthermore, long-term implications include associations with overweight, obesity, and hypertension in newborns from infancy through to adulthood.
Historically, Brazil has implemented national policies concerning maternal and child health. However, with the increased availability of assistance for women, there has been a corresponding rise in cesarean section rates. In an effort to curb this trend, various programs, protocols, and campaigns were established, such as Rede Cegonha, Projeto Parto Adequado, Protocolo Clínico de Diretrizes Terapêuticas para Cesariana, and "Quem espera, espera." Despite the introduction of these public policies, recent studies analyzing national data have shown a continued increase in cesarean section rates. Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the temporal trends and factors associated with cesarean sections between 2000 and 2017 in the Brazilian states and the Federal District.
In this ecological time-series study, all live births in Brazil were encompassed and divided into two distinct time periods: the first spanning from 2000 to 2009, and the second from 2010 to 2017. The prevalence data regarding cesarean sections were sourced from the Information System on Live Births (Sistema de Informações Sobre Nascidos Vivos – SINASC), which is accessible through the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS).
The prevalence of cesarean sections in each geographic unit and year of study was determined by selecting the number of live births from cesarean sections among mothers residing in that unit. This calculation was done using the formula: <>
The maternal independent variables included age categorized as 19 years or less, 20 to 34 years, and 35 years or more; skin color classified as white or others (black, brown, yellow, and Amerindian); years of schooling divided into less than 8 years, 8 to 11 years, and 12 or more years; marital status as with or without a partner; type of pregnancy as single or twin or more; duration of gestation as extremely preterm, moderately preterm, and full term; and number of prenatal care consultations as none to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 or more. Data labeled as "Ignored" or "Blank" were retained to prevent overestimation of the data, thus treated as a distinct category within each variable in the analysis.
The Prais-Winsten method of generalized linear regression was employed for the time-trend analysis, with regression parameters estimated while controlling for first-order autocorrelation using the Cochrane-Orcutt transformation, which accounts for the dependency of a serial measure on its own previous lower values. The annual variation in the prevalence of cesarean section and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI 95%) were calculated following the methodology proposed by Antunes.
The study employed a significance level of 5%. P-values that were not statistically significant (≥ 0.05) were construed as indicative of stability, leading to the acceptance of the null hypothesis. Conversely, p-values that were statistically significant (< 0.05) were categorized as suggestive of growth (positive annual variation) or reduction (negative annual variation). The statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 15.0® software.
A hierarchical model was developed for the adjusted analysis, comprising two entry levels. The first level incorporated maternal socioeconomic variables such as schooling, age, skin color, and marital status, while the second level included assistance-related characteristics like prenatal care consultations, gestational age, and type of gestation. In the regression model employed (backwards), all variables were adjusted to those at the same level and lower, with a p-value ≤ 0.20.
This study adheres to the guidelines outlined in Resolution No. 466 of December 12, 2012, as stipulated by the National Committee of Ethics in Research (Conselho Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa – CONEP). The SINASC database utilized in this research is publicly available, open access, and does not contain any identifiable participant information. Therefore, in compliance with Resolution 466/2012, ethical approval from the Ethics Committee is not deemed necessary for this project.
The national prevalence of cesarean sections over the 18-year study period was 48.4%, with the lowest prevalence observed in the North region at 37.8% and the highest in the Southeast at 54.9%. The profile of Brazilian mothers during this period revealed that the majority had less than 11 years of schooling (82.3%), were aged between 20 and 34 years (69.9%), had non-white skin color (50.7%), lived with a partner (49.2%), delivered full-term infants (89.8%), experienced single pregnancies (97.8%), and attended 7 or more prenatal care consultations (52.7%) (Supplementary Table 1).
The rate of cesarean sections in Brazil exhibited a notable increase over the years, ranging from 37.8% in 2000 to 50.1% in 2009, indicating a consistent upward trend with an annual variation of 1.7 percentage points (CI95% 1.6; 1.8). This rise was observed across all regions of the country, with the Southeast displaying the smallest annual increase at 1.3 percentage points (CI95% 1.2; 1.4). Notably, Roraima stood out among the states with the highest variation, showing a significant increase of 3.4 percentage points (CI95% 0.4; 6.5) during the same period as outlined in Table 2.
From 2000 to 2009, there was a notable reduction in the prevalence of cesarean sections among mothers with less than 8 years of schooling in the Northeast region (β -0.7, CI95% -0.8; -0.7), as well as in the group of mothers aged 19 or younger with non-white skin color (β -3.9, CI95% -5.4; -2.3), living with a partner (β -0.1, CI95% -0.3; -0.0), and attending less than 3 prenatal care consultations in the South region (β -3.1, CI95% -4.4; -1.9). Conversely, there was an increase in the prevalence of cesarean deliveries among mothers with 12 or more years of schooling in the Northeast (β 3.1, CI95% 2.7; 3.4), aged 35 years or older (β 12.4, CI95% 9.2; 15.6), with non-white skin color (β 1.4, CI95% 0.7; 2.1), experiencing moderate preterm birth or multiple pregnancies, those living without a partner (β 0.1, CI95% 0.0; 0.3), and those attending 7 or more consultations (β 1.8, CI95% 1.5; 2.0).
In 2010, surgical deliveries accounted for 52.3% of all births in Brazil. A stability in the prevalence of cesarean sections is observed (β -0.4 CI95% -1.3; 0.5) in the country between 2010 and 2017 (Table 4). Only the Southeast region exhibited a slight reduction in the rate of cesarean deliveries with an annual variation of -0.9 (CI95% -1.5; 0.0). The states primarily responsible for this reduction were Espírito Santo (-1.5 CI95% -2.6; -0.5) and Rio de Janeiro (-1.8 CI95% -2.6; -1.0). Despite the stability in the North and Northeast regions, certain states (such as Acre, Tocantins, Maranhão, and Roraima) continue to show a growing tendency towards cesarean deliveries.
In the North and Center-West regions, mothers with 8 to 11 years of schooling showed positive associations with cesarean section (β 0.3 CI95% 0.0; 0.7 and β 0.7 CI95% 0.4; 1.0, respectively). In the Southeast, mothers with 12 years of schooling or more experienced a reduction of 0.5 p.p. in CD rates (IC95% -1.0; 0.0). Regarding maternal age, there was a 1.0 p.p. increase in CD rates among women aged 19 years or younger in the Southeast region (CI95% 0.2; 1.7). Conversely, in the Northeast, there was a 4.4 p.p. decrease in CD rates among mothers aged 20 to 34 years (CI95% -5.7; -3.2). Mothers with white skin color had a negative association with cesarean sections in the North (β -0.8 CI95% -1.2; -0.4) and Center-West (β -0.5 CI95% -0.7; -0.3) regions, while non-white mothers in the Center-West were positively associated with CD (β 0.8 CI95% 0.3; 1.2). Brazil as a whole and the North region exhibited significant associations with CD, being positive among partnered mothers and negative among those without partners. Extreme preterm birth was positively associated with CD in the North, South, and Brazil overall. Notably, an increase in cesarean section rates was observed only in the Center-West region (β 5.0 CI95% 0.1; 9.9) among women with single gestation. Mothers who attended 3 or fewer prenatal consultations saw a 2.3 p.p. increase in CD rates (CI95% 0.8; 3.9), while those with 7 or more consultations experienced a reduction in CD rates (β -0.6 CI95% -1.0; -0.2) in the Southeast region (Table 5).
The rate of cesarean sections in Brazil increased from 39.7% (SD±9.8) between 2000 and 2009 to 53% (SD±9.4) between 2010 and 2017, as shown in Supplementary Table 6. After adjustments, only mothers aged 20 to 34 years maintained a significant association with cesarean sections during this time period. There was a decrease in cesarean deliveries among extreme preterm, moderate preterm, and full-term births, as well as among mothers who had fewer than 3 prenatal care consultations. A slight decline in the prevalence of cesarean deliveries was noted from 2015 onwards, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Over the 18-year period examined, the prevalence of cesarean sections stood at 48.4%, a rate nearly three times higher than the WHO's recommended level, accounting for a total of 25,804,402 surgical deliveries. The percentage of cesarean deliveries rose from 37.8% in 2000 to 50.1% in 2009, marking a 12.3% increase. A similar trend was noted in the analysis of data from SINASC, encompassing close to 36 million births, with cesarean section rates in Brazil ranging from 37.9% in 2000 to 53.9% in 2011. Throughout the initial decade under scrutiny, cesarean delivery prevalence surged across all regions of Brazil. Research indicates that the decision to opt for a cesarean section often stems from fears of pain, mortality, lacerations, or a sense of incapacity to undergo natural childbirth. Factors influencing this choice include the convenience of scheduling and planning the delivery, medical recommendations, and higher socioeconomic status. Many women perceive vaginal delivery as an anxiety-inducing experience, while cesarean section is viewed as a more efficient and less painful alternative.
When examining the factors associated with Cesarean Delivery (CD), it becomes evident that women perceive and desire this method of delivery as a consumer preference. A demographic comprising mothers with 12 or more years of education, aged 35 or older, of non-white ethnicity, partnered, and attending 7 or more prenatal care sessions, opted for cesarean sections between 2000 and 2009. Similarly, a cohort study involving 4,231 live births in Pelotas revealed that pregnant women aged 35 or older had a 25% higher likelihood of undergoing cesarean sections compared to younger counterparts. Furthermore, women with over 12 years of education exhibited a 59% increased likelihood of choosing CD, while black women experienced an 18% higher rate of CD compared to white women. The elevated rate of cesarean sections among older women can be clinically attributed to a higher prevalence of chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes. However, this older demographic also tends to possess greater economic stability, potentially influencing their preference for abdominal delivery.
This inequality is evident when examining the factors associated with the non-realization of cesarean sections during the same time period. Women with less than 8 years of schooling, aged 19 years or younger, white-skinned, and those who attended 3 or fewer prenatal consultations were linked to a decreased likelihood of undergoing a cesarean section. A time-series study conducted in Niterói, involving 62,449 births, revealed a declining trend of 5.1% among women with less than 8 years of schooling, 2.3% among those aged less than 19 years, 0.7% among white-skinned individuals, and a significant 15.6% decrease for those attending less than 3 prenatal consultations. Upon analyzing the characteristics of these women, it is apparent that they sought healthcare services only at the time of delivery, neglecting the importance of prenatal care. Limited access to health services may have a detrimental impact on the likelihood of undergoing a cesarean section.
Since 2015, there has been a stabilization in the occurrence of cesarean sections across all regions of the country, with a slight trend towards reduction noted in the Southeast region. In the North and Northeast, although the rate of cesarean deliveries has remained stable, certain states are displaying an increasing trend. These observations lend support to the hypothesis that Brazil has reached a plateau in the prevalence of cesarean sections, with rates hovering around 60% in most states, and suggest that a decrease in these rates may be anticipated in the coming years.
An intriguing discovery emerges from the analysis of Brazilian women who underwent cesarean sections between 2010 and 2017, revealing a notable shift in comparison to the initial study period spanning from 2000 to 2009. This transformation could potentially be attributed to the impact of public policies introduced post-2011 and the heightened availability of educational resources outlining the pros and cons of different delivery methods. Within this altered landscape, a specific demographic stands out: women with 12 or more years of education, aged between 20 and 34, of Caucasian descent, without a partner, and who attended 7 or more prenatal appointments experienced a decrease in cesarean deliveries. It is plausible that this group had greater exposure to globalized information facilitated by technological advancements, leading to enhanced knowledge and empowerment in utilizing scientific insights to make informed decisions regarding the most advantageous approach to childbirth.
While CD rates are currently stable or decreasing among women with higher levels of education, non-teenagers, and those with better prenatal care coverage, there is an observed increase in rates among women with 8 to 11 years of schooling, aged 19 or younger, non-white individuals, and those who attended 3 or fewer prenatal care consultations. These trends mirror findings from an ecologic study conducted in Belo Horizonte, which included 36,127 live births and demonstrated a positive correlation between cesarean deliveries and adolescents with lower levels of education who attended fewer than 3 prenatal consultations. Historically, cesarean deliveries were viewed as a luxury item and a symbol of status, leading to their adoption by lower socioeconomic classes.
It is probable that Brazilian women of higher socioeconomic status residing in states with elevated Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI) are increasingly opting for physiological delivery methods, a trend supported by scientific findings. Conversely, women of lower socioeconomic status in economically disadvantaged states continue to favor cesarean deliveries as a commodity. This is evidenced by the fact that in the Southeast region, which boasted the country's highest GDP in 2017, reductions in cesarean section rates were primarily driven by women with advanced education and comprehensive prenatal care. Consequently, it is posited that individuals of lower socioeconomic standing tend to emulate the choices of those with greater intellectual and financial resources. As a result, it is anticipated that cesarean section rates will either stabilize or decline in the coming decade, as economically disadvantaged women view states with superior socioeconomic metrics as exemplars to emulate.
Efforts to enhance awareness regarding VD in the South, Southeast, and Center-West regions, where cesarean section rates were notably high but stable in 2017, should be maintained and reinforced. Conversely, the escalating prevalence of cesarean sections in the North and Northeast regions underscores the necessity for increased interventions to enhance pregnant women's satisfaction, provide training for healthcare professionals, improve health system structures, and ensure the availability of on-call teams for assisting with physiological deliveries. Despite cesarean section rates reaching 46.5% in the North and 50.1% in the Northeast in 2017, swift and effective actions are crucial to prevent rates from approaching the national average of nearly 60%. It is essential to implement measures that consistently reduce cesarean section prevalence, thereby encouraging natural deliveries, fostering ongoing education for healthcare professionals, delivering quality prenatal care with guidance on the benefits of VD, and continuing to develop public policies that yield positive outcomes in maternal-fetal care.
Studies employing an ecologic design are constrained by the necessity for robust and reliable indicators. It is crucial to acknowledge the potential for underreporting when utilizing information systems. Furthermore, a significant limitation lies in the inability to attribute the study's findings to the individual level, known as the ecological fallacy. Despite these constraints, the study holds relevance as it stands as the inaugural research endeavor encompassing an 18-year historical series, incorporating Brazilian states with pertinent data on cesarean section rates and associated factors. Notably, it is the first study to demonstrate a decrease in cesarean deliveries nationwide and in select states since 2015.
