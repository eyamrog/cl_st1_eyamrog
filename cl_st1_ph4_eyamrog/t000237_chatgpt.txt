The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious illness that first surfaced in December 2019 in China and has since rapidly disseminated across the globe. By the end of the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 had affected over 3.1 million individuals and resulted in more than 220,000 fatalities worldwide.
The initial case in Brazil was documented on February 26, 2020, with the first fatality reported on March 17, 2020. Following the identification of the disease in Brazil, there was a steady daily rise in both cases and fatalities. By April 29, 2020, just two months later, Brazil had accumulated 71,866 confirmed cases and 5,017 deaths, surpassing even China, the epicenter of the pandemic.
This study delves into the crucial task of monitoring mortality rates attributed to COVID-19, a pivotal aspect in evaluating the severity of the disease and aiding in decision-making processes. Specifically, the research focuses on examining the spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 mortality within various Brazilian states during the period spanning from March 17, 2020, to April 24, 2020, encompassing epidemiological weeks 12 to 17.
This ecological study examined all COVID-19 related deaths, with the geographic units of analysis being the state and EW. Data was sourced from the Ministry of Health of Brazil (https://covid.saude.gov.br) as of April 25, 2020, while population data was obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (https://www.ibge.gov.br/). The accumulated mortality rates for each state and EW were calculated using the equation: <>.
Furthermore, an exploratory spatial analysis was conducted, employing stratification at equal intervals. Choropleth maps were generated to visually represent the findings. Given that secondary data sourced from the public domain was utilized, the Research Ethics Committee deemed approval unnecessary.
The first death attributed to COVID-19 was recorded in São Paulo on March 17, 2020, followed by two confirmed deaths in Rio de Janeiro on March 19, 2020. By Epidemiological Week (EW) 12, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro collectively accounted for 18 deaths. By EW13, 10 states had reported fatalities, with São Paulo (1.82/1 million) and Rio de Janeiro (0.77/1 million) exhibiting the highest mortality rates, contributing to 97 out of 114 total deaths in Brazil. Moving to EW 14, São Paulo (5.62/1 million), Rio de Janeiro (3.42/1 million), Amazonas (2.83/1 million), and Ceará (2.40/1 million) had the highest mortality rates. In EW 15, Amazonas recorded the highest mortality rate nationwide (12.50/1 million), closely followed by São Paulo (12.26/1 million). Notably, Pernambuco saw a substantial surge in mortality from 1.45/1 million to 7.46/1 million in the same week. By EW 16, Amazonas witnessed a tripling of its mortality rate, soaring to 37.9/1 million, surpassing São Paulo's rate of 21.51/1 million by 1.7 times. In EW 17, Amazonas reported the highest COVID-19 mortality rate at 60.14 deaths/1 million (n = 255 deaths), trailed by Pernambuco (36.47/1 million), Rio de Janeiro (33.64/1 million), São Paulo (32.82/1 million), and Ceará (30.94/1 million).
This study illustrates the progression of death rates across Brazilian states during the initial six Epidemiological Weeks (EWs) of COVID-19 mortality in Brazil, as depicted in Figure 1. The first instances of cases and fatalities were documented in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Subsequently, with the emergence of fatalities in these regions, surveillance services in other states commenced reporting both cases and deaths. Following this, within a few weeks, the North and Northeast states exhibited the highest mortality rates.
Since the onset of community transmission of COVID-19, tracing an accurate route for the distribution of cases has become increasingly challenging. However, certain factors can shed light on the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil. São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are often referred to as Brazil's "entrance gates" due to the significant influx of international passengers and cargo flights, with a majority of flights from Europe and the United States landing in these cities. Moreover, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro boast the highest concentration of domestic flights in the country, serving as key arrival and departure points or connecting hubs, thus potentially playing a crucial role in the dissemination of the disease to other states.
While both air transport and traffic networks are crucial for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 spread within a country, they alone are insufficient to account for the variations in mortality rates among different states. Initial findings indicate that COVID-19 mortality is linked to advanced age and underlying health conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Nevertheless, mortality rates exhibit significant disparities even within these vulnerable population subsets. Our investigation, conducted on April 24, 2020, revealed that the mortality rate in Amazonas was nearly double that of São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. This disparity underscores the potential influence of social and demographic factors, as well as disparities in healthcare services, as significant contributors to COVID-19 mortality outcomes.
As COVID-19 progresses rapidly to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, critically ill patients require mechanical ventilatory support in intensive care units (ICUs). The varying availability of these resources poses an additional risk factor for death from COVID-19. In Amazonas, there are 6.5 adult ICU beds per 100,000 people, which is 3.3 times lower than in Rio de Janeiro (21.9/100,000 population) and 2.7 times lower than in São Paulo (18.0/100,000 population). When specifically considering public health beds, the availability in Amazonas drops even further to 5.0 beds per 100,000 people.
An estimated 22.6% of individuals exclusively utilizing the public health system lack access to ICU beds within their resident health regions, as these beds are predominantly concentrated in metropolitan areas. Furthermore, 9.8% of health regions possess 10 beds per 100,000 population. In terms of human resources, the region only accommodates 4% of the total physician workforce in the country, equating to roughly one physician for every 1,000 inhabitants. This ratio is seven times lower than the physician availability in state capitals within the South region. The situation exacerbates in municipalities distant from the capital, such as in Amazonas, where the capital Manaus boasts a ratio of two physicians per 1,000 inhabitants, contrasting starkly with the interior municipalities of Amazonas, where the ratio plummets to 0.2 physicians per 1,000 inhabitants. Consequently, the scarcity of both human and material resources for healthcare, coupled with the rapid transmission of COVID-19, is likely to contribute to an escalation in mortality rates.
In the Northeast region, Pernambuco and Ceará exhibited high COVID-19 mortality rates. Similar to the North region, the Northeast faced significant social vulnerability, as 30.5% of individuals reliant solely on the public health system lacked access to ICU beds in their respective health regions. Furthermore, all states in the Northeast region have fewer than two physicians per 1,000 inhabitants.
This study is subject to certain limitations. Given that we conducted our analysis using secondary data sourced from surveillance systems, there is a strong possibility that COVID-19 related deaths were underreported. It is worth noting that Brazil ranks among the countries with the lowest testing rates for COVID-19 on a global scale. Despite these factors, it is important to acknowledge that any underreporting that may have taken place is likely to have been random in nature and has not had any discernible impact on the outcomes of our study.
In essence, Brazilian states experiencing the most pronounced deficiencies in health resources have exhibited the highest COVID-19 mortality rates. The disparities in the availability and accessibility of healthcare services pose further obstacles, contributing to the escalating COVID-19 mortality rates within the nation. This research underscores the imperative for an immediate enhancement of the operational capabilities of the Unified Health System.
