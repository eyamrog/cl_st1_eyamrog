In this study, we present the identification of a SARS-CoV-2 genome using metatranscriptome next-generation sequencing from the nasopharyngeal swab of a suspected case of local Covid-19 transmission in Brazil. The successful detection of the virus was facilitated by depleting human ribosomal RNA and employing an optimized in-house bioinformatics approach.
COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was initially identified as an unusual form of pneumonia in China in December 2019. By early April 2020, the disease had rapidly spread worldwide, affecting over 150 countries and resulting in more than 1,000,000 confirmed cases as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). The first documented case in South America occurred on February 26, 2020, when a traveler returning from Northern Italy tested positive in São Paulo, Brazil's largest city. Subsequently, suspected instances of local transmission emerged within the country, notably in Bahia state in early March 2020.
Determining the roles of different diagnostic technologies in the context of an ongoing viral epidemic presents significant challenges, with recent research highlighting sensitivity issues associated with real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) for COVID-19 diagnosis. Factors such as high viral recombination in coronaviruses and fluctuating viral loads throughout the disease progression may potentially interfere with RT-qPCR accuracy, necessitating further investigation within the realm of COVID-19 diagnostics. Consequently, the development of novel protocols for untargeted clinical metagenomics could offer valuable diagnostic tools for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens amidst the current global landscape of emerging viral infections. Recent studies have explored metagenome-based strategies for next-generation sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, revealing varying outcomes when comparing amplicon-based sequencing to direct metatranscriptome sequencing. Notably, metagenome sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens has shown superior results compared to nasal swabs, underscoring the potential of this approach in enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
In this investigation, we successfully identified a SARS-CoV-2 genome directly from a nasopharyngeal swab specimen of a suspected case of local transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil, utilizing a metatranscriptomics approach. On March 03, 2020, a female patient presented at a public hospital in Feira de Santana-Bahia, Brazil, with complaints of a sore throat and mild dyspnea. Given her self-reported close contact with a returning traveler from Italy who had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, a specific diagnostic inquiry was deemed necessary, prompting the immediate collection of a nasopharyngeal swab sample. The extraction of viral RNA and RT-qPCR amplification were conducted following a validated protocol established within our research group at the Institute of Health Sciences, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador-BA, Brazil, as outlined in a Promega application report. To summarize, 200 µL of samples preserved in transport medium (Leibovitz's L15) were subjected in triplicate to RNA extraction using the Maxwell 16 instrument, following the Maxwell® 16 Viral Total Nucleic Acid System protocol from Promega. The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome via RT-qPCR was executed in accordance with the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus protocol, employing the GoTaq® Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR System from Promega and primers/probe targeting the nucleocapsid (N) encoding region. A moderately high viral load was identified in the nasopharyngeal swab sample, with a cycle threshold (Ct) of 21, a value akin to the highest reported for the initial days post-symptom onset in eighteen Chinese patients.
Concurrently, the RNA extracted, approximately 14 ng/µL, underwent metatranscriptome next-generation sequencing on the Ion S5 platform (ThermoFisher) utilizing an Ion 540™ chip and the Ion Total RNA-Seq kit v2, following the manufacturer's guidelines (ThermoFisher). One sample had undergone prior processing with the Low Input RiboMinus™ Eukaryote System v2 (ThermoFisher) to eliminate human ribosomal RNA from the total RNA (Fig. 1). The sequence reads underwent initial quality filtering (Phred >20), assessment for ambiguous bases (>1% sequence with Ns), and size (reads >= 30 nt); any reads originating from human transcripts were excluded: 77.29% in the rRNA depleted library and 84.49% in the whole RNA library. The remaining sequence reads (ranging from 30 to 358 nt) were subsequently employed for contig assembly (refer to the detailed pipeline in Fig. 1). The sequencing data is accessible on NCBI's SRA database under the accession number PRJNA613951.
Depletion of human rRNA resulted in a notable increase in the number of contigs (n = 51; N50 = 180 nt) confidently aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome, as illustrated in Figure 1b. This led to a genome coverage of 29.9% for contigs and 59.9% for total reads, surpassing the coverage levels reported in recent studies on nasopharyngeal swabs. SNP analysis conducted using Atlas 2 (https://sourceforge.net/p/atlas2/wiki/Atlas-SNP/) revealed that mutations predominantly accumulate in four ORFs (ORF1a, M, ORF8, and N) along with the 3’UTR, mirroring the mutation profile observed in strains from Brazilian patients available on the NexStrain platform (https://nextstrain.org/).
Our findings validate the utility of direct metatranscriptome sequencing from nasopharyngeal swabs as a supplementary approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, while also offering insights into potential nucleotide mutations that might affect the sensitivity of RT-qPCR-based diagnostics. It is important to highlight that the processing of samples and the construction of sequencing libraries, especially in terms of ribosomal RNA depletion, can have a substantial influence on metatranscriptomic outcomes.
