Materials and Methods: The literature search was systematically conducted across multiple databases including MEDLINE/PubMed, Scielo, Lilacs, Web of Science, and Scopus, adhering to PRISMA guidelines to identify pertinent articles published within the last two decades. Data extraction was performed by two reviewers independently utilizing a standardized form. Recorded variables encompassed the country of study, study design, pacifier material, sample size, microorganisms examined, decontamination techniques employed, method accessibility, and outcomes obtained.
Results: A total of 121 articles were retrieved from all databases, with 8 articles meeting the final screening criteria. The methods of disinfection examined in the literature included 3.5% neutral detergent, 70% apple cider vinegar spray, boiling water for 15 minutes, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite, 70% hydrogen peroxide spray, 0.12% chlorhexidine, BrushtoxÂ®, sterile water, and microwave disinfection.
Conclusion: The consensus on pacifier decontamination remains unclear due to the wide range of disinfection methods available and varying levels of accessibility to disinfectant agents. Despite the diversity in disinfection approaches, this article has successfully identified and described the suggested methods for pacifier disinfection.
The use of pacifiers is becoming more prevalent in various contemporary cultures, emerging as a prevalent non-nutritive sucking habit among children. These pacifiers serve multiple functions, such as calming the child, aiding in sleep, and fulfilling their physiological and psychological requirements. However, the discussion surrounding the advantages and drawbacks of pacifier use remains contentious due to conflicting data. In addition to the perceived benefits, it is crucial to consider the association of pacifiers with microorganisms, as they can serve as vehicles for contamination and transmission.
Currently, humanity is grappling with a new challenge: coexisting with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. While children typically exhibit asymptomatic responses to COVID-19, heightened attention must be directed towards younger individuals, as the incidence of cases within this demographic is notably elevated due to their tendency to forego mask-wearing and other preventive measures [5]. Furthermore, pacifiers could potentially serve as a mode of transmission, given their close proximity to the mouth and face. These items come into contact with saliva and oral microbiota, fostering the formation of microbial biofilms on their surfaces [4,6,7]. Given the frequency of pacifier drops, they are exposed to a diverse array of microorganisms and are often reinserted into the mouth without prior cleaning or disinfection [4]. Additionally, the use of pacifiers has been linked to various other ailments and conditions in children, including fungal infections [7] and intestinal parasitosis [4].
Given the potential for contamination and transmission of microorganisms, particularly SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to emphasize the proper disinfection of pacifiers [4,8,9]. Unfortunately, in everyday practice, pacifiers are often only washed with running water and dried, highlighting the need for improved disinfection methods [10]. Despite the importance of this issue, there is a scarcity of research globally on the efficacy of various disinfection techniques in reducing contamination. The objective should not be to discourage pacifier use but rather to emphasize the necessity of thorough disinfection to safeguard oral health and prevent oral infections in children [11]
The objective of this study was to review pacifier disinfection methods to ascertain if a consensus exists in the literature and to identify a method that consistently meets expected outcomes. This involved identifying all suggested methods for pacifier disinfection and evaluating their effectiveness.
This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [12]. The initial phase of this systematic review entailed formulating a guiding question for the study: "Is there a consensus on pacifier decontamination?" The protocol was finalized and registered with the Prospective International Registry of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under ID number 152011 prior to commencing the literature search.
To enhance our search strategies, we conducted a survey across various databases including MEDLINE/PubMed, Scientific Electronic Library (SciELO), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS), Web of Science, and Scopus, which have been repositories for scientific studies over the past two decades. Employing Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors, specifically "pacifier", "disinfection", "biofilm", and "microbiology", we associated the term "pacifier" with each of the others using the Boolean operator "AND". Consequently, the search equations were structured as follows: (pacifier and disinfection); (pacifier and biofilm); (pacifier and microbiology).
Eligible studies for inclusion in this research encompassed the topic of pacifier disinfection and were published between January 1999 and October 2019, without any language restrictions. Inclusion criteria necessitated studies that independently examined various methods of pacifier disinfection, each with a comparative group. Exclusion criteria encompassed studies that diverged from the primary focus of pacifier disinfection, those solely focused on pacifier contamination and/or biofilm formation, and any duplicated research efforts.
The articles were selected in two phases. Initially, the two reviewers, VS and DL, individually assessed the titles and abstracts of all references to exclude clearly irrelevant studies during phase 1. Any discrepancies were resolved through consensus with the supervisor, FM. Moving on to phase 2, the full texts were independently reviewed and selected by both reviewers, with DL conducting the same process. Any disagreements that arose were also settled by the supervisor, FM.
Two reviewers, VS and DL, independently extracted data using a standardized form. Recorded factors included the country of study, type of study, pacifier material, sample number (n), microorganisms analyzed, decontamination methods used, method accessibility, and results obtained from the reviewed articles. In instances of discrepancy, a consensus was reached by the supervisor, FM. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, a meta-analysis was not feasible; however, study characteristics and results were qualitatively analyzed.
The methodological quality of the studies was independently assessed by two reviewers (VS and DL), with discrepancies resolved under the supervision of FM. The risk of bias was evaluated based on criteria such as randomization of pacifier selection, use of a disinfection control material (sterile water), sample size parity, protocol clarity, multiple disinfection method selection, and statistical analysis. Studies were categorized as having "low risk of bias" for one to two "no" responses, "average risk of bias" for three to four, and "high risk of bias" for five to six affirmative responses. Any disagreements between reviewers regarding quality assessment were addressed by the supervisor (FM).
The term "pacifier" was associated with other relevant terms, leading to an initial retrieval of 121 articles from various databases. Following the removal of duplicates, 56 articles were chosen for further examination based on the presence of defined keywords in their titles or abstracts. These selected articles underwent an initial screening process focusing on their summaries, disinfection methods, and the significance of their findings, resulting in the identification of 11 relevant studies. Subsequently, a final screening was conducted through a thorough reading to assess compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, ultimately yielding 8 articles for inclusion. The flowchart in Figure 1 illustrates the step-by-step process of identification, selection, eligibility assessment, and inclusion of studies.
Among the eight studies analyzed, seven were in vitro experimental studies [3,8,9,11,13-15], with one being a transverse study [10]. The selected studies were carried out in Brazil (5) [3,8,10,13,15], South Africa (2) [9,11], and India (1) [14]. Sample sizes varied across the studies, with some ranging from 10 to 50 participants [8,13,15], others from 51 to 100 participants [3,9,14], and a few with sample sizes between 101 and 160 participants [10,11].
All the chosen studies examined various methods for disinfecting pacifiers.
A 3.5% neutral detergent solution was applied to the sample and subjected to mechanical agitation for a duration of 1 minute. This treatment resulted in the successful eradication of C. albicans, achieving a remarkable reduction in contamination levels by 100% as reported in a previous study [8].
The apple cider vinegar 70% spray was applied twice to all sample surfaces, resulting in a statistically significant reduction of viable cells in S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. mutans, and E. coli biofilms [13]. However, all pacifiers contaminated with C. parapsilosis and treated with apple cider vinegar remained contaminated [11].
Boiling water for 15 minutes proved to be an effective method for controlling C. albicans, resulting in a 100% reduction in contamination, as supported by previous research [8]. This finding is consistent with other studies that found just five minutes of boiling water to be adequate for disinfecting pacifiers contaminated with S. mutans and C. albicans [15]. Additionally, it has been recommended by other researchers that pacifiers should be disinfected in boiling water for 15 minutes to effectively eliminate cariogenic microorganisms [10].
Sodium hypochlorite at a concentration of 2.5% was utilized for immersion, with specimens being exposed to 10 mL of the solution for a duration of 5 minutes. This treatment method demonstrated significant efficacy in controlling Candida albicans, resulting in a complete reduction of contamination by 100% as reported in a previous study [8].
The 70% hydrogen peroxide spray was applied twice to all sample surfaces, effectively reducing viable Enterobacteriaceae cells within the microcosm biofilm [13].
Chlorhexidine 0.12% has been shown to be effective in removing S. epidermidis and C. parapsilosis [11], C. albicans [9], and S. mutans [3,9,14]. Previous authors have highly recommended disinfecting pacifiers by spraying an antimicrobial agent like chlorhexidine 0.12% [10].
BrushtoxÂ® was found to be effective in eliminating S. epidermidis and C. parapsilosis in a previous study [11], which contrasts with the findings reported by other researchers [10].
Sterile water alone has been proven ineffective in completely eliminating pacifier contamination, as indicated by previous studies [3, 9, 10, 14]. Despite vigorous cleaning efforts with sterile water, the samples remained contaminated, highlighting the insufficiency of this method in effectively removing pathogens from pacifiers [11].
Microwave energy proved effective in disinfecting a pacifier contaminated with C. albicans [9,15] and S. mutans [3,9,14,15]. The pertinent data extracted from the referenced articles were summarized in Table 1.
Among the seven studies analyzed, five were deemed to have a low risk of bias [3, 8, 9, 11, 13], while two were classified as having a medium risk [10, 15] (refer to Figure 2). Interestingly, three of the studies did not employ sterile water as a control material; instead, they utilized multiple disinfection methods in their experiments. Notably, only one study demonstrated no bias upon scrutiny [8].
Pacifiers, commonly utilized by children, are consistently exposed to saliva and oral microorganisms, making them potential vehicles for contamination and microbial transmission, particularly of SARS-CoV-2, necessitating proper hygiene practices. Additionally, children, being a highly vulnerable group to COVID-19 due to the immaturity of their immune systems, coupled with close family contacts being susceptible to cross-infection, underscore the importance of maintaining stringent pacifier disinfection protocols during the ongoing pandemic. Given the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through aerosols and close contact, heightened attention to pacifier hygiene is crucial in these challenging times.
Various disinfection methods are available for pacifier decontamination, including antimicrobial solutions such as chlorhexidine, triclosan, cetylpyridinium chloride, Listerine, and various dentifrices, as well as natural agents like garlic and tea tree oil extracts, and radiation methods like microwave and ultraviolet rays, similar to those used for toothbrush disinfection. However, the effectiveness of these methods varies according to different authors. Therefore, this systematic review aims to establish whether there is a consensus in the literature regarding the most effective method and to identify all suggested methods for pacifier disinfection in order to determine if there is a method that consistently meets expected results.
Pacifier nozzles are commonly manufactured using either latex or silicone materials. Presently, silicone nozzles are favored due to their lower allergenic potential attributed to reduced roughness and microbial adhesion [6,7]. Despite the latex surface exhibiting greater irregularity compared to silicone, potentially serving as a biofilm reservoir and infection niche [6], silicone pacifiers still pose a risk for microorganism adhesion and infection transmission [4,7]. Notably, research indicates that post-disinfection procedures, latex pacifiers display increased surface pores and roughness in comparison to those subjected to heat treatment [15].
From a social perspective, disinfection methods should meet several criteria: they must be effective, simple, inexpensive, non-toxic, and easily implemented. Despite the importance of these characteristics, there is a scarcity of global studies dedicated to identifying the optimal method. Our findings support this scarcity and extend it further. While our focus was on a single criterion - the types of pacifier disinfection - and we considered applicability and effectiveness, only eight studies met our criteria over a twenty-year period. Interestingly, among the eligible studies, only Brazil and South Africa appeared to prioritize pacifier disinfection. We excluded an article from India from our analysis as its content overlapped with another study included in our review. This underscores the necessity of conducting systematic reviews to assess published research critically, ensuring the relevance and synthesis of findings, as advocated by previous scholars.
Regular implementation of cleaning and disinfection protocols serves as a common approach to managing the colonization of pathogenic microorganisms. Despite the limited number of studies available, this systematic review highlights the diverse range of disinfectant agents employed for pacifier disinfection, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Many of the techniques outlined in the literature are adaptations from existing protocols, reflecting the varied approaches to decontaminating products and utensils intended for human use. Through the examination of multiple articles, nine distinct strategies for microbial control were identified, involving the utilization of solutions and products with thermal, chemical, mechanical, and chemomechanical properties.
Numerous studies have outlined diverse decontamination protocols and agents, yet only a limited number of microorganisms have undergone testing. The fungi and bacteria scrutinized consistently belonged to the Candida and Streptococcus genera, respectively, both prevalent in the oral microbiota. Despite a consensus on the microorganisms, the microbiological analysis approach varied: three studies employed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) [3,10,15], while four utilized the viable count method [8,9,11,13]. SEM proves to be a valuable tool not only for detailed observation of substrate morphology but also for monitoring bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on a biotic surface [21]. In contrast, the viable count method is a reliable technique for assessing live microorganisms [22], a method with a long-standing history of use.
Considering the variability in the analysis, it is imperative to assess the disinfection method that excels in terms of advantages and can be easily replicated by the general population. The use of antimicrobial sprays in daily routines is intriguing due to its practicality and convenience. Among the seven articles reviewed, five focused on the disinfection efficacy of this method. A notable advantage of spray application is its speed and ease of use, offering a fresh portion of the solution with each application, unlike the dipping process where the solution quickly becomes contaminated and requires frequent replacement. Additionally, the effectiveness of disinfection is contingent upon the agent utilized, with no consensus on the optimal agent for spray applications.
Another commonly employed strategy by parents for pacifier decontamination involves vigorous cleaning with sterile water. Nevertheless, research has demonstrated its inadequacy in completely eradicating pacifier contamination [8,10] or eliminating planktonic cell contamination [3,9,11], underscoring the ineffectiveness of water alone against bacterial and fungal contamination [4,7]. These findings suggest that water may serve as a control in in vitro assessments to gauge the efficacy of various disinfection protocols (both physical and chemical) before conducting in vivo evaluations [3].
When utilizing boiled water, several studies have demonstrated complete disinfection of the pacifier surfaces within 15 minutes [8,10] and even as quickly as 5 minutes [15]. These findings align with a systematic review and meta-analysis, which affirmed that boiling drinking water effectively deactivates pathogens across various organism groups [24].
It is recommended to clean pacifiers daily by washing them with running water and a neutral detergent, employing vigorous mechanical action for a minimum of 5 minutes [8]. Previous studies have reported favorable outcomes when adhering to this cleaning protocol [25]. Another effective method involves immersing the pacifier in a solution of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes, as this agent has been proven to achieve complete disinfection of pacifiers [8], as well as toothbrushes [26].
Antimicrobial agents that are cost-effective, minimally toxic, and easy to administer, commonly found in households or easily accessible in the market, merit consideration [27]. Studies have shown that hydrogen peroxide spray at 70% concentration and apple cider vinegar spray effectively eradicated viable cells within bacterial biofilms [13,27].
BrushtoxÂ® is a solution containing activated ethanol (40% v/v) and a biocide (parabens) that is considered an effective disinfectant for eliminating bacteria and fungi from toothbrushes [23]. However, its efficacy in pacifier decontamination remains a topic of debate, with conflicting findings reported in the literature [10, 11]. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of BrushtoxÂ® should include considerations of its cost, availability, and potential drawbacks that could impede its widespread adoption among the general population [27].
The chlorhexidine solution (0.12%) is suggested for diverse applications [28], such as disinfecting toothbrushes [29], and has demonstrated efficacy in eradicating pacifier microorganisms [3,9-11]. Nevertheless, its utilization is contentious, primarily due to cost considerations in comparison to alternative disinfection solutions. These drawbacks could constrain its broad adoption, particularly among low-income demographics [8,25].
The issue of chlorhexidine-related microbial resistance remains controversial, with some studies not demonstrating the emergence of resistant microorganisms while others indicating that certain strains could potentially develop tolerance after prolonged exposure to chlorhexidine. It is important to note that for pacifier disinfection, the adverse effects of chlorhexidine are minimized as the application is conducted outside the mouth and without direct mucosal exposure. Consequently, a cost-benefit analysis of utilizing this antimicrobial agent is essential.
Another method for pacifier disinfection involves the use of a microwave. This procedure, while optional, is straightforward and can effectively reduce or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms present on the pacifier's surface. Research has indicated that microwave disinfection is not only successful for pacifiers but also for other dental materials like orthodontic instruments. Specifically, running the microwave at power level 7 (equivalent to 70% of total power) for 7 minutes has proven effective in pacifier disinfection, particularly in addressing S. mutans and C. albicans contamination. Additionally, running the microwave at full power for 5 minutes has also shown to be an efficient method for pacifier disinfection. However, it is crucial to exercise caution when utilizing this method due to variations in microwave models and their respective parameters.
The quality assessment of the included studies indicates an overall good quality, as none exhibited a high risk of bias. However, future research should focus on better evaluating the control group, as three studies did not utilize sterile water. Despite this limitation, the disinfection modes of pacifiers in our analyses were deemed appropriate, as they employed a variety of different methods for testing.
Currently, there exists a lack of consensus regarding the disinfection of pacifiers, primarily stemming from the varied protocols that have been proposed utilizing a range of agents and strategies. Each method carries its own set of advantages and disadvantages, necessitating a careful evaluation of the most suitable approach based on factors such as the frequency of pacifier use, the location where it was dropped, and the accessibility of disinfectant agents within the family environment.
