The study focused on evaluating the efficacy of physical and chemical decontamination methods for Bostrychia binderi Harvey. Thalli underwent washing and exposure to various chemical solutions (5% liquid detergent, 1% povidone iodine, and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite) in different sequences and durations. Post-treatment, the thalli were cultivated in a laboratory setting to assess any adverse effects on the alga. Quantification of contaminating organisms in the culture medium was conducted at the end of the cultivation period. Effective decontamination methods included washing, spraying, removal of macrofauna with tweezers, immersion in 5% liquid detergent for 60 seconds, followed by 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 2 minutes, successfully eliminating all analyzed contaminants. While immersion in 1% povidone iodine did not hinder thalli growth, a 5-minute immersion in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite had a negative impact. The study recommends the outlined protocol for establishing unialgal cultures of Bostrychia binderi Harvey.
Culture techniques for macroalgae in the laboratory are valuable tools in ecophysiological studies for basic research or to obtain relevant products for humans (Fernandes et al., 2011). According to Berland et al. (1972), contaminants in macroalgal culture medium grow and proliferate faster than the algae, competing for nutrients and releasing substances capable of inhibiting algal growth. Fernandes et al. (2011) note that the establishment and maintenance of macroalgal cultures free of contaminating organisms have been one of the main challenges faced by researchers. Contaminating organisms such as cyanobacteria, microalgae, fungi, heterotrophic bacteria, protozoa, and invertebrates can also thrive in these cultures. Typically, the primary source of contamination for macroalgal cultures is the biota present on the algal surface.
Procedures have been developed and are utilized to prevent the contamination of cultures. Various methods for surface decontamination of macroalgae have been employed, including the use of chemical compounds such as antibiotics, disinfectant solutions (such as detergent, povidone iodine, sodium hypochlorite, and sodium hydroxide), as well as physical methods like brushing and washing (e.g. Oliveira et al. 1995, Kawai et al. 2005, Bravin et al. 2006, Shea & Chopin 2007, Fernandes et al. 2011, Holdt et al. 2014, Saminathan et al. 2014, Yong et al. 2014, Kerrison et al. 2016, Ali et al. 2018). Nevertheless, it is crucial to tailor the methods for surface decontamination of macroalgae to each specific species (Fernandes et al. 2011) due to the fact that the effects of these procedures, particularly the use of chemical compounds, can vary significantly among different macroalgal species.
The genus Bostrychia Montagne, a member of Rhodomelaceae (Rhodophyta), comprises macroalgae found in temperate and tropical regions, inhabiting both continental aquatic and marine environments, particularly salt marshes and mangroves (King & Puttock, 1989). Bostrychia species play a crucial role in the mangrove community structure known as Bostrychietum, a term introduced by Post (1936) encompassing predominantly rhodophytes like Bostrychia, Caloglossa (Harvey) G. Martens, and Catenella Greville, alongside cyanobacteria and chlorophytes that associate with pneumatophores of Avicennia L., rhizophores, and stems of Rhizophora L. and Laguncularia C.F.Gaertn (West, 1991; West et al., 1993; Pedroche et al., 1995; Yokoya et al., 1999; Fontes et al., 2007; García et al., 2016).
Bostrychia spp. exhibit growth through apical cells located in the branches and follow a Polysiphonia-type life history. The tetrasporophyte life stages, which are diploid, release tetraspores (haploid) that subsequently develop into male and female gametophytes (haploid). Male gametophytes generate and release spermatia (haploid) that fertilize the carpogonium (haploid) situated at the terminus of carpogonial branches produced by the female gametophytes. Following fertilization, carposporophytes (diploid) form and release carpospores (diploid), which then mature into tetrasporophytes (West et al., 1993; West et al., 2001).
Sediment and various mangrove organisms, such as microalgae, protozoa, fungi, nematodes, microcrustaceans, annelids, small molluscs, chironomid larvae, and trombiculid mites, are linked to the Bostrychietum (García et al., 2016; Vieira et al., 2018). Additionally, epiphytic macroalgae and endophytic fungi may also have associations with Bostrychia spp. (De Felício et al., 2015). However, establishing laboratory cultures of Bostrychia sp. that are free from contaminating organisms (unialgal cultures) poses challenges, necessitating the development of decontamination protocols tailored to Bostrychia species.
In this study, the primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of physical and chemical methods for decontaminating the surface of Bostrychia binderi Harvey. This particular species was chosen as a model organism to establish a decontamination protocol for the production of pure algal cultures for laboratory investigations within this genus. Our hypothesis posits that a sequence of procedures including rinsing with distilled water following washing and spraying with sterilized seawater, manual removal of macrofauna and epiphytic macroalgae, as well as immersing thalli in a 5% liquid detergent solution followed by a 0.2% sodium hypochlorite treatment, will effectively decontaminate the surface of B. binderi.
Collection and maintenance of cultures - Specimens of Bostrychia binderi Harvey were collected in the mangrove of the “Área de Proteção Ambiental da Barra do Rio Mamanguape” (6°46'15.00"S and 34°56'15.00"O) in February 2017 by Henrique Douglas dos Santos Borburema (JPBN° 63215). The field collection involved the removal of most of the estuarine sediment along with in situ water.
In the laboratory, the remaining sediment adhered to the thalli was physically removed through multiple washings and spraying with sterilized seawater, while macrofauna individuals such as molluscs, crustaceans, and annelids were carefully extracted using tweezers. Thalli sections hosting filamentous and crustose macroalgae were excised with scalpels. The removal of macrofauna individuals and cutting of thalli parts with epiphytes were meticulously carried out under a stereoscopic microscope. All tools utilized in handling the macroalgae were sterilized in 70% ethanol, and tweezers were subjected to flaming. The seawater employed in these procedures underwent sterilization via filtration using sterilized cellulose membrane filters with a pore size of 0.45 µm, followed by heating in a laboratory drying oven at 90 ºC for two hours (with subsequent reheating after cooling) as outlined by Borburema et al. (2020). Notably, the seawater was not autoclaved to maintain the integrity of its vitamins.
Specimens of B. binderi weighing approximately 900 mg were housed in 1000 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 700 mL of culture medium under constant aeration. The water temperature was maintained at 25 ºC, with a photonic flux density ranging from 60 to 80 µmol photons m-2 s-1, and a photoperiod of 12:12 h (light:dark cycle) to sustain the macroalgae in the laboratory for one week prior to the chemical procedures aimed at testing surface decontamination. The culture medium consisted of sterilized seawater enriched with von Stosch’s solution (8 mL L-1), following the method outlined by Edwards (1970) but with modifications that included a 50% reduction in vitamin concentrations as suggested by Yokoya (2000).
In our study, we evaluated the efficacy of thalli immersion treatments in chemical solutions following multiple rounds of washing and spraying with sterilized seawater, as well as the physical removal of macrofauna individuals and epiphytic macroalgae, as detailed previously.
Tetrasporophyte plant thalli of B. binderi, measuring 3 cm in primary axis length with lateral branches and weighing 200 mg ± 20 (n = 5 per treatment), were subjected to a series of treatments. Initially, the thalli were washed with distilled water and then immersed in a liquid detergent containing 5% sulfonic acid for 60 seconds as per Fernandes et al. (2011) and Saminathan et al. (2014). Subsequently, the detergent was thoroughly rinsed off with sterilized seawater. The thalli were then exposed to 1% povidone iodine (POVIDINE ®) for varying durations: 15 seconds (treatment 1), 30 seconds (treatment 2), 1 minute (treatment 3), and 2 minutes (treatment 4), following the protocols outlined by Saminathan et al. (2014) and Ali et al. (2018). In parallel, other thalli were treated with sodium hypochlorite (0.2% active chlorine L-1 of deionized water) for 1 minute (treatment 5), 2 minutes (treatment 6), and 5 minutes (treatment 7), based on the methodology described by Holdt et al. (2014). All chemical solutions were meticulously rinsed off the thalli with sterilized seawater. A control group (n = 5) consisted of thalli that did not undergo the initial washing with distilled water or exposure to any of the tested substances.
This study did not aim to compare the effectiveness of 1% povidone iodine with 0.2% sodium hypochlorite, but rather to assess the efficacy of the treatments (1-7) in comparison to the control. All laboratory glassware utilized in the procedures underwent sterilization by being immersed in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite overnight, followed by washing and drying in a laboratory drying oven at 120 ºC for a minimum of four hours.
Thalli were cultivated for three weeks in 100 mL glass transparent containers with 50 mL of culture medium, which was refreshed weekly. The culture medium and cultivation conditions, including temperature, photon flux density, and photoperiod, remained consistent with those outlined for maintaining macroalgae in the laboratory prior to surface decontamination treatments.
The biomass values of the thalli were measured weekly using an analytical balance while replacing the culture medium. Prior to weighing, the thalli were delicately blotted dry with paper towels to eliminate excess water. Relative growth rates (RGR) were computed at the conclusion of the cultivation period, employing the formula advocated by Yong et al. (2013): [(Wt/Wi)1/t - 1] x 100, where Wt represents the wet weight after t days, Wi denotes the initial wet weight, and t signifies the duration of cultivation. The wet weights and RGRs were assessed as indicators of thalli health.
At the conclusion of the cultivation period, 30 mL of culture medium was removed from each replicate, and 20 mL of formaldehyde was introduced, resulting in a final formaldehyde concentration of 4%. Additionally, Rose Bengal dye was incorporated into the mixture. The 4% formaldehyde served the purpose of fixing and preserving the contaminants, while the Rose Bengal dye was used to color them, thereby aiding in their visual identification during subsequent counting procedures. Subsequently, a volume of culture medium (1 mL) was extracted from all replicates near the thalli surface using a pipette and transferred to a SedgEwick-Rafter counting chamber. This allowed for the contaminants to be enumerated using stereoscopic and optical microscopy techniques.
Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the number of contaminants (individuals mL-1) in thalli culture medium immersed in 5% liquid detergent and 1% povidone iodine at various time points with the control group using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Additionally, the number of contaminants in thalli culture medium immersed in 5% liquid detergent and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite at different time intervals was compared to the control group through a series of tests. Specifically, the Mann-Whitney test was employed to compare the mean number of ciliates, microcrustaceans, and nematodes between the control and the 1-minute immersion period. For annelids, comparisons among the control and immersion treatments for 1, 2, and 5 minutes were conducted using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.
ANOVA and Tukey’s test were utilized to compare the thalli weights observed at the three cultivation weeks for the same treatment. The final weights obtained from immersion treatments in 5% liquid detergent and 1% povidone iodine were compared to the control using ANOVA, while a Kruskal-Wallis test was employed to compare the final weights from immersion treatments in 5% liquid detergent and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite to the control. Furthermore, the relative growth rates (RGRs) of the thalli immersed in 5% liquid detergent and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite were compared to the control through ANOVA and Tukey’s test. Additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to compare the RGRs of the thalli immersed in 5% liquid detergent and 1% povidone iodine to the control.
Data were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and for variance homogeneity with Levene's test. Statistical analyses were conducted utilizing the R program (version 4.0.0), with a significance level set at 5%.
Ciliates, microcrustaceans, nematodes, annelids, and small gastropods in samples of thalli culture medium from all treatments and control were quantified using stereoscopic and optical microscopy. Immersion treatments in 5% liquid detergent for 60 seconds followed by 1% povidone iodine were found to be ineffective in eliminating contaminants on the thalli surface. The mean number of contaminants (individuals mL-1) did not show significant differences among these treatments and the control group, as indicated in Table 1.
Immersion treatments in 5% liquid detergent for 60 seconds, followed by exposure to 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 2 and 5 minutes, proved effective in eliminating ciliates, microcrustaceans, nematodes, and small gastropods, while also significantly reducing the number of annelids (refer to Table 1). Treatment 5, involving thalli immersion in 5% liquid detergent followed by exposure to 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute, exhibited the lowest efficacy in eliminating contaminants. Notably, small gastropods were successfully eradicated in all treatments involving 0.2% sodium hypochlorite (see Table 1).
In all treatments involving chemical procedures, a biomass loss was noted in B. binderi during the second weighing, which took place after one week of cultivation (see figure 1). This decline in biomass could potentially be attributed to adverse effects of the chemical compounds on the macroalga. Nevertheless, by the third weighing, conducted after three weeks of cultivation, a recovery of the thalli was observed, with a subsequent biomass gain (see figure 1). Interestingly, the final weights of the thalli did not exhibit any significant differences across the various treatments.
Relative growth rates (RGRs) of the thalli were calculated using the weights obtained between the second and third weighing, post-recovery of the thalli. Significantly different RGRs were observed among thalli immersed in 1% povidone iodine for 30 seconds (1.69% day-1 ± 0.26) compared to those immersed for 15 seconds (0.76% day-1 ± 0.25) and 2 minutes (0.65% day-1 ± 0.63). However, no significant differences were noted when compared to the control (1.15% day-1 ± 0.42) and 1 minute (1.13% day-1 ± 0.63). Thalli immersed in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes exhibited the lowest growth rate (0.46% day-1 ± 0.14), significantly differing from thalli immersed for 2 minutes (1.19% day-1 ± 0.30), 1 minute (1.02% day-1 ± 0.22), and the control (Figure 2). These findings suggest that immersion in 1% povidone iodine did not have a negative impact on thalli growth, while immersion in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes did affect growth.
The results of this study suggest that immersing species of Bostrychia in a 5% liquid detergent for 60 seconds is ineffective for surface decontamination, as evidenced by the persistence of contaminating organisms following this treatment. Conversely, immersion in a compound containing 1% povidone iodine also failed to eliminate these organisms. In contrast, immersion in a solution containing 0.2% sodium hypochlorite proved to be effective, indicating that this concentration of sodium hypochlorite is indeed suitable for surface decontamination of macroalgae. It is worth noting that while the 5% liquid detergent may not be effective in eliminating contaminants, it does play a role in removing fat layers from these organisms, thereby complementing the action of sodium hypochlorite as suggested by Holdt et al. (2014).
Diatoms were present in both treatment and control samples, although they were not quantified due to established methods for inhibiting their growth in culture medium using GeO2 (Germanium Dioxide), a substance known not to harm macroalgae (Lewin 1966, Markham & Hagmeier 1982, Shea & Chopin 2007, Miranda et al. 2012, Saminathan et al. 2014). Diatoms have the potential to outgrow and outcompete macroalgae in culture medium, releasing substances that can hinder algal growth (Berland et al. 1972). However, in our study, these adverse effects were likely absent as thalli biomass remained relatively stable across weeks in the control group (which did not undergo decontamination procedures), with only a slight difference in relative growth rates observed in the control thalli compared to the 5-minute immersion treatment, possibly due to the impact of sodium hypochlorite (further discussed below).
Saminathan et al. (2014) proposed a method involving thalli immersion in liquid detergent (0.5% for 10 minutes) followed by 1% povidone iodine for 30 seconds, which they claimed reduced bacteria and eliminated zooplankton and ciliates on Gracilaria dura (C.Agardh) J.Agardh. However, our study found that 1% povidone iodine alone was not effective in eliminating ciliates and zooplankton, such as microcrustaceans, from the algal surface. It is possible that the successful decontamination reported by Saminathan et al. (2014) was due to the longer immersion time of thalli in detergent (10 minutes).
In their study, Fernandes et al. (2011) demonstrated the efficacy of chemical agents in surface decontamination of macroalgae, specifically using Hypnea musciformis (Wulfen) J.V.Lamouroux as a model, highlighting the effectiveness of detergent (5%) and sodium hypochlorite (1.01%) solutions. In our research, we opted for a lower concentration of sodium hypochlorite (0.2%) due to the delicate nature of Bostrychia sp. thalli compared to Hypnea J.V.Lamouroux. Macroalgae such as Gigartinales and Gracilariales (e.g. Hypnea sp., Kappaphycus Doty, Chondrus Stackhouse, Gracilaria Greville) possess phycocolloids in their thalli, imparting greater rigidity and consistency. The surface decontamination procedures for these macroalgae, as outlined in studies by Holdt et al. (2014), Yong et al. (2014), Saminathan et al. (2014), and Ali et al. (2018), are well-established owing to the economic significance of these species.
During the cultivation period, it was noted that immersing the thalli in sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes led to a minor loss of pigmentation, resulting in bleaching of the thallus. This reduction in pigment likely contributed to the observed decrease in growth in this treatment, as pigment loss can hinder photosynthesis. Fernandes et al. (2011) also documented a similar effect in thalli treated with detergent and sodium hypochlorite. However, given the subsequent recovery of the thalli and the effectiveness of a 2-minute immersion in sodium hypochlorite for eliminating contaminants with minimal negative impacts on the macroalga, we recommend the use of this chemical compound for a shorter duration, in line with the findings of Holdt et al. (2014).
For studies involving Bostrychia species and other estuarine macroalgae, it is advisable to remove sediment in the field, as these environments often have a high concentration of sediments on macroalgae. Subsequently, in the laboratory, any remaining adhered sediments and biota should be removed according to established protocols.
Following the decontamination procedures outlined in this study, it is advisable to reapply the procedures as needed, particularly if contaminants are detected in the culture medium. For other species within the Bostrychia genus, it is suggested to conduct preliminary assessments of thalli immersion durations in a 5% liquid detergent and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite solution. This precaution aims to prevent pigment loss in macroalgae and minimize any potential damage resulting from excessive exposure to the chemical compounds.
The data obtained in this study enabled us to establish protocols for the eradication of contaminating organisms on B. binderi. Our findings indicated that immersing thalli in 5% liquid detergent followed by 1% povidone iodine was ineffective, whereas immersing them in 5% liquid detergent followed by 0.2% sodium hypochlorite was effective. Notably, the relative growth rates (RGRs) of thalli immersed in sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes significantly differed from those immersed for 2 minutes and the control group. However, the RGRs of thalli immersed for 2 minutes did not differ from the control, suggesting that a 2-minute immersion is preferable to avoid prolonged exposure of the macroalgae to the compound. We recommend physically removing any remaining annelids using sterilized tweezers under stereoscopic and optical microscopes. The detailed protocol for surface decontamination of B. binderi is succinctly outlined in Table 2.
