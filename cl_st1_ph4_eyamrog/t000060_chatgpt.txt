This article seeks to examine how formulations, politeness, and facework are utilized by speakers to achieve specific objectives in courtroom interactions. The theoretical framework draws upon concepts from conversation analysis and forensic linguistics, with the corpus centered around the trial of Jodi Ann Arias, a case that garnered significant media coverage in the United States. The analyzed excerpts are sourced from the prosecutor's cross-examination on the final day and a reporter's transcript of the proceedings, accessible online. It is crucial to emphasize that these linguistic devices play a pivotal role in shaping, bolstering, challenging, or undermining the public perception of individuals involved in such legal contexts.
According to Schegloff (2001, p. 230), conversational interaction can be viewed as a "form of social organization through which the work of the constitutive institutions of societies gets done âˆ’ institutions such as the economy, the polity, the family, socialization, etc", and it serves as "the basic and primordial environment for the development, the use, and the learning of natural language". This perspective has led us to explore the application of conversation analysis in forensic settings, focusing on the strategies employed by speakers to achieve specific goals and outcomes. Our research adopts a textual-interactive approach to spoken language, integrating the principles of conversation analysis and forensic linguistics. Our primary objective is to examine how formulations, politeness, and facework are utilized by speakers in courtroom interactions to attain their objectives. We have scrutinized various elements including adjacency pairs like "question/answer", so-prefaced questions, discourse markers, paraphrases, face-threatening acts, mitigation devices, verbal planning markers, formulations prefaced by discourse markers, tag questions, and the three key properties of formulations: preservation, transformation, and deletion.
Stokoe and Edwards (2010, p. 155-156) contend that legal interaction and conversation analysis are intertwined, with various interactional contexts within legal institutions such as courtrooms, police stations, emergency services, prisons, legal documents, and lawyers' offices serving as foundational materials for ethnomethodology and conversation analysis. They posit that interactions in settings like courtrooms can represent profoundly significant moments in individuals' lives.
In the realm of forensic linguistics, Caldas-Coulthard (2014, p.1) highlights its emergence as a burgeoning academic discipline, particularly active in English-speaking nations. The establishment of The International Association of Forensic Linguists (IAFL) in 1993 in Britain underscores the significance of this field. This study, therefore, delves into the domain of interaction within legal contexts, aligning with the focus of forensic experts who scrutinize the spoken language within legal settings such as courthouses, police stations, and interviews (Caldas-Coulthard, 2014, p. 3).
a fundamental aspect of conversational analysis is the notion of the adjacency pair, where conversational turns are structured in pairs with the first part setting expectations that constrain the second part. As highlighted by Sacks et al. (1974, p. 716), this class of units encompasses sequences like 'greeting-greeting' and 'invitation-acceptance/decline'. The initial element of an adjacency pair is referred to as the "first pair-part," as outlined by the authors.
According to Sacks et al. (1974), conversational turn-taking involves constraints that dictate what actions should be taken in the subsequent turn, such as a question prompting an answer that becomes particularly relevant for the following turn. However, these constraints do not inherently assign the next turn to a specific individual. Despite this, they serve as the fundamental element in the process of selecting the next speaker, as it is primarily through affiliation, as the initial pair-part, that the most effective method for choosing the next speaker - addressing someone directly - is facilitated.
The mere presence of a single turn does not suffice to define a conversation; in fact, we argue that even two turns alone do not constitute a conversation. A conversation necessitates more than two interrelated and cooperative turns, occurring within the framework of conditional relevance. Following the initiation of a turn, the expectation of a subsequent turn arises, and when this expectation is met, it is viewed as a continuation or response to the initial turn. In this context, the combination of the first turn with its subsequent counterpart forms a conversational pair, which is essentially recognized as the fundamental unit of dialogue.
Consideration must also be given to the allocation of turns in conversational sequences. In contrast to the typical pattern of "Question 1-Answer 1-Question 2-Answer 2" (Q1-A1-Q2-A2), it is important to note that not all initial pairs necessarily lead directly to their corresponding second pairs. Instances arise where a question-answer sequence is delayed due to the insertion of another question-answer sequence. As elucidated by Yule (1996, p. 77), this results in a sequence format of Q1-Q2-A2-A1, with the intermediary pair (Q2-A2) termed as an insertion sequence. Here, the Q2A2 pair is embedded within the Q1A1 pair, thus constituting an insertion sequence within the conversation. The author posits that despite the appearance of Q2 as a response to Q1, it is assumed that once A2 of the insertion sequence is provided, A1 of the initial question (Q1) will subsequently follow. Coulthard and Brazil (1992, p. 52) further note:
In essence, within the inserted sequence, the original question maintains its transition relevance. If the second speaker fails to provide an answer, its absence is as conspicuous as it would be without any intervening sequence. Consequently, the questioner can express dissatisfaction with the missing response in the same manner. This argument posits that adjacency pairs are normative structures where the second part is expected to follow. Therefore, other sequences can be seen as inserted between the completed first pair part and the anticipated second pair part.
The interlocutor's response to the first question, which is promptly succeeded by another inquiry, suggests a desire to prolong the conversation and potentially defer providing a direct answer. This behavior is indicative of a strategy employed to buy time and avoid immediate responses. Such instances can be exemplified as follows:
Would you prefer the early flight?
Inquiring about the arrival time of the specified event is a common query.
At 9:45.
Indeed, that is a valuable insight. As highlighted by Yule (1996, p. 78), this perspective holds significant merit in the context of our discussion.
In the aforementioned example, the delay in response signifies that the initial element of the pair may not always elicit the anticipated second part from the speaker. According to Yule (1996, p. 78), this delay in providing a response symbolically signifies the potential unavailability of the immediate, typically automatic, expected answer. It serves to highlight the gap between what is anticipated and what is actually given, with such delays being consistently interpreted as carrying significance.
Adjacency pairs serve as the foundation for the principle that each conversational turn is both a reaction to the preceding one and a projection of what is expected to follow. Speakers, in crafting their utterances, demonstrate their comprehension of the prior discourse while also indicating their anticipations for the forthcoming dialogue. This concept aligns with Goffman's assertion (1981, p. 5) that conversational exchanges are intricately linked through this interplay of responses and expectations.
In conversations, questions and answers naturally arise, each occurring at distinct points in "sequence time." Questioners are focused on what lies ahead, anticipating responses and relying on forthcoming information, while answerers reflect on what has been said, looking backward rather than forward. Despite questions being poised to elicit answers and appearing reliant on them, answers are even more reliant, often making less sense in isolation than the initial query that prompted them. Answers, by their nature, must build upon what has already been introduced in the conversation.
The scholar highlights the concept of a 'first pair part' and a 'second pair part' in questions and answers, as described by Harvey Sacks, representing a fundamental dialogic unit. This structure consists of two consecutive utterances, each of the same type, forming what is known as an "adjacency pair". The initial pair-part establishes a "conditional relevance" for the subsequent slot, where any response will be scrutinized for its potential as an answer. Even silence in this context is significant, serving as a response in itself, as noted by Goffman (1981, p. 6). Wooffitt (2005, p. 32) further asserts that.
An adjacency pair refers to a sequence of two adjacent utterances produced by different speakers, with a specific order of a first part followed by a second part. This structure dictates that the first part necessitates a particular second part or a range of possible second parts (Heritage, 1984a, p. 246). For instance, an invitation serves as the initial part of an invitation-response pair, a question initiates a question-answer pair, and a greeting starts off a greeting-greeting pair.
While two-part adjacency pairs are prevalent, there exists a plethora of casual conversations that fall outside this framework, such as classroom discourse, interrogations, service encounters, and various forms of everyday talk that involve a third move in their exchanges. These conversational routines provide a platform for participants to ensure mutual understanding of the preceding pair's function, offer commentary on the ongoing exchange, and react to responses within the context of the initial interaction (Sinclair, 1992, p. 85).
Why did you wake up late today?
It is evident that the timing of the event occurred quite late.
Certainly! Please provide the passage you would like me to improve.
While acknowledging the prevalence of a two-part structure, specifically the "question/answer" adjacency pair, in conversations, it is important to note the existence of a potential three-part structure as well. The Birmingham Discourse Analysis model proposes the possibility of a three-part structure over a two-part one. According to Coulthard and Brazil (1992, p. 66), "all eliciting exchanges have the potential of a three-part structure, although a two-part realization is common, especially in polar responses." The example of a general practitioner consultation highlights that "three-part exchanges are not uncommon."
Doctor: And what has been troubling you lately?
Patient R reported experiencing discomfort in the chest area.
Doctor, I am experiencing pains in my chest.
Patient R confirmed their agreement by responding with a simple "Yes."
Doctor: Where in your chest do you feel the pain?
Patient R presented with symptoms indicative of cardiac distress. The focus of examination was primarily on the heart side, where abnormalities were suspected.
Doctor F responded affirmatively.
Doctor: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
Patient R reported experiencing symptoms for a week as of last Wednesday.
Doctor F: A week ago last Wednesday.
The discussion does not hinge on whether the talk consists of a two-part or three-part structure. As Sinclair (1992, p. 85) points out, resolving the issue cannot be achieved through a simple tally of whether there is a greater prevalence of two-part or three-part talk in the exchange structure. Instead, the focus should be on understanding the variability present in the exchanges and seeking an explanation for it.
The concept of formulation was initially introduced by Garfinkel and Sacks (1970) to refer to the practices employed by interactants to demonstrate their comprehension of various aspects of an interaction. These elements serve as opportunities for individuals to articulate the conversation by describing, explaining, characterizing, elucidating, translating, summarizing, capturing the essence of it, noting its adherence to rules, or commenting on deviations from rules (Garfinkel & Sacks, 1970, p. 350). An illustrative instance of this can be seen in the phrase "Painsâ€”in your chest then" in:
Doctor: And what has been troubling you lately?
Patient R reported experiencing discomfort in the region of the heart.
Doctor, I am experiencing pains in my chest.
Patient R confirmed their agreement as documented by Coulthard and Brazil (1992, p. 66).
According to Heritage and Watson (1979, p. 128-129), formulations serve a multiplex purpose, addressing a wide range of matters that are intricately tied to the specific context of the conversation in which they are used.
According to their findings, formulations exhibit three fundamental properties: the preservation, deletion, and transformation of a preceding utterance or utterances.
According to the properties outlined by Holt and Johnson (2010, p. 28), it is emphasized that...
In the context of formulating utterances, the preservation of certain elements of the sense and reference of news materials is crucial, alongside the alteration of the original syntactic and semantic structure in which the news was initially presented. Additionally, the removal of specific aspects of the delivered news content is also a significant consideration. Heritage and Watson (1977, p. 2-3) discuss these processes in their research.
Deppermann (2011, p. 122) contends that same-speaker formulations serve to elucidate, clarify, specify, generalize, and so forth, meanings by reworking a previous version of reference or description, while other-speaker formulations function as demonstrations of comprehension (and can also clarify, elucidate, etc.). However, formulations, whether from the same speaker or different speakers, do not serve as a straightforward tool for making meanings transparent. According to Deppermann, formulations possess both an explicative and a transformative dimension.
While each formulation retains certain elements of the original meaning, it also omits some aspects while introducing new layers of significance (Heritage and Watson, 1979, p. 129). Furthermore, there exists a reflexive interplay between the initial and revised versions: Formulations elucidate meanings that were previously implicit (or assumed to be so) in the original text, yet their contextual significance is partly dependent on the versions they aim to supplant. When analyzing the semantic attributes of formulations, it is crucial to consider both the sequential structure and the precise linguistic construction of the formulation (Deppermann, 2011, p. 122).
According to Drew (2003, p. 296), formulations are utilized to fulfill particular interactional tasks that differ based on the setting. While they serve as a general mechanism in interactions, the presentation of formulations is intricately linked to the activities they facilitate in specific situations. Consequently, these devices exhibit multifunctionality by assuming various interactional roles across diverse contexts.
According to Goffman (1974, p. 9), the term "face" refers to the positive social value a person effectively claims for themselves based on the line others assume they have taken during a specific interaction. Politeness, as a social phenomenon, is geared towards maintaining harmony in interactions to foster cordial relationships among participants. Schneider (1998, p. 51) asserts that politeness is typically conveyed through grammatical structures that adhere to pragmatic conventions recognized by a particular society as carrying intentional illocutionary force, such as the use of phrases like "please" or "could you."
Goffman (1974, p. 9) posits that "face is a representation of self, defined by socially accepted attributes, thus, it is a representation that can be shared by others, such as when an individual presents themselves favorably in their profession or religious affiliation." During interactions, individuals typically aim to portray a positive self-image and social standing by adopting either a defensive stance, focused on safeguarding their own face, or a protective stance, aimed at preserving the face of their conversational partner (Burgo & Neto, 2016, p. 885).
In the realm of social interactions, individuals engage in various encounters that involve interactions with others. Within these interactions, individuals tend to articulate their opinions, judgments, and perspectives, thereby manifesting what is known as a "line" - a sequence of verbal and nonverbal behaviors through which they convey their interpretation of the situation and, consequently, their assessment of the participants, particularly themselves (Goffman, 1974, p. 9). Through this process, individuals not only evaluate the other participants but also construct a representation of themselves, shaping their self-image. Moreover, this constructed line must align with the individual's desired self-presentation, reflecting how they wish to be perceived.
Regardless of an individual's intention to take a stance, they will perceive that they have successfully done so (cf. Goffman, 1974). According to Goffman (1974), other participants will presume that the individual has consciously taken a position, requiring them to consider the impression that others may have formed of them in order to effectively respond to their reactions.
An individual protects their face when their behavior aligns with the expectations of other participants, essentially presenting an image that conforms to the assumptions and judgments of those involved, thereby gaining approval within the context of the interaction. Face, in this sense, is not confined solely to the individual but rather permeates the dynamics of the encounter, manifesting when participants are able to interpret and understand the implicit judgments conveyed within these interactions.
The author defines facework as the set of actions taken by an individual to prevent any loss of face, both for themselves and others. In contrast to politeness, facework encompasses practices that seek to either bolster, undermine, or maintain the image of the interlocutor. Politeness, on the other hand, revolves around behaviors that cater to individuals' desires for approval and autonomy. Initially rooted in Goffman's (1974) concept of face, Brown and Levinson (1987) broadened the idea of politeness by highlighting two facets of the socially constructed self-image: negative face and positive face.
Negative face refers to the desire of every "competent adult member" to have their actions unimpeded by others.
Positive face refers to the desire of individuals to have their needs and desires be seen as desirable by others. This concept, as defined by Brown and Levinson (1987), highlights the importance of individuals feeling validated and accepted by at least some others in a social context. Positive face is crucial for maintaining harmonious relationships and fostering a sense of belonging within a group. It reflects the inherent human need for approval and recognition from others, contributing to a sense of self-worth and social connectedness. By understanding and respecting positive face needs, individuals can navigate social interactions more effectively and build stronger interpersonal relationships.
In social interactions, each speaker aims to uphold face to ensure smooth communication; this involves balancing the preservation of one's own face with showing respect for others. Safeguarding negative face involves protecting personal boundaries and privacy, while maintaining positive face requires acknowledgment and appreciation from others. However, conflicts may arise when one's efforts to protect negative face clash with another's desire to maintain positive face. BelchÃ­ (1994, p. 332) contends that such conflicts are inherent in face-saving dynamics.
The defense of individual A's territory conflicts with individual B's desire to initiate relationships. This principle suggests that interactions are inherently confrontational, although fortunately, this confrontation does not always manifest to the same extent.
Interaction inherently creates situations of conflict, making it crucial for harmonious development that participants, as outlined by BelchÃ­ (1994, p. 343), "preserve the interlocutor's face to strike a balance between the urge to connect and the respect for the other's privacy" (translated by us).
While it may not always be feasible to completely avoid face-threatening acts, there are specific strategies that can be employed to reduce the potential impact of such acts (Cruz, 2020, p. 42). In certain studies conducted by Rosulek (2010, p. 227), it was observed that lawyers often utilize the voice of the law or the judge to mitigate potential face-threatening acts. For instance, lawyers may leverage the authority of the judge to convey to jurors that certain evidence, such as a defendant's prior bad acts, cannot be considered in the case. By citing the judge's instructions, as in the example provided where the lawyer states, "As the Court has instructed you, you should not simply conclude the defendantâ€™s a bad person and therefore should be convicted of this," the lawyer is able to emphasize the judge's authority in guiding the jurors. This approach helps prevent the lawyer from making direct demands or accusations towards the jurors, which could potentially harm the lawyer-juror relationship. TkacukovÃ¡ (2010, p. 343) also discusses the use of politeness strategies in a cross-examination scenario, highlighting the importance of maintaining a respectful and tactful demeanor in such interactions.
Several researchers, such as Cashion (1985) and Harris (2003), have delved into the correlation between politeness and power, arriving at a consistent conclusion. Interestingly, individuals occupying powerful roles often employ politeness strategies extensively to mitigate face-threatening actions they must undertake. However, these individuals also have the option to forgo politeness strategies when they aim to explicitly assert their authority. Harris (2003) highlights the significance of negative politeness features in institutional contexts, emphasizing strategies that prevent encroaching on the speaker or hindering their autonomy. Cashion's (1985) study revealed that counselors predominantly utilized negative politeness features, with positive politeness strategies, which cater to the speaker's desire for approval, being infrequent. For instance, in his cross-examination, Rampton utilizes a negative politeness strategy by saying 'correct me if I'm wrong' to refrain from imposing his knowledge on the witness.
Politeness serves as a crucial mechanism for safeguarding the face of both the speaker and the listener, regardless of whether it is enacted through positive or negative politeness strategies.
The research corpus comprises the trial of Jodi Ann Arias, which garnered significant media attention. On May 8, 2013, she was found guilty of the first-degree murder of her former partner, Travis Victor Alexander, in the United States. Alexander was tragically shot in the head, stabbed multiple times, and had his throat slit on June 4, 2008. His body was discovered by acquaintances in the shower of his residence approximately five days later, prompting a 911 call. During police questioning, these individuals suggested that Arias should be investigated. Subsequently, on July 9, 2008, Arias was formally charged with first-degree murder in connection to Alexander's demise. She was taken into custody on July 15, 2008, and ultimately received a life sentence without the possibility of parole on April 13, 2015, in Arizona. Currently, she is incarcerated at the Arizona State Prison Complex â€“ Perryville, specifically in the Lumley Unit.
In order to select the corpus for analysis, we systematically collected all available materials related to Arias's trial from online sources. This included viewing all videos of the trial accessible on YouTube and examining the transcripts that were made public on the internet. It is crucial to highlight that, as reported by the multi-platform news and information media company USA TODAY, Arias testified during her sentencing retrial in the absence of media presence. Subsequently, the Court of Appeals mandated the release of transcripts of her testimony.
This study adopts an empirical-inductive approach, drawing texts from actual usage scenarios and analyzing all instances for qualitative interpretations. The data is presented to showcase how language was utilized in authentic interactions, revealing signs of local verbal planning where speaking and planning occurred simultaneously. Through examining these instances, we have explored potential meanings and interpretations that informed the theoretical framework guiding this research. To narrow down our corpus, we focused on specific types of formulations, politeness strategies, and facework tactics that offered intriguing elements for analysisâ€”common devices employed by speakers to achieve their communicative goals. Consequently, we used the recurrence of these devices as a criterion for data selection. Subsequently, we organized the excerpts in chronological order, starting with the video capturing the final day of the prosecutorâ€™s cross-examination (Day 25) in Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix, Arizona, on February 21, 20139, and a reporterâ€™s transcript of proceedings featuring the testimony of Jodi Ann Arias on November 3, 201410. It is important to note that the video excerpts were transcribed following Leite's guidelines (2017, p. 21-22).
Our analysis was structured around eight excerpts that highlighted key elements for discussion, including the adjacency pair "question/answer", discourse markers, questions prefaced with "so", paraphrases, positive politeness, solidarity politeness, negative politeness, deference politeness, properties of formulations (preservation, transformation, and deletion), tag questions, facework strategies, verbal planning markers, mitigation devices, and hedges.
In the excerpts, the sentences to be analyzed are presented in italics. The first three excerpts were extracted from the concluding day of Jodi Ann Arias's cross-examination (Day 25): Juan Martinez served as the deputy county attorney, Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott represented the defendant, and Sherry K. Stephens presided as the judge. The subsequent excerpts were sourced from the reporter's transcript of the proceedings.
The initial segment of the "question/answer" adjacency pair is introduced by the discourse marker "so." It is essential to acknowledge that discourse markers, within this context, are viewed as syntactically independent elements separate from verbs, which can be composed of one or more lexical items or expressions. These markers aid in monitoring conversations and structuring spoken text. Furthermore, they serve as versatile tools, functioning as textual organizers, illocutionary force indicators, verbal planners, and mitigators, among other roles. According to Schiffrin (2001, p. 57), discourse markers encompass a range of linguistic expressions, including conjunctions (e.g., and, but, or), interjections (oh), adverbs (now, then), and lexicalized phrases (y'know, I mean). Semantically, discourse markers demonstrate "semantic aptness," aligning appropriately with the discourse they are part of; crucially, their semantic evolution suggests a unidirectional flow, with referential (propositional) meaning serving as the foundation for pragmatic (textual and interpersonal) meanings (Brinton, 2001, p. 149). In the aforementioned instance, the discourse marker "so" functions as a topic developer, initiating the turn with a direct question that prompts the interlocutor to validate the speaker's inference.
Upon reviewing the defendant's responses during direct examination, Mr. Martinez proceeds to seek confirmation regarding his understanding of the actual events. While questions and answers are commonplace in everyday interactions, the conventional adjacency pair of "question/answer" can exhibit variations within forensic settings. As highlighted by Gibbons (2008, p. 119), the dynamics in courtroom examinations deviate from typical social interactions, with the prevailing assumption being that lawyers and judges pose questions while witnesses provide responses, barring certain exceptions. Witnesses are typically expected to stay on topic and are generally not allowed to evade answering, except in cases where a response might incriminate them. It is essential to acknowledge that many cross-examining lawyers refrain from posing questions to which they are unaware of the answers.
Upon initial examination, it may seem that the lawyer is attempting to summarize the events to ensure his understanding by asking, "So... after two oâ€™CLOCK... that... you... took everything and put it down in the car correct?" However, his request for confirmation from the interviewee implies a decision-making aspect, rather than a mere comprehension check. The use of the discourse marker "correct" in this context functions similarly to a tag question, seeking discursive approval in argumentative and interactional settings. This approach reveals that the lawyer is constructing his own interpretation of the information rather than seeking confirmation, strategically setting the stage for subsequent questions. Through the combined use of "so" and "correct" in the question, he guides the interviewee towards confirming his version of events, thereby implying the validity of his interpretation. Additionally, the lawyer employs a so-prefaced question, which, as noted by Holt and Johnson (2010, p. 26), serves a crucial role in evaluatory summary and can challenge the interviewee's account, prompting them to reformulate it in a more substantial manner. Holt and Johnson (2010, p. 25) emphasize the transformative nature of such questions in eliciting more significant evidential responses.
Researchers investigating legal discourse, as well as other institutional settings like news interviews, have identified distinct patterns in question design that are linked to specific functions within these contexts. These include and- and so-prefaced questions (Johnson, 2002), formulations (Heritage & Watson, 1979; Heritage, 1985), and reported speech (Philips, 1986; Matoesian, 2000; Galatolo, 2007). These linguistic devices, frequently utilized in questioning strategies (and occasionally in other segments of legal discourse such as the incorporation of reported speech in summarizing arguments), play a crucial role in achieving one of the primary objectives of legal communication: determining the responsibility or guilt of individuals or entities involved.
The discourse marker "correct" serves to align the interviewee with the interviewer's perspective, as posited by Holt and Johnson (2010, p. 34), who suggest that the attorney's questioning strategy aims to elicit simple confirmatory responses. Although Arias does not provide a direct affirmative response as anticipated by Martinez ("Yes, that is correct"), she also does not outright reject his account. By stating "that makes sense," she effectively validates the interviewer's viewpoint, thereby fulfilling his objective of securing her agreement without explicitly confirming it.
When Martinez inquires "pardon?", it appears to be more than just a hearing issue, as the witness spoke clearly and loudly. This could be interpreted as a strategic move on Martinez's part, aiming to prompt the witness to repeat her statement in the hopes of eliciting potentially incriminating information. Subsequently, the witness revises her statement by substituting "having sex" with "otherwise engaged," a more polite and socially acceptable phrase. This linguistic maneuver serves to cultivate a favorable impression, particularly for the jury, showcasing her refinement and decorum. Through this rephrasing, she mitigates any potential negativity and accentuates her desired image of being perceived as respectful. This aligns with Scollon and Scollon's concept of "deference politeness," where she opts for a more courteous and deferential expression compared to her initial choice of words.
In this study, it is important to clarify that the terms "positive" and "negative" are not used in the traditional sense of "good" or "bad," but rather to denote opposing ends of a spectrum. Positive politeness pertains to the interlocutor's inclination towards group inclusion and identification, while negative politeness relates to notions of respect, distance, and deference. Scholars like Scollon and Scollon (1983) have labeled positive politeness as "solidarity politeness" and negative politeness as "deference politeness." Bazergan (2017, p. 40) suggests that solidarity politeness operates on the assumption of minimal interpersonal and power differentials, emphasizing closeness between participants. On the other hand, deference politeness, as described by Scollon and Scollon (1995, p. 44), highlights a sense of equality or near-equality among participants while maintaining a certain level of distance. Consequently, deference politeness underscores the participants' perceived distance, whereas solidarity politeness centers on the shared aspects of their relationship.
Martinez challenges Arias's negative face by attempting to discredit her account of the timing of events and highlighting the imprecision of her statements. By phrasing his arguments as "the way you're saying is... you're saying it could be... six o'clock in the evening and you're telling us it was... surely after after two o'clock," he underscores her lack of specificity, leaving room for various interpretations due to her vague responses. He seeks to point out inconsistencies in her testimony by referencing her own words, further emphasized by the use of the discourse marker "right" (based on that statement right?), with the intention of seeking confirmation.
Coulthard and Johnson (2007, p. 29) posit that in actual courtrooms, lawyers often engage in 'face threatening acts' during witness questioning, which serves to challenge the witness. They further argue that the lawyer's function within the courtroom, especially during cross-examination, enables them to disrupt and exert pressure on the witness in alignment with the interactional objectives of the Crown or State, from whom they derive their authority.
The device employed in her narrative weakens it due to the inconsistent manner in which she delineates the timing of events. Initially stating it was after two o'clock while loading luggage into the car, she becomes notably vague when pressed by Martinez, responding with verbal hesitations such as "Uh" and "well," coupled with uncertain discourse markers like "maybe maybe not," "I guess," and "I don't know." This hesitancy is evident in her responses, indicating a lack of clarity. Furthermore, the prosecutor's question, "And it was surely after two you... did what you were doing?" lacks precision, leaving room for ambiguity regarding the specific action being referred toâ€”whether it was having sex or loading the luggage. The lack of clarity in questions often leads to ambiguous responses, causing confusion among listeners due to the imprecise nature of the dialogue.
The utilization of the formulation prefaced by the discourse markers "and" and "so" is emphasized in the passage, as seen in "And so... when youâ€™re saying youâ€™re not sure." Martinez initiates his formulation with a conclusion: "and so youâ€™re saying," while still maintaining the essence of Arias' statement, essentially reiterating her uncertainty. Subsequently, he challenges her response by inquiring, "you were a little bit more sure under direct examination, werenâ€™t you?" This formulation omits the part of her statement where she expresses uncertainty, transforming it into alternative information that prompts a different interpretation: if she was somewhat more certain previously, why is she uncertain now? Consequently, he persistently probes for precise details that could bolster his arguments, exemplified in the segment "But you were more... sure about the time... do you remember back to you?"
Gibbons (2008, p. 121) highlights the significance of tag questions in courtroom discourse, noting them as "perhaps the most widely discussed type of courtroom question." This observation aligns with the prevailing discourse on the subject.
The initial segment of this inquiry is structured as a declaration, enabling the attorney to present their account of events (the information). The subsequent segment comprises a tag, imposing diverse forms of interactive influence on the witness (the social). Consequently, this style of courtroom interrogation serves as a quintessential illustration of linguistic structure aligning with pragmatic purpose. It is hence unsurprising that a significant portion of queries during cross-examination adopt the tag format, encompassing a variety of tag types - some of which are atypical in everyday conversations.
In Excerpt 3, Mr. Martinez's statement, "you were a little bit more sure under direct examination weren't you?" serves to highlight the stark contrast between Arias's previous assertion of certainty and her current uncertainty regarding the specific timing of placing her items in the car. This temporal detail holds significant weight in the construction of Martinez's accusation, thereby revealing a certain level of coercion in his line of questioning. Generally, closed questions, particularly those requiring yes or no responses, tend to be more coercive due to their limited range of possible answers. Conversely, tag questions, while prompting a yes or no response, can be more persuasive as they may induce a sense of vulnerability in the interlocutors based on the preceding statement. TkacukovÃ¡ (2005, p. 335) supports this notion by stating:
Compared to yes/no questions, tag questions and declarative questions exhibit a strong bias towards eliciting a confirmative response, rendering them more coercive (Huddleston & Pullum, 2002, p. 881-894). Beyond simply coercing witnesses into providing type-conforming answers, these question types offer a distinct advantage to counsels: they are perceived as statements, thereby transforming questions into evidence (Hobbs, 2003b, p. 486â€“87). Tag questions and declarative questions serve as potent tools that allow counsels to present evidence on behalf of witnesses, relegating witnesses to the role of minimal responders. Among these question types, tag questions are regarded by certain scholars (Woodbury, 1984, p. 205; Berk-Seligson, 1999, p. 36) as the most coercive due to their additional pragmatic implication that the questioner is correct. However, Gibbons (2003, p. 101) cautions against placing excessive emphasis on question form alone, as intonation and tone of voice also play a crucial role in determining the level of coerciveness.
Pragmatically speaking, questions that conclude with discourse markers like "correct" and "right" are considered, akin to tag questions, as devices possessing the same illocutionary force. This equivalence is evident in Excerpts 1 and 2, where Mr. Martinez inquires, "So... after two oâ€™CLOCK... that... you... took everything and put it down in the car correct?" and "it was at two specifically it was around two oâ€™clock when you actually put the luggage in the car right?". Drawing on Gibbons (2003, p. 95), Holt and Johnson (2010, p. 25) delineate two primary objectives of questions in legal contexts: "1. eliciting information and 2. obtaining confirmation of a version of events that the questioner has in mind". The instances we are examining appear to align with the latter objective.
The following excerpts were extracted from the reporter's transcript of the proceedings. It is crucial to note that "Q" denotes the questioner (Ms. Willmott), while "A" signifies Arias.
In Excerpt 4, the transformation of the semantic framework is evident as Ms. Willmott reformulates her question regarding the executive director banquet to elicit a general understanding of what occurred, departing from the original specific inquiry. This adjustment in questioning highlights the nuanced nature of courtroom dialogue, where assumptions play a crucial role in shaping responses. This instance underscores the distinct rules governing courtroom questioning, contrasting with the norms of everyday conversation where Arias' response would have been unremarkable. Roca-Cuberes (2014, p. 310-313) further emphasizes the varied analysis of institutional talk across different settings.
Participants in formal settings such as courtrooms, classrooms, and news interviews have been observed to meticulously structure their behavior to reflect and generate the 'institutional' nature of their interactions (Drew and Heritage, 1992, p. 26). This behavior is further shaped by a reduction in the range of choices and potential actions typically present in casual conversations. Paul Drew, in comparing the use of formulations in institutional contexts and everyday discourse, highlights the rarity of formulations in the latter (Drew, 2003). Drew posits that this scarcity is due to the absence of the need for extensive negotiations and compromises in mundane conversations (Drew, 2003, p. 306).
In her attempt to justify Arias' need to provide background information, Ms. Willmott employs the phrase "I donâ€™t believe itâ€™s non-responsive." Opinion markers like "I think," "I believe," and "I assume" fall under this category, typically associated with the first person singular. While these markers generally convey certainty and conviction, they can also indicate uncertainty or potential inaccuracy. In this context, the use of an opinion marker serves as a face-saving strategy, preempting any adverse reactions or misinterpretations from the audience. This approach aims to guide the listeners, particularly the Judge, in interpreting the discourse. By employing such modalization markers, the speaker softens the impact of the statement's illocutionary force. The use of "I donâ€™t believe" not only asserts the speaker's viewpoint but also safeguards their positive face by acknowledging and protecting their opinion from potential dissenting perspectives.
In the example provided, two markers are utilized to allow speakers to expand on their speeches. Additionally, the marker "you know" is utilized for social interaction purposes. These linguistic devices are commonly employed in spoken language and play a crucial role in the flow of conversation. Through the use of the "you know" marker, speakers aim to garner anticipatory approval from their interlocutors, thereby preempting potential disagreements. This subtle linguistic cue encourages listeners to align with the speaker's viewpoint or dissuades those with differing opinions. Essentially, it serves as a preemptive measure by the speaker to avert any potential discord or discomfort in the conversation.
When combined effectively with the time planner marker, the Judge strategically employs the hedge "Well, technically," as a form of mitigation. This linguistic device serves as a hedge by reducing the explicit markers of certainty, thereby diminishing potential threats to the speaker's credibility. By softening the inherent risks in the speaker's assertion, this hedge steers the listener towards a more favorable understanding of the speaker's intentions.
The term "hedge" as utilized in this study was introduced by Brown and Levinson (1987, p. 145) as "the particle, word, or phrase that modifies the degree of membership of a predicate or noun phrase in the set; it indicates that membership is partial, true only in certain respects, or more true and complete than expected." Furthermore, another form of mitigation device can be observed in the phrase "why don't you just restate the question that you technically asked her." This device softens the impact of an imperative verb like "restate," rendering the request more polite and safeguarding the speaker's positive face.
Regarding the use of "I think" and "I donâ€™t think" in Excerpt 5, it is important to note that these expressions serve the same functions as observed in Excerpt 4. They function as mitigation devices, allowing the speaker to lessen their responsibility for their statements. These markers play a crucial role in mitigating and protecting the speaker's face, subtly conveying opinions rich in ideological values and varied interactional goals. Expressions like "I think (that)," "I believe (that)," "I know," and "it seems to me" not only present an opinion but also serve a mitigating function by acknowledging the presence of the interlocutor and reducing the speaker's accountability for their stated opinion. For example, when the Judge states, "so the question frames her answers, I think that itâ€™s appropriate," she is justifying her objection. The question posed is highly objective, requiring a similarly objective response from the defendant to avoid objections. Despite the clear-cut nature of the question, indicated by the interrogative pronoun "what," the Judge employs the phrase "I think" to assert the appropriateness of the objection. This strategic use of language helps soften her responsibility for her statements while maintaining a positive image, potentially being perceived by listeners as a fair judgment.
Another aspect derived from informal conversation is the marker "I mean." In the aforementioned scenario, this linguistic device is utilized by the speaker to steer the listener towards a specific interpretation. This form of metalanguage modalization delves into the discourse practices and the portrayal of speech. By employing "I mean," the speaker highlights the manner in which things are articulated, guiding or redirecting the listener towards a particular intended meaning. Through this marker, speakers endeavor to direct the listener's focus towards a more favorable interpretation. Similarly, with the markers "well" and "you know," we observe the same functions as mentioned in Excerpt 4, along with the hedge "technically."
In terms of formulations, three properties are observed: preservation, transformation, and deletion. The original question, "After leaving that convention, did you have any type of impressions about -- that you learned from convention?", was later reformulated as, "Did you have other impressions having to do with your life and where your life was going?". While the aspect related to her impressions is preserved, the interpretation changes as certain aspects of the original question are deleted (impressions related to what she had learned from the convention) and then transformed (other impressions related to her life and its direction). The question undergoes a semantic transformation, as the defendant is not asked if she has any impressions, but specifically if she has other impressions, focusing on those related to Arias's life and its trajectory. The markers "well" and "you know" reappear in Excerpt 6 with similar meaning effects as described in Excerpts 4 and 5.
In Excerpt 7, Ms. Willmott initially asks, "And this is when?" in reference to Alexander sending a photograph of his genitalia to Arias. In the revised version, she inquires, "When is it that he sent -- approximately when is it that he sent you a picture of his genitalia?" This modification retains a portion of the original meaning while enhancing the question by incorporating additional details and restructuring it for greater objectivity. By maintaining the term "when" from the initial query and introducing new information, Ms. Willmott aims to ascertain the timing of Mr. Alexander's action more precisely. The inclusion of "approximately" within the question serves to safeguard Arias in case her response lacks specificity, potentially preventing objections. This adjustment reflects Ms. Willmott's strategic approach to rephrasing her question in response to Mr. Martinez's objection, ultimately seeking a more accurate and effective line of inquiry.
In Excerpt 8, Mr. Martinez raises another objection, contending that the defendant's response does not directly address the query "What is it that you're learning?". However, in this instance, there is a noticeable absence of a preservation property in Ms. Willmott's revised question; instead, there are evident deletion and transformation characteristics at play: "What was Mr. Alexander's description of premarital, LDS of you want premarital sex". The essence of the original question is entirely replaced and refined into a more specific inquiry. Following several unsuccessful prior attempts to counter the prosecutor's objections, Ms. Willmott opts to rephrase her question in a straightforward manner (a yes/no query), thereby preempting any potential objections to the defendant's response.
Our analysis highlights the significance of formulations in courtroom interactions, as questioners have the ability to selectively preserve, omit, alter, or even add to the statements made by interlocutors. It is crucial to acknowledge that through a textual-interactive perspective on spoken language, one can observe the construction of text and the strategies utilized to serve the interests and objectives of participants within the forensic context.
Based on the findings, it was observed that various techniques were employed in the formulations, including preservation, deletion, and transformation, either individually or in combination. However, the predominant function identified in most instances was transformation. For instance, during cross-examination, the lawyer retained certain words verbatim from the defendant's statements, as seen in the example "that makes sense" in "when you say that makes sense although it makes sense," where the term "that" was preserved deictically in the second occurrence by using a grammatical substitute "it." At other times, the lawyer omitted certain elements of the original meaning, but predominantly, he opted for altered forms in his formulations. By transforming the defendant's words, he presented his own interpretation of her statements, thereby prompting the audience to align with his perspective.
It is crucial to highlight the utilization of so-prefaced questions and the discourse markers "correct" and "right" functioning as tag questions in certain formulations by prosecutors. So-prefaced questions prove to be instrumental in challenging and reshaping the defendant's narrative, exerting pressure on her to reframe it in a manner favorable to the prosecution. Regarding the discourse markers and tag questions mentioned, there is a discernible level of coercion evident in the line of questioning by the cross-examining lawyer. These interrogative techniques tend to be more coercive as they limit the range of possible responses and, from a pragmatic standpoint, suggest that the respondent acknowledges the questioner's presumed correctness.
In our corpus analysis, it was evident that mitigation devices played a crucial role in maintaining the self-image projected by speakers and in eliciting specific effects on their audience. Utilizing hedges like "I think," "I don't think," and "I don't believe," along with markers, helped to mitigate potential adverse reactions or interpretations from listeners, thereby softening the impact of speakers' statements and choices by creating a distance from conflicting judgments or viewpoints, thus safeguarding their positive image. For instance, when the Judge sustained objections raised by the deputy county attorney, she opted for politeness strategies when interacting with the defense lawyer. To temper the force of an imperative statement, she employed the phrase "why don't you just restate" in the context of "why don't you just restate the question that you technically asked her," which functioned as a courteous request that mitigated any potential threat to face.
In both everyday conversations and forensic contexts, the specific context in which questions and responses unfold necessitates the continuous application of facework in verbal exchanges. Given the unpredictability of interlocutors' thoughts and actions, speakers utilize various mechanisms to safeguard aspects they wish to conceal and emphasize those they wish to reveal. Flower (2018, p. 31) posits that facework strategies serve diverse purposes, including preserving, upholding, granting, and potentially challenging one's face.
Politeness strategies serve as important tools for speakers to mitigate the direct impact of their speech acts. These sociointeractional strategies are closely linked to individuals' desires for approval from others and their efforts to maintain autonomy. Within this framework, various techniques such as metadiscursive expressions, evasive forms, paraphrases, and markers signaling different levels of speaker involvement are employed. These linguistic phenomena play a crucial role in shaping interpersonal communication dynamics.
In terms of monitoring information flow, we examine the notion of involvement as outlined by Chafe (1982, p. 47), which involves the speaker's monitoring of the communication channel with the listener to ensure its effective functioning. Speakers can utilize specific strategies to reinforce the content being communicated by drawing attention to key points of the ongoing discussion. Hence, markers such as well, you know, and I mean are particularly suitable for this purpose.
This study adopts a textual-interactive approach to spoken language, positioning itself at the intersection of conversation analysis and forensic linguistics. Our primary aim is to stimulate additional analyses and reflections that can enrich the understanding of spoken texts within forensic settings.
I extend my sincerest gratitude to Professor Dr. Richard Malcolm Coulthard for his invaluable support and contributions throughout all phases of this research.
