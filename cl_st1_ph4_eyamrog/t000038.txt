COVID-19 PERITRAUMATIC DISTRESS INDEX EXPLORATORY 
FACTOR ANALYSIS RESULTS USING A BRAZILIAN SAMPLE 
Alberto Abad1 
Abstract 
We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to empirically derive the COVID-19 
Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) factor structure. Data (peri-traumatic stress during the 
COVID-19). We used data from the Physical and Psychological Reactions as Health Indicators 
Research (Virtual Laboratory of Affective, Cognitive and Behavioral Neuropsychometry – 
LAVINACC). EFA was implemented using a Polychoric Matrix and Robust Diagonally 
Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method. We used the Parallel Analysis with 
random permutation, and as a rotation technique, we used the Robust Promin. The adequacy 
of the model was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), 
Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) fit indices. The Ratio 
Communality Index (RCI) reported (RCI = 0.998452) showed both subsamples have a similar 
amount of common variance. Results showed adequacy of the polychoric correlation matrix 
measured by Bartlett's sphericity (21116.6, (df =   276; p < 0.00001) and KMO = 0.939. The 
overall assessment (UniCo = 0.918; ECV = 0.85), MIREAL = 0.200), suggested that CPDI can 
be treated as a two-factor structure: first factor (internal stressors), second factor (external 
stressors). Replication studies to verify further validity and reliability should be undertaken.

Resumo 
Realizamos uma análise fatorial exploratória (EFA) para derivar empiricamente a estrutura 
fatorial do Índice de Estresse Peri-traumático COVID-19 (CPDI). Foram utilizados dados da 
Pesquisa de Reações Físicas e Psicológicas como Indicadores de Saúde (Laboratório Virtual 
de Neuro-psicometria Afetiva, Cognitiva e Comportamental – LAVINACC). A EFA foi 
implementada usando um método de extração de Matriz Policórica e Robust Diagonally 
Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS). Utilizou-se a Análise Paralela com permutação aleatória, 
e como técnica de rotação, utilizou-se Promin. A adequação do modelo foi avaliada por meio 
dos índices de ajuste Root Mean Square Error of Approach (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis Index 
(TLI) e Comparative Fit Index (CFI). O Índice de Comunalidade da Razão (RCI) relatado (RCI 
= 0,998452) mostrou que ambas as sub-amostras têm uma quantidade semelhante de variância 
comum. Os resultados mostraram adequação da matriz de correlação policórica medida pela 
esfericidade de Bartlett (21116,6, (df = 276; p < 0,00001) e KMO = 0,939. A avaliação global 
(UniCo = 0,918); (ECV = 0,85), MIREAL = 0,200), sugeriu que o CPDI pode ser tratada como 
uma estrutura de dois fatores: primeiro fator (estressores internos), segundo fator (estressores 
externos). Estudos de replicação para verificar mais validade e confiabilidade devem ser 
realizados.

Introduction 
The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is one of the most significant health 
challenges on a global scale this century. By 2022, two years after the outbreak in China in late 
2019, there had been more than 62 million deaths worldwide from COVID-19. As no one can 
predict how the pandemic will evolve, this can lead the population to experience stress, fear, 
and anguish for a long time (Danese et al. 2020). Previous research has revealed a profound 
and wide range of psychosocial impacts on people at the individual levels during the outbreak 
of infection (Abad et al. 2020). People are likely to experience fear of falling sick or dying, 
feelings of helplessness, and stigma (Wang et al. 2020). 
Through 2020 and 2021, the Virtual Laboratory of Affective, Cognitive, and Behavioral 
Neuropsychometry – LAVINACC – conducted the Physical and Psychological Reactions as 
Health Indicators throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic research. Among other indicators, they 
researched the peri-traumatic stress during the COVID-19 pandemics in Brazil using the Peri-
Traumatic Distress Scale (CPDI) (Qiu et al. 2020) to a sample of 1844 participants (Abad et 
al. 2020). 
According to Qiu et al. (2020), CPDI inquired about the frequency of 22 factors (Anger; 
Anxiety; Negative Mood; Irritableness; Exhaustion; Sluggishness; Helplessness; Avoidance; 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4310
Indecisiveness; Sleeplessness; Poor Appetite; Distrust; Physical Symptoms; Bladder and 
Bowel; Obsessive Behavior; Insecurity; Fear; Sadness; Spread Negative News; Social 
function; Lack of Judgement; Attention Deficit). Shanghai Mental Health Center Psychiatrists 
verified the CPDI content validity. The Cronbach’s alpha of CPDI is 0.95 (p<0.001) (Qiu et al. 
2020). This research aims to empirically derive the factor structure of the COVID-19 
Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). 
Method 
Research Design 
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to empirically derive the factor 
structure of the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) (Qiu et al. 2020). We used 
FACTOR, a program developed to fit the EFA model using a variety of procedures (e g., 
number of factors/components to be retained, factor and component analysis, rotation methods) 
(Lorezo-Seva e Ferrando 2013). As a preliminary analysis, the program performed SOLOMON 
(splitting a sample into subsamples in factor analysis) to assess if both subsamples have a 
similar common variance amount (Lorenzo-Seva 2021). 
We implemented EFA using a Polychoric Matrix and Robust Diagonally Weighted 
Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method. RDWLS is advised when the univariate 
distributions of ordinal items are asymmetric) (Asparouhov e Muthén 2010). We used the 
Parallel Analysis with random permutation as an improved method to asses dimensionality. 
We based the decision of dimensionality on the percentage of common explained variance 
(Timmerman e Lorenzo-Seva 2011). As a rotation technique, we used the Robust Promin 
(Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018). 
We evaluated the adequacy of the model using the Root Mean Square Error of 
Approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) fit 
indices. According to Brown (2015), RMSEA values must be less than 0.08, with confidence 
intervals not reaching 0.10. TLI and CFI values must be above 0.90, or preferably 0.95. 
Additionally, We use the H index to assess how well a set of items represents a 
common factor – factor stability – (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018). H values range from 0 to 
1, showing the latent variable strength across different studies (High H values (> 0.80) suggest 
a well-defined latent variable, low H values suggest an ill-defined latent variable) (Ferrando e 
Lorenzo-Seva 2018).

Results 
As a preliminary approach – the sample was over 400 observations (n = 1844) – FACTOR 
performed the SALOMON splitting method (Lorenzo-Seva 2021). The Ratio Communality 
Index (RCI) reported (RCI = 0.998452) showed both subsamples have a similar amount of 
common variance (the closer its value to 1, the most comparable subsamples are) (Lorenzo-
Seva 2021). We have a kurtosis (p < 0.05), which indicates our data do not have a normal 
distribution. Therefore, the Diagonally Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method 
is suitable for categorical data that do not have a normal distribution (Asparouhov e Muthén 
2010). 
Adequacy of the polychoric correlation matrix measured by Bartlett's sphericity 
21116.6, (df =   276; p < 0.00001) and KMO = 0.939 tests suggested the interpretability of the 
items' correlation matrix. Parallel analysis suggested two factors as being the most 
representative of the data (See Table 1).

Unidimensional Congruence (UniCo = 0.918) suggested data cannot be treated as 
essentially unidimensional (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018). Nevertheless, Explained 
Common Variance (ECV = 0.85) was within the limit, as values larger than 0.85 suggests that 
data can be treated as essentially unidimensional. Finally, the Mean of Item Residual Absolute 
Loadings (MIREAL) value (MIREAL = 0.200), lower than 0.300 suggests that data can be 
treated as essentially unidimensional. Additionally, the adjustment indexes which assess 
whether the obtained factor structure is suitable for the database show strong criteria indexes

attesting to the plausibility of this model:  Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA 
= 0.067); Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI = 0.976). 
The Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) proposed to remove one item (21 Recently, 
I rarely talk to my family) (MSA = 0.55089) (Lorenzo e Ferrando 2021). Nevertheless, Pratt's 
relative importance indicator that measures how much each of the factors explains the item’s 
variance showed item #21 is significant for the first factor, therefore the decision was to retain 
the item. 
The quality and Effectiveness of Factor Score estimates  (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 
2018) showed: Factor Determinacy Index (FDI = 0.982) for factor 1, and (FDI = 0.933) for 
factor 2; ORION marginal reliability showed (ORION =  0.964) for factor 1 and (ORION = 
0.871) for factor 2 as factorial score reliability indicators. Finally, the Sensitivity ratio (SR) 
score was for the first factor (SR = 5.200) and (SR = 2.597) for the second factor. 
Discussion 
Our results point out a two-factor structure of the CPDI (Qiu et al. 2020) that could be 
congruent if we consider stress as the physiological or psychological response to internal or 
external stressors (VandenBos 2015). The first factor, internal stressors (items 1, 4, 7, 12, 13, 
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 20, 23, and 24) is suitable for inner manifestations [e g., palpitations, 
sweating, dry mouth, shortness of breath, fidgeting, accelerated speech, augmentation of 
negative emotions, longer duration of stress fatigue (VandenBos 2015)]. The second factor – 
external stressors (items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 22) [e g., any event, force, or condition that 
results in physical or emotional stress (VandenBos 2015)]. Probably, it is advisable to 
reformulate items (5, 6, and 21). Since the present findings are preliminary, further replication 
studies for validity and reliability should be conducted.
