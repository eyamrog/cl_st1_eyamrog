Aim: This study aims to elucidate the application of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as a diagnostic tool in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory settings.
A literature review was conducted on articles published up to May 2020, utilizing a survey across various databases including Scopus, Wiley Online Library, SciELO, DIALNET, EBSCO, MEDLINE, and PubMed. This search retrieved a total of 40 articles of interest that were included in the research analysis.
Development: The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 focuses on targeting specific viral components such as the RNA polymerase dependent RNA, ORF1ab fragments, the E gene, the N gene, and the S gene. It has been observed that nasopharyngeal swabs yield more accurate results compared to oropharyngeal swabs and saliva samples. In cases where there are suspected false-negative results, it is deemed essential to incorporate RT-PCR tests using rectal swabs. Ongoing research efforts are dedicated to refining and enhancing the detection process through the development of new studies and techniques.
In conclusion, the availability of diagnostic tests plays a crucial role in identifying positive cases and tracing the transmission chain. RT-PCR stands out as the preferred test during the active phase of viral replication, while the RT-LAMP assay offers a rapid diagnostic alternative based on similar principles to RT-PCR.
Coronaviruses are classified within the subfamily Coronavirinae, part of the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales. These viruses are characterized by their large size and positive-sense RNA genome, with four distinct genera: alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. Prior to 2019, only six human coronaviruses (HCoV) were identified as causative agents of respiratory illnesses. Notably, two of these strains, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have been associated with infections primarily affecting the lower respiratory tract.
In 2002, a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, attributed to SARS-CoV, posed a threat to 8,098 individuals, resulting in the mortality of 774 patients. The epicenter of the disease was identified in Guangdong, China, from where it disseminated to over a dozen countries. Bats were hypothesized to be the natural hosts of the virus (3,4).
In 2012, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV emerged in Saudi Arabia, with bats identified as the natural hosts and dromedary camels as the intermediate hosts. A total of 2494 cases, resulting in 858 deaths, were reported due to rapid nosocomial transmission. MERS displayed clinical features akin to SARS, characterized by prominent gastrointestinal symptoms and acute renal failure.
In December 2019, the Chinese Government notified the global scientific community about a sporadic outbreak of pneumonia cases lacking a known underlying cause, epidemiologically linked to a wholesale seafood market in Wuhan. On January 21, 2020, Chang et al. documented the initial case of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) in Taiwan, involving a 55-year-old woman who tested positive for a new strain of the betacoronavirus genus through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), specifically Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Following this initial confirmation, the virus rapidly disseminated worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a pandemic in March 2020.
The prompt implementation of diagnostic tests and protocols for virus detection has been a crucial contribution, particularly RT-PCR, known for its proven safety in detecting other coronavirus strains. The utilization of this method, alongside various interventions, has demonstrated its effectiveness in controlling COVID-19 within Chinese borders. The worldwide SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has presented a significant challenge to humanity in the quest for a swift and secure solution to curb the rapid transmission of COVID-19. Precise detection methods are imperative, with RT-PCR playing a pivotal role in this regard.
This study seeks to elucidate the fundamentals of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as a diagnostic tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2.
A literature review was conducted on articles published up to May 2020, utilizing a survey of databases including Scopus, Wiley Online Library, SciELO, DIALNET, EBSCO, MEDLINE, and PubMed. The search terms employed were RT-PCR test, RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and their Spanish translations. This search strategy yielded 40 relevant articles included in this research and published in refereed journals. The use of Boolean operators and tailored search formulas for each database facilitated a streamlined retrieval process, reducing the number of articles retrieved.
A comparison of the genomes of 1,008 SARS-CoV types in humans, 338 in bats, and 3,131 MERS-CoV revealed a high similarity with SARS-CoV-2, showing only 5 nucleotide differences within approximately 29.8 kb. The complete genome sequence of the novel coronavirus (WH-Human_1) was initially published on January 10, 2020. An analysis of the genetic code of SARS-CoV-2 identified discrepancies with SARS-CoV and related coronaviruses, amounting to 380 amino acid substitutions. SARS-CoV-2 contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode 27 proteins, mirroring SARS-like bat coronaviruses.
The assembly of the viral code played a crucial role in advancing diagnostic tests reliant on RT-PCR principles. This process necessitated a specific set of primers to pinpoint distinct sequences linked to variations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, ensuring the prevention of cross-reactions with other viral strains within the same family or alternative respiratory pathogens.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR is a method that detects and quantifies specific nucleic acid sequences through the use of fluorescent reporters. TaqMan and Molecular beacon are the primary probe technologies commonly employed in diagnostic applications. The term "real-time" signifies that the detection of amplified products takes place in every cycle of the reaction, while "quantitative" indicates the ability to measure the amount of DNA present in the sample. This method offers an advantage over conventional PCR as it allows for the monitoring of amplification products in real-time during the reaction, eliminating the need for an agarose gel.
Diagnostic packages for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR primarily focus on targeting specific genes, including the RNA dependent polymerase (RdRp), ORF1ab frames, the envelope gene (E gene), the nucleocapsid protein gene (N gene), and the S gene. To enhance sensitivity in detection, many manufacturers opt to target multiple regions within the viral nucleic acid sequence. Confirmation of diagnosis typically requires positive results for both ORF1ab gene amplification and either N or E gene amplification. However, caution is warranted when utilizing one-step RT-PCR assays that target ORF1b fragments or the N gene, as these may cross-react with other coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and MERS, potentially leading to false-positive results in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.
The German company TIB MOLBIOL GmbH, in collaboration with multiple partners, developed a real-time RT-PCR test by the second week of January 2020. This test is designed to detect viral RNA by targeting the E-gene and RdRp(23) of SARS-CoV-2 specifically (Gene E: 3.2 RNA copies/ 95 % CI: 2.2-6.8) (RdRP 3.7 RNA copies/ 95 % CI: 2.8- 8.0) without showing cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses(24). Additionally, the researchers devised single-step RT-PCR assays to identify the ORF1b frames and N-gene regions of SARS-CoV-2 within a rapid timeframe of one hour and 15 minutes(23).
Chan et al. (25) developed an RT-PCR assay that targeted RdRp/Helicase, demonstrating no cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and exhibiting superior analytical sensitivity (11.2 copies/reaction of RNA transcripts) in comparison to the RdRp-P2 assay. The latter assay, despite having an average viral load of 3.21 × 104 RNA copies/ml, resulted in 42 false-negative outcomes.
A high-performance commercially available test is the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test by Cepheid, USA, which delivers results within 45 minutes using the GenXpert benchtop system. This test necessitates only one minute for sample preparation and targets various regions of the viral genome, specifically the N gene and E gene. In clinical samples, the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test demonstrated a 100% match when compared to other established RT-PCRs, surpassing commonly used diagnostic platforms in the sensitivity panel with a detection limit of 8.26 x 101 copies/mL.
Nasopharyngeal swabs serve as the primary collection method in RT-PCR testing, although they may fail to detect early-stage infections, necessitating a deeper sample obtained through bronchoscopy (27). Bronchial specimens are adept at identifying SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in alveolar lavage fluid, surpassing the efficacy of nasal and pharyngeal swabs (11). In a study encompassing 4880 cases, Liu et al. (28) noted that alveolar lavage fluid exhibited a 100% positive rate for the ORF1ab frames of SARS-CoV-2, outperforming sputum (49.12%) and nasopharyngeal swab samples (38.25%).
Wang et al. (29) found that during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a higher proportion of oropharyngeal swabs were obtained compared to nasopharyngeal swabs. However, the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR in oropharyngeal swabs was only 32%, significantly lower than the 63% positivity rate in nasal swabs. Subsequent research corroborated these findings, with one study (30) revealing that 73.1% of positive cases identified through nasopharyngeal swabs tested negative when using oropharyngeal specimens. This suggests that false negatives may occur when relying solely on samples from the oropharyngeal cavity (19, 30).
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in lower respiratory samples such as sputum or endotracheal aspiration has been reported in 100% of cases, with nasal mucosa showing positivity in 81%, faeces in 69%, oropharynx in 63%, gastric content in 46%, anal mucosa in 25%, conjunctiva in 6.7%, and urine in 6.2%. Additionally, Wang et al. (29) found that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had the highest positivity rates at 93%, followed by sputum at 72%, and nasal swabs at 63%.
In most individuals with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab is typically detected from the onset of symptoms and reaches its peak after approximately one week (13). A study conducted by Wölfel et al. (32) revealed that all patients tested positive for the virus between day one and day five, with none of the 27 urine samples and 31 serum samples showing positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Tang-Xiao et al. (19) estimated that the average duration from symptom onset to a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result is around 20 days. Additionally, in certain instances, viral RNA can still be detected by RT-PCR up to six weeks following the initial positive test (13).
In cases of advanced-stage COVID-19 pneumonia, patients exhibit a significant viral RNA load for SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples, alongside a reduced presence of the virus in the respiratory tract. Historical data from previous coronavirus outbreaks that led to epidemics have highlighted the role of enteric involvement in transmission. Consequently, it is advisable to include screening of rectal swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 in advanced cases of COVID-19, as suggested by existing literature (33,34).
In their study, Wang et al. (35) documented three cases that were discharged after meeting the criteria set by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, only to be readmitted later as positive cases of the virus. These patients primarily exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea and alterations in bowel habits, and were found to have tested positive for the virus in faecal samples despite initially testing negative in respiratory samples.
The authors emphasize the necessity of incorporating diagnostic tests that involve rectal swab collections in instances where respiratory tract samples yield negative results, yet the patient continues to exhibit symptoms indicative of COVID-19.
Salivary glands have been found to express the surface receptor of angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACE2), which plays a crucial role in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells by binding to this receptor. A study by Azzi et al. (37) in Italy involved the collection of salivary samples from 25 COVID-19 patients, all of which tested positive for the virus. Similarly, a study by Williams et al. (38) in Australia found that 33 out of 39 infected patients had positive salivary samples. However, it is worth noting that nasopharyngeal swabs are reported to have higher sensitivity compared to salivary samples.
The reliance on manual settings in the RT-PCR test poses a significant constraint in SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics, particularly in terms of scalability and speed during outbreak situations. Consequently, there is a pressing need for alternative workflows that can facilitate the swift tracking of critical samples. A potential solution lies in the adoption of a fully automated RT-PCR platform that can execute extraction, amplification, and detection of viral genetic material autonomously, eliminating the requirement for human intervention. Examples of such platforms include the NeuMoDx 96 system and the Cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 test.
Diagnostic results obtained from the Cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 automated platform utilizing the Universal Media Transport System (UTM-RT) demonstrated an overall agreement of 98.1% (211/215; 95% CI, 95.0-99.4%) when compared to the LightMix diagnostic package(40). Additionally, when comparing the NeuMoDx 96 automated platform to the Cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 test, a 100% positive match (35/35) and a 99.2% negative match (129/130) were observed(39). The notable advantage of these systems over traditional tests is attributed to the reduced processing time for samples and the minimization of errors in the workflow.
While complete automation of the RT-PCR process, which includes RNA purification, may not be universally feasible due to its high cost, countries can consider adapting strategies to expedite the manual analysis of samples as a viable alternative.
Another approach to enhance the accurate detection and containment of SARS-CoV-2 involves the utilization of a rapid diagnostic test that can be conveniently conducted in field settings and local healthcare facilities, eliminating the necessity for specialized equipment or extensively trained personnel for result interpretation. The RT-LAMP test has been identified as a viable option for this specific objective (41,42).
The diagnostic test yielded positive results within an average time of 26.28 ± 4.48 minutes, as reported by reference 46, whereas the RT-PCR assay typically necessitates one to two hours post viral RNA preparation for result acquisition. Operating on the same fundamental principle of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RT-LAMP distinguishes itself by not requiring thermal cycles that escalate DNA replication, a characteristic of RT-PCR. Additionally, RT-LAMP offers the advantage of operating at a consistent temperature range of 60 to 65ºC. In a study by Lin et al. (43) involving 130 swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples, the RT-LAMP assay successfully identified 58 confirmed cases without any instances of cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens.
Yan et al. (41) designed a set of orf1ab-4 and S-123 primers utilizing RT-LAMP technology, which yielded positive outcomes within 18 ± 1.32 minutes and 20 ± 1.80 minutes, respectively. The sensitivity of the assays was determined to be 2 x 101 copies/reaction for orf1ab-4 and 2 x 102 copies/reaction for S-123, both established at a temperature of 63ºC for a duration of 60 minutes. Through testing with 60 strains of human respiratory pathogens, it was observed that the specificity of the assay only exhibited cross-reactivity with the pseudoviruses, indicating no cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens.
Gun-Soo et al. (42) validated an RT-LAMP assay, demonstrating results within 30 minutes of the onset of the amplification reaction. This process was optimized using the Leuco Crystal Violet colorimetric detection method.
One of the primary constraints associated with RT-PCR and other PCR-based tests lies in mutations occurring within the targeted gene region chosen for primer development. Consequently, it becomes imperative to track mutant sites within the viral genome via comprehensive sequencing to identify potential variations and incorporate them into novel primers for validating new assays.
The availability of diagnostic tests is essential for identifying positive cases and tracing the transmission chain, with the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction playing a significant role. This test demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity, with nasopharyngeal swabs yielding the most reliable results. Rectal swab samples have been deemed necessary in cases where false negatives persist despite symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. The automation and enhancement of diagnostic tests are constantly evolving, with the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification test (RT-LAMP) emerging as a viable alternative.
