Abstract
By analyzing 25,671 journals largely absent from common journal counts, as well as
Web of Science and Scopus, this study demonstrates that scholarly communication is
more of a global endeavor than is commonly credited. These journals, employing the
open source publishing platform Open Journal Systems (OJS), have published 5.8
million items; they are in 136 countries, with 79.9% in the Global South and 84.2%
following the OA diamond model (charging neither reader nor author). A substantial
proportion of journals operate in more than one language (48.3%), with research
published in a total of 60 languages (led by English, Indonesian, Spanish, and
Portuguese). The journals are distributed across the social sciences (45.9%), STEM

(40.3%), and the humanities (13.8%). For all their geographic, linguistic, and disciplinary
diversity, 1.2% are indexed in the Web of Science and 5.7% in Scopus. On the other
hand, 1.0% are found in Cabells Predatory Reports, while 1.4% show up in Beall’s
questionable list. This paper seeks to both contribute and historically situate expanded
scale and diversity of scholarly publishing in the hope that this recognition may assist
humankind in taking full advantage of what is increasingly a global research enterprise.

Recalibrating the Scope of Scholarly Publishing:
A Modest Step in a Vast Decolonization Process
In 2018, Philip G. Altbach and Hans de Wit, two leading scholars of higher education at
Boston College, published “Too Much Academic Research Is Being Published” in
University World News. In making their case, Altbach and de Wit point out that although
“no one knows how many scientific journals there are... several estimates point to
around 30,000” (2018).1 Finding the number excessive, they declare “a crisis in
academic publishing” involving “too much pressure on top journals” and “the rise of
predatory journals and publishers that publish low or marginal quality research.” They
recommend steps be taken to reduce the amount of research published.2 The analysis
in this article not only challenges such journal estimates but calls for a recognition of the
Global South’s research commitment and engagement. The source of this analysis is
25,671 journals that are using the open source editorial management and publishing
platform Open Journals Systems (OJS), first released by the Public Knowledge Project
2 Also in 2018, Gianfranco Pacchioni, Vice-Rector for Research at the University of Milano Bicocca,
published The Overproduction of Truth (2018) on a similar theme (“accompanied by objective data and
findings”) claiming that as a result of the internet, “in a short time the world of research has changed from
the passionate activity of a few selected people to a crowded universe of practitioners, often with few
ideas and sharing little or no ethical values” (p. 4).
1 Just how dated this number may be is suggested by the Library of Congress study of 1963 which found a
global total of 35,000 journals, with 100 titles from Indonesia (Gottschalk & Desmond, 1963).

(PKP) in 2002.3 Our association with PKP, as authors of this paper, is noted in the
Competing Interests statement at the end of this paper.
Earlier studies of what we are calling JUOJS (journals using OJS) located 9,828
journals in 2015 (Alperin, Stranack, Garnett, 2016). A survey of 2,114 of JUOJS staff
members found 97.8% of them to be open access (OA), with 13.6% utilizing Article
Processing Charges (APC) to provide OA (Alperin, Stranack & Hanson, 2017; see also
Edgar & Willinsky, 2010). These results suggest that 84.2% of the JUOJS are “OA
diamond” (which neither charge authors nor readers for access). This result can be
compared to a more recent study which placed JUOJS at 60% of OA diamond journals,
among “at least 17,000, but likely up to 29,000, OA diamond journals” (Bosman et al.,
2021, p. 93). Of relevance to this paper’s section on indexing, Bosman and coauthors
conclude that “even though they are well embedded in academic structures, OA
diamond journals struggle to be properly integrated into the ecosystem of scholarly
publications” (p. 84).
This “struggle to be properly integrated” has a postcolonial history that Altbach
addressed in the “University as Center and Periphery” some four decades ago (1981).
The “peripheral universities" of the “Third World,” he noted, are “basically distributors of
knowledge... dependent on the central institutions for innovation and for direction.” Their
“special problems with developing research capabilities” include “few outlets for
scholarship, creative writing, and research reports by Third World intellectuals” as
3 Founded in 1998, PKP (https://pkp.sfu.ca/) is a research and development initiative at Simon Fraser
University and Stanford University.

“publishers are largely uninterested in Third World authors.”4 Altbach saw this powerful
"colonial educational heritage” a form of “neocolonialism” not easily overcome: “The
odds against a fully autonomous and effective publishing enterprise being developed in
the [African] continent are high” (1976, p. 461). The universities there, he further warns,
“not only have to confront the reality of the historically and economically based power of
the industrialized nations but also… the widespread desire by the industrial nations to
maintain their dominant positions” (1981).5
The pervasiveness of this “intellectual imperialism” – as Syed Hussien Alatas at
the University of Malaya has framed this center-periphery pattern, beginning in the late
1960s (2000) – has also given rise to an “academic dependency” theory of relevance to
this paper.6 Its leading scholar, Syed Farid Alatas, at the National University of
Singapore and the University of Malaya, writes of multiple dependencies afflicting Global
South researchers, including a “dependency on recognition” that leads to “many
6 Syed Farid Alatas on “academic dependency”: “A condition in which the knowledge production of certain
scholarly communities are conditioned by the development and growth of knowledge of other scholarly
communities to which the former is subjected” (Alatas, 2022, p. 18).
5 In 2019, Collyer, Connell, Maia, & Morell observed that “the periphery continues to be a rich source of
raw materials for the mainstream knowledge economy in our time. It produces data for the new biology,
pharmaceuticals, astronomy, social science, linguistics, archaeology, and more. It is, for instance, a key
source of data for modern climate science…. the metropole continues to be the main site of theoretical
processing in the global economy of knowledge” (Collyer, Connell, Maia, & Morell, 2019, p. 10).
4 In other contexts, Altbach addresses “the role and nurturing of journals in the Third World” by observing
that “journals are especially crucial for African scholarly and scientific development” (1998, 2), just as he
holds that universities in the Global South could "play a key national role in terms of training and
sometimes in terms of applied research" (1981).

scholars [being] torn between satisfying the requirements of publishing in high ranked
‘international’ journals, particularly those listed in the [Web of Science], and publishing
locally in their own languages” (2022, p. 20). The JUOJS attest to a certain break with
the recognition dependency, just as these journals address what the Kenyan novelist
and essayist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o identified as a “need to move the center from its
assumed location in the West to a multiplicity of spheres in all cultures of the world,”
which Thiong'o framed as part of a “vast decolonization process” (1991, p. xiv, 3).7
In the first decade of the twenty-first century, Ezra Ondari-Okemwa, an
information science scholar at Machakos University, noted how the region’s shortfalls in
“the technological capability to support electronic knowledge transfer and scholarly
publishing” were matched by the regional publications’ “lack [of] visibility” (2007). What
this means for researchers is summed by PLOS publisher Alison Muddit: “The need to
achieve credibility and visibility within the global research system” means researchers in
the Global South choosing “between a desire to strengthen local platforms and outlets
that better serve local needs and feeling pulled to ‘play the game’ in which norms have
been set by the Global North” (2020; see also Alperin and Rozemblum, 2017).
Against this array of challenges, this paper seeks to bring to light how editors,
publishers, and researchers around the world, and especially in the Global South, have
7 Thiongo’s call for “decolonization” is to be tempered by Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang’s cautionary point
that in the North American context the “metaphorical” use of decolonization to, for example, describe
Eurocentric bias reduction is not the “decolonization [that] brings about the repatriation of Indigenous land
and life” and may “actually further settler colonialism” (2012, p. 1). While the scale and diversity of
scholarly publishing reported here is presented as a break with the colonial past that has yet to be
recognized, the extent to which it may also be furthering colonialism calls for additional studies.

taken advantage of an open source publishing platform to create, against Altbach’s
odds, “an effective scholarly publishing enterprise.” The scale of this enterprise will be
mapped across the principal dimensions of scholarly publishing: (a) country and region,
(b) language, (c) discipline, and (d) indexing. By counting those whose research has too
often been discounted, this paper demonstrates the extent to which scholarly publishing
in the Global South is shifting the assumed center to “a multiplicity of spheres.” This is
enriching what is thought of as “the literature” across the disciplines, although its full
generative potential for research is only beginning to be recognized and realized.
1.0 Data and Sample Selection
The JUOJS employ an optional PKP Beacon, released with the software in 2015, that
enables PKP to notify OJS users of security patches and other software upgrades.8 The
beacon also transmits indexing information about the journal, including the journal’s title,
ISSN, number of items published, titles, and abstracts. This study employed a standard
for “active” journals of five items a year, set by the Directory of Open Access Journals
(DOAJ, 2020).9 The resulting publicly available data set for 2020 was 25,671 journals or
36.5% of the 70,214 OJS beacons operating at the time (Khanna et al., 2021). The
growth in journals using OJS over the previous decade has shown signs of increasing
(Figure 1). The journals in the data set averaged 38.1 items in 2020, for a total of
9 The entire public dataset consists of 70,214 PKP software installations, with 487 instances of Open
Monograph Press and 100 of Open Preprint Systems, in addition to 69,627 journals using OJS.
8 One measure of the proportion of journals using OJS that have an active beacon is provided by the
4,326 journals in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) using OJS, for which it could be
determined that 75.7% transmit data to PKP through the beacon.

996,000 items, while these journals have published a total 5.4 million items since their
inception. An OJS installation, from which multiple journals can be generated, is host to
2.62 active journals on average.

2.0 Country and Region
2.1 Country and Region Methodology
A journal’s country of origin of a journal through a three step process. First, we used the
ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) of a journal to query the LOC ISSN lookup
API for location, which provides us with a MARC code. This MARC code can then be
mapped to a country (Raoni, 2021). MARC codes that map to within-country regions or

states are handled manually to reflect corresponding countries. Second, we extract the
top level domains from the journal URLs and map them to their corresponding ISO
3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. Third, we geolocated the IP address of the journal host
using a weekly updated copy of the GeoLite2 Free Geolocation Data.10

10 Notwithstanding the robustness of our three level checks, this method can generate results skewed
towards the location of hosting servers and data centers, which in itself can reduce visibility of journals
originating in the Global South (Cloudscene, 2022).

The beacon data revealed JUOJS in 136 countries (while a country was not identified for
20 journals). Indonesia leads with 11,535 (45.0%) journals, followed by Brazil with 2,653
(10.3%).11 The top ten countries account for 74.6% of the total (Figure 2).12 Yet the
global distribution of the journals is widespread with pockets of more intense use (Figure
3).

Hawkins, 2022), and the multinational science academies statement “Action Steps for Rebuilding
Ukraine’s Science, Research, and Innovation (2022),” PKP has reached out to the journals’ editors with
strategies for journal preservation involving the Internet Archive, as well the PKP Preservation Network.

compared to a world average of 41% and the next closest country Colombia at 64% (Van Noorden, 2019).

The economic distribution of JUOJS was analyzed using the four World Bank
income groups (Figure 4). By gross national income (GNI) per capita, 81.1% of the
JUOJS are found in the World Bank’s middle income countries, with the 27 low income
countries accounting for only 53 JUOJS (0.2%). This amounts to 81.6% of the journals
coming from countries associated, by national income, with the Global South (Haug,
2021). From a geopolitical perspective, using the five United Nations Regional Groups,
78.1% of the JUOJS are located in three UN regional groups associated with Global
South (Dados & Connell, 2012): Asia-Pacific States (54.7%), Latin American and
Caribbean States (21%), and African States (2.4%) (Figure 5).

3.0 Language
3.1 Language Methodology
To determine the languages of publication for the JUOJS, we ran Google’s Compact
Language Detector v3 (gcld3) on the 100 most recent articles in the ISSN-verified
subset of JUOJS. Gcld3 is a freely available pre-trained neural classifier and has a
built-in flag for language predictions that indicates when the predicted language
classification exceeds an optimal probability threshold. Only reliable language
classifications were retained for each journal. Then, the most frequent language
12
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4729
classification for each journal was designated as the journal’s primary language of
publishing. If gcld3 classified a given journal’s article abstracts as being in multiple
languages (i.e., with at least 5 articles per language), then the journal was designated as
multilingual. Finally, a variety of heuristic checks were applied to verify the primary
language of publishing for each journal, for example, by checking predicted languages
against top-level domains, which resulted in the semi-manual correction of 478 journals.
Two relatively under-resourced languages, Balochi and Faroese, are currently
unsupported by gcld3 and were instead discovered by searching top-level domains.
3.2 Language Results
Language detection software indicated that research was being published in 60
languages by the JUOJS, for which an example journal was found by manually verifying
each language (Table 1). The language classifications for all ISSN-verified JUOJS (n =
22,561), were shared with Google Scholar to extend the scope of its indexing of journals
to additional languages.13
Table 1
Languages of Published Research in Journals Using OJS (N = 25,671)
13 This resulted, for example, in the Google Scholar indexing of the journals Hanken and Balochistaniyat,
which publish in Balochi (an Iranic language spoken in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran). On the other
hand, Fróðskaparrit, which may be the only journal to publish research in Faroese, has yet to be indexed.
As discussed below in the section on indexing, Google Scholar includes the vast majority of JUOJS,
including those publishing in Kazakh, Kiswahili, and Kurdish.

Close to half of the JUOJS published articles primarily in English (49.7%), with
the top ten languages accounting for 97.0% of the titles (Figure 6). By comparison,
Scopus has publications in 40 languages, with the proportion of documents (rather than
journals) in English at 92.6%, followed by 2.8% in Chinese and 1.3%% in Spanish
(Vera-Baceta, Thelwall & Kousha, 2019).

The high level of linguistic diversity among JUOJS calls into question the
common linguistic assumption that “English is the language of science,” as a recent
headline in Nature read (Elnathan, 2021). The reign of English in research and
scholarship only began to take hold in the latter half of the twentieth-century, after
sharing the spotlight earlier with French and German; and while medieval Latin served
as the language of learning in the West, the influx of learning from the Islamic world in
Arabic, through the twelfth-century translation movement, made all the difference
(Hunter-Konos, 2015, Willinsky, 2017, pp. 117-152).

Today, English hegemony is facing challenges in the name of “bibliodiversity,”
which Monica Berger, New York City College of Technology, places at the center of
decolonizing the OA movement in research (2021; Shearer, 2019). A “position
statement” on this question of research and language has been issued by the Chilean
scholar Federico Navarro, La Universidad de O'Higgins, and eleven other faculty from
around the globe, “challenge(s) assumptions made about the use of English as a ‘lingua
franca’ in scientific-academic contexts,” by identifying its deleterious effects on
knowledge production, while arguing for “why we, as research communities in different
fields and regions, should use multiple languages and varieties to promote transnational
dialogue in scientific-academic contexts” (2022). Similarly, Suresh Canagarajah, at Penn
State, expresses his hope this bibliodiversity amounts to a “gradual chipping away at
power, to decolonize writing and scholarship as diverse communicative spaces, which
will complement the parallel activism for large scale institutional and policy changes”
(2022, p. 20). The commitment to such change within scholarly communication is
reflected in the international array of signatories to the 2019 Helsinki Initiative on
Multilingualism.

While the research hegemony of English is present among the JUOJS, another
linguistic feature of this collection is that 48.3% publish in more than one language
(Figure 7). The relationship among the four leading languages can be tracked among
mono- and multi-lingual journals (Figure 8). While monolingual English language
journals represent the largest segment at 6,651 titles (indicated in by single dot under
the first column), the notable bibliodiversity among the JUOJS appears in the next
column with Indonesian-English bilingual journals with 4,431 titles, and
Portuguese-Spanish-English trilingual journals with 550 titles. It is also worth noting that
the use of English may be overestimated, as it is common for titles and abstracts, on
which the language analysis relies, to be translated from other languages into English.
As well, articles do, on occasion, employ multiple languages in their text, for example,
Spanish and Castilian, or Bahasa Indonesia and Javanese.

4.0 Discipline
4.1 Discipline Methodology
To assess JUOJS’ research coverage, the title and abstract of the five most recent
articles published in the ISSN-verified journals were first concatenated, then passed as
inputs to a neural field of study classifier trained on English-language data (Weber et al.,
2020). The use of this classifier required the translation of all titles and abstracts into
English, for which we used the Ubiquitous Knowledge Project’s EasyNMT. The outputs
of the classifier are distributions of likelihood over all classes, meaning that it supports
multidisciplinary classification. But for ease of reporting, each journal was assigned the
single most probable field of study label according to the Australian and New Zealand
18
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4729
Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC). This schema was preferred over others
because of the availability of the data set used to train the neural classifier, examples in
which were labeled according to ANZSRC (Weber et al., 2020). ANZSRC fields map to
the OECD’s Fields of Science and Technology (FOS), but differ from those embodied by
the National Science Foundation’s seven research area directorates. Differences are
mainly found in STEM fields, especially in the pure sciences. The classifier mitigates this
problem of comparison by assigning basic labels such as Chemical and Physical
Sciences, which the NSF classification then groups into broader research fields.
4.2 Discipline Results
The disciplinary distribution of journals reveals that social science research is the
leading area among journals, although the STEM fields – led by the medical and health
sciences, followed by engineering and technology – also play a major role by journal
count (Figure 8). The STEM presence is notable where the expectation is that research
conducted beyond the center represents a degree of cultural diversity that will occupy
the main body of research activity (Figure 9). Where the social sciences and humanities
are assumed to have a local significance that can be well served by researchers on site,
the “universality” of the sciences frees them up for gravitating toward the center, with
these results suggesting a more distributed basis for research in the sciences,
technologies, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

To compare the JUOJS disciplinary breakdown to the profile found in Scopus
(with an overlap of less than 4% between them; see below), one finds a mixed picture.
On the one hand, Scopus has a higher proportion of titles in mathematics and medicine
and health sciences, while the set of JUOJS have a higher proportion in education and
language, communication and culture (Table 2). Yet in other disciplinary areas the
journal coverage of disciplines is roughly comparable between the JUOJS and Scopus
two sets, such as economics, engineering and computer science. One can imagine
more advanced citational studies to determine the extent to which journals in these two
sets draw on the other in their shared disciplinary interests.

JUOJS in its database, based on its use of our data set. EBSCOHost, Scopus,
OpenAlex, DOAJ, and Beall’s List make their respective journal lists publicly available.
Bianca Kramer ascertained the number of JUOJS in ROAD (2022), while SerpApi
generously assisted in assessing Google Scholar’s indexing of JUOJS. With each of the
indexes, we then assess how well JUOJS are represented in the index by assessing
overlap based on matched ISSNs, and/or matched journal URLs and domain names.
The specific matching criteria used for each resource are also reported with Table 3.
5.2 Indexing and Citation Results
As early as 1998, Ann María Cetto and Octavio Alonso-Gamboa, at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), raised the marginalization of Global South
research in the principal journal indexes (Cetto & Alonso-Gamboa, 1998). They found
that the Web of Science’s coverage of scholarly publishing in Latin America and the
Caribbean amounted to 0.5% of the journals indexed (p. 114). Cetto and
Alonso-Gamboa were inspired to join forces with others in the region to form Latindex in
1997, which currently indexes 24,486 journals, as a way of countering what had
otherwise been constructed, in Cetto’s words, as “the large periphery of the present
world system” (1997, p. 40).14
14 Anna Maria Cetto: “We pertain to the large periphery of the present world system, in the economical
sense,in the political sense,and of course in science as well” (1997, p. 40).
23

A quarter century after the Cetto and Alonso-Gamboa study, the Web of Science
Citation Reports includes 1.2% of the JUOJS (Table 3).15 The coverage of JUOJS in
EBSCO and Scopus is only marginally better. Our concern here is with the extent to
which these three databases are commonly assumed to constitute the scientific
literature, with researchers turning to them to write literature reviews and analyze
characteristics of scholarly communication, for example, in the Global South (e.g.,
Cortés, Guix & Carbonell, 2021).
On the other hand, a new generation of indexes, such as Dimensions and
OpenAlex, do much better. They cover 54.3% and 63.8% of the JUOJS respectively, by
relying on automated aggregation of open resources (such as Microsoft Academic
Graph, Crossref, Unpaywall, DOAJ, ORCID, and PubMed). Finally, 88.3% of the JUOJS
are indexed in Google Scholar. This is a result, in good part, of its lead engineer Anurag
Acharya reaching out repeatedly to PKP, beginning in 2004, to improve its indexing of
JUOJS through improvements on both sides. This suggests the deliberate effort needed
to start to overcome the legacy of “the large periphery,” as Cetto put it.

bGoogle Scholar, mapped Jun 2022 using domain name rather than journal URL, does not make its
total journal count available or calculable.
cLatindex analysis includes only JUOJS published in this index’s participating countries (N=6,319).
dAnalysis performed by Bianca Kramer (2022).
eTotal projected from Chen’s (2019) 10% sampling of list’s 1,189 publishers, averaging 42.7
journals/publisher, with 28.5% of publishers no longer online in Jan 2019 with this proportion applied
to the list’s 1,395 standalone journals.
Google Scholar data affords further insight into the JUOJS by offering article-level
citation data (although by OJS installation domain rather than by journal). The 22,679
JUOJS in Google Scholar (June 2022) were hosted on 8,548 OJS domains, with 2.7
journals on average. Each identified domain was accompanied by the first page of
search results, with citation counts for roughly the top ten articles by citation (Figure 10).
This revealed that 34 (0.4%) of the 8,548 journal domains had over 10,000 citations
among their first ten articles. 565 journal domains (6.6%) had over 1,000 citations, and
1,015 journal domains (11.9%) had over 500 citations. But then 547 domains (6.4%) had
no citations on the first page.16 The overall mean for the JUOJS’ first page of Google
Scholar search results is 358.8 citations (median: 50.0).

citation counts were not the result of journals being too recent to have accumulated any citations.

As a further but still preliminary analysis of citation practices surrounding JUOJS,
the most-cited articles in English, Indonesian, and Portuguese were examined for their
citation by JUOJS or by other publications. For the leading English-language article,
which has 16,432 citations and is published in the Journal of Statistical Software, 95% of
the articles citing it come from outside of JUOJS (Table 4). Judging by this one very
successful article, the journal is contributing to the broader research literature. This is
less the case with the top-cited article in Indonesian, published in Jurnal Ekonomi dan
pendidikan, and the top-cited article in Portuguese, published in Outra travessia. These
two articles are cited less frequently than the English leader, with 1,321 citations and
1,408 respectively, with those citations coming to a far greater extent from JUOJS. The
leading Indonesian article had 73.2% of its citing articles in JUOJS, while for the leading
Portuguese article the proportion was 77.7%. This likely reflects the prevalent role
played by JUOJS in these two languages, although still roughly one-fifth of the citing
27

articles come from sources other than JUOJS. Much more systematic work is needed on
this question of citational dynamics in recalibrating scholarly communication, and this
will be the subject of future studies.

5.2.1 Regional Index
As noted above, Latindex is a regional index, which draws on bibliographic data from 17
national resource centers across Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Iberian
Peninsula. Of the 24,486 journals indexed in Latindex, 4,208 (17.2%) are JUOJS. On
the other hand, fully two-thirds of the JUOJS that are published within this
Iberoamerican region are indexed in Latindex.
28
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4729
5.2.2 OA Indexes
The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is an independent organization
supported by libraries, publishers, and others, which accepts journals based on a
thorough review of their adherence to scholarly standards. The Directory of Open
Access Scholarly Resources is operated by the International Center for the registration
of serial publications that manages ISSN (International Standard Serial Number)
registration and accepts data from related sources, such as DOAJ, Latindex, and
Scopus, which accounts for the greater number of journals it indexes and the
corresponding increase in JUOJS that it indexes.
5.2.3 “Predatory” Journal Indexes
The University of Colorado Denver librarian Jeffrey Beall’s designation of “potential,
possible, or probable predatory scholarly OA publisher[s],” for which he began to keep a
list in 2008, has played an outsize role in the discounting of Global South journals. While
we have addressed this issue in some detail elsewhere (Khanna & Willinsky, in press),
suffice it to state here that that there are two prominent lists of so-called “predatory”
journals: Beall managed his publicly available list until 2017, at which time Cabells
began to offer its subscription service Predatory Reports.17 Beall’s 2017 list contains 366
JUOJS (1.4% of the JUOJS), while Cabells’ Predatory Report has 237 (1.0), with the two
lists sharing 82 JUOJS in common.
17 In 2021, Stanford University Library paid $3,500 for a year of Cabells Predatory Reports at our request.
29
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4729
The relevance of this analysis for this study has to do with recent and repeated
assertions that “predatory journals are a global threat” (Oviedo-García, 2021; Bagat,
2021; Shrestha, Timsina, & Subedi, 2021; Grudniewicz et al., 2019; Strong 2019), with
other articles conflating predatory with OA publishing (Krawczyk & Kulczycki, 2021). We
are no less opposed, to be clear, to deceptive and dishonest journals, wherever they are
published.18 Yet the way this is being framed as a global research threat plays into the
peripheralizing world system, bemoaned by Cetto (1997) in the last century, while doing
little to address the problem. What might be more effective, and less damaging to global
science, is to set a publishing standard for the transparency of journal integrity, for which
we’ve begun running initial tests (Willinsky, 2022).
6.0 Conclusion
This paper does not answer the question of how many journals there are in the world. It
establishes, however, that the several estimates of 30,000, noted above, fall woefully
short. Scholarly publishing is taking place on far more of a global scale than is
commonly recognized in such estimates, as well as in studies that rely on the Web of
Science Citation Index and Scopus. Dismissing this global scale out of hand, as too
much research or predatory publishing, seems a less than scientific approach. Rather,
there are grounds for beginning to recalibrate scholarly communication on a decidedly
expanded, but no less rigorous, scale. This can only help the world take advantage of a
18 John Bohannon’s notable experiment in determining deceptive journals, involving the submission of a
hoax study, found 18% of the titles selected from Beall’s list redeemed themselves by rejecting the
submission, among those who accepted it were journals published by Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer, and SAGE
(Bohannon, 2013).

yet to be fully grasped growth of the research enterprise. This growth is about more than
journal counts. It concerns significant bibliodiversity in scholarly communication
reflected, in this case, by the 60 languages in which research is published from 136
countries. It involves changes in scholarly communication economics. There are open
source alternatives to corporate domination of publishing services relied upon by profit
and non-profit publishers.19 The open source platform investigated in this study can be
said, for example, to be driving an OA diamond model of equitable access for authors,
users, and readers across the full range of academic disciplines.20
Still, this study represents preliminary rescaling work in scholarly communication.
It leaves many questions unanswered on how JUOJS operate within the larger world of
research. How are the researchers they publish engaging and contributing to the work of
others? The citation patterns need to be mapped to learn about how this work interacts
within and beyond this set of journals. Is this work contributing, for example, to the
improved efficiency that has been observed in research’s circulation and use.21 Case
21 “Citations are not becoming more concentrated but increasingly dispersed, and one can therefore argue
that the scientific system is increasingly efficient at using published knowledge. Moreover, what our data
20 The OA diamond model challenges “the more salient mechanisms through which the inequalities of
knowledge production between the North and South are maintained,” namely, the corporate sector’s
“market concentration, commodification, and monopolization” of journal publishing (Collyer, 2018, p. 60).
19 That the scale of this alternative has yet to register with scholarly communication is reflected in the
otherwise acute observer Roger Schonfeld noting in his remarks on “keeping [scholarly publishing]
infrastructure independent” that “open source alternatives, including Janeway and OJS… do not yet seem
to have substantially impacted the market share of the commercial infrastructure providers” (Schonfeld,
2022).
31
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4729
studies are called on JUOJS’ influence on policy-making and professional practice. Such
investigations will serve the 2030 goal set by Research4Life, in an encouraging accord
among its 160 “publisher partners,” which is to raise the “profile… and support for the
Global South research publishing industry” (Our vision, 2022, p. 26).
Yet there is something more at issue with the global scale of this publishing
activity that aligns with the point made Achille Mbembe at the University of the
Witwatersrand, in paying tribute to Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o’s re-centering project of the last
century, that “the decolonizing project is back on the agenda worldwide” (2019, p. 18,
original emphasis). Mbembe envisions this agenda transforming universities into
“platforms for the redistribution of different kinds of knowledges” (p. 7, original
emphasis). This, too, is a part of what we have found here, linguistically and
geopolitically. It suggests that another world of scholarly communication – more broadly
global, diverse, and inclusive – is not just possible or on the agenda.22 It is already
underway for the benefit of all.
22 This is inspired by Handel Kashope Wright and Yao Xiao’ observation that “in terms of ontology and
epistemology and indeed the world order, decolonization helps us see that another world is possible”
(2021).
shows is not a tendency towards an increasingly exclusive and elitist scientific system, but rather one that
is increasingly democratic” (Larivière, Gingras, & Archambault, 2009, p. 861).
