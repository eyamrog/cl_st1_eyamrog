The Four-Color Theorem was originated with the coloring of Countries in a MAP and it 
was a challenging problem that remained open since 1853 for more than 170 years. By 
the end of Sec XX, this problem was solved using computational tools but until today 
there is no algebraic proof of it. In this article, the original problem of coloring MAPS over 
a Spherical Surface is briefly reviewed. A Spherical MAP is converted into a Planar MAP 
using polar coordinates and the frontiers of the Countries are described as real implicit 
equations and then deployed from the real space into the complex space. In the complex 
space the rules to color MAPs are described as system of algebraic equations and 
inequations. One example of MAP is solved (colored) and the explanation about why 
these systems are solvable is done. Beginning from the example, a general theory to 
coloring MAPs is derived. As all the transformations used admits inverse, the obtained 
planar MAP solution can be reversed as a solution to the Spherical MAP. All operations 
involve simple algebraic transformations and some Calculus concepts. 

The Four-Color Theorem was proposed in 1853 by Francis Guthrie and received 
attention by great mathematicians for many years and remained unsolved (1), (2), (3) 
until 1976 when a disruptive solution was purposed (4). This solution was firstly refused 
and the employed methodology suffered revisions ex (5), (6) until the work of Gonthier 
(7) was finally accepted. The use of computational tools as a central part of the proof 
instead of the use of pure abstract arguments causes discomfort to the purists even 
nowadays. In the present text, it is used the fact that a constant radius Spherical MAP 
has a biunivocal relation with the (𝜃, 𝜑 ) spherical coordinates. In a (𝜃, 𝜑 ) plane, the 
frontiers of each Country may be described by equations. A selection rule-based in 
clockwise orientation sense is used to choose the positive functions set and based on 
this selection a complex space is generated, converting each positive real equation into 
four complex equations. After this preparation, contour conditions overall connected 
frontier segments are modeled by a system of equations and inequations. This system 
is demonstrated to be cyclic and solvable in one color (the trivial problem, one Country, 
and one-color solution that is not treated) until four colors (the most complicated case, 
which is treated here).   

As known (8, p 123) Polar coordinates transformations (𝑥= 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜑; 𝑦=
𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜑; 𝑧= 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃) establish a biunivocal correspondence between the points 
belonging to a unitary Sphere and their coordinates in the (𝜃, 𝜑) plane. 

Especially for two-variable functions, the Implicit Function Theorem (FIT) (9, p. 480-485) 
guarantees that under mild conditions 𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0 may be reduced to 𝜃= 𝑟(𝜑)  or 𝜑=
𝑟(𝜃). Then, the domain (𝜃, 𝜑) can be decomposed into different Countries using implicit 
functions to define their frontiers as in Fig 1.  

As known from Calculus, to each closed frontier there are always two implicit equations 
𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0   and −𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0 associated with the frontiers. To avoid that two different 
functions delimit a unique region, a positive sign is attributed (here) to the function that 
has a positive sign at the right side of a clockwise dislocation over the frontier of one 
Country. These positive signed functions are named 𝑓𝑝′𝑠. Every  𝑓𝑝 function is unique 
and can be deployed into four different complex functions ( 𝑓𝑝+ 𝑖 𝑓𝑝 , 𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝 , −𝑓𝑝+
𝑖 𝑓𝑝 , −𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝). The four equations ( 𝑓𝑝+ 𝑖 𝑓𝑝 = 𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝 = −𝑓𝑝+ 𝑖 𝑓𝑝 = −𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝=
0) have de same trace in the (𝜃, 𝜑) surface but they have different signs at their right and 
left sides. The functions (𝑓𝑝+ 𝑖 𝑓𝑝, 𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝, −𝑓𝑝+ 𝑖 𝑓𝑝, −𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝) will be denoted as 
( 𝑓+ + , 𝑓+ − , 𝑓− + , 𝑓− −). 

Some definitions and Sub-theorems are important to the subsequent derivations: 

2.1.2.1-) Each real equation (𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0) has only one internal color (a direct 
consequence of the two variable implicit real continuous function and the selection of 
𝑓𝑝 done in 2.1.1). 

2.1.2.2-) The four complex equations { 𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) + 𝑖𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0 ; +𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) −𝑖𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) =
0; −𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) + 𝑖𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0; −𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) −𝑖𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0 } have the same trace in the surface 
(𝜃, 𝜑) (by definition), then every frontier segment may be represented by four complex 
equations. 

2.1.2.2.a) To every segment of a frontier, two of the four complex equations are 
assigned, one associated with the internal (left) side and the other associated with the 
external (right) side of the segment (by definition). 

2.1.2.2.b) Adjacent segments on the external side of any Country represent different 
Countries then they are represented by different complex equations. 

2.1.2.3 -) A continuous, connected (closed), non-self-crossing line (frontier) can be 
subdivided only in an even or in an odd number of segments (by construction). 

2.1.2.3.a -) If a continuous, connected (closed), non-self-crossing line is divided into 
two or more even number of segments, it can ever be colored two colors (by 
inspection). 

2.1.2.3.b -) If a continuous, connected, non-self-crossing line is divided into three or 
more odd number of segments, it can ever be colored with three colors (by 
inspection). 

Algorithm: 

a.) In a selected MAP, put all countries uncolored. 

b.) Enumerate (nominate) all countries. Enumerate all frontier segments (even in null 
measure segments as point r in Fig 1) of all countries according to their Country’s 
boundaries. 

c.) Select a Country M 

d.) Beginning with M, write the associated equation system (for the internal colors) and 
the inequation system (for the external colors) for M and all Countries neighbors of M. 
With this procedure, expand subsequently the equation and inequation system for all 
Countries of the MAP. 

e.) Adopt a color for one Country and solve all the equations and inequations system. 

At the beginning, all equations and inequations have 4 degrees of freedom. In the system 
above, suppose that 1-)  𝑓1.1  ∈ 𝑓++ then 11-) ⇒  𝑔2.1  ∈𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡(𝑓++) =
{𝑓+ −, 𝑓− +, 𝑓− −} . Then suppose that 𝑔2.1 ∈ 𝑓+ − then 5-), 12-) and 1-) ⇒ ℎ3.2 ∈
𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡(𝑓+ +, 𝑓+ −) = {𝑓− +, 𝑓− −}.  Then suppose that ℎ3.2  ∈ 𝑓− + then by 6-), 7-) 
13-) and 1-) ⇒  𝑖4.3 ∈𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡(𝑓+ +, 𝑓+ −, 𝑓− +) = {𝑓− −}.  

With (𝑓1.1, 𝑔2.1, ℎ3.2, 𝑖4.3) determined, all remaining equations and inequations are 
reduced to one degree of freedom and the coloring of the MAP’s is solved. It is important 
to note that the solution to any external contour of  {𝑔2.3; ℎ3.4; 𝑖4.1}  will be realized in one 
of the  {𝑔2.3; ℎ3.4; 𝑓1.1} 𝑜𝑟 { 𝑓1.1; ℎ3.4; 𝑖4.1} 𝑜𝑟 { 𝑔2.3; 𝑓1.1; 𝑖4.1} subsets. In the case of Fig 
2  𝑗5.1, 𝑗5.2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑗5.3  ∈ 𝑓++  . 

Revising the example of Fig 2 is enough to solve the Reduced System of Equations and 
Inequations as presented in Fig 3. 

An initial condition to solve the system is required f. ex. the internal color  𝑓1.1. Then as 
the inequation system 5-), 6-) and 7-) constitute an odd cycle, because of 2.1.2.3-b) it 
requires 3 colors to be solved. After this, all other inequations 8-) to 16-) have 1 degree 
of freedom. In this case there are 4*3*2*1 = 24 equivalent color configurations. For a 
general problem, there are additional colors configurations due to the extra degrees of 
freedom due to the presence of even cycled Countries. 

In synthesis, the “machinery” works, in part, because the external restraints of each 
Country are always reducible to even and/or odd cycles then they can always be solved 
in two or three colors.  

From example 2.1.3-) a general theory can be deduced observing that: 

2.1.5-a) For an 𝑛 Country MAP, the internal 𝑓𝑖.∗ colors of the segments of each Country 
𝑖 are governed by one equation set of order 𝑘  ⇒   𝑓𝑖.1 = 𝑓𝑖.2 = … 𝑓𝑖.𝑘 where 𝑖= 1 𝑡𝑜 𝑛 
where  𝑘 is dependent on 𝑖 (𝑘= 𝑘(𝑖)). 

2.1.5-b) For each 𝑓𝑖.𝑘(𝑖) internal representation there is one 𝑓𝑗.𝑘(𝑗) external 
representation. The 𝑘(𝑖) order of the 𝑖−𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑒 Country is the same order of the 
inequation I set { 𝑔2.1 ≠ℎ3.2;. . ≠𝑜𝑗.𝑘(𝑗) } that governs the external cycle (𝑗= 𝑛) of the  
𝑖−𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑒 Country. 

Then, any MAP is described by a set of Equations and Inequations divided into distinct 
subsets as in Fig 4. 

For an 𝑛 Country MAP there are even and odd 𝑘 order Countries. The subset of 
Equations determines that one color define the (internal) color of each 𝑖−𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑒 Country. 
The subset of Inequations 2 determines that the colors of the neighboring Countries are 
complementary to the (internal) color of the 𝑖−𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑒 Country color. Then the use of 
2.1.5-b) implies that all Inequalities 1 composed by odd order cycles are solved with 3 
colors. Then, the resolution of the MAP system needs one color for each internal color 
(Equation Subset) and 3 complementary colors for the external colors (odd Inequation 1 
subset).  

Finally, it is necessary to prove that the color set that colors one subset is the same set 
that colors others all subsets. For this, suppose that 𝑓∗ exist as a fifth color. Then 𝑓∗ can 
not belong to {𝑓+ 𝑖∗𝑓; −𝑓+ 𝑖∗𝑓;  𝑓−𝑖∗𝑓; −𝑓−𝑖∗𝑓} set then 𝒇∗ is not a real 
function (because every real function can be deployed into four complex 
functions) and this conclusion contradicts the Implicit Function Theorem that 
guarantees the existence of implicit real 𝑓∗ functions in ℛ2 ( ℛ𝑛 ). Then, in this Space, 
𝑓∗ exist as a real function and it belongs to {𝑓+ 𝑖∗𝑓; −𝑓+ 𝑖∗𝑓;  𝑓−𝑖∗𝑓; −𝑓−𝑖∗𝑓} 
set and a fifth color does not exist. 

The Four-Color Theorem has an algebraic demonstration formulating it as an Equation 
and Inequation System. As part of the resolution, the deployment of Real Equations into 
Complex Equations is presented as an innovative view of Real Equations. The technique 
for doing this transformation and the rules for segments enumeration and the solving 
method for the complex Equation and Inequation System is presented as an example for 
this modeling. The consequences of the observations 2.1.2.3.b -), 2.1.5-a) and 2.1.5-b) 
are determinant to the solution. The Implicit Function Theorem was used due to the 
simplicity of the demonstration it gives. A different approach is to divide each segment 
into new real functions or approximate them by piecewise linear functions, splines, besier 
functions, etc and reconstruct each segment and each frontier as the union of these 
functions. With this reconstruction in hand, it is possible to apply the complex deployment 
for the entire set of equations and inequations. The above derivation seems too 
cumbersome and is open as a challenge to the reader. The author believes that the 
deployment of Real equations into Complex equations can be used in theoretical and/or 
applied fields of Mathematics and Physics. As a non-mathematician, the author 
recognizes that the text is too resumed and may require more formalism. There are many 
open opportunities to be explored, even in correcting eventual mistakes did by the 
author.
