This paper presents a sociolinguistic and ethnographic study conducted with young migrants from Timor-Leste residing in a small town in Northern Ireland (CABRAL; MARTIN-JONES, 2017). The research delves into their migration paths, whether through Portugal or England, documenting their proactive approaches in adapting to local settlement conditions and employment while fostering new realms of solidarity and conviviality within the community. Specifically, our focus centers on the realm of sports, particularly nine football clubs established for Timorese men and boys in the Irish locale. We delve into three key facets of the communicative dynamics surrounding these football clubs: (1.) The linguistic, cultural, and semiotic practices entwined in the naming and branding of the clubs, reflecting diverse Timorese identities and global football cultures; (2.) The language proficiencies of Timorese club managers (Tetum, Portuguese, and English), their organizational strategies, ethos, and knowledge bases; (3.) The symbolic importance of scheduling football tournaments around significant dates in Timor-Leste's nation-building history, symbolizing a collective national heritage.
This paper presents findings from a sociolinguistic ethnographic study conducted with young migrant workers from Timor-Leste residing in a small town in Northern Ireland (CABRAL; MARTIN-JONES, 2017). The primary objectives of this research were: (1.) to construct a narrative of the life histories of a select group of these young Timorese individuals, considering their educational backgrounds, previous work experiences in Timor-Leste, and their migration paths from Timor-Leste to Northern Ireland (via Portugal or England); (2.) to record how they navigated the local circumstances of settlement and employment; (3.) to explore the proactive ways in which they established new forms of solidarity and social interaction within their local environments, and (4.) to examine how they utilized various linguistic, cultural, and semiotic resources (including Portuguese) to shape new transnational and transcultural identities within their local contexts.
This paper delves into a specific life world, focusing on the realm of sport, particularly examining nine football clubs established for men and boys within a small-town setting. The study delves into three distinct facets of social, cultural, and semiotic practices evolving around football: (1) the linguistic, cultural, and semiotic practices entwined with the naming and branding of the clubs, reflecting diverse Timorese identities from various regions of Timor-Leste and globalized football cultural spheres; (2) the language resources employed by Timorese club managers, encompassing Tetum, Portuguese, and English, alongside their organizational strategies, ethos, and knowledge bases; and (3) the significance of scheduling football tournaments around pivotal dates in Timor-Leste's nation-building process, symbolizing a collective national heritage.
Our research unveiled the intricate and context-specific methods through which Timorese migrants were shaping their identities within this particular environment, utilizing various linguistic, cultural, and semiotic tools in an active manner. This highlighted the necessity for a reevaluation of the framework and extent of contemporary studies on language, migration, and deterritorialization. While it is crucial to document how language repertoires and practices are influenced by language policies and educational backgrounds in their home countries, equal attention must be paid to the social dynamics linked to reterritorialization, as well as the concept of mooring as described by Hannam et al. (2006), and the communicative behaviors that emerge during specific instances of mooring. Only by simultaneously considering migration and mooring can we gain a comprehensive understanding of how multilingual resources are reshaped in the context of transnational movement and how identities are formed across various social spheres.
The theoretical framework guiding our research stems from the realms of multilingualism, globalization's sociolinguistics, anthropological studies on migration and diaspora, and recent sociological discourse on mobilities and mooring. Subsequently, we delve into the convergence of theoretical constructs across these domains, emphasizing those most pertinent to our investigation. Following this, we explore the expansive temporal and spatial dimensions of transnational population movements originating from Timor-Leste, with a specific focus on recent Timorese migration to Northern Ireland. Our research methodology is expounded upon in the subsequent section, detailing the ethnographic, textual, and photographic data collection methods employed. We then highlight the diverse backgrounds and migration paths of our study participants, elucidating how their communicative repertoires have evolved over time. A comprehensive examination of the local settlement and employment conditions is provided in the subsequent section. The following section scrutinizes nine football clubs, elucidating how linguistic and semiotic resources are utilized in club naming, organization, and branding, alongside the incorporation of cultural assets and knowledge reservoirs by club administrators. Furthermore, we underscore the intricate processes of identification within this sporting milieu and the nuanced local representations of Timorese identity. The concluding sections offer reflections on the research findings and their broader implications.
The late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries witnessed a significant upsurge of interest in globalization across the social sciences. During this period, the sociological and anthropological literature experienced a proliferation of theoretical frameworks and critical analyses concerning the evolving social and cultural dynamics of the contemporary era (e.g. HARVEY, 1989, APPADURAI, 1996, CASTELLS, 2000, HANNERZ, 1996). Scholars highlighted various facets of globalization, including the heightened transnational movement of populations, the rapid advancements in communication technologies, and the reshaping of political and economic landscapes on a global scale.
In the early 2000s, sociolinguists began to play a significant role in advancing research in the field, contributing through empirical studies and theoretical frameworks. Their work helped to delineate the political, economic, and cultural landscape of late modernity, shedding light on how language practices and ideologies shape and validate these conditions. Notable scholars such as Coupland (2003), Heller (2007, 2011), Blommaert (2010), Duchêne and Heller (2012), and Heller et al. (2016) made substantial contributions to this evolving discourse. Our focus lies on the epistemological transformations within the sociolinguistics of multilingualism, highlighting how ongoing debates in this domain influenced our research with the Timorese community in the UK.
Throughout the majority of the twentieth century, the primary focus within the field of sociolinguistics regarding multilingualism revolved around delineating the patterns of language utilization within localized 'communities'—entities that were often depicted as static, uniform, and enclosed. Pratt (1987, p. 60) was a trailblazer in advocating for a shift away from the centralization of the concept of "community" and towards embracing a framework of "linguistics of contact". She contended that such investigations should center on the "modes and zones of contact between dominant and subordinate factions, among individuals with diverse and manifold identities, and amidst speakers of varying languages".
Critiquing essentialised notions of community, a new orientation emerged in the social sciences towards the study of contemporary mobilities. This shift marked a departure from "sedentarist approaches" (HANNAM et al., 2006, p. 5) towards a focus on mobility, deterritorialization, and the intensification and diversification of transnational population movements. Sociolinguists working in multilingual contexts embraced the concept of mobility, adopting new conceptual frameworks. Heller (2011, p. 5-6) emphasized the need to shift attention "from stability to mobility" and advocated for a fundamental reevaluation of theory and methodology in this field. She highlighted the necessity to move beyond the traditional focus on "stable communities" and instead concentrate on tracing the trajectories of various social actors across time and space. This approach allows for an exploration of how the communicative repertoires of these actors are shaped within their trajectories. The notion of trajectory facilitates an understanding of the interconnected dimensions of time and space, moving beyond static analyses. It also enables a nuanced examination of the complexities inherent in contemporary transnational movements, including prolonged stays in different countries and the consequent exposure to diverse language resources and knowledge bases.
In his work on the sociolinguistics of globalization, Blommaert (2010) advocated for a "sociolinguistics of mobile resources" that acknowledges the varied material and symbolic connections formed within global networks. He proposed the necessity of a sociolinguistic examination that portrays linguistic and semiotic occurrences as situated and dispersed across various levels, ranging from the global to the local, with a particular emphasis on investigating the interconnections between these scales.
The development of the mobility paradigm in sociolinguistics and the social sciences has led to a divergence of views. Some scholars (e.g. CRESSWELL, 2002, BRENNER, 2004, HANNAM et al., 2006, URRY, 2007) have critiqued research that solely focuses on mobility and deterritorialized approaches that propose a new overarching narrative of mobility, fluidity, or liquidity as inherent aspects of postmodernity or globalization. These critics argue that any examination of mobilities must also consider moorings and reterritorializations. They contend that forms of detachment or deterritorialization are always accompanied by rhizomic attachments and various reterritorializations, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive understanding of mobility beyond just its surface manifestations.
In line with this body of research, we adopt the perspective that, in our efforts to offer a comprehensive understanding of the lived experience of migration among various social groups, it is essential to consider both mobility and mooring (or even re-mooring) simultaneously, as Hannam et al. (2006, p. 2) articulate: "mobilities and mooring occur dialectically." It is imperative to delve into the historical context of specific migration paths while also capturing the contextualized manner in which mooring (or re-mooring) takes place, alongside the emergence of new social structures, communities of practice (WENGER, 1998), and social activities that acquire significance. Research within anthropology and cultural studies (e.g. BRAH, 1996, FORTIER, 2000, AHMED et al., 2003) has consistently maintained this dual emphasis, offering insights into dislocation and displacement while shedding light on the social and cultural dynamics involved in mooring, reterritorialization, or what Ahmed et al. (2003) refer to as regrounding.
Mooring and remooring in the context of labor migration entail significant agency on the part of the social actors engaged. This encompasses not only securing housing and employment but also locating venues for recreational pursuits linked to their place of origin, as well as strategizing the logistics and leadership of these activities. In the context of remooring, these social processes are inherently iterative in nature.
Situated within the emerging field of sociolinguistics of multilingualism, our research with Timorese migrants in Northern Ireland delves into the intricate interplay between social processes of mobility and mooring, while also examining how language and other semiotic resources (KRESS, 2010) are utilized in the mooring process. Our focus lies on the establishment of spaces fostering solidarity and conviviality within local life worlds, the formation of novel identities and senses of belonging within these spaces, and the varied representations, both online and offline, of Timorese identity that extend far beyond the confines of Timor-Leste. Drawing on Habermas' (1987) concept of "lifeworld" to denote realms beyond institutional structures, we employ the term "spaces of conviviality" in a broad sense, encompassing both the everyday notion of shared enjoyable activities and Gilroy's (2004) idea of potential conviviality in contemporary urban environments where individuals of diverse backgrounds coexist harmoniously, normalizing differences and fostering the sharing and blending of cultural resources across generations.
We acknowledge the intricate connection between south-north migration and global power asymmetries, intertwined with the significant economic transformations occurring in late capitalism. Adey (2006, p. 85-86) emphasizes the relational nature of mobility, akin to power, which is not uniformly distributed. The movement of certain social actors must be understood in juxtaposition with the immobility experienced by others, where relocating from the global south to the north and west often entails a shift in social hierarchy positioning. Duchêne and Heller (2012, p. 15-16) underscore the uneven, boundless, and fluid nature of the landscape, where social actors occupy diverse and varying advantageous positions concerning access to circulating resources.
In our broader research project, we explore the various social spaces frequented by young Timorese migrants involved in our study. While this paper primarily delves into the convivial environments they establish within their local spheres, their construction of diverse identities within these contexts, and their utilization of digital tools to showcase these practices and identities to loved ones in Timor-Leste, our overarching investigation also encompasses their day-to-day encounters in the small-town landscapes they inhabit and their efforts to secure employment in different settings. Furthermore, we consider their positioning within these workplaces, which is influenced by their language capabilities and the reservoir of knowledge at their disposal.
The initial significant exodus of Timorese occurred following the Indonesian invasion and subsequent occupation of the eastern part of Timor in 1975. Many individuals and families sought refuge abroad, often with the aid of the International Red Cross, in pursuit of a more peaceful existence in a different nation. The majority resettled in Australia or Portugal, while some Timorese found sanctuary in countries like Mozambique, which had also been under Portuguese colonial rule. In the 1990s, as the resistance against Indonesian control intensified, numerous Timorese students sought shelter in foreign embassies in Jakarta after participating in student-led protests both in Timor and Indonesia. These students eventually relocated to Portugal, where they received financial backing for their education for several years. Subsequently, some of these students migrated to the UK to work.
Since gaining Independence in 2002, a new transnational movement has emerged in Timor-Leste. A considerable number of young Timorese individuals have been departing the country in pursuit of employment opportunities in countries such as Indonesia, South Korea, Australia, and Western Europe. Following Independence, Portugal facilitated the acquisition of Portuguese citizenship for all Timorese individuals born before May 20, 2002 (the date of Independence), granting them the right to reside and work not only in Portugal but also within the European Union (EU). This provision stemmed from the fact that, according to international law, the eastern part of Timor had remained a Portuguese colony until the country's Independence in 2002. Portugal and the United Nations did not acknowledge Indonesia's occupation and governance of the territory from 1975 to 2002. This political and legal framework played a crucial role in mitigating the high levels of unemployment experienced by young individuals in urban areas of Timor-Leste in the immediate aftermath of Independence.
Many individuals who have availed themselves of the opportunity to apply for Portuguese citizenship have chosen to seek employment in countries other than Portugal, with a notable destination being the United Kingdom. This migration pattern has become more pronounced following the recent economic downturn in Portugal. While there is a lack of official data regarding the exact number of Timorese individuals currently residing and working in the UK, informal estimates suggest that the total figure is approximately 15,000. The financial contributions made by these individuals through remittances to their families in Timor-Leste are of great significance. For instance, in 2008, it was approximated that remittances from the UK to Timor-Leste totaled $5 million annually (SHUAIB, 2008). Given the substantial increase in the number of individuals migrating to the UK, it is reasonable to assume that this figure has since risen significantly, as highlighted by recent studies (McWILLIAM, 2022).
Two primary pathways have emerged for young migrants from Timor-Leste seeking employment in the UK. Firstly, some have opted for the well-established labor migration channels from mainland Portugal and Madeira, predominantly entering the rural sector. Consequently, Timorese migrant workers have congregated in small towns and rural regions of England, such as Devon and Lincolnshire, as well as in Northern Ireland, particularly in County Tyrone. Notably, in Northern Ireland, there has been a proliferation of factories associated with food production, including those specializing in poultry and meat processing and packaging (Doyle & McAleavey, 2016). Conversely, other Timorese migrants have gravitated towards urban centers like Bridgewater, Bristol, Oxford, Peterborough, Leeds, London, and Northwich near Manchester, securing employment within the service industry, encompassing roles in supermarkets, department stores, and online shopping and packing services. Irrespective of their location, these individuals find themselves in precarious positions within the local economy, aligning with Standing's (2010) concept of the expanding "global precariat." Typically engaged through employment agencies, they are expected to adhere to flexible work schedules.
Our initial field visits to Northern Ireland took place in October 2014 and June 2015, where we engaged in participant observation across various public settings such as the Catholic Church in Dungannon and local sports events, particularly football matches, meticulously documenting our observations in field notes. Utilizing still photography, we collected a range of texts and artefacts, including digital sources like Facebook and YouTube postings. Furthermore, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with twelve Timorese men residing and working in Dungannon and Cookstown, primarily conversing in Tetum but occasionally incorporating Portuguese and/or English. These interviews, lasting around an hour each, were all audio-recorded, with six conducted individually and the remainder as group interviews with football team members. The discussions centered on the interviewees' migration journeys and their experiences of settling or resettling within the Northern Irish milieu. The six individual interviewees formed a central cohort of research participants, as detailed in Table 1.
Our participant observation, interviews, and previous research conducted in Dungannon by Da Costa Cabral (2010) collectively indicate a significant diversity among the young Timorese individuals currently residing and working in Dungannon and Cookstown. These individuals originate from various districts of Timor-Leste and communicate in distinct regional languages such as Fataluku, Makasai, and Mambai, alongside Tetum, the predominant lingua franca. The language resources and migration trajectories of the core group of research participants are outlined in Table 1. Notably, all interviewees within this core group, aged between 20 and 45, have received their education, either entirely or partially, in Bahasa Indonesia.
All members of the core group possessed modest material resources when deciding to relocate northward. They had sufficient funds to afford the long-haul flight from Timor-Leste to Europe and sustain themselves financially during their job search.
All members of the core group possessed modest material resources when deciding to relocate north. They had sufficient funds to cover the expenses of a long-haul flight from Timor-Leste to Europe and sustain themselves while searching for employment. For instance, MFB had previously worked in an Indonesian bank during the Indonesian occupation (1975-1999) and later, post-Independence in 2002, he had engaged with a non-governmental organization (Interview with MFB, June 2015). CX, on the other hand, had served as a male nurse with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) during the three-year UN administration (1999-2002) before transitioning to the national health service in Timor-Leste post-Independence (Interview with CX, June 2015). DA had been employed as a driver for a government department after Independence (Interview with DA, June 2015). Lastly, AX had worked as a porter in a warehouse in Dili, handling sacks of rice, and also as a construction worker.
Several of the individuals we interviewed had previously resided in Portugal before relocating to Northern Ireland and resettling there. As a result, they possessed a proficient understanding of the Portuguese language. One interviewee, for instance, had been among the group of students who sought asylum in an embassy in Jakarta during the 1990s. Following this event, he was granted safe passage to Portugal (Interview with HA, June 2015).
In June 2015, two of the individuals we interviewed (RS and HA) were part of the initial wave of immigrants to Dungannon, arriving from Portugal in 2001 and 2002. They secured employment through an agency in Portugal. Another interviewee (MFB) had previously worked in England before relocating to Northern Ireland, gaining prior experience with English in a professional setting. These insights were gathered during interviews conducted in June 2015.
Three young Timorese individuals (RS, HA, and MFB), who had previously resided in Portugal or England before relocating to Northern Ireland, demonstrated a certain level of proficiency and ease in speaking both Portuguese and English. Conversely, those who arrived in the early 21st century directly from Timor-Leste to reunite with friends and family already established in Northern Ireland exhibited limited English skills and virtually no proficiency in Portuguese. Their primary languages were regional Timorese dialects, Tetum, and some Bahasa Indonesia. Similar to the linguistic landscape in Timor-Leste, Tetum emerged as the predominant language for broader communication within the Irish context.
The communication difficulties encountered by recent immigrants when interacting with Irish authorities and accessing social services are apparent in the latest health and social care statistics from Northern Ireland. As highlighted by Doyle and McAreavey (2016), Tetum featured among the top six languages for which interpreter services were requested in the realm of health and social care during the period from 1st April to 30th June, 2014. Over those three months, a total of 24,158 interpreter requests were recorded for 41 distinct languages throughout Northern Ireland.
Labor migration to England has been a consistent trend since the mid-twentieth century, contrasting with the more recent phenomenon of large-scale migration to Northern Ireland. It was only at the beginning of the twenty-first century that Northern Ireland witnessed a notable surge in inward migration. Doyle and McAreavey (2016, p. 52) highlight this shift, noting that between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the number of non-UK/Ireland migrants to Northern Ireland tripled, reaching 4.5% of the local population. This increase can be attributed to two key political events: the conclusion of the Peace Process in Northern Ireland on December 2, 1999, which altered the region's political economy and attracted infrastructure investments, and the accession of Eastern European and Baltic nation-states to the European Union starting in 2004. This EU expansion facilitated labor migration to both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, particularly from Poland and the Baltic States, notably Lithuania (Corrigan et al., 2015; Doyle & McAreavey, 2016). However, with the UK's departure from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the migration route to Northern Ireland from the EU has been closed off.
In the latter half of the twentieth century, only a small number of migrants arrived in Northern Ireland, predominantly settling in major urban centers like Belfast rather than in smaller towns like the focus of our study. Towns such as Dungannon and Cookstown had limited exposure to newcomers until labor migration notably surged in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. Based on findings from the 2011 Census, Doyle and McAreavey (2016, p. 59) highlighted a substantial influx of migrants from diverse backgrounds in specific wards of Dungannon by 2011. They noted that Dungannon, situated in rural County Tyrone, had four wards with migrant levels exceeding 20% collectively and two wards surpassing 30%, marking a significant transformation within a decade. Against this backdrop of demographic shifts, Timorese individuals in our study who arrived in Dungannon in the early 2000s recounted facing pronounced hostility towards newcomers and encountering frequent instances of racist language in the small-town setting. Additionally, they struggled with understanding the local variant of Irish English, as revealed in interviews with RS and HA conducted in June 2015.
However, individuals who reported early experiences of hostility also acknowledged a shift over time due to the influx of other migrant groups from Poland, Portugal, and the Baltic States (Interview with RS and HA, June 2015). The South Tyrone Empowerment Project (STEP), a local nongovernmental organization, played a significant role in this transformation by offering support to migrant communities in various aspects such as housing, interactions with local authorities, legal matters, interpretation and translation services, and healthcare settings. Our field observations revealed visible changes in the public sphere, including multilingual children's books in the public library and the organization of a multicultural festival by the Dungannon Town Council. These initiatives indicated a shift in the community's attitude towards diversity and inclusion.
The majority of rental accommodations in Dungannon and Cookstown consist of houses, with a limited number of apartments available. Due to the high cost of renting an entire house, it is common for single individuals of migrant background to opt for shared occupancy arrangements. Additionally, married Timorese individuals often choose to share housing with family members or friends from Timor-Leste.
Timorese individuals who migrate to Dungannon or nearby towns typically secure employment in one of the local factories, with the largest being Moy Park, which is primarily engaged in chicken processing and packaging for retail distribution. Originally an Irish company, our fieldwork in 2015 revealed that Moy Park had been under Brazilian ownership since 2010, underscoring the increasingly globalized nature of food production in the region. Additionally, two smaller factories in Cookstown specialize in packaging pork and cheese for retail consumption, as indicated in an interview with DA conducted in Tetum in June 2015. Furthermore, there is a rendering plant in the vicinity that focuses on preparing animal feed, as discussed in a joint interview with RS and HA in June 2015.
Two local employment agencies serve as the primary gatekeepers for individuals seeking work. While the initial Timorese arrivals secured employment promptly, with their passage from Portugal even covered (Interview with RS and HA, June 2015), recent arrivals have encountered a prolonged wait of approximately 5-8 months before securing a full-time position. Moreover, there has been a noticeable trend towards increased casualization of employment, leading newcomers to initially receive part-time work on an irregular basis. Reflecting on the insecurity and anxiety endured by himself and his peers over an eight-month period due to the precarious nature of their circumstances, one interviewee shared the following experience: “Ne’ebé telefone ami tau deit iha ulun leten …kualkér tempu deit [sira] liga ona” (We slept with our phones above our heads …they could call us at any time) (Interview with CX, June 2015). For those Timorese fortunate enough to secure full-time positions, the working hours are notably extensive, with twelve-hour shifts becoming the norm. However, overtime compensation has been eliminated, as the current schedule alternates weekly between 5 days of work and just 2 days the following week.
The proficiency in English has become a crucial factor for employment agencies in the selection of candidates. This is evident in the initial screening process where applicants are required to undergo interviews in English prior to receiving an application form. Individuals with a certain level of English proficiency are then positioned into roles of higher responsibility within the workplace, such as assuming supervisory roles or supporting veterinary staff in poultry inspection tasks. These recruitment and workplace practices are contributing to the establishment of a linguistic hierarchy, as discussed by Duchêne et al. (2013). Within this framework, Timorese migrants are undergoing a reevaluation of their language skills, with those who previously relied on their knowledge of Portuguese in Timor-Leste now finding that these skills are no longer as valued in their new work settings.
As demonstrated earlier, Timorese migrants residing in Dungannon and Cookstown have encountered significant social, economic, and linguistic obstacles while striving to secure housing and employment as they establish themselves in these new environments. Simultaneously, within their immediate social spheres, they are actively establishing areas for mutual support and social interaction. By examining how Timorese individuals, both men and women, were anchoring themselves (or in certain instances, re-anchoring) in these compact Northern Irish communities, we gained a profound understanding of their capacity to take initiative in constructing fresh livelihoods in unfamiliar settings, notwithstanding the hurdles they confront.
Within the diverse Timorese population, distinct groups with specific interests have coalesced into communities of practice. For instance, there exists a choir that performs monthly at the Catholic Church and a traditional women's dance troupe. However, the current discussion centers on a specific all-male community of practice that emerged from a shared passion for football, which we encountered during our research.
During our fieldwork in June 2015, we observed and documented three key aspects of the football activities unfolding at that time, shedding light on the involvement of various social actors. The first aspect delves into the naming and branding of the clubs, emphasizing how linguistic and semiotic practices in this realm reflected diverse Timorese identities. Moving on, the second aspect explores the leadership within the clubs and the organizational strategies employed by club managers. We highlight how these individuals leveraged language resources and existing knowledge to drive their organizational endeavors, while also integrating Timorese cultural practices into the club ethos. Lastly, the third aspect centers on the scheduling of football tournaments, particularly around significant dates in Timor-Leste's history. We also discuss the friendly away matches and the utilization of social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube for the representation of all football matches, both in tournaments and friendly encounters.
In October 2014, it came to our attention that there were nine Timorese football teams catering to men and boys in the Dungannon/Cookstown area, as detailed in Table 2. The clubs' names served as markers of the players' identities, drawing from various language resources, including Portuguese. Notably, FC Tahi Calu and FC Moko United predominantly comprised Fataluku speakers hailing from Lospalos in Timor-Leste's Eastern region, reflecting a regional affiliation. Similarly, FC Matebian's players, mainly from the Baucau area and the eastern and central regions, predominantly spoke Makasai, with their club name further emphasizing their regional ties.
The Young Crocs team was established for Timorese boys, aged 14-19, who were residing in Northern Ireland and primarily spoke Irish English. The team's name symbolized their shift towards using English, yet the inclusion of "crocs" hinted at their Timorese identity, as crocodiles are commonly associated with Timor-Leste due to the island's resemblance to the animal. On the other hand, FC Tahi Calu carried various connotations, including gendered ones: Translated as "male sea," the name pointed to the Southeast of Timor-Leste where strong tides are prevalent. Furthermore, it held a masculine undertone as, in Fataluku and Tetum languages, a calm sea is metaphorically referred to as female, while a turbulent sea is termed as male.
The six additional teams comprised adult players from various districts of Timor-Leste, each representing a shared national identity as Timorese. During interviews with the organizers of the Ramkabian club, they elucidated the rationale behind the club's name, which integrated elements from three distinct mountains in Timor-Leste: Ramelau, Kablake, and Matebian. This nomenclature was chosen to underscore inclusivity, the management of diversity, and the fostering of solidarity. One of the organizers articulated the club's objectives, seamlessly blending Portuguese and Tetum languages, emphasizing the goal of fostering strong friendships not limited to the club but extending to all spheres of life. Similarly, FC Lao Rai United operated with a similar ethos, with one organizer highlighting how the football club and participation in tournaments facilitated interactions among Timorese from diverse regions. The club's name, incorporating "Lao Rai" (Travellers), symbolized the collective identity of the players as individuals constantly on the move. AS Bidau, the third club, also embraced an inclusive approach, with its name referencing a linguistically varied neighborhood in Dili. The players in this team boasted diverse language backgrounds, further exemplifying the club's commitment to inclusivity and diversity.
All football clubs bore compound names incorporating elements from regional languages such as Tetum or Portuguese, as well as English. The utilization of acronyms like FC and AS adhered to the broader conventions observed in international football leagues. Notably, FC, denoting "Football Club," was positioned before the club's name, aligning with the word order prevalent in Portuguese league club names. AS, commonly seen in the Italian football league (e.g., AS Milan), was interpreted by one interviewee as representing the Portuguese term Associação (Association). Consequently, for AS Bidau members, AS symbolized the realm of Portuguese football, a domain closely monitored in Timor-Leste.
A variety of semiotic resources were creatively utilized in the branding of each club, with distinct colors and logos contributing to their unique identities. The logos for FC Lao Rai United, Ramkabian, and the Young Crocs are displayed in Figure 1 below.
All of these logos feature imagery that connects them to Timor-Leste. For instance, the logo for FC Lao Rai United incorporates the map of Timor-Leste, while the Young Crocs logo prominently features a crocodile. Additionally, the logos for the Ramkabian and Young Crocs teams include elements such as the star from the national flag and the flag's colors of red, yellow, black, and white. These logos were designed online and primarily served as virtual images that circulated in digital texts.
Color was symbolically utilized in various aspects, including the design of football shirts, jackets, ribbons for medals, and cups, all incorporating the red, yellow, black, and white colors of the national flag. Additionally, FC Lao Rai United had arranged for the creation of a traditional Timorese tais in the colors of yellow, black, and white, with the club's name woven into it. At the conclusion of our interview with club members, we were presented with two tais draped around our necks, a formal Timorese gesture of gratitude. One of these tais is depicted in Figure 2 below.
Our interviews with football club organizers and managers provided insight into the extensive organization involved in running these clubs. The majority of individuals assuming leadership roles within specific clubs demonstrated a proficient level of English communication skills. Moreover, they possessed knowledge regarding UK fundraising practices, as well as expertise in scheduling and coordinating sports events in Northern Ireland. Securing funding for the team and tournaments, booking pitches, hiring Irish referees, and arranging local sponsorships were among their responsibilities. Notably, Ramkabian received sponsorship from a local law firm, while Fitun Unidade was sponsored by a taxi firm in Cookstown. These sponsorships facilitated the acquisition of football shirts, jackets, medals, and cups for players and tournaments. Additionally, two players from the Lao Rai club had previously been part of Timor-Leste's national team, bringing a professional edge to the club's organizational activities.
Some club organisers and managers integrated Timorese cultural practices and values into the management of club funds, as exemplified by the FC Lao Rai club. This practice was brought to our attention during an interview with one of the managers (Interview with MFB, June 2015). During the interview, he seamlessly blended Tetum with Portuguese and English, emphasizing that the football club prioritized the well-being of its players beyond just football-related matters. For instance, the club would contribute funds towards the cost of airfare for players needing assistance to travel back to Timor-Leste, such as for a family funeral. He explicitly referenced the Timorese cultural practice of lia mate, lia moris, which involves customary obligations within extended families in Timor-Leste, encompassing cultural rituals associated with death and life. These obligations and practices are integral to the life worlds of Timorese individuals in Timor-Leste and the diaspora, involving providing support during significant events like funerals, weddings, and christenings. Each member of the Lao Rai club contributed £10 monthly towards club expenses, highlighting a sense of community and shared responsibility. The club manager also observed in English that football clubs had gained significance in uniting people and had notably improved organization in recent years (Same interview with MFB, June 5, 2015).
The football tournaments involving Timorese teams in Dungannon and Cookstown are strategically scheduled to align with significant national and political dates in Timor-Leste, specifically on May 20th, the Independence Day anniversary, or August 30th, marking the decisive Referendum on Independence in 1999. Figure 3 showcases the cup secured by Fitun Unidade during the 2014 May 20th tournament, accompanied by images of the medals awarded to individual players, such as the man of the match or the highest goal scorer.
The photograph on the left depicts the cup adorned with ribbons that are intricately draped around it and tied to the medals. These ribbons bear the colors of the national flag of Timor-Leste, namely red, yellow, and black. In contrast, the photograph on the right showcases the date of the tournament elegantly engraved on the base of the cup, presented in both Portuguese and English languages.
In addition to the annual tournaments, individual clubs organize friendly matches with Timorese teams in various regions of the UK. For instance, in 2014, the FC Lao Rai United football team expanded its range of fixtures and journeyed to Northwich, located just south of Manchester in England, for a friendly match with a Timorese football team. Subsequently, there have been additional friendly matches and tournaments held in locations like Oxford and Peterborough. Images and video recordings capturing these matches, along with the post-match celebrations, are shared on social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. These posts are predominantly viewed and commented on in Tetum by friends and family members in Timor-Leste and by other Timorese individuals residing across the diaspora, including those in the UK, Portugal, South Korea, and Australia. Football garners significant interest in Timor-Leste, evident through the presence of a national team and the participation of a former national team member who played for FC Lao Rai in Dungannon during our research. While football is also played in local schools in Timor-Leste, there are limited resources available to establish regional football teams. The matches of prominent football clubs in Europe, such as the national team of Portugal or regional clubs like Manchester United in the UK, are accessible for viewing on television or online platforms in Timor-Leste. Consequently, the act of selecting and supporting specific football teams has gained popularity among the populace.
Focusing our research lens on the various activities surrounding football clubs provided us with insightful revelations into the intricate and multifaceted processes of identification within this migration context. Timorese identities were being constructed in a manner that intertwined with both historical and contemporary elements. These identities were manifested through the utilization of linguistic tools and a variety of semiotic resources, encompassing images, colors, and various material, textual, and online mediums. As illustrated in Table 2, certain clubs emphasized regional identity while others highlighted inclusivity and a broader sense of Timorese identity. Branding practices, such as incorporating the colors of the national flag in logos (as shown in Figure 1) and on medal ribbons (as depicted in Figure 3), served as markers of national identity. Moreover, some clubs integrated symbols of cultural heritage, such as woven tais and the crocodile image. Additionally, linguistic resources and symbols associated with international football culture were intertwined with these diverse representations of Timorese identity.
Despite the diversity in team-specific identification practices, the annual scheduling of tournaments around significant national dates in Timor-Leste emphasized the shared national identity of players. These tournaments united all clubs in sports events, portraying them as part of a single diasporic community with roots in Timor-Leste. Noteworthy is the regular posting of tournament details on social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube, reaching audiences in Timor-Leste and the diaspora. These digital practices reflect the widespread use of mobile technology within the transnational Timorese community. Additionally, our research reveals that specific migration paths, communication styles, and knowledge resources of Timorese individuals in Northern Ireland empower them to initiate unique group activities, such as football clubs with distinct values or cultural groups focused on Timorese heritage. This environment allows for individual agency within local contexts, fostering solidarity and conviviality through organizational practices that leverage linguistic and semiotic resources. Simultaneously, as they anchor themselves in the new country, a shared sense of history and belonging tied to their nation of origin is also taking shape.
In this paper, our objective has been to contribute to the emerging field of sociolinguistics concerning multilingualism and mobility, with a specific focus on a transnational population shift from the global south to the north and west. The case study of Timorese migrants in Northern Ireland highlights several key points: Firstly, it underscores the necessity of moving beyond mere synchronic description and analysis, emphasizing the significance of historical context in understanding specific migration patterns, the complexities of south/north interactions, and the role of collective memories from past political struggles and national identity symbols in shaping a sense of solidarity and belonging.
Secondly, an orientation towards national identity is often intertwined with other identities among migrants. This may include connections to specific regions of origin or particular urban neighborhoods within those regions.
The case of Timorese migrants in Northern Ireland highlights the significance of utilizing the concept of trajectory as a guiding framework. This approach allows us to emphasize two key processes: firstly, how educational backgrounds, in conjunction with migration paths, influence the communicative skills, language capabilities, and knowledge assets accessible to migrants; and secondly, how individual migrants, possessing specific linguistic repertoires and resources that hold greater value within the local linguistic landscape, can take on leadership roles within the community, fostering local communities of practice and organizing activities centered around sports such as football.
The dual emphasis on mobility and the intricate processes of mooring allows for a nuanced perspective that challenges prevailing narratives of detachment, dislocation, and vulnerability in migration studies. By delving into the contextualized practices of mooring, this approach sheds light on the active agency of individuals involved in these processes. Furthermore, a detailed examination of the linguistic, cultural, and semiotic practices within distinct groups, like the football clubs examined in this study, facilitates a deeper comprehension of the intricate social significances embedded in local mooring activities. This exploration reveals the complex layers of meaning that enrich the understanding of how these practices are imbued with diverse social connotations.
Conducting thorough ethnographic research on the utilization of digital resources for multimodal documentation of familial and social practices in the home country offers a more profound insight into the fluidity of diaspora. Diasporas are not static social entities but rather the result of ongoing communicative interactions and the formation of connections with a homeland focus.
The sole publicly available data on recent migration to Northern Ireland, UK, referenced in this study, is sourced from the article by Doyle, C. and McAreavey, R. (2010), listed in the References. The interviews conducted with Timorese migrants are not publicly accessible due to the sensitive nature of the information contained therein, which could potentially jeopardize the privacy and safety of the research participants.
