Sacubitril/valsartan has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and sudden death in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Consequently, it is crucial to assess the safety profile of this medication in real-world clinical settings.
Objective: This study sought to evaluate the safety outcomes associated with the use of sacubitril/valsartan in patients diagnosed with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who were receiving care at a specialized healthcare facility in Brazil.
Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) from a specialized ambulatory service, classified in functional class II-IV, who were prescribed sacubitril/valsartan based on clinical indications, and followed up for four months. The primary endpoints focused on symptomatic arterial hypotension, hyperkalemia, and decline in renal function. Serum potassium levels, blood pressure readings, and creatinine clearance were assessed at the beginning and conclusion of the follow-up period. Statistical significance was set at a 5% level for all comparisons.
Results: The analysis included twenty-six patients, of whom 57.7% were male, with a mean age of 57.8 ± 10 years and an average left ventricle ejection fraction of 29.9 ± 7.7%. Symptomatic hypotension was observed in 53.8% of the patients, hyperkalemia in 19.2%, and a reduction in renal function in 6.7%. Significant differences were noted from the initial to final systolic (122 ± 24mmHg versus 109 ± 15mmHg; p=0.024) and diastolic (76 ± 18mmHg versus 66 ± 12mmHg; p=0.022) blood pressure levels. However, there was no significant difference in serum potassium levels (4.8 ± 0.4mEq/L versus 5.0 ± 0.3mEq/L; p=0.07) or creatinine clearance (65 ± 23mL/min/1.73m² versus 66 ± 29mL/min/1.73m²; p=0.89).
Conclusions: Symptomatic hypotension emerged as the most prevalent side effect associated with sacubitril/valsartan. A decrease in blood pressure was noted by the conclusion of the follow-up period, with no concurrent decline in renal function or substantial elevation in serum potassium levels.
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a chronic disease with significant morbidity and mortality, impacting more than 26 million individuals globally. The clinical progression of the disease is gradual following diagnosis, despite medical interventions, leading to mortality in at least a quarter of patients within five years. In countries like Brazil and other developing nations, the situation is particularly dire, necessitating the urgent implementation of optimal therapies to mitigate adverse outcomes. The BREATHE registry (Brazilian Registry of Heart Failure - Clinical aspects, care quality, and hospitalization outcomes) has shed light on the real-world national mortality rate of 12.6%, which is four times higher than that observed in countries such as the United States.
Significant therapeutic advancements with prognostic implications in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) have emerged over the years. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) demonstrated their effectiveness in HFrEF by reducing mortality rates by over 30%. Subsequently, in 1997, the utilization of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone, exhibited a notable benefit as an adjunctive therapy for HFrEF. The year 2001 marked a pivotal moment with metoprolol succinate and carvedilol solidifying the indispensable role of beta-blockers in HFrEF treatment, forming a pharmacological triad that remains fundamental in current practice. It wasn't until 2014 that the PARADIGM-HF study unveiled sacubitril-valsartan as a novel treatment option, showcasing a significant improvement in survival outcomes for individuals with HFrEF.
National and international guidelines advocate for the prescription of sacubitril/valsartan to patients experiencing symptomatic HFrEF despite receiving optimal medical treatment. However, potential side effects like arterial hypotension, hyperkalemia, and acute renal dysfunction may limit its applicability in certain populations. Conducting local and regional analyses in HFrEF is crucial for enhancing our understanding of medical therapy in this condition. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the tolerability and safety outcomes of sacubitril/valsartan in HFrEF patients who had not responded to optimized medical treatment.
We conducted an analysis on patients diagnosed with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) who were receiving care at an ambulatory specialized service affiliated with the Brazilian public health system. The study included patients enrolled between April and August 2018, with a minimum clinical follow-up period of four months. Initially, a total of 105 patients were identified during routine appointments at the specialized ambulatory service.
Patients included in this study were 18 years of age or older and had a previous diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), characterized by a left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) lower than 40% as determined by the Simpson method on an echocardiogram conducted within the past two years. These patients were classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV despite receiving optimal medical therapy, which included the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists at target or maximum tolerated doses. Sacubitril/valsartan was initiated based on medical necessity, starting at a dose of 24/26mg twice daily, with potential up-titration to 49/51mg and 97/103mg twice daily within two to four weeks if well-tolerated. In cases where dose escalation was not feasible, the current dose was maintained. Discontinuation of sacubitril/valsartan occurred in the event of serious adverse reactions such as severe hyperkalemia (>6.0mEq/L), acute renal failure, or symptomatic hypotension attributed to the medication, with reinitiation following resolution of the complication. Patients experiencing symptomatic hypotension were managed on an individual basis, with efforts to alleviate symptoms through simple interventions like reducing diuretics or other antihypertensive medications while maintaining HFrEF treatments whenever feasible.
Patients were excluded if their creatine clearance was below 30mL/min/1.73m² as determined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) formula, if they had hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels exceeding 5.5 mEq/L), if their systolic blood pressure was less than 100mmHg, or if they had a documented medical history of allergy or angioedema following the use of valsartan. Additionally, patients were excluded if they discontinued medication without medical guidance and lacked a clinical rationale for cessation, as well as if they failed to attend medical follow-up appointments at the institution for any cause.
Data pertaining to medical evaluations and complementary exams were retrieved from medical registries upon admission and during the four-month follow-up period. The information gathered encompassed demographic details such as age and gender, as well as comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary artery hypertension. Additionally, data on the etiology of HFrEF and the medications being administered (such as ACEI or ARB, beta-blockers, spironolactone, diuretics, and anticoagulants) were documented. Study outcomes, such as serum potassium levels, creatinine clearance, and blood pressure, were routinely monitored by medical personnel post-admission and throughout the follow-up period. Patients were consistently queried about symptomatic hypotension occurrences. Blood pressure readings were taken at each medical appointment, with measurements conducted at least twice in both arms using digital equipment (Omron®). Patients were instructed to rest for five to ten minutes in a seated position, with their back against the chair, legs uncrossed, and feet flat on the floor.
Regular evaluations were conducted on a weekly basis within the initial month of commencing medication, followed by subsequent assessments every 15 or 30 days, contingent upon the specific clinical circumstances of each individual. Laboratory evaluations were scheduled every 30 days in adherence to institutional guidelines, with the possibility of more frequent assessments in the event of complications. Patients who failed to attend appointments were promptly contacted via telephone to facilitate rescheduling and ensure the collection of necessary data.
The safety outcomes assessed in this study included symptomatic arterial hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure below 90mmHg accompanied by symptoms such as syncope, pre-syncope, temporary visual blurring, or dizziness with no other identifiable causes), hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels exceeding 5.5 mEq/L), and acute reduction in renal function indicated by creatinine clearance below 30mL/min/1.73 m² according to the MDRD formula or a serum creatinine reduction exceeding 25% from baseline. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was also considered as symptomatic hypotension. The study compared initial and final average values of blood pressure, serum potassium, and creatinine clearance. Exploratory data analysis was conducted on efficacy outcomes such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and NYHA functional class at admission and end of follow-up, although the study lacked statistical power to detect differences in these comparisons. Additionally, clinical hard endpoints including death and hospitalization due to decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFeRF) were computed.
For the sample size effect, taking into account an alpha error of 5% and a confidence level of 95%, along with an estimated occurrence of outcomes at 30% in the sample over the follow-up period, we determined a necessary sample size of 24 patients with 80% power. Anticipating a potential loss to follow-up of up to 15%, we adjusted the sample size to 30 patients for inclusion in the study.
The study received approval from the institutional Research Ethics Committee under the number 2.618.469 and was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Helsinki Declaration, as well as compliance with resolution 466/2012. All patients enrolled in the study were provided with the medication from the institution at no cost. Sacubitril/valsartan was administered following the institutional protocol, with no additional interventions from the research team. Prior to participation, all patients were required to read, understand, and sign the informed consent form freely.
Categorical variables were presented as absolute numbers and percentages, while continuous variables were expressed as means and standard deviations in cases where they exhibited a normal distribution. Comparative analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 23.0, employing the Chi-Square test, Fisher test, and paired t-student test, with a significance level set at 5%.
During the inclusion period, 31 HFrEF outpatients in ambulatory follow-up met the inclusion criteria and were prescribed sacubitril/valsartan instead of an ACEI or an ARB, with 26 patients (83.9%) completing the four-month follow-up, forming the analyzed sample. The etiology of HFrEF predominantly consisted of ischemic cardiomyopathy or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, with a notable utilization of mortality-reducing medications at baseline. Baseline clinical characteristics are outlined in Table 1. Symptomatic arterial hypotension was observed in 14 patients (53.8%), while hyperkalemia was present in five patients (19.2%) during the clinical follow-up, with no instances of serum potassium levels exceeding 6.0 mEq/L. Two patients (6.7%) experienced a reduction in creatinine clearance greater than 25% from baseline, but none fell below 30mL/min/1.73m². No patients required definitive discontinuation of medication due to blood pressure, hyperkalemia, or acute renal dysfunction. Temporary discontinuation due to symptomatic hypotension was necessary in 11 patients (78.6% of those affected) and due to hyperkalemia in five patients (100% of those affected). No patients needed to discontinue medication, even temporarily, due to acute renal dysfunction. Table 2 details the initial and final mean values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum potassium, and creatinine clearance. Among patients requiring interruption of sacubitril/valsartan for medical reasons, the average duration of maximum dose usage was 78.8 days for those with symptomatic hypotension compared to 77.4 days for those without (p=0.48), and 73.0 days for those with hyperkalemia versus 78.9 days for those without (p=0.65).
The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) upon admission and at the end of the follow-up period were 29.9 ± 7.7% and 34.0 ± 7.8%, respectively (p=0.04). The average NYHA functional class at both time points was 2.1 ± 0.5 and 1.1 ± 0.3 (p=0.01). A significant improvement in functional class was observed in 22 patients (84.6%), with 21 patients (80.8%) achieving functional class I by the end of the follow-up period. There were no instances of worsening NYHA functional class reported. One patient (3.8%) experienced mortality, and another patient (3.8%) required hospitalization due to decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) during the follow-up period.
As a recently approved medication that is still being integrated into the therapeutic arsenal for HFrEF in Brazil, there is a lack of real-world safety studies for sacubitril/valsartan in the Brazilian population. Within our sample, which consisted of refractory HFrEF patients on optimal medical therapy, we noted a high incidence of symptomatic hypotension, albeit effectively managed through straightforward medical and behavioral interventions in the majority of cases. Additionally, we observed to a lesser degree occurrences of hyperkalemia and reduced renal function, both of which did not have significant clinical implications.
Sacubitril/valsartan induces significant vasodilation by inhibiting the degradation of natriuretic peptides, resulting in enhanced natriuresis, diuresis, and systemic vasodilation. In the PARADIGM-HF trial, the sacubitril/valsartan group exhibited a notable decrease in blood pressure after eight months compared to the enalapril group. Symptomatic hypotension was reported in 14.0% of patients on sacubitril/valsartan and 9.2% on ACEI (p<0.001). A French pharmacovigilance study also identified arterial hypotension as the primary side effect of sacubitril/valsartan, affecting 18% of patients. In our investigation, over half of sacubitril/valsartan patients experienced symptomatic hypotension when queried, yet none required permanent medication cessation, and symptoms did not impact the duration of target-dose usage. The heightened incidence of this side effect in our study may be attributed to vigilant clinical monitoring, with active symptom inquiry during medical consultations. Given the recent integration of this drug into clinical practice, this proactive approach was adopted to mitigate potential severe adverse events during patient follow-up. The methodology of questioning and interviewing may have influenced these findings, as some HFrEF patients may tolerate hypotension without significant symptoms, potentially leading to increased reporting of this outcome upon inquiry.
The occurrence of hyperkalemia and elevation of nitrogenous compounds in the plasma is a common occurrence in the natural progression of HFrEF, particularly during episodes of decompensation. In the PIONEER-HF study, it was found that the incidence of hyperkalemia in hospitalized patients was 11.6% for those initiating sacubitril/valsartan compared to 9.3% for those receiving enalapril, with a relative risk of 1.25 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.84-1.84. Even in outpatients, especially those with concurrent chronic kidney disease, the risk of hyperkalemia is heightened. Factors such as advanced age, male gender, baseline hyperkalemia, diabetes, and the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contribute to the predisposition for hyperkalemia. The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which is an integral part of optimal medical therapy, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of death in HFrEF. Our study revealed a slight increase in average serum potassium levels, which did not pose a higher risk of severe outcomes like cardiac arrhythmias, thus not warranting medication discontinuation. It is important to note that initiating spironolactone is not recommended if the baseline creatinine level exceeds 2.5mg/dl or if serum potassium levels are above 5.0mEq/L. Close monitoring of serum potassium and creatinine levels is essential once spironolactone is initiated. Discontinuation criteria include serum potassium levels exceeding 6.0mEq/L or serum creatinine levels surpassing 3.5mg/dl. For potassium levels between 5.6 and 6.0mEq/L, or creatinine levels between 2.5 and 3.5mEq/L, dose reduction and frequent laboratory monitoring are advised.
RAAS blockade can initially induce hemodynamic renal changes without significantly exacerbating glomerular filtration. However, vigilance is crucial as various mechanisms may contribute to decreased glomerular filtration in the context of cardiac and renal dysfunction. In the PARADIGM-HF trial, no significant differences in renal function were noted between the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups (2.2% versus 2.6%; relative risk 0.86; 95% confidence interval 0.65-1.13; p=0.28). These results suggest that sacubitril/valsartan does not appear to have a negative impact on renal function, despite the frequent occurrence of symptomatic hypotension. It is worth highlighting that individuals with a creatinine clearance <30mL/min/1.73m² were excluded from the study, leaving the safety implications of the medication in this specific population uncertain.
Recent therapeutic advancements have been reported in the treatment of Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF), showcasing improved survival rates that were previously unseen in clinical trials. Sacubitril/valsartan emerges as a novel pharmacological intervention for HFrEF, demonstrating a significant reduction in mortality by 16%, cardiovascular mortality by 20%, and HFrEF-related hospitalizations by 21%. With a clinically significant net benefit and a favorable safety profile evidenced in real-world studies, sacubitril/valsartan should be considered a frontline therapeutic option for HFrEF. While tolerability concerns primarily revolve around symptomatic hypotension, a manageable issue often addressed through diuretic adjustments, clarification of fluid restrictions, and patient education on postural and behavioral modifications. It is crucial to account for local and regional variations in pharmacological tolerance due to potential ethnic and physiological differences. Therefore, a focus on promoting therapeutic adherence and the timely administration of life-prolonging medications can significantly enhance both the longevity and quality of life for individuals with HFrEF.
While our study is pertinent to our population, it is important to acknowledge the limitations, particularly the small sample size. Although we observed significant clinical improvements in terms of LVEF and NYHA functional class during follow-up, the study lacked the necessary power for a comprehensive efficacy analysis. It is crucial to note that the research was carried out in a specialized HFrEF center within a medical teaching institution that actively promotes therapeutic adherence through various means like continuous education, family meetings, and frequent medical appointments. Therefore, caution must be exercised in generalizing these findings, as many national public institutions may not have access to similar resources and protocols, potentially leading to higher rates of drug interruptions.
In Brazilian clinical practice, sacubitril/valsartan has been shown to be safe for a high-risk and refractory group of patients with HFrEF treated in a specialized ambulatory service. More than half of the included patients experienced symptomatic arterial hypotension at some point during follow-up; however, no cases required definitive drug interruption. Adverse outcomes such as hyperkalemia and worsening of renal function were less common occurrences.
Understanding the potential adverse effects of medications utilized in the treatment of Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) is a critical focus for multidisciplinary healthcare teams, as it enables them to deliver prompt interventions and implement aggressive, yet safe, therapeutic strategies. Moreover, a significant challenge in the clinical management of HFrEF patients lies in facilitating the utilization of life-saving medications like sacubitril/valsartan.
