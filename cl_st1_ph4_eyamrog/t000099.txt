ABSTRACT – (Initial in vitro plant establishment of seeds and nodal segments from 
bromeliad Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch differs in 
respiratory rates and shoot formation). We aimed to investigate the morphological and 
respiratory differences during in vitro shoot formation from seeds and nodal segments 
(NS) of Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch, due to differences in 
plants obtained by micropropagation. During 35 days of culture, seeds resulted in full 
plants 14 days earlier than NS, with longer leaves and more roots. Nevertheless, NS 
plantlets exhibited shoot multiplication. Peaks in O2 consumption and CO2 release were 
detected at 7 and 14 days for NS and seeds, respectively, suggesting that initial growth 
has a high energetic requirement. However, the respiration peak was higher in NS than 
in seeds, possibly due to high energy consumption required for multiple bud breaks. 
After peaking, respiration decreased, reaching similar values between propagules by 35 
days, indicative of an ongoing increase in photosynthesis in both seed and NS plants, 
possibly due to shoot growth. In conclusion, the development process of NS plants may 
affect the energy and respiratory demand differently than in seedlings.

consumo de O2 e liberação de CO2 foram detectados aos 7 e 14 dias para NS e 
sementes, respectivamente, sugerindo que o crescimento inicial tem alta demanda 
energética. No entanto, o pico de respiração foi maior em NS do que em sementes, 
possivelmente devido ao alto consumo de energia necessário para as múltiplas quebras 
de gemas. Após o pico, a respiração diminuiu, atingindo valores semelhantes entre os 
propágulos aos 35 dias, indicativo de um aumento contínuo da fotossíntese em plantas 
de sementes e NS, possivelmente devido ao crescimento de brotos. Em conclusão, o 
processo de desenvolvimento das plantas de NS pode afetar a demanda energética e 
respiratória de forma diferente daquelas de sementes.

Introduction  
An efficient conservation method for endangered plant species is the 
development of in vitro germplasm banks, since they allow the storage of a great 
number of plants in small spaces, without excessive maintenance as required for plants 
in the field or greenhouses (Imarhiagbe et al. 2016, Oseni et al. 2018). This technique 
can be applied to seeds or tissue explants, such as nodal segments (NS, Pilatti et al. 
2011). The ornamental bromeliad Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) 
Klotzsch (Bromeliaceae) can be propagated in vitro by seeds and NS isolated from the 
stems of elongated plants that are subcultured to obtain new plants (Santos et al. 2010). 
Micropropagation has been used in the cultivation of diverse bromeliads species 
to meet the ornamental plants market demand, which aids in preventing illegal 
extraction (Mercier & Nievola 2003, Negrelle et al. 2012). Due to the possibility of 
maintaining cultures in controlled conditions (light, temperature, nutrients, etc.), this

technique has been used for studies of basic physiology in diverse species (Narayani & 
Srivastava 2017, Bakhshipour et al. 2019, Chetty et al. 2020), including bromeliads 
(Carvalho et al. 2013, Freitas et al. 2015, Andrade & Tamaki 2016, Santos et al. 2017, 
Silva et al. 2017, Andrade-Santos et al. 2020, Silva et al. 2020).  
The cultivation of plants under sealed flasks could lead to restriction of gas 
exchange between the internal and external environment, causing an accumulation of 
gases such as CO2 and O2 inside the flasks (George et al. 2008). Thus, the gaseous 
composition of the isolated in vitro atmosphere reflects the respiratory and 
photosynthetic activities of micropropagated plants (Chen 2006). When plants are 
cultivated under photomixotrophic conditions, defined by the use of high sugar 
concentration in the culture medium, low irradiance, high relative humidity and reduced 
gas exchange due to enclosed vessels, the rate of photosynthesis is diminished while 
respiration is less affected due to the carbon supply (Lucchesini et al. 2001, George et 
al. 2008, Ševčíková et al. 2019).  
The consumption of gases and respiratory activity of seeds and NS would 
inevitably differ since shoot development from each propagule undergo very distinct 
processes: germination involves the imbibition of the seed, followed by increased 
respiration and metabolic activity that result in root emergence from the seed testa (Taiz 
et al. 2017). 
NS lead to shoot formation from an axillary bud meristem that is stimulated after 
apical dominance is broken due to the node isolation from the mother plant (George et 
al. 2008). However, no studies about respiration during in vitro plantlet development 
from lateral buds and how it compares to seed germination were found.  
Considering the developmental differences between seeds and NS, we 
hypothesize that these propagules of A. strobilacea have distinct rates of respiration

during plant formation. Hence, to evaluate our hypothesis, we investigated the 
morphological development during initial in vitro shoot formation from seeds and NS of 
A. strobilacea and the progression of respiratory rates during 35 days by assessing CO2 
and O2 levels inside culture vessels. By evaluating the progression of respiratory rates 
during in vitro plant formation, it would also be possible to detect differences in 
photosynthetic activity between propagules. The obtained results may indicate the 
metabolic state of plants from seeds and NS and provide information on the period that 
plants initiate photosynthetic activity and thus, have higher capability to endure 
acclimatization (Ševčíková et al. 2019). Therefore, this study may aid in the 
improvement of the maintenance of germplasm collections and plant production of A. 
strobilacea, while also presenting the original method of a simultaneous evaluation of 
the time course of the initial development of these kinds of explants during 
micropropagation. 
 
Materials and methods  
Seeds of Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch were 
harvested at the Reserva Biológica de Mogi Guaçu in São Paulo State, Brazil, and 
stored under 8°C for approximately 12 months prior to the experiments. NS were 
obtained as described by Santos et al. (2010). The seeds were surface sterilized in 100% 
(v/v) commercial sodium hypochlorite (2% of active chlorine) containing 0.1% (v/v) 
Tween 20® for 20 min and then transferred to 25% (v/v) of hydrochloric acid for 10 min 
to remove a large part of the mucilage. Seeds were immersed in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 
min, in the fungicide Benomyl 0.1% (w/v) for an additional 15 min, and in 100% (v/v) 
commercial sodium hypochlorite containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20® for 1 h (Santos et al. 
2010). The seeds were transferred aseptically to 250 mL flasks containing 40 mL of

Murashige & Skoog (1962) medium (MS) with 1/5 of the original macronutrient 
concentration (MS/5), 100% of MS micronutrients, sucrose 2% (w/v), 100 mg L-1 of 
myo-inositol, and 0.1 mg L-1 of thiamine. The pH was adjusted to 5.8, and agar (5 g L¹) 
was added before autoclaving for 15 min at 121°C. The seeds were kept in a growth 
room at 25±2°C, 12-h photoperiod and 14 μmol m-2 s-1 to induce elongation of the stem 
axis of the plants (Santos et al. 2010). After three months, NS were isolated from the 
elongated plants (figure 1a) and transferred aseptically to flasks containing 20 mL of the 
same culture media described previously, closed with caps containing a 2-mm hole 
covered by a rubber septum for the harvesting of air samples (Lamarca & Barbedo 
2012). The same was performed for a batch of surface-sterilized seeds. Flasks were kept 
in a growth room under 12-h photoperiod, 25±2 °C and 30 μmol m-2 s-1 irradiance. Plant 
growth evaluation and air samples were analysed during the light period from five 
flasks containing five propagules each at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 35 days.  
The percentage of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the flasks was 
determined by a gas analyser (model ILL6600, Illinois Instruments, Inc., Johnsburg, IL, 
USA) as described (Lamarca & Barbedo 2012). These analyses allow an indirect 
assessment of respiratory activity by the calculation of O2 consumption and CO2 release 
rates. The percentage values of O2 and CO2 were converted to partial pressure of gas 
through the equation: p1 P-1 = v1 V-1, where: p1: partial pressure of gas (atm), P: local 
atmospheric pressure (= 0.9 atm), v1: gas volume (%) and V: total volume (= 100%) 
(Atkins & De Paula 2001). These values were then converted to μmoles of O2 and CO2 
through the equation: p1 V = n RT, where: V: total volume of air of flasks (L), n: 
number of moles of gas, R: gas universal constant (0.082 atm L mol-1 K-1), T: 
temperature (in Kelvin) (Atkins & De Paula 2001).

The following growth parameters were evaluated in 20 plants separated at 
random from the pool of 25 propagules, per period: number of leaves and roots; longest 
leaf and root length. Only roots over 0.5 cm and expanded leaves were measured. The 
selection was performed due to the presence of NS that did not sprout or seeds that did 
not germinate during the experiment. 
For the evaluation of number of shoots per propagule, a separate batch of NS 
and seeds were cultivated in 250 mL flasks containing 40 mL of MS/5 culture media 
and maintained in a growth room under 12-h photoperiod, 25±2 °C and 30 μmol m-2 s-1 
irradiance. Shoot production was assessed every 15 days of in vitro culture up to 75 
days in 15 plants per period (five plants per flask in a total of three flasks).  
 
Results and discussion  
Leaf formation was first detected in seeds at 14 days of culture, concomitantly to 
roots (figures 1d and 2). The same occurred for leaves of NS, although roots were 
detected at 28 days (figure 2). Accordingly, it was reported that Acanthostachys 
strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch seedlings develop roots earlier than leaves 
(Pereira 1988) while in node cultures, shoots are generally formed prior to roots, 
requiring hormonal addition to the media to induce rooting (George et al. 2008) ‒ 
although this is not the case for A. strobilacea (Santos et al. 2010, 2017).  
NS showed shoot multiplication after two weeks of culture (table 1, figures 1b 
and c), which was not present in seeds (table 1, figures 1d and 2e). However, seedlings 
had higher leaf elongation, more and longer roots than NS plants by 35 days of culture 
(figure 2). The more intense root and leaf growth in seedlings might be the result of 
reserve mobilization from the seed, which provides nutrients for the plant until it is 
nutritionally independent (Taiz et al. 2017). Meanwhile, shoot multiplication in NS may

be due to multiple bud breaks induced by apical dominance release after node excision 
from the mother plant (George et al. 2008). 
The O2 consumption and CO2 release rates in seeds of A. strobilacea peaked at 
14 days of culture (figure 3), corresponding to full seedling formation (figure 2). 
Contrarily, respiratory rates in NS peaked at 7 days (figure 3), being five times higher 
than seeds and before the detection of leaf emergence at 14 days. Therefore, we may 
assume that NS showed a more intense and earlier requirement for energy generation 
through respiration than seeds for initiating plant formation. The isolation of nodes and 
apical dominance release stimulates cytokinin accumulation in the excised tissue, 
leading to cell proliferation in the lateral buds and new shoots formation (Souza et al. 
2010, Buchanan et al. 2015, Li et al. 2018). Thus, respiratory activity would increase 
accordingly to provide sufficient energy for cell division during shoot formation and 
multiplication process (Siqueira et al. 2018). Accordingly, it is reported that sugar 
accumulates in NS cultivated in vitro as to promote bud outgrowth and provide 
substrates for respiration to sustain the intense cell division (see review by Schneider 
et al. 2019). A similar pattern was previously described for the bromeliad Ananas 
comosus (Souza et al. 2010). Furthermore, the higher respiration rates in NS than in 
seeds may be due to the multiple bud breaks in the former (table 1, figures 1b and c). 
The peaks in respiration during plant formation may increase the flux of 
electrons in the mitochondria and consequently, formation of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) (Møller 2001). ROS are involved in cell signaling pathways and specific gene 
expression related to seed germination, seedling formation and bud dormancy release 
(Bailly et al. 2008, Kranner et al. 2010, Considine & Foyer 2014). Hence, it is possible 
that the respiration pattern of seeds and NS observed herein is associated with

fluctuations in mitochondrial ROS that directly influence seedling and plant formation 
from NS. 
The O2 consumption and CO2 release rates progressively decreased in NS and 
seeds after peaking at 7 and 14 days, respectively, reaching similar values by 35 days 
(figure 3). This decrease in respiration rate might have derived from an ongoing 
increase in photosynthetic activity due to the development of leaves and multiple shoots 
in seeds and NS, respectively, and due to depletion of the carbon source of the media. 
Overall, in vitro plants cultivated under photomixotrophic conditions as in the present 
study show photosynthetic activity, although at lower rates than respiration (Ševčíková 
et al. 2019). It has been reported that protocorm-like bodies of the Cymbidium Melody 
Fair 'Marilyn Monroe' orchid showed an increase in photosynthetic rates concomitant to 
decreases in respiration between 20 and 60 days of in vitro culture in MS medium 
containing 2% sucrose (Ogasawara et al. 1995). Studies also indicate that an increase in 
photosynthesis can lead to higher cytosolic ATP/ADP rates, inhibiting respiration 
(Krömer 1995; Buchanan et al. 2015). The decrease in O2 consumption observed herein 
may also reflect the cellular energy demand, which was possibly lower after seedling 
establishment and full morphogenesis in NS plants - both highly energetic processes 
(Yaseen et al. 2012, Taiz et al. 2017). Finally, the occurrence of some photosynthetic 
capacity observed in seed and NS plants by 35 days would possibly facilitate ex vitro 
acclimatization at that period (Ševčíková et al. 2019). Indeed, our research group 
observed a 100% survival rate after transplanting one-month-old A. strobilacea 
seedlings (De Carvalho et al. 2014) and NS plants (unpublished data) to Pinus bark 
substrate, under the same environmental conditions described. 
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to compare the time course of in 
vitro plant development from distinct propagules simultaneously. This approach

allowed us to conclude that the developmental process of NS plants formation may 
affect the cell energy demand and, thus, respiration activity differently than in seedlings. 
Nevertheless, both seeds and NS plants of A. strobilacea can form viable plants with 
leaves and roots in a short period of time, which broadens the applicability of in vitro 
culture for both conservation and commercial production of this species. Indeed, the use 
of seeds ensures genetic variability, desirable for germplasm conservation (Pence 2010), 
while the shoot multiplication in NS enables a large-scale clone production, which is of 
considerable value for commercial production aiming at the ornamental plants market 
(Kyte et al. 2013).  
Finally, considering the involvement of mitochondrial ROS production and 
carbohydrate mobilization in seed germination and bud outgrowth (Considine & Foyer 
2014, Taiz et al. 2017, Signorelli et al. 2018), it may be valuable to investigate the 
effects of redox status and carbohydrate composition during shoot generation from 
seeds and NS of A. strobilacea to provide more insight on the developmental 
discrepancies between them.
