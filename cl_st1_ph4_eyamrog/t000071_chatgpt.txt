Approaching the book on "predatory practices in scholarly communication," we, as members of a project focused on developing journal publishing platforms and conducting research on open science, delve into a chapter analyzing a cohort of 521 journals utilizing our platform that are also featured on one or both of the prominent lists of journals categorized as "predatory." One of these lists, encompassing 30,968 journals affiliated with "potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers," was curated by University of Colorado Denver librarian Jeffrey Beall until 2017 (Beall’s list, n.d.). The other list, compiled post-2017 and comprising 15,470 titles identified as potential threats, is Cabells Predatory Reports (Cabells, n.d.). These publishers and journals are believed to exploit researchers by enticing them to pay an "article processing charge" (APC) to publish in what essentially amounts to a facade of an open-access scholarly journal. The term "presumed to prey" is used due to the inherent challenge faced by Beall, Cabells, and other observers in ascertaining whether a journal adheres to scholarly standards like peer review. This challenge is rooted in the historical development of journals, often originating from scholarly societies and groups composed of trusted colleagues (Csiszar, 2020), where editorial transparency was not a concern beyond the presence of respected names on the masthead. With the advent of the internet and open access, the global dissemination of research has expanded, providing a veil for deceptive practices to thrive under the guise of tradition and trust. Beall and Cabells rely on indicators like unprofessional websites, incomplete mastheads, exaggerated claims, and email spamming as proxies for identifying potential threats to scholarly integrity in the absence of direct access to a journal's editorial processes.
Predatory proxies present a significant challenge, often extending to reputable journals, including top-tier publications (Olivarez et al., 2018). This association sometimes leads to the misconception of equating predatory practices solely with open access publishing, influenced by Beall's vocal opposition to open access (Beall, 2013; Krawczyk & Kulczycki, 2021). Direct evaluations of journals' adherence to peer-review standards have yielded mixed results. For instance, Cobey et al. (2019) discovered that 83.3 percent of authors publishing in Beall-listed journals believed their work underwent peer review, a concerning statistic. Journalist John Bohannon's experiment submitting a hoax paper to 304 journals revealed that 18 percent of these journals, including reputable publishers like Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer, and SAGE, accepted the flawed paper (2013). Some researchers exploit predatory journals for personal gain, such as increased compensation and research awards (Demir, 2018; Pyne, 2017). Despite these cautionary tales, the prevailing sentiment is that predatory journals pose a global threat, as highlighted by 35 scholars in Nature (Grudniewicz et al., 2019), potentially hindering the positive global expansion of research. The scholarly publishing industry has responded with initiatives like "Think. Check. Submit." advising authors to submit to trusted, indexed journals affiliated with recognized organizations. While acknowledging that some well-meaning journals may be mislabeled as predatory due to resource constraints, the overarching concern remains the rise of predatory publishing in the era of increased research output. Our study, conducted in three phases, aims to address the issue of fake journals and mislabeling by focusing on 521 journals identified as "predatory" by Beall and/or Cabells, utilizing the Open Journal Systems (OJS) platform. Stanford University's subscription to Cabells Predatory Reports in 2021 facilitated our research, alongside our affiliation with the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) at Simon Fraser University and Stanford University. We disclose potential conflicts of interest and a commitment to responsible investigation in our exploration of these journals.
Our research findings directly impact the reputation of PKP's software and its users in academic journals, aligning with the project's aim of supporting open access to research as a fundamental right and enhancing the quality of scholarly work. The data sourced from OJS journals in our analysis are openly accessible for reproducibility and further investigation, serving as a safeguard against potential biases (Khanna et al., 2021). A significant conflict of interest arises from the commitment of open source software projects like OJS to uphold users' "freedom to run the program for any purpose," as defined in common open source principles (Wheeler, n.d.). However, rather than adopting a hands-off approach, we are willing to intervene responsibly to evaluate and influence OJS's role in combating predatory practices. Our objective is to explore how developers of open source software and infrastructure platforms can contribute to addressing this critical issue.
Our intervention comprises two main components: firstly, we offer guidance to publications utilizing OJS that have been flagged as predatory, aiming to address the underlying issues contributing to this classification and enhance their scholarly publishing standards. Secondly, we are in the process of integrating verification technologies and communication strategies into publishing platforms, enabling readers to make more informed assessments of journal credibility. The overarching objective is to mitigate the confusion and negative impact generated by predatory practices in scholarly communication, while simultaneously elevating the overall quality of academic publishing. While assisting these publications may inadvertently empower unscrupulous entities to deceive more authors and readers, we weigh this risk against the consequences of disregarding a significant body of legitimate research and impeding advancements in combatting deceptive practices within scholarly communication. Readers are encouraged to approach this chapter with an awareness of these potential conflicts of interest and a commitment to upholding ethical standards.
Initially launched in 2002, the utilization of OJS has expanded significantly, with 25,671 active journals in 2020 spanning 155 countries. Notably, 81.7 percent of these journals originate from the Global South, with prominent contributions from Indonesia, Brazil, and the USA. The research published in these journals encompasses 56 languages, with English, Indonesian, and Portuguese leading the pack. In 2020 alone, these journals collectively published an average of 38.8 articles, amounting to over 4.7 million articles since 2010. PKP collects data from these journals, including through the software's optional beacon feature. While the beacon offers PKP access to journal data, some users opt to disable it, suggesting that the reported numbers may be conservative. Studies have indicated that the majority of OJS-utilizing journals are open access (89 percent) and constitute a significant portion of "diamond open access" journals, refraining from charging readers subscription fees or authors APCs. Despite being predominantly indexed by Google Scholar and to a lesser extent by the Directory of Open Access Journals, these journals represent a burgeoning force in research, encompassing a mix of long-standing publications, new and inexperienced publishers, and a minority engaging in unethical practices.
This study was conducted in three phases spanning from 2018 to 2021. The initial phase involved contacting a limited sample of publishers and journals utilizing OJS listed in Beall’s and Cabells Predatory Reports to gauge their willingness to receive recommendations for enhancing the quality of their journals. The second phase aimed to identify the number of OJS journals listed in Beall’s and Cabells Predatory Reports. The final phase served as a technical response to the preceding phases, proposing strategies for the scholarly publishing sector to authenticate and communicate a journal’s compliance with scholarly norms. The persistent lack of transparency has facilitated predatory practices and fostered ambiguity surrounding the use of the "predatory" label, underscoring the necessity for industry-wide measures to address these issues.
During the initial phase, which spanned from July to December of 2018, we meticulously sifted through Beall’s 2017 list until we pinpointed 50 publishers and 51 standalone journals utilizing OJS. Subsequently, we reached out to these entities via email, highlighting their presence on Beall’s list and extending an offer to assist in enhancing their journal websites. Out of the contacted parties, 14 publishers (representing 113 journals) and two standalone journals expressed interest. Following this, we meticulously examined sample journals from each publisher, drawing guidance from Beall’s Criteria for Determining Predatory Open-Access Publishers, which encompasses 54 criteria ranging from the absence of a specified journal editor to the presence of a fee-based expedited peer review service guaranteeing publication with minimal scrutiny. Notably, Scholar Science Journals and Khalsa Publisher swiftly implemented upgrades post our correspondence, while COES&RJ (Center of Excellence for Scientific & Research Journalism) acknowledged and acted upon our recommendations. Among the fourteen publishers, three disclosed their unsuccessful attempts to be delisted by Beall, whereas a fourth successfully persuaded Beall to acknowledge their inclusion in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).
In our examination of the 14 publishers and two standalone journals, it was revealed that seven of the publishers (equivalent to 14 percent of the initially selected publishers) did not impose charges on authors for publication, thereby excluding them from being classified as "predatory" according to Beall and Cabells. Among these seven, two offered journal subscriptions for sale, while the remaining five did not have either subscriptions or author fees. Furthermore, we assessed the entire group against eight essential criteria we identified from Beall's criteria (2015), supplemented by DOAJ and Google Scholar listings (refer to Table 1). Among the publishers that did require author fees, only one publisher (Fundamental Journals) failed to meet seven or more of the 10 scholarly standards.
In relation to the peer-review inquiry, we approached the 14 publishers who responded to our initial request, seeking permission for restricted access to their peer review process through password access (utilizing our understanding of OJS). Among these, five publishers granted us entry to a journal (refer to Table 1). Upon examining an average of 12 recent articles from each journal, we observed that four out of the five publishers' journals possessed complete sets of reviews, while the fifth journal lacked reviews for three out of 20 articles. On average, there were 1.6 reviews per article; however, it is noteworthy that 24 percent of these reviews merely recommended publication without any accompanying commentary, indicating a need for substantial enhancements in peer review quality. To summarize, out of the initial 50 randomly selected publishers utilizing OJS from Beall's list, only 14.0 percent were largely compliant with Beall's fundamental criteria, with five out of the seven demonstrating direct evidence of peer review.
While Beall did not specify the reasons for adding individual publishers or journals to his list, Cabells Predatory Reports (2021) categorizes the "violations" for each title, ranking them from "severe" to "minor." Cabells outlines over 60 behavioral indicators for journals that are indicative of "misconduct," "fraudulent operations," and "probable threats" (Cabells, n.d.). Among the journals utilizing OJS, Cabells found an average of 4.3 violations per journal. The most prevalent violation was the absence of a policy for digital preservation, classified as a "moderate" violation present in 107 journals, accounting for 45.1 percent of those using OJS (Table 2). For publishers with journals listed in Cabells Predatory Reports, we crafted emails detailing their violations, as it was improbable they would have access to this information otherwise. Our emails included recommendations for addressing these concerns and instructions for notifying Cabells of any corrections made to their journals. For instance, for the common violation of lacking a preservation policy, we suggested that publishers enroll their journals in the PKP Preservation Network, a resource available to all OJS journals, and display this as their preservation policy. As the emailing of publishers was finalized upon submission of this chapter for publication, we are unable to provide feedback on its effectiveness in assisting the publishers.
Cabell's method of identifying "violations" for each listed title represents an advancement from Beall's approach of merely appending publishers and journals to its roster. However, there persists a dependence on somewhat feeble proxies that may not necessarily mirror a lack of expertise and professional backing. Despite the enhanced granularity, the drawback lies in the unavailability of the journals' identities and their corresponding "violations" to those mentioned. This lack of transparency is disconcerting as Cabell's list of violations does offer constructive insights for journal enhancement. We have proposed to Cabell the notion of equitability in sharing its evaluations with the journals labeled as a "potential threat." Although Cabell is currently hesitant to take this stride, we intend to keep them informed about our initiative of engaging with publishers listed in Predatory Reports, providing guidance on rectifying the attributed "violations" and requesting reconsideration. Our aspiration is for Cabell to contemplate the value of altering its role in scholarly publishing. This approach could potentially enhance the accuracy of their predatory reports by eliminating false positives.
Our attempts to engage with publishers and journals have yielded limited results, contributing valuable insights to the existing body of literature on predatory list overreach. Despite our efforts, the response rates were modest, with publishers showing a 28.0 percent engagement rate and standalone journals at 3.9 percent. Only two publishers took action based on our recommendations, indicating that while this approach may be ethically sound, it is not a highly effective strategy for addressing the problem at hand. This underscores the need for enhanced methods to accurately identify and combat fraudulent journals.
In this phase, our objective was to assess the prevalence of journals utilizing OJS that are categorized as "predatory" in Beall's and Cabells' listings. Initially, we cross-referenced the PKP list of OJS journals with Beall's final compilation of predatory publishers and journals, which was discontinued in 2017 due to pushback from various publishers and organizations (Silver, 2017). To determine the total number of journals encompassed by Beall's list in 2018, we examined a sample of 231 publishers, constituting 19.9 percent of the total 1,163 publishers, irrespective of their OJS usage (refer to Table 2). The average count of 24.3 journals per publisher indicated that Beall's list encompassed 30,968 journals labeled as "predatory," including 1,395 standalone journals. Notably, 61.7 percent of these journals had not yet published any articles, while 6.3 percent lacked a website, a figure that escalated to 32 percent by 2021. Among journals utilizing OJS, 366 titles were linked to Beall's list, representing 1.2 percent of the total journals on Beall's List and 1.4 percent of the 25,671 active journals known to be utilizing OJS (refer to Table 3).
Cabells International generously conducted a comparison between PKP's journal list and Predatory Reports by cross-referencing the journals' ISSNs (International Standard Serial Number) on both lists. By focusing on journals with ISSNs, Cabells narrowed down their list to 7,490 titles out of 15,470, while PKP's list was reduced to 22,802 out of 25,671. Among these, 237 journals were found on both lists, accounting for 3.2 percent of Cabells' list with ISSNs and 1.0 percent of the journals utilizing OJS with ISSNs.
In our investigation, we analyzed the intersection of journals utilizing OJS that are present on both Beall's and Cabell's lists (refer to Table 4). Our findings revealed that 82 journals, constituting 0.3 percent of the total OJS journals, are listed on both platforms, with a notable presence of journals from India and the United States. This amounts to a collective total of 521 journals utilizing OJS that are featured on either one or both predatory lists, representing 2.0 percent of the OJS journals in circulation. A comparison between the two lists indicates that Cabell's list exhibits a slightly stronger emphasis on publications from the Global South, while the disparities in country representation between the lists are likely attributed to the specific journal collections maintained by publishers.
The prevalence of journals utilizing OJS on the aforementioned lists does not offer much reassurance. Given that OJS is an open-source publishing platform that is freely accessible for download and provides comprehensive documentation for journal setup and operation, one might have anticipated a more widespread adoption by predatory journals. However, it is plausible that the emphasis of OJS on facilitating editorial oversight of peer review dissuades those with malicious intentions, or that the platform's robust design and support mechanisms empower journals to transcend the subjective categorization of being labeled as "predatory." Nevertheless, it is evident that certain journals are exploiting OJS to unscrupulously levy charges on authors for publishing their submissions sans peer review, thereby undermining the integrity of scientific research. Despite instances of potential overcounting on both lists, the prevalence of OJS usage is notably higher in the recent Cabells Predatory Reports list (3.2 percent) compared to Beall's list (1.2 percent), indicating a broader coverage of journals from the Global South by Cabells. This uptick in OJS utilization may mirror the platform's escalating growth trajectory, thereby underscoring the imperative for platform developers to redouble efforts in addressing this pressing issue.
The extent of uncertainty and innuendo surrounding Beall's list and Cabells Predatory Reports is concerning. Rather than assigning blame to Beall and Cabells International, it might be more productive to focus on redirecting the scholarly publishing technologies that have facilitated this global knowledge exchange. There is a pressing need for new systems that can effectively verify and demonstrate to the public the degree to which these journals adhere to scholarly standards. This necessity leads us to the third phase of our study.
In order to bolster the public value of open access and the global reach of scholarly publishing, PKP is actively working on enhancing tools for evaluating and communicating the credibility of scholarly content. This initiative entails journals collaborating with third-party trade organizations to authenticate and document the roles of individuals involved in the publication process. An illustration of this collaboration is demonstrated through ORCiD, an organization specializing in researcher identity and profile management. Initially, the focus will be on incorporating five fundamental scholarly standards, with a future consideration for more detailed and specialized criteria, such as those pertaining to clinical trials (refer to Table 5). These systems will rely on the seamless exchange of information between journals and the partnering organizations, fostering a transparency that exceeds current capabilities. This transparency may encompass insights into the backgrounds of journal reviewers or the typical number of reviews a manuscript undergoes. While automation will play a key role in facilitating these connections and controls, the final outcomes will undergo human scrutiny and potential challenges. By licensing the connecting technologies under open source, these advancements will be accessible to both commercial and non-commercial platforms.
Upon registration with a journal's publishing platform, editors, editorial board members, reviewers, and authors are mandated to log into ORCiD (Fig. 2). Assuming the role of a journal editor necessitates an additional ORCiD login, where this new designation is appended to one's ORCiD profile. ORCiD, in turn, furnishes the journal with a clickable ORCiD icon, allowing readers and authors to delve into the editor's credentials and background, assured of the authenticated identities and the recourse to ORCiD in case of discrepancies. While acknowledging the potential susceptibility of such systems to circumvention, given the inherent limitations of technology, the complexity of bypassing detection has been significantly heightened, with room for further enhancements to address any breaches effectively.
The communication of results from verification systems, such as peer reviews and indexing, to readers and authors is a crucial aspect to consider. To address this, we have initiated the development of a "Publication Facts" label inspired by the FDA Nutrition Facts label (Fig. 3). This label will adhere to open science principles, inviting public scrutiny, and will undergo evaluation and refinement with diverse audiences, ranging from high school students to journalists. The goal is to ensure the label's clarity and comprehensibility for researchers and the general public, enabling them to assess the reliability of research articles. Linked to individual studies, the label will offer metrics on their adherence to standards, accompanied by detailed explanations of each standard and metric. This labeling strategy aims to educate both the public and professionals on research standards, providing readers with a tool to quickly evaluate or delve deeper into the trustworthiness of research publications.
The issue of transparency and clarity regarding the adherence of journals to scholarly standards is not only relevant in the broader context of scholarly publishing but also plays a crucial role in mitigating the mislabeling of journals as "predatory." By making the adherence of journals to scholarly standards more explicit and publicly accessible, there is a potential to foster wider acceptance and utilization of scholarly work. This could lead to journalists and other professionals developing a habit of verifying the credibility of research sources before utilizing them, while also integrating the practice of checking such labels into the educational curriculum of high school and college students. Establishing an industry standard for scholarly publishing appears to align with the principles of universal open access and garnering public support for research endeavors.
It is widely acknowledged that unethical website operators exist within scholarly publishing, mirroring similar issues in other industries. Acknowledging this fact, this study aligns with previous research in highlighting how a lack of transparency at critical junctures in the scholarly publishing process can result in an excessive application of the predatory label to both journals and publishers. While this heightened awareness may shed light on a genuine problem, it poses a threat to the advancements being made in open access and the promotion of a more extensive global research endeavor. This concern is particularly evident in the industry's current initiative, "Think. Check. Submit." While designed to aid authors in selecting appropriate venues for their work, it inadvertently contributes to a broader sense of skepticism towards research literature beyond established and reputable publications.
This study contributes to the extensive literature on predatory journals by providing both evidence and rationale for addressing the fundamental issues of transparency. The implementation of verification systems for publishing platforms through trusted trade organizations sets a higher standard for both the operators of predatory journals and those who may incorrectly apply the label. While PKP is spearheading these initiatives, it is crucial to acknowledge that their efficacy hinges on widespread adoption as an industry norm for journal accountability across various publishers and publishing platforms. This necessitates the involvement of a diverse array of journal platforms and scholarly publishers united by the common objective of aiding the public in evaluating the reliability of research publications, particularly in light of the increasing accessibility of research through open access. These verification and authentication standards, tailored to effectively communicate with both the public and professionals, regarding the distinctive publishing practices of scholarly publishing, will elevate the expectations for both legitimate and deceitful journals.
If a publicly accessible and reliable foundation can be established to enhance confidence in a journal's credibility, services like Cabells could potentially redirect their focus from compiling lists of possible wrongdoers to actively safeguarding the public interest by collaborating with journals requiring corrections and enhancements, all the while aiming to uncover intentional deceit and fraudulent practices. The revelations made by Jeffrey Beall and Cabells International underscore the necessity for mechanisms to authenticate and communicate a journal's commitment to scholarly norms in an era characterized by open access and widespread engagement in research.
