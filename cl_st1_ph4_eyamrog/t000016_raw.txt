ABSTRACT 
1 
Parkinsonia aculeata L. (palo verde) it is native to semidesert region and seasonally dry 
2 
tropical forests. A more detailed study of the biochemical composition of its organs could 
3 
offer information for its use for pest and disease biocontrol in species of agricultural and 
4 
economic interest. This research aimed to determine the content of polyphenols and 
5 
flavonoids in hydroalcoholic extracts obtained from the stems and leaves of P. aculeata and 
6 
its phytotoxicity in tomato seedlings applied at the early stages of growth. The extracts were 
7 
applied at 15, 25 and 35 days after emergence (DAE). The highest content of polyphenols and 
8 
flavonoids was obtained in the leaves, and the polyphenol concentration exceeded that of 
9 
flavonoids. The hydroalcoholic extracts, of both stems and leaves, presented level 5 
10 
phytotoxicity in tomato plants at 15 DAE. However, from 25 DAE, there was no 
11 
phytotoxicity. At 35 DAE, there was only phytotoxicity when the volume of both organs was 
12 
5 mL Plant-1. There was a significant interaction between organ and volumes factors. The 
13 
study shows that leaf and stem extracts can be used for fusarium wilt biocontrol without 
14 
causing phytotoxicity in tomato plants from 25 days, using volumes between 1 and 3 mL 
15 
plant-1.

INTRODUCTION 
40 
Phytopathologists and producers, with an organic approach, employ various agrotechnical 
41 
alternatives with the aim of reducing the contaminant load from the excessive application of 
42 
broad-spectrum fungicides. The use of plant extracts to control pests and diseases is one of 
43 
those agrotechnical alternatives (Báez et al. 2021). Among them, extracts of species such as 
44 
the governor (Larrea tridentate (DC.) Coville) and oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) have been 
45 
used to control phytopathogenic fungi of the genus Fusarium, which produces significant 
46 
losses in the yield of crops of economic interest (Figueroa et al. 2019). 
47 
Plants sometimes produce a significant amount of primary and secondary metabolites as a 
48 
regulatory action on a large number of pests and diseases; for this reason, the possibility of 
49 
being used with a focus on environmental protection through integrated management is being 
50

studied (Zoppolo et al. 2008). Some of these metabolites are synthesized as defenses 
51 
(repellents) and others intoxicate and directly eliminate microorganisms and pests. For 
52 
example, saponins, amygdalins, and norhydroguaiaretic acid are used for the control of fungi 
53 
and bacteria (Martínez-Olivo et al. 2020). Protocatechotic acid has a significant effect on the 
54 
control of pathogens in general and in particular on preventing basal rot in tomatoes (El-
55 
Nagar et al. 2020). Among the metabolites that plants synthesize are polyphenols (PP), which 
56 
are obtained from the shikimic acid biosynthetic pathway (Santos-Sánchez et al. 2019). PP 
57 
are normally antioxidants whose main function is to prevent damage to foliar organs. The 
58 
damage can be due to biological oxidation induced by abiotic stress or caused by insects and 
59 
microorganisms (Lee et al. 2020), including bacteria and fungi (Rivera-Solís et al. 2021). 
60 
Many species of the semidesert also show characteristics of tolerance to pests and diseases, 
61 
subsisting in addition to prevailing adverse conditions such as salinity and drought (Gonzáles 
62 
et al. 2021), asis the case for P. aculeata, commonly known as “palo verde or bacaporo” 
63 
(Adhikari & White 2014). This species has been studied in various regions of the world 
64 
mainly for clinical purposes (Divya et al. 2011; Franco et al. 2022), and phytochemical 
65 
studies have been developed to determine the presence of various metabolites that can be used 
66 
for the biocontrol of pathogens, such as Fusarium oxysporum (Arvizu-Quintana et al. 2021). 
67 
These studies are of great importance in the prevention of environmental contamination after 
68 
having been proven that they present minimal or no phytotoxicity in the plants of economic 
69 
interest. An important step is to evaluate whether these extracts obtained from model plants, 
70 
such as paloverde, affect the physiological, biochemical and/or agronomic performance of the 
71 
plants. Another important point is to substitute some chemical pesticides with these products. 
72 
The substitution may reduce the amounts of pollutants in agricultural area. Taking these 
73 
elements into account, a study was carried out to determine the content of polyphenols and 
74

flavonoids in hydroalcoholic extracts obtained from stems and leaves of P. aculeata and to 
75 
evaluate the phytotoxicity in tomato seedlings applied in the initial stages of development.

Materials and methods 
78 
Location of the experimental area. The research was developed in the Biotechnology 
79 
Laboratory of the National Institute of Technology of Mexico, Valle del Yaqui Campus, in 
80 
the municipality of Bácum, Sonora, Mexico. Leaf and stem samples of P. aculeata plants 
81 
were taken from the semidesert Sonora to obtain hydroalcoholic extracts by percolation 
82 
according to the process described by Fecker et al. (2020). The samples were separated at a 
83 
rate of 100 g and then remained in 1 L of 76% alcohol during 10 days (Figs. 1a-b, leaves and 
84 
stems, respectively). After this period, the alcohol was separated using a rotary evaporator at 
85 
30 revolutions per minute and at a temperature of 65°C (BUCHI R215, USA), with an 
86 
extraction efficiency of 75%. The extracts were kept at 4°C until they were used (Fig. 1c).

Tomato variety used to evaluate phytotoxicity 
91 
As an experimental model, tomato seeds of the Río Grande® variety were used, with 
92 
determined growth, cataloged as susceptible to fusarium wilt (Arellano-Aburto et al. 2021). 
93 
The seeds were sown in 200-well polyfoam trays under semi-controlled conditions in a 
94 
growth chamber. The conditions inside the chamber were adjusted to 10 hours of light, a 
95 
temperature of 25°C and a relative humidity of 75%. Peat moss type substrate (PROMIX) 
96 
was used for seed germination. At 15 days after emergence (DAE), the seedlings were 
97 
selected and subjected to the established treatments.

Treatments and experimental design 
100 
The treatments consisted of the combination of two sources of variation: A) plant organs, with 
101 
two levels (stems and leaves); and B) volumes of extracts applied, with four levels (0, 1, 3 and 
102 
5 mL plant-1). The level of zero applications of the extract was taken as the control treatment. 
103 
Each treatment of the eight conformed, had a sample size of 30 plants. The application of the 
104 
extracts was carried out on the roots and foliar route, in unison, three times after emergence: 
105 
at 15, 25 and 35 DAE. This last factor was not included as a source of variation, and the 
106 
results were compared separately in the respective statistical analyses. 
107 
The treatments were distributed under semi-controlled conditions, following a completely 
108 
randomized experimental design with a bifactorial arrangement. In all treatments, the edge 
109 
effect and neighboring variants were taken into account for phytotoxicity variable 
110 
measurement. These plants were dispensed with to reduce the possible experimental error. 
111 
 
112 
Evaluated variables 
113 
Polyphenol content was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method developed by Anesini et 
114 
al. (2008). For the test, a volume of 125 µL of the gallic acid standard solution was prepared, 
115 
and 0.5 mL of distilled H2O and 125 µL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent were added. These 
116 
reagents remained in the reaction for 6min, and 1.25 mL of a 7% Na2CO3 solution was added. 
117 
Finally, 1 mL of distilled H2O was added and left to stand for 90min at a temperature of 17°C 
118 
and 65% relative humidity. 
119 
An absorbance reading was performed on the obtained solution in a UV Vis Genesys 10S 
120 
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) at a wavelength (λ) of 760 nm. Then, both stem and 
121 
leaf extracts were diluted at a 1:5 ratio with 50% methanolic solution, and the total 
122 
polyphenol content was determined in the same way as gallic acid standards. Then, by 
123 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4719
interpolating the absorbance of the extracts in the gallic acid curve, it was determined, in 
124 
triplicate samples, the content of total polyphenols expressed in mg L-1 of extract. 
125 
Flavonoid content was determined by the method described by Muñoz et al. (2007). Samples 
126 
of 250 μL of the extracts of P. aculeata were dissolved in 1000 μL of deionized water. Then, 
127 
75 μL of NaNO2 was added and allowed to react for 5 minutes. Subsequently, 75 μL of 10% 
128 
AlCl3 and 500 μL of 1 M NaOH were added. The mixture was centrifuged at 3500 r.p.m. 
129 
during 5 minutes. Finally, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 510 nm. The final 
130 
concentrations of total flavonoids were expressed in mg L-1 of stem and leaves extract 
131 
(Herrera et al. 2017). 
132 
 
133 
Evaluation of the phytotoxicity of the extracts 
134 
The evaluation of the phytotoxicity of hydroalcoholic extracts from leaves and stems of P. 
135 
aculeata was carried out in the initial stages of the Rio Grande tomato variety, following the 
136 
scale described in Table 1, taking the scale proposed by Esparza-Díaz et al. (2010) as a 
137 
reference. 
138 
 
139 
TABLE 1 
140 
 
141 
Statistical analysis 
142 
To compare the concentrations of polyphenols and flavonoids, the theoretical distribution of 
143 
student probabilities proposed by Gosset (1917) was used, establishing the differences 
144 
between the organs where they were determined. 
145 
For the evaluation of phytotoxicity, a double classification analysis of variance was carried 
146 
out based on a linear model of fixed effects (Fisher 1937). The number of damaged or dead 
147 
plants during each treatment (discrete quantitative variable) was taken as a variable response. 
148 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4719
When there were differences between the means of the treatments, the test (Tukey's multiple 
149 
comparison)was used for a significance level of 5% (Tukey 1960). The statistical indicators of 
150 
coefficient of variation (CV), standard error of the mean of the treatments (ESx) and the 
151 
coefficients of determination (R2) were determined, without adjusting for the isolated factors 
152 
(organs and volume) and for the interaction between these twofactors. STATISTICA 
153 
professional software, version 14.1 for Windows (Stasoft 2014), was used for statistical 
154 
processing. 
155 
 
156 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
157 
Polyphenols and flavonoids Content in the hydroalcoholic extract of stems and leaves. 
158 
Polyphenols concentration and total flavonoids showed highly significant differences between 
159 
the organs from which the extracts were obtained. The concentration was in both parts, but it 
160 
was higher in the leaves (Table 2). The result demonstrates the plant ability to store these 
161 
compounds to be protected from pests and diseases. The storage is more in the leaves than in 
162 
the stem. Silva et al. (2012) evaluated rot control in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). It was verified 
163 
that hydroalcoholic extracts of leaves and stems of palo verde at concentrations of 10% were 
164 
effective in promoting a low severity of the disease (3.7 and 3.3, respectively). These results 
165 
may explain the low abundance of reports showing the presence of pests and diseases in this 
166 
species. It was attributed to the synthesis and accumulation of these compounds as main 
167 
biocontrol agents. 
168

171 
Various investigations on the use of crude plant extracts have revealed their inhibitory 
172 
activities on microorganisms. For example, the use of antimicrobial activity of Pinus 
173 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4719
wallichiana A.B.Jacks. leaf extracts against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense. (Foc), 
174 
attributed to the significant presence of flavonoids and polyphenols (Ain et al. 2022). These 
175 
results affirm that the palo verde extract has important potentialities as a biocontrol agent 
176 
because it comes from a plant. This product easily mitigates into the plant (Stefanovic and 
177 
Comic 2012), so it would generate little or no phytotoxicity. This characteristic confirms the 
178 
importance of this study. 
179 
 Many of these extracts contain terpenoids, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, phenylpropanoids, 
180 
and flavonoids, which are used to manufacture fungicides and pesticides at high 
181 
concentrations (Nxumalo et al. 2021). 
182 
In Mexico, various plant species extracts have also been obtained. They have a significant 
183 
concentration of flavonoids and polyphenols used as biocontrol agents of insects. A major 
184 
control of 48-hour-old larvae with seven concentrations was obtained when the insecticidal 
185 
activity of mistletoe dust (Phoradendron densum Torr. ex Trel.) on Spodoptera frugiperda 
186 
was evaluated by Hernandez et al. (2018). 
187 
In general, flavonoids play an important role in the protection against biological oxidations 
188 
induced by biotic and abiotic stresses (Sun et al. 2022). The content of polyphenols in plants 
189 
and fruits varies depending on the genotype, species, environmental conditions, degree of 
190 
maturity, soil composition, geographic location, and storage conditions (Shen et al. 2022). 
191 
Flavonoids are also a frequent object of research due to their diverse functions, such as 
192 
nutrient assimilation, protein synthesis, enzymatic activity, photosynthesis, formation of 
193 
structural components, and defense against adverse environmental factors such as aggression 
194 
of pathogens and insects (Figueirinha et al. 2008; Vélez-Terranova et al. 2014).

Phytotoxicity of extracts in tomato seedlings 
197 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4719
The application at 15 DAE of treatments T2 to T8 showed highly significant phytotoxicity 
198 
(p=0.0017) in the Rio Grande tomato variety, causing damage to 77% of the plants of each 
199 
mentioned treatment (value of 5). For this reason, the hydroalcoholic extract application of P. 
200 
aculeata at 15 DAE is not recommended (Table 3). In the statistical analysis, at this moment 
201 
of application (15 DAE), although there was a significant interaction between the 
202 
organ*volume factors (p=0.01796), it was observed that the effect of the applied volume 
203 
explained 98% of the total variability obtained (R2(volumes)=0.98). These findings show that 
204 
any volume used close to emergence can generate phytotoxicity and that this increases 
205 
significantly as the volume of extract applied increases (Table 3). 
206 
 
207 
TABLE 3 
208 
 
209 
When the treatments were applied at 25 DAE, there were also significant differences between 
210 
the organs used to obtain the extracts (p=0.00274), as well as between the volumes 
211 
(p=0.0003), with also a significant interaction (p=0.0179). When the extracts were applied 
212 
during 25 DAE, a total variability found in phytotoxicity was explained by 64%, and the 
213 
average phytotoxicity between treatments was 2. A similar result was found at 35 DAE, 
214 
where the source of volume variation contributed 79% to the total variability found in 
215 
phytotoxicity, although the average value of phytotoxicity was 1 (Table 3). The results 
216 
obtained indicate that high volumes of the extract can cause phytotoxicity in plants. Because 
217 
of this these studies must be carried out to recommend its use. This can be useful to producers 
218 
to control diseases in seedling without causing damage to the initial morphological and 
219 
physiological characteristics of plants. 
220 
Multiple extracts have been obtained from semi-desert plants for agronomic purposes, with an 
221 
organic and integrated management approach for pest and disease control (Heikal et al. 2021). 
222 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4719
The governor species (Larrea tridentata (DC.) Coville) has been used as biocontrol of 
223 
fusarium, with reductions in radial growth of 10% (Martínez-Olivo et al. 2020). Neem extract 
224 
(Azadirachta indica A.Juss.) has been used to evaluate antifungal activity against tomato 
225 
vascular wilt and showed high control efficiency and minimal phytotoxicity in seedlings 
226 
(Ayvar-Serna et al. 2021). 
227 
For fungal diseases such as fusariosis, the hydroalcoholic extract of Acacia farnesiana was 
228 
tested for a decade (Rodríguez et al. 2012) under in vitro culture conditions, with significant 
229 
decreases in the mycelial growth of the fungus and minimal phytotoxicity in plants. Rivera-
230 
Solis et al. (2021) also tested extracts of Sargassum spp. as inducers of tolerance to Fusarium 
231 
oxysporum in tomato seedlings without finding significant phytotoxicity. These results 
232 
demonstrate the practical value of plant extracts in controling diseases that affect agricultural 
233 
crops and their contribution to caring for the environment by reducing the application of 
234 
chemical products. 
235 
Plant extracts in pest and disease management are currently recognized as environmentally 
236 
safe, less hazardous and cheaper. In their most natural form, many plant species have 
237 
insecticidal characteristics (Tavares et al. 2021). Its use constitutes an alternative to mitigate 
238 
contaminant loads due to concentrated chemical products that sometimes generate resistance 
239 
in organisms. 
240 
The production of plant extracts is still important in the discovery of innovative and 
241 
environmentally safe antimicrobials to overcome problems with resistance to multiple 
242 
pesticides. The use of extracts to minimize or eliminate the damage caused by pests and 
243 
diseases can be a contribution to the national and international scientific community. This 
244 
could have a great economic and ecological significance.

CONCLUSIONS 
247 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4719
The hydroalcoholic extracts of Parkinsonia aculeata L. present a higher concentration of 
248 
flavonoids and polyphenols in the leaves than in the stems. 
249 
The Río Grande tomato variety presents high phytotoxicity (f=5) at 15 DAE. Because of this, 
250 
the application of hydroalcoholic extracts of P. aculeata at this time is not recommended.  
251 
The safe application of the hydroalcoholic extract of P. aculeata without symptoms of 
252 
phytotoxicity appearing, must be carried out from 25 to 35 DAE of the seedlings.
