Tumor marker (TM) requests are frequently encountered in clinical practice for neoplasm screening.
Objectives: This study aims to examine the frequency of inappropriate TM test orders and associated costs within a private health insurance setting.
Methods: This study examined data pertaining to TM requests within a private health insurance company from 2010 to 2017. The analysis focused on patients aged 50 years and above, possessing accessible medical records, and having undergone at least one TM test during the specified study duration. Inappropriate tests were identified when TMs were utilized for neoplasm screening without a prior diagnosis. The investigation encompassed variables such as age, gender, the medical specialty of the ordering physician, and the associated costs of the tests.
Results: Over the period from 2010 to 2017, a total of 1112 TM tests were conducted, showing a notable increase from 52 to 262 tests annually. The study cohort predominantly comprised women, accounting for 69.5% of the sample, with an average age of 59.4 years (SD, 8.2). The majority of test orders were deemed inappropriate, making up 87.8% of the total, and contributing to 79.4% of the overall expenses associated with TM tests. Among the medical specialties, cardiology professionals were the most frequent requesters of TM tests, accounting for 23.9%, followed by internal medicine specialists at 22.7% and gynecologists at 19.2%.
In this study, a notable prevalence of inappropriate test orders was identified, leading to increased expenditures. Given these findings, it is imperative for healthcare administrators to prioritize investigations of this kind. Implementing targeted interventions is crucial to curbing the unwarranted utilization of TM tests within clinical settings.
The recent technological advancements in medicine have undeniably revolutionized diagnostic tests and laboratory prognoses. However, these advancements have also led to a significant increase in financial burdens on healthcare services, impacting patients and governments, especially in countries with limited financial resources. The misuse of these new healthcare technologies has become prevalent in many countries, despite efforts by various publications and guidelines to standardize their usage, as evidenced by alarming statistics in the literature. Apart from financial implications, the inappropriate use of diagnostic tests poses risks such as unnecessary treatments and excessive test requests. The definition of an inappropriate test is broad and subject to interpretation, with Zhi et al. (2013) defining it as a test requested without a clear diagnostic hypothesis for a specific case. Moreover, an appropriate clinical indication for testing should consider sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value studies for the targeted diseases, typically outlined in guidelines by governmental bodies, institutes, or medical specialties like the USPSTF. Unlike pharmaceutical clinical trials, literature on the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests is not as readily available.
Tumor markers (TMs) are commonly utilized in clinical settings as screening tools for individuals aged 50 and above, encompassing a range of substances like cell surface antigens, cytoplasmic proteins, enzymes, hormones, oncofetal antigens, receptors, and oncogenes and their derivatives. As highlighted by Sharma (2009), the key attributes of an ideal TM consist of high specificity towards a particular tumor type, a reasonable lead-time compared to clinical diagnosis, and a high sensitivity to minimize false-positive outcomes. Regrettably, these sought-after characteristics are often challenging to attain in practical clinical scenarios, prompting a general consensus against incorporating TM tests into routine screening protocols for asymptomatic patients.
Given the substantial increase in the financial burden of healthcare services, the optimization of expenses has become crucial. However, numerous studies have highlighted a concerning prevalence of inappropriate orders for tumor marker (TM) tests. For instance, a study conducted in Greece by Ntaios et al. (2009) revealed that only 10% of the 10,921 TM tests were correctly requested. These tests included cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE).
Research on the insufficient utilization of tumor marker (TM) tests in Brazil is limited. This study delved into the frequency of orders and associated costs within a private health insurance setting concerning inadequately requested TM tests, including CA 125, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3), cancer antigen 72-4 (CA 72-4), and cancer antigen 27-29 (CA 27-29).
This retrospective study was conducted within a non-profit, private employer-sponsored health insurance program managed by a federal public institution situated in Brasília, Federal District, Brazil. The financial backing for this insurance primarily stems from government allocations, with a smaller portion derived from user contributions, estimated at around 20%. The insurance scheme extends coverage to an average of 5979 individuals annually, encompassing both active and retired employees as well as their dependents.
The study population comprised individuals who underwent complementary blood tests through their health insurance plans from 2010 to 2017. Only active employees aged 50 years and above with available medical records were considered, excluding retirees and dependents. This age criterion aimed to target patients typically undergoing screening tests. The year 2012 was omitted from analysis due to data inconsistency resulting from a software management change, which could introduce methodological bias.
The variable of "inappropriate tests" was deemed to be present in cases where no prior neoplasm diagnosis had been conducted, and if at least one of the following tumor markers (TMs) - CA 125, CEA, CA 15-3, CA 72-4, CA 19-9, and CA 27-29 - was documented in the medical records, falling under the "TM" variable. The criteria for this categorization were established based on guidelines provided by USPSTF11-13, The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP)14, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)15.
Additional variables examined in this research encompassed age (in completed years at the time of testing), gender (male/female), the medical specialty of the ordering physician, and details regarding costs (specific test expenses and user co-participation) as provided by the insurance manager. Monetary values in reais (the Brazilian currency, R$) were converted to US dollars utilizing the exchange rate prevailing in February 2020 (US$ 1.00 = R$ 4.06).
It is reasonable to assume that all cancer diagnoses were accurately documented, as any instances of sick leave, notifications, or premature retirements resulting from cancer would have been duly noted in the patients' medical records. The review of medical records was conducted by the study's appointed physician.
All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25.0. Descriptive statistics, including measures of position such as mean, median, and standard deviation, were employed. Additionally, the chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, and binary logistic regression were utilized where appropriate for the analysis.
The study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Medical School at the University of Brasília (CAAE 88696318.9.0000.5558).
Between 2010 and 2017, a total of 1,112 TM tests were ordered, with annual orders showing a notable increase from 52 to 262. The sample predominantly comprised women, accounting for 69.5% of the participants, with an average age of 59.4 years (standard deviation, 8.2).
The examination of medical records revealed that 12.2% (n = 136) of tests were correctly ordered, meaning they were requested after the cancer diagnosis, while 87.8% (n = 976) were deemed inappropriately ordered.
Out of the 136 orders deemed appropriate, 80.9% were designated for female patients, whose average age stood at 60.4 years (SD, 7.4). The likelihood of satisfactory test ordering was found to be linked with patient age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.13) and female gender (OR = 8.37, 95% CI: 4.08-17.17) (X2(2) = 43.965; p < 0.001, Nagelkerke R2 = 0.273).
A gradual rise was noted in both the absolute and per capita figures of inappropriate test orders over the years, starting from 48 test orders in 2010 (averaging 8.7 orders per 1000 registered users) and escalating to 227 orders in 2017, equating to 34.9 orders per 1000 registered users.
During the study period, the total costs associated with TM tests amounted to US$ 156,452.60. Notably, a substantial portion of this expenditure, totaling US$ 124,222.91 (79.4%), was allocated to inappropriate orders, showcasing a significant increase from US$ 3,127.17 in 2010 to US$ 26,776.83 in 2017. The average cost of these inappropriate tests was US$ 16.81 (SD, US$ 15.58) per patient and US$ 110.43 (SD, US$ 91.16) per government entity. Over the period from 2010 to 2017, the mean cost of inappropriate test orders equated to US$ 2.90 for each health insurance user, as detailed in Table 1.
In terms of the medical specialty of ordering physicians, the majority were cardiologists (23.9%), followed by internal medicine specialists (22.7%), obstetricians and gynecologists (19.2%), and general practitioners (10.14%). Despite clinical oncologists ranking seventh on this list, accounting for only 5.6% of all orders, they demonstrated the most appropriate test orders when compared to other specialties, showing a statistically significant association. The data pertaining to test orders based on medical specialty can be found in Table 2.
In this study conducted within a private health insurance setting, a notable and continuous rise was noted in the volume of inappropriate TM test orders lacking the necessary cancer diagnosis, contrary to the guidelines set forth by scientific organizations. The study revealed a remarkably high rate of inappropriate requests, amounting to 85.2% of all orders, leading to expenses that constituted a significant portion of the total expenditure on TM tests, totaling 79.4%.
Research on this topic in Brazil is limited, yet similar patterns of high rates of inappropriate test requests have been observed in various other countries. For instance, in Greece, a staggering 90% of TM test orders were deemed inappropriate. A study conducted in Modena, Italy, found that 62% of patients admitted to an internal medicine unit had at least one TM test ordered. Similarly, in Padua, less than 40% of the 23,059 TM test orders within a university hospital were considered appropriate. A broader Italian study indicated an alarming trend of more than one biomarker testing request for every five individuals, a figure disproportionate to the cancer prevalence in the country. In Turkey, around 90% of 1,858 patients had TM tests ordered for benign conditions. Studies in Canada have also highlighted the issue, showing that up to 20% of tests, not limited to TM tests, were inappropriately ordered, resulting in unnecessary costs amounting to millions of dollars.
In terms of medical specialties, it was noted that oncologists tended to order a higher number of appropriate TM tests compared to other specialists. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no prior studies exploring this particular relationship. Moss et al. (2008) conducted a study assessing the understanding of medical professionals regarding the sensitivity and specificity of CA 125 for ovarian cancer. Their findings revealed that 54% of general practitioners believed that this marker should not be limited to disease monitoring; however, 40% of these practitioners struggled to identify the causes of false-positive results despite feeling competent to request such tests. Furthermore, the same authors found that general practitioners lacked confidence in managing patients with elevated CA 125 levels, even in cases where ultrasound scans appeared normal, leading to referrals for further evaluations. This suggests a lack of familiarity among these physicians with interpreting TM results. Based on our findings, it is possible that oncologists' test orders may have exhibited heightened sensitivity and appropriateness, as they were often guided by additional diagnostic indicators even when used for screening purposes.
Several studies have endeavored to elucidate the factors contributing to physicians' inappropriate test requests, citing technical unfamiliarity, patient and family pressure, financial incentives, and fear of ethical and legal repercussions as key reasons. A study involving 1768 primary care physicians in the United States revealed that a significant portion were uncertain about requesting and interpreting laboratory results for primary care diagnoses. Patients commonly request tests and referrals to specialists, with Kravitz et al. (2003) noting that one in five patients make such requests. Additionally, family members influence around half of all medical decisions. Interestingly, oncologists appear to be less swayed by patient requests for procedures and tests, as evidenced by Gogineni et al. (2015) who found that physicians complied with less than 1% of patient demands during anticancer treatment.
In this context, several studies have proposed strategies and interventions aimed at reducing the number of inappropriately requested tests. Adopting clinical protocols to guide medical conduct in order to minimize unnecessary or redundant diagnostic tests has been shown to result in savings of up to 57%. A study conducted within a laboratory at a university hospital in Croatia demonstrated that standardizing minimum intervals for test performance could lead to a significant reduction (approximately 50%) in TM test orders, consequently lowering overall costs. Similarly, Torre et al. (2015) found that the percentage of adequately requested TMs increased from 31% to 78% following the standardization of their utilization protocol. Educational programs targeted at primary care physicians have the potential to reduce the number of tests performed (TMs or otherwise) by up to 51%, resulting in savings of approximately US$ 60,000 annually. In Northern Ireland, researchers reported that 72% of TM tests were appropriately requested, attributing these results to effective audit methods in conjunction with guideline publication. Physicians advocate for evidence-based practice supported by electronic medical records, structured care programs, continuous quality monitoring, and the identification of barriers and facilitators of clinical practice guidelines as effective strategies to prevent unnecessary test utilization.
Limitations of this study encompass its retrospective design, the inclusion of only one health insurance provider and a subset of its users, as well as the absence of data from the year 2012. The amalgamation of all tumor markers (CA 125, CEA, CA 15-3, CA 72-4, CA 19-9, and CA 27-29) into a single category hindered a more comprehensive analysis. Nonetheless, the strengths of this research lie in its substantial sample size, the extended evaluation period of 7 years, the meticulousness of medical records and conducted tests, and the pioneering nature of being the first Brazilian study on this particular subject.
In the current study conducted over a span of 7 years within a private health insurance setting, a notably high frequency (87.8%) of inappropriate TM test orders was observed. Oncologists emerged as the professionals exhibiting the most discerning judgment in ordering these tests. Given the anticipated surge in healthcare costs in the forthcoming years, particularly in nations like Brazil, initiatives geared towards curtailing the utilization of unnecessary technologies and tests hold significant relevance. Audits, physician education programs, established protocols, and patient education initiatives could potentially play a pivotal role in promoting the appropriate utilization of tumor biomarkers.
