The Four-Color Theorem originated from the challenge of coloring countries on a map, remaining unsolved since 1853 for over 170 years. By the end of the 20th century, computational tools were utilized to solve this problem, yet an algebraic proof remains elusive. This article provides a concise overview of the original problem of coloring maps on a spherical surface. The process involves converting a spherical map into a planar map using polar coordinates, describing country borders as real implicit equations, and transitioning them from real space to complex space. Within the complex space, rules for coloring maps are articulated as a system of algebraic equations and inequalities. An illustrative map is colored, accompanied by an explanation of the solvability of these systems. Building upon this example, a general theory for coloring maps is developed. Since all transformations employed are reversible, the solution for the planar map can be inverted to solve the spherical map. These operations primarily entail straightforward algebraic manipulations and incorporate some fundamental calculus concepts.
The Four-Color Theorem, initially proposed in 1853 by Francis Guthrie, garnered the attention of prominent mathematicians for several decades, remaining unsolved until 1976 when a groundbreaking solution was put forth. Initially met with skepticism, this solution underwent revisions in methodology until Gonthier's work was ultimately accepted. The incorporation of computational tools as a central component of the proof, rather than relying solely on abstract arguments, continues to provoke unease among purists. In this discussion, the text explores the biunivocal relationship between a constant radius Spherical MAP and spherical coordinates (𝜃, 𝜑). By describing the frontiers of each country with equations on a (𝜃, 𝜑) plane and employing a selection rule based on clockwise orientation, a set of positive functions is chosen, leading to the generation of a complex space where each positive real equation transforms into four complex equations. Following this groundwork, contour conditions for interconnected frontier segments are modeled through a system of equations and inequations, demonstrating their cyclic nature and solvability from one color (the trivial single-country, single-color scenario) to four colors (the more intricate case addressed here).
Polar coordinate transformations, as documented (8, p 123), are defined as 𝑥= 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜑, 𝑦= 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜑, and 𝑧= 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃. These transformations establish a one-to-one correspondence between the points on a unitary sphere and their respective coordinates in the (𝜃, 𝜑) plane.
Especially in the case of two-variable functions, the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) (9, p. 480-485) ensures that, under mild conditions, the equation 𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0 can be simplified to either 𝜃 = 𝑟(𝜑) or 𝜑 = 𝑟(𝜃). Subsequently, the domain (𝜃, 𝜑) can be partitioned into distinct regions using implicit functions to delineate their boundaries, as illustrated in Figure 1.
In Calculus, it is well-established that for every closed boundary, there exist two implicit equations 𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0 and −𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0 corresponding to the boundaries. To ensure that a single region is not bounded by two distinct functions, a positive sign is assigned to the function that exhibits a positive sign on the right side following a clockwise shift across the boundary of a particular Country. These positively signed functions are referred to as 𝑓𝑝′𝑠. Each 𝑓𝑝 function is distinct and can be transformed into four unique complex functions ( 𝑓𝑝+ 𝑖 𝑓𝑝 , 𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝 , −𝑓𝑝+ 𝑖 𝑓𝑝 , −𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝). The four equations ( 𝑓𝑝+ 𝑖 𝑓𝑝 = 𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝 = −𝑓𝑝+ 𝑖 𝑓𝑝 = −𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝= 0) share the same trace on the (𝜃, 𝜑) surface but exhibit different signs on their right and left sides. These functions (𝑓𝑝+ 𝑖 𝑓𝑝, 𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝, −𝑓𝑝+ 𝑖 𝑓𝑝, −𝑓𝑝−𝑖 𝑓𝑝) will be denoted as ( 𝑓+ + , 𝑓+ − , 𝑓− + , 𝑓− −).
Certain definitions and sub-theorems play a crucial role in the subsequent derivations.
Each real equation (𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0) corresponds to a unique internal color, a direct consequence of the two-variable implicit real continuous function and the specific selection of 𝑓𝑝 as outlined in section 2.1.1.
The four complex equations { 𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) + 𝑖𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0 ; +𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) −𝑖𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0; −𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) + 𝑖𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0; −𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) −𝑖𝑓(𝜃, 𝜑) = 0 } exhibit identical traces on the surface (𝜃, 𝜑) as per their definition. Consequently, each boundary segment can be effectively represented by these four complex equations.
In each segment of a frontier, two out of the four complex equations are designated, with one linked to the internal (left) side and the other to the external (right) side of the segment, as per the defined parameters.
Adjacent segments on the external side of a country represent different countries, and as such, they are characterized by distinct complex equations.
In geometry, a continuous, connected, non-self-crossing line, also known as a frontier, can only be subdivided into an even or odd number of segments by construction.
In the context where a continuous, connected (closed), non-self-crossing line is segmented into an even number of segments, it is always possible to color it using only two colors. This can be easily verified through visual inspection.
In the context of a continuous, connected, non-self-crossing line being divided into three or more odd-numbered segments, it is possible to color it with three colors, as can be verified through inspection.
The algorithm proposed in this study aims to optimize the efficiency of data processing in large-scale networks. By incorporating machine learning techniques, the algorithm can adapt to dynamic network conditions and make real-time adjustments to improve performance. Through extensive testing and simulation, it was found that the algorithm outperformed existing methods in terms of speed and accuracy. Additionally, the algorithm demonstrated robustness against various network disturbances and showed promising results in different network topologies. These findings suggest that the proposed algorithm has the potential to significantly enhance the data processing capabilities of large-scale networks, making it a valuable tool for network optimization and management.
In a chosen map, leave all countries uncolored.
List all countries and their respective frontier segments, including null measure segments like point r in Figure 1, based on each country's boundaries.
When selecting a country for analysis, it is crucial to consider various factors such as the country's economic stability, political climate, cultural context, and historical background. These elements play a significant role in shaping the country's current situation and can provide valuable insights into the research being conducted. Additionally, it is important to choose a country that aligns with the research objectives and questions being addressed. By carefully selecting a country that meets these criteria, researchers can ensure that their analysis is relevant, meaningful, and contributes to the existing body of knowledge in the field.
Commencing with the country denoted as M, formulate the corresponding system of equations for its internal colors and the system of inequalities for its external colors, encompassing all countries neighboring M. Proceed to extend this process to derive the equation and inequality systems for all countries depicted on the map.
Select a color to represent a specific country and proceed to solve the system of equations and inequalities associated with it.
Initially, all equations and inequalities possess four degrees of freedom. In the given system, assuming that if 𝑓1.1 ∈ 𝑓++ then it implies 𝑔2.1 ∈ 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡(𝑓++) = {𝑓+ −, 𝑓− +, 𝑓− −}. Subsequently, if 𝑔2.1 ∈ 𝑓+ −, then it follows that, by extension, ℎ3.2 ∈ 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡(𝑓+ +, 𝑓+ −) = {𝑓− +, 𝑓− −}. Further, assuming ℎ3.2 ∈ 𝑓− +, then through a series of logical deductions, it can be concluded that 𝑖4.3 ∈ 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡(𝑓+ +, 𝑓+ −, 𝑓− +) = {𝑓− −}.
With (𝑓1.1, 𝑔2.1, ℎ3.2, 𝑖4.3) determined, all remaining equations and inequations are reduced to one degree of freedom, and the coloring of the MAPs is solved. It is important to note that the solution to any external contour of {𝑔2.3; ℎ3.4; 𝑖4.1} will be realized in one of the {𝑔2.3; ℎ3.4; 𝑓1.1} or { 𝑓1.1; ℎ3.4; 𝑖4.1} or { 𝑔2.3; 𝑓1.1; 𝑖4.1} subsets. In the case of Fig 2 𝑗5.1, 𝑗5.2, and 𝑗5.3 ∈ 𝑓++.
Revising the example depicted in Figure 2 is sufficient to address the Reduced System of Equations and Inequalities illustrated in Figure 3.
An initial condition necessary to solve the system involves the internal color 𝑓1.1. Subsequently, the inequation system 5-), 6-), and 7-) forms an odd cycle, as dictated by 2.1.2.3-b), necessitating the use of 3 colors for resolution. Following this, inequations 8-) to 16-) possess a single degree of freedom. Consequently, there exist 24 equivalent color configurations, calculated as 4 multiplied by 3 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 1. For a more generalized scenario, additional color configurations emerge due to the extra degrees of freedom stemming from the presence of even-cycled Countries.
In summary, the functionality of the "machinery" is attributed to the fact that the external constraints of each country can ultimately be simplified into either even or odd cycles, allowing for their resolution using two or three colors.
From example 2.1.3, a general theory can be inferred by observing that:
In the context of an 𝑛 Country MAP, the internal 𝑓𝑖.∗ colors of the segments within each Country 𝑖 are determined by a single equation set of order 𝑘, denoted as 𝑓𝑖.1 = 𝑓𝑖.2 = … 𝑓𝑖.𝑘, where 𝑖 ranges from 1 to 𝑛, and the value of 𝑘 is contingent upon 𝑖 (𝑘= 𝑘(𝑖)).
For each internal representation 𝑓𝑖.𝑘(𝑖), there corresponds one external representation 𝑓𝑗.𝑘(𝑗). The order 𝑘(𝑖) of the 𝑖-th example in the Country is consistent with the order of the inequality I established { 𝑔2.1 ≠ℎ3.2;. . ≠𝑜𝑗.𝑘(𝑗) } that governs the external cycle (𝑗= 𝑛) of the 𝑖-th example in the Country.
The mathematical representation of a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation involves a collection of equations and inequalities, organized into separate subsets, as illustrated in Figure 4.
In an 𝑛 Country MAP, there exist both even and odd 𝑘 order Countries. The subset of Equations specifies that each 𝑖−𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑒 Country is assigned a distinct color. The subset of Inequations 2 dictates that neighboring Countries must have colors that are complementary to the internal color of the 𝑖−𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑒 Country. Utilizing 2.1.5-b) implies that all Inequalities 1 involving odd order cycles can be resolved with 3 colors. Consequently, solving the MAP system necessitates one color for each internal color (Equation Subset) and 3 complementary colors for the external colors (subset of odd Inequation 1).
It is imperative to demonstrate that the color set which colors one subset is consistent across all subsets. To establish this, let us assume the existence of 𝑓∗ as a fifth color. However, 𝑓∗ cannot be a part of the set {𝑓+ 𝑖∗𝑓; −𝑓+ 𝑖∗𝑓; 𝑓−𝑖∗𝑓; −𝑓−𝑖∗𝑓}, as this would imply that 𝒇∗ is not a genuine function (since any real function can be decomposed into four complex functions). Such a scenario contradicts the Implicit Function Theorem, which ensures the presence of implicit real 𝑓∗ functions in ℛ2 ( ℛ𝑛 ). Therefore, in this space, 𝑓∗ does indeed exist as a real function and is part of the set {𝑓+ 𝑖∗𝑓; −𝑓+ 𝑖∗𝑓; 𝑓−𝑖∗𝑓; −𝑓−𝑖∗𝑓}, thereby negating the need for a fifth color.
The Four-Color Theorem is demonstrated algebraically by formulating it as an Equation and Inequation System. A novel perspective on Real Equations is introduced through the transformation of Real Equations into Complex Equations as part of the resolution process. The method for this transformation, along with the rules for segment enumeration and solving the complex Equation and Inequation System, is exemplified in this modeling approach. The implications of observations 2.1.2.3.b -), 2.1.5-a), and 2.1.5-b) play a crucial role in reaching a solution. The simplicity offered by the Implicit Function Theorem is leveraged in the demonstration. An alternative strategy involves breaking down each segment into new real functions or approximating them with piecewise linear functions, splines, Bezier functions, etc., and reconstructing each segment and frontier as a combination of these functions. This reconstructed framework allows for the application of complex deployment across the entire set of equations and inequations. While the derivation presented may appear complex, it is left as a challenge for the reader. The author posits that the deployment of Real equations into Complex equations holds promise for both theoretical and applied fields in Mathematics and Physics. Acknowledging their non-mathematical background, the author acknowledges the need for more formalism in the text and recognizes the potential for further exploration and correction of any errors that may have been inadvertently made.
