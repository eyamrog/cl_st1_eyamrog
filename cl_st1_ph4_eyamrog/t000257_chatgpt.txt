During the current period of confinement resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, various reflections have emerged, highlighting the undeniable benefits that science can offer to society. Simple practices such as frequent handwashing, which have been widely advocated during the quarantine period, have been underscored by previous research findings. These observations serve to underscore the critical importance of continued investments in scientific research and development.
Carl Sagan's "The Demon-Haunted World," published in 1995, emphasized the importance of understanding the benefits of scientific discoveries and beliefs rather than expecting individuals to possess a comprehensive knowledge of scientific facts. Since the initial diagnosis of new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, the global spread of Covid-19 has led to a significant impact. Nearly fifty days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic, the statistics are staggering, with over 3.1 million confirmed cases and approaching 224,172 deaths reported (https://covid19.who.int).
What insights can be gleaned from Sagan's work in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic? In 1909, Young authored "A Brief Sketch of Semmelweis and His Work on Puerperal Sepsis," emphasizing the significance of Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis in advancing aseptic practices. Young noted that shortly after Lister introduced antisepsis in surgery, the medical community began applying these principles in obstetrics, echoing the truths Semmelweis had long advocated for (Young, 1909).
Semmelweis demonstrated that the practice of doctors washing their hands in hospitals significantly reduced mortality rates among parturient women. This seemingly mundane act has now, in recent weeks, acquired immense significance as one of the most effective measures in preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus. The act of handwashing, a basic yet crucial practice, along with other preventive measures advocated by the World Health Organization, challenges fundamental principles of evidence-based medicine (Sackett, 1997). Despite the widespread dissemination of these simple yet vital practices, including quarantine, some national governments have failed to adhere to them (Usher, 2020).
During this pandemic, various reflections have emerged, including the rapidity of government decision-making, the increasing effectiveness of telemedicine, advancements in medication and vaccine development, and the reorganization of healthcare systems. These aspects are inherently linked to evidence-based medicine. It is evident that sustained financial investments in research are crucial and should not be halted or reduced in this context.
In light of the lessons learned from the pandemic, it is possible, as Sagan articulated, to gain a comprehensive appreciation for the beauty and efficacy of science, leading to the realization that prioritizing scientific endeavors is advantageous for the entirety of humanity. This shift in perspective could potentially result in a global landscape free from the shadows of fear and uncertainty, instead fostering enlightenment through the promotion of scientific knowledge and fostering solidarity among nations. It is crucial to bear in mind that the historical context of epidemics can provide valuable insights and guidance, but only if individuals are well-informed about past events and respond with prudence (Jones, In Press).
