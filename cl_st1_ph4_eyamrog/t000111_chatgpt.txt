Brazilian Portuguese data presented in this paper provide support for the argument I am putting forth, which challenges Emonds' (1979) assertion that free relatives cannot possess appositive semantics or syntax. I contend that there are compelling reasons to consider the wh-sentence highlighted in the title of this paper as a free relative with appositive content, taking into account factors such as distribution, matching, the properties of "quem," and semantic implications. The type of sentence involving "quem" that I analyze here deviates from a typical (headed) appositive relative clause as it appears to be directly juxtaposed to the noun it refers to, essentially functioning as an equivalent. This unique structure poses challenges for the relativization process as outlined by Kayne (1994), further emphasizing the distinct nature of this sentence type.
Apposition, a common syntactic phenomenon in natural languages, becomes complex when considering its characterization. Numerous questions arise when examining such constructions, with a primary inquiry being the nature of apposition itself. Is it a structure with its own distinct syntax? This paper delves into the nature of appositive sentences in Brazilian Portuguese, exemplified by those enclosed in (1) below.
In this research article, I will contend that sentences (1) a and b feature a free relative clause with appositive content, rather than being classified as ordinary appositive relatives. The primary objective of this discussion is two-fold: firstly, to elucidate the structure and function of the wh- sentence within the utterances; and secondly, to differentiate them from conventional appositive relative clauses like the subordinate clause in (2).
There are empirical grounds to suggest that (1) and (2) exhibit distinct structures in Brazilian Portuguese, attributable to certain syntactic patterns exemplified by the paradigm provided below:
It is evident that the first element of the apposition can be elided in (3a) but not in (4a), and the positions of the nominal and the subordinate sentence can be switched in (3b) but not in (4b). Additionally, the wh-sentence can be extraposed in (3c), whereas the extraposition of the appositive clause is impeded in (4c).
It is imperative to seek an explanation for these phenomena, which appears to be rooted in the characterization of both sentence types and their syntactic-semantical behavior. To facilitate this analysis, I will initially provide a brief overview of apposition, followed by a detailed examination of appositive sentences, particularly focusing on the Brazilian Portuguese data presented in (1) and (2). The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 1 delves into the general concept of apposition and sentential apposition, while also addressing the typology of sentential apposition in Brazilian Portuguese. Moving on to Section 2, the discussion centers on Brazilian Portuguese QUEM sentences, with a specific emphasis on free relative sentences. Section 3 presents the analysis undertaken in this study, and Section 4 concludes with final remarks.
In this section, I provide a general discussion on the phenomenon of apposition, along with an examination of specific cases of apposition in Brazilian Portuguese.
Apposition is commonly defined as the relationship between what has been referred to as the anchor (Huddleston & Pullum, 2002) and the appositive expression itself, maintaining a form of equivalence (Heringa, 2011). In an appositional construction, two juxtaposed expressions, typically nominal, are presented, as illustrated in example (5).
Generative studies typically classify apposition as a dual phenomenon, delineating it based on functional properties into reformulative apposition and attributive apposition (McCawley, 1998; Cardoso & De Vries, 2010; Heringa, 2011). Griffiths (2015) provides an illustration of reformulative apposition through data in (6).
The apposition in (6) serves to offer additional information to the anchor (The big apple), providing a form of specification on this anchor. Regarding attributive apposition, Cardoso & De Vries (2010) suggest that the type of apposition in (7) is derived from a reduced relative clause, featuring an unpronounced copula and relative pronoun. This form of apposition includes some form of predication on the anchor.
In either scenario, both types of appositives are believed to be coordinated with their anchors, as supported by numerous relevant studies (refer to Döring, 2014; Ott, 2014). However, Griffiths (2015) may argue, supported by compelling empirical evidence, that reformulative apposition functions as a coordinated structure, while attributive appositives serve as components that integrate a finite parenthetical copular clause with unpronounced elements, specifically the copula and the relative pronoun.
I will not delve into this idea extensively here, given the current paper's scope; however, I may incorporate some generalizations made here into my argument. In the context of Brazilian Portuguese, traditional analysis typically interprets apposition as coordination. For example, Rocha Lima (2011) suggests that appositive phrases are nominal constructions that can directly follow another nominal phrase, with both referring to the same entity. This can be observed in examples (8) and (9).
Cunha & Cintra (2008) suggest a similar concept: appositive phrases possess a nominal nature, are coreferential to the nominal they are associated with, and are juxtaposed. However, Cunha & Cintra note that appositive constructions cannot exhibit an adjectival nature, as they form a unit that signifies the same entity as their related nominal without characterizing it. Moving forward, the subsequent section delves into sentential appositives, exploring their structure and functionality.
In addition to apposition structures like (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9), languages also exhibit appositive structures in (10) and (11) that require distinct treatment owing to their syntactic characteristics.
Regarding the data presented, it is essential to grasp the distinct structures of each type of appositive in relation to various derivational processes. The instances in (b) pertain to appositive relative clauses, which are believed to involve a head raising operation (as discussed in Kayne, 1994), whereas for (10) and (11)a, there appears to be no evident relativization process at play. Consequently, the derivation for (10)b and (11)b unfolds as follows:
In examples (10) and (11)a, the anchor appears to be base generated as the argument of the main verb, followed by a form of specification (the appositive juxtaposed CP) in a manner of adjunction.
Crosslinguistically, notable distinctions can be observed between (10)a and (11)a, stemming from varying lexical characteristics inherent to Portuguese as opposed to English. In Brazilian Portuguese, the equivalent structure to (10)a lacks an appositive clause, instead featuring a completive construction introduced by a preposition.
I will set aside this divergence for now and focus on examining the proximity and similarity between the apposition in (11)a and the data in (1), which is the primary objective of this paper. It is crucial to note that in Brazilian Portuguese, the structure of the apposition in (11)a differs syntactically from that in (11)b, where the latter consists of a relative clause while the former does not.
When examining Brazilian Portuguese appositive clauses, it becomes apparent that the language features two distinct types of sentential appositives: those with a nominal nature and those with an adjectival nature, akin to a relative clause. Examples illustrating this distinction can be seen in the bracketed sentences provided in (15) and (16).
Upon careful analysis of (15) and (16), it becomes apparent that they represent distinct structures with noticeable syntactic differences. This is particularly evident when considering the ability to elide the anchor in (15) but not in (16), as demonstrated by the examples provided in (17) and (18) below:
Considering the entire que sentence in (17) as replacing the elided anchor functioning as the complement of the verb disse, it becomes evident that the subordinate clause in (15) is directly chosen by the matrix verb, disse, owing to the selectional characteristics of a verb like disse (which could be described as a CP with a DP-like nature). In contrast, (16) may differ from (15) because the omission of the anchor is not permissible, as demonstrated in (18). This serves as evidence that the que sentence in this instance cannot be linked to the position of the anchor, as it functions as a standard CP (rather than a DP-like CP) in that particular context where a DP is being selected by the matrix verb. Furthermore, the discrepancy between (15) and (16) appears to be supported by the contrast illustrated in (19) and (20) below.
The data clearly demonstrate that the anchor and the apposition can interchange positions in (19) but not in (20), providing further evidence for the lack of correspondence between these structures in terms of their syntactic nature. Another aspect of this asymmetry is evident in the ability to extrapose the apposition, which is feasible in (15) but prohibited in (16), as illustrated in (21) and (22) below.
The conclusion drawn is that nominal appositive clauses (as exemplified in (15)) and appositive relative clauses (as seen in (16)), despite their semantic similarities, exhibit distinct syntactic structures. These divergences are of significant importance for the analysis of the wh- sentences that are the primary focus of this paper.
The current inquiry revolves around the connection between (15) and (1). Are they comparable in nature? What type of sentence does the wh-sentence in (1) represent? How does (16) differ from (1)? These aspects will be thoroughly examined in the subsequent sections of this study.
The wh-word "quem" serves multiple functions in Brazilian Portuguese. It can function as an interrogative pronoun, initiating a wh-question (23), a relative pronoun, introducing a relative CP (24), or a wh-phrase introducing a free relative clause (25).
Macambira (1998) examines the morphosyntactic aspects of quem, highlighting its versatility as an indefinite interrogative (23), an ordinary relative pronoun (24), and an indefinite relative (25). In each context, quem is shown to possess unique morphosyntactic features, distinguishing it as a distinct linguistic element.
When examining (23)a, there is no ambiguity regarding the nature of "quem"; it is evidently an interrogative pronoun with a distinct [+wh] feature, which causes the movement of this word from its original position to the clause's periphery (Chomsky, 1977; Cheng, 1991; Rizzi, 1991).
In (23)b, "quem" functions as an interrogative pronoun with a strong [+wh] feature, now situated within an embedded interrogative clause. Similar to (23)a, it undergoes wh-movement and is shifted to the forefront of the subordinate clause.
Regarding the type of quem found in sentences like (25), Rocha (1990) posits that it arises from a morphological amalgamation process, wherein a relative pronoun and its antecedent nominal are thought to be "condensed" or amalgamated into a single item. This representation is illustrated below:
Medeiros Junior (2005) concurs with Rocha's (1990) analysis, asserting the impossibility of inserting a DP as the antecedent of quem in sentences of this nature, as exemplified in (27).
It is worth noting that in (24), the term "quem" is connected to a nominal antecedent. Upon closer examination of the sentence, it becomes evident that the lexical item "quem" functions as a typical relative pronoun, as demonstrated in (28) where "quem" can be seamlessly substituted with the relative pronouns "que" or "a qual" (refer to Macambira, 1998; Medeiros Junior, 2006).
Let us delve further into the structure and types of sentences introduced by "quem" in Brazilian Portuguese.
As outlined in the preceding section, interrogatives, headed relatives, and free relatives can all be introduced by the word "quem." It is imperative to closely examine each type of sentence and analyze their respective syntactic behaviors.
An interrogative sentence serves as a primary means of seeking information. However, beyond its informational function, there are several pertinent syntactical considerations that must be taken into account when constructing such a sentence.
Since Chomsky's seminal work in 1977, it has been widely accepted that these sentences are derived through wh-movement. This means that the wh-phrase in such constructions is positioned differently from where it is originally generated. The author articulates this phenomenon in terms of a rule, highlighting the displacement of the wh-phrase within the sentence structure.
In a more recent study, wh-movement has been conceptualized as a checking operation essential for confirming a strong [+wh] feature in a wh-operator. This operation is only viable within a specific configuration, specifically a Spec-head configuration as proposed by Cheng (1991) and Rizzi (1991).
Both root and indirect questions are theoretically subject to the same operation, as they share similar structures. However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that indirect questions exhibit subtle differences from root interrogatives.
Root interrogatives, such as (32) a, do not appear to pose significant challenges in terms of their derivation or structure. They are considered to be CPs, which are derived through wh-movement of an operator to the periphery, specifically to the specifier of a Focus projection as proposed by Rizzi (1997). This conclusion is reached by the author through a detailed examination of the following data:
The conclusion drawn from this data is that if Focusing and wh-fronting cannot co-occur, it is possible that both the focalized constituent and the wh-phrase are vying for the same position. Therefore, wh-fronting may place wh-operators in Spec, FocP.
Embedded interrogatives, as discussed in Rizzi (1997) and Rizzi & Bocci (2017), present a slight variation compared to other constructions. While they are believed to result from wh-movement, Italian data suggests that the displaced wh-element may not be focalized. This is evident in the absence of similar restrictions observed in matrix clauses within an embedded context. In subordinate clauses, it is proposed that wh-operators occupy the Spec position of an EmbQ projection.
In Brazilian Portuguese, there are root and embedded interrogatives introduced by quem (34) and (35) respectively.
In the context of Brazilian Portuguese, Rizzi and Bocci's analysis appears to align seamlessly with the language's structure: 1) root and embedded interrogatives are generated through wh-movement; 2) within root interrogatives, the wh-element is emphasized; 3) in embedded interrogatives, the wh-operator undergoes movement even in the presence of a focalized constituent.
A relative clause, identified as a nominal modifier that integrates a complex DP (Chierchia, 2003), has been historically interpreted as being right-adjoined to N in early works (Chomsky, 1977). Nevertheless, recent analyses have redefined these structures as a complement of D within the complex DP (Kayne, 1994).
In Brazilian Portuguese, relative clauses have been analyzed as consistently involving wh-movement (Kato & Nunes, 2009) or occasionally not (Tarallo, 1984; Kennedy, 2007; Medeiros Junior, 2020). Setting aside this discrepancy, which will not be the focus of this paper, the relative CP in Portuguese is typically introduced by the word "que."
In the section discussing the concept of an appositive, it is noted that "quem" can function as a typical relative pronoun in Brazilian Portuguese, serving to introduce a headed relative clause.
It is worth noting that "quem" can only be linked to a nominal antecedent when it functions as the complement of a preposition; otherwise, the sentence structure is deemed unacceptable.
A free relative clause is a relative clause that is not linked to a noun in the specific syntactic context. Scholars have examined these constructions as DP constructions in argument position (Caponigro, 2002; Citko, 2004; Medeiros Junior, 2005; Marchesan, 2008). The data in (41) include free relative clauses.
The wh-sentences in (41) exhibit a striking resemblance to those in (35) but are structured more like DPs. In contrast, the embedded sentence in (35) forms a typical CP with prominent [+wh] characteristics, chosen by the main verb.
The matrix verb's selection properties play a crucial role in determining the acceptability of a question, as evident in (35) and (41). Additionally, free relatives are influenced by the matching effect, as discussed by Bresnan and Grimshaw (1977), Larson (1987), and Vogel (2003). This effect stipulates that the category and case of the wh-phrase must align with the verb's selection properties in both the matrix and relative clauses; any mismatch results in ungrammaticality. Notably, indirect questions do not adhere to this requirement, as illustrated by the contrast between (42) and (43).
According to Medeiros Junior (2015), Brazilian Portuguese free relatives appear to necessitate agreement even in subject position, despite numerous studies suggesting that this requirement does not extend to pro-drop languages (Hirshbühler & Rivero, 1983; Suñer, 1983, 1984; Grosu, 1994; Izvorski, 1996, 1997). This phenomenon is evident in the data presented below:
In the realm of semantics, free relatives are recognized for their maximalizing content (Grosu & Landman, 1998). The core concept suggests that free relatives featuring a realis verb form encompass a semantically CP-internal head along with external material outside the CP, specifically a phonologically empty pro. In this scenario, the semantics of the external material are entirely dictated by the CP's meaning (Grosu & Landman, 1998, p. 158). Consequently, the semantics of such a sentence inherently entail a maximal interpretation (ideally universal), contrasting with the definite reading found in interrogatives or cleft sentences.
Medeiros Junior (2014) posits that all free relatives in Brazilian Portuguese belong to the category of wh- ever, based on their semantic content. The author contends that the wh-words found in these structures are morphologically complex entities that arise from a sophisticated syntactic process involving the incorporation of the head D into C, which is activated by the existence of a null -ever suffix in D. In this linguistic context, wh-words within free relatives exhibit a universal interpretation. The universal semantics of free relatives in Brazilian Portuguese are therefore attributed to their syntactic derivation, as illustrated in diagram (46)9.
Now, we will delve into the analysis of the data presented in (1), which serves as the focal point of this study.
In a seminal study from 1979, Emonds evaluates the phenomenon of relative clauses and asserts that a free relative could have appositive content. It is nonsensical to consider a free structure, which inherently should not directly relate to realized syntactic material, as needing to be connected to an anchor, or antecedent.
In the subsequent sections, I will present arguments suggesting that Emonds may have been partially incorrect in his assumptions, particularly when considering the data from BP. Let us now clarify this matter.
Let us revisit the data presented in (1) as (47) and (16) as (48) below.
The wh-sentence in (47) closely resembles an ordinary relative appositive, much like the one in (48), as they both contain appositive content and appear to be introduced by a relative pronoun. Yet, upon closer examination of their syntactic behavior, it becomes apparent that they are distinct. As previously highlighted in the introductory section, this difference becomes evident.
In (47), eliding the anchor is feasible, whereas in (48), it is not possible.
In (47), the anchor and the appositive have the flexibility to interchange their positions, whereas in (48), this interchangeability is not possible.
In (47), many speakers accept an utterance where the wh-sentence can be extraposed, while in (48), this extraposition is never accepted.
However, upon closer examination of (15), which is reiterated as (52), an intriguing observation emerges: it exhibits identical behavior to that of (47).
What could be the underlying issue in this scenario? Let us endeavor to unravel this enigma.
As discussed in section 1.3, the appositive in (52) functions as a standard CP (referred to here as a DP-like CP), directly chosen by the main verb and placed alongside the nominal anchor "uma só coisa." This implies that the Wh-sentence in (47) could also be positioned next to the nominal "Um fã teu." Conventional appositive relatives are expected to operate differently; specifically, an appositive relative clause cannot be juxtaposed to the anchor because the anchor represents the nominal undergoing relativization, which has been extracted from within the relative clause (refer to Kayne, 1994; Bianchi, 1999).
Syntactically, the head of the appositive relative in (48) functions as the complement of a higher D, while the relativized NP remains within CP, specifically in its Spec position.
The nature of the wh-sentence in (47) prompts inquiry. It is plausible to consider it a free relative clause. Several reasons support this interpretation. Primarily, upon examining (47), it appears that the wh-sentence functions as both the external argument of the matrix verb and the anchor to which it is juxtaposed.
Juxtaposition differs from modification as highlighted by Mathews (1981); while modification is present in example (54), it is absent in (47). Furthermore, as previously discussed in the section on headed relative clauses, it was established that standard headed relative clauses introduced by QUEM are exclusively permissible in Brazilian Portuguese when QUEM is preceded by a preposition.
This restriction does not appear to have an impact (47). Additionally, as highlighted in the section on free relative clauses, it is imperative for Brazilian Portuguese free relatives to consistently align; sentences that do not align are deemed unacceptable.
The wh-sentence in (47) appears to be subject to the matching requirement, where a matching sentence, (58)a, is acceptable, while a mismatch like (58)b would render the sentence unacceptable. Deleting the preposition, as shown in (58)c, resolves the mismatch problem, thereby rendering the sentence acceptable once more.
A fourth argument pertains to semantics: in free relative clauses, BP free relatives exhibit maximalizing content, wherein wh-phrases convey universal meanings. This observation aligns well with the assertion made in (47).
Upon careful examination, it can be inferred that the wh-sentence in (47) functions as a free relative clause with appositive content, rather than a typical appositive relative clause. This suggests that the wh-sentence in (47) is not derived from a headed appositive relative clause.
If a free relative in Brazilian Portuguese is indeed derived as proposed in diagram (46), it is essential to note that the C head and the D head engaged in the relativization process must be adjacent. Without this adjacency, it would be challenging to account for the head incorporation process evident in the form of the wh-element "heading" these structures.
One could argue that the wh-word QUEM in (47) appears to align with both the relativizer and the antecedent (the relativized nominal) simultaneously, as demonstrated in (60) below.
It is evident that the relativized nominal in (47) is not "Um fã teu," but rather "uma pessoa." This adjacency between the relativizer in C and the antecedent DP allows for the incorporation process as outlined in (46) above.
Hence, it is imperative that a free relative clause be derived from a restrictive relative clause. Consequently, it can be inferred that Emonds' assertion in 1979 regarding the absence of an appositive counterpart for free relatives holds some validity. It is evident that the derivation of free relatives necessitates the use of restrictive relatives; however, the evidence presented in (1)/(47) indicates the existence of appositive free relative clauses. The question then arises: how can these appositive free relative clauses be characterized?
Derived from restrictive relatives through a process of head incorporation, these elements result in the anchor and the relativized constituent being distinct syntactic entities.
They are positioned in juxtaposition and hold equal significance to the anchor.
They have the ability to interchange positions with the anchor.
Extraposition is a phenomenon where elements within a sentence are moved to the end for various reasons, such as emphasizing certain information or improving the overall flow of the sentence. This process allows for a more structured and coherent presentation of ideas, enhancing the clarity and readability of the text.
In this study, an examination of peculiar quem-clauses in Brazilian Portuguese is undertaken. It is argued that these quem-clauses should not be classified as typical appositive relative clauses or nominal appositive constructions, given their distinct syntactic characteristics.
One of the primary arguments against interpreting the quem-sentences in (1) as conventional appositive relatives is the potential for omitting the anchor nominal in (1), a feature not found in genuine appositive relative clauses where the anchor is the name being relativized. Additionally, I contended that in expressions like (1), the anchor and the appositive can interchange positions, a phenomenon contrary to the fixed structure observed in the presence of an appositive relative clause.
I have attempted to demonstrate that the quem-sentence in the data under analysis appears to be juxtaposed to the anchor, in contrast to the typical structure of appositive relative clauses where the anchor is assumed to be extracted from within the subordinate clause (as discussed in Kayne, 1994). Additionally, these quem-sentences exhibit the ability to be extraposed in (1), which differs from the behavior of authentic appositive relatives.
The primary assertion put forth in this discussion is that the quem-type sentences under consideration are free relative clauses containing appositive content. If these sentences truly qualify as free relatives according to the framework outlined by Medeiros Junior (2014), as I am endeavoring to demonstrate, the antecedent D head and the relative CP head have undergone amalgamation via head incorporation. This implies that the relativized nominal does not serve as the anchor, but rather something different (the amalgamated DP); this would consequently account for the potential omission of the anchor in these constructions.
The analysis reveals that Brazilian Portuguese sentences, exemplified here, demonstrate the presence of appositive free relatives. The subordinate wh-sentences in (1) serve as instances of this phenomenon. This assertion implies that the wh-sentence in (1) should adhere to specific matching criteria (refer to Marchesan, 2008; Medeiros Junior, 2005, 2014), a notion supported by the data examination. Furthermore, if these sentences are indeed free relatives, they must embody a maximalizing interpretation, equating to a universal significance in Brazilian Portuguese (see Medeiros Junior, 2005, 2006; 2009, 2014), a trait seemingly validated by the data scrutiny.
These findings appear to undermine Emonds' (1979) assertion regarding the impossibility of a free relative with appositive content, suggesting that this generalization may be somewhat inaccurate. Additional insights into the analytical approach employed in this study will be explored in forthcoming research endeavors.
I extend my gratitude to the anonymous reviewers for their meticulous examination of this paper and valuable contributions, as well as to Ezekiel Panitz for his invaluable language review.
