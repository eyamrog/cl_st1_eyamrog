A cluster of pneumonia was initially documented in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, with a coronavirus identified as the causative pathogen, subsequently named Severe Acute Coronavirus Syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This led to the emergence of COVID-19, a disease that has rapidly spread globally. The mortality rates associated with COVID-19 in Europe continue to rise, with challenges in accurately gauging its lethality. Notably, older individuals exhibit a higher mortality rate compared to seasonal influenza. Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in diagnosing COVID-19, while Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) is essential for assessing Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). Although Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) has been considered the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, there are instances where CT demonstrates higher sensitivity than RT-PCR. Here, we present a confirmed case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a 59-year-old woman, revealing a slight decrease in LVEF without troponin-I elevation, potentially indicating COVID-19-induced cardiomyopathy due to heightened cytokine release. This study represents the first documented association between TTE and CT images in COVID-19, showing a correlation between deteriorating TTE findings and progressive CT images.
A 59-year-old female presented with a four-day history of fever following a cold. Prior to hospital admission, she experienced fever and cough but did not report symptoms such as chest tightness, chest pain, chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Despite treatment with antifebrile agents, her condition did not improve, leading to her admission to the outpatient clinic at BHT Clinic Tema Hospital. Notably, four days before seeking medical attention, she had contact with a relative who had recently traveled from Europe. Her medical history included bariatric surgery three years prior, and she had ongoing conditions of type II diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Upon hospitalization on March 20, 2020, she continued to have a fever, reaching a peak temperature of 39.5 °C, a heart rate of 119 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg. Additionally, she exhibited tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 24/min and adequate oxygenation at 95% ambient air saturation. A positive identification of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was confirmed via RT-PCR from a throat swab, with negative results for other respiratory viruses and pathogens. Computed tomography findings were consistent with previous case reports, and laboratory results indicated leukopenia, lymphopenia, slightly elevated CRP levels, and low procalcitonin levels. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) using a 3.5-MHz transducer revealed a normal LVEF of 65% at admission, in line with standard TTE findings.
The patient was isolated and commenced on nasal high flow therapy for respiratory insufficiency, along with a treatment regimen consisting of oseltamivir (75mg/capsule, 1 capsule twice daily for 5 days), azithromycin (500mg on the first day, followed by 250mg once daily for 4 days), paracetamol (1gr/100 mL, twice daily), N-acetylcysteine ampule (300mg/3ml IV, twice daily), enoxaparin (4000 anti-Xa IU/0.4 mL, once daily), methylprednisolone (40mg IV, once daily for 5 days), esomeprazole ampule (40 mg IV, once daily), and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (200mg/tablet, 400mg twice daily on the first day, followed by 200mg twice daily for 6 days). After 5 days of treatment, the patient's temperature normalized and symptoms resolved. However, on day 6, a repeat CT scan revealed increasing expansion of ground-glass opacities (GGOs) progressing to "crazy paving consolidations" (Figure 1: C-D). Additionally, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured at 52%, with normal troponin-I levels. Based on the CT findings and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) results, favipiravir was added to the treatment regimen (200mg on the first day, followed by 1600mg twice daily and 600mg twice daily for 4 days) in place of oseltamivir. By day 12, a follow-up CT scan indicated absorption of previous consolidations and GGOs in both lungs, with residual fibrous lesions suggestive of organizing pneumonia (Figure 1: E-F). The LVEF improved to 65%, a repeat RT-PCR was negative, and the patient was discharged. No further follow-up CT scans were conducted.
The transmission of the infection primarily occurs through respiratory droplets, with fever and dry cough being the predominant clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in patients, often accompanied by body aches, fatigue, and a higher prevalence among individuals aged between 40 and 60 years. Additional symptoms such as headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea may also manifest in some cases. Severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating intubation in certain patients. While the clinical signs of COVID-19 may resemble those of typical upper respiratory tract infections, specific details are discernible through chest CT scans. However, distinguishing COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias based solely on CT findings is challenging, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of epidemiological history and confirmation through RT-PCR testing. Viral infections, including influenza, have been associated with acute myocarditis, ranging from asymptomatic to severe cases contributing to hemodynamic instability. Autopsy studies from past influenza pandemics have reported significant rates of myocarditis complications, indicating a potential fatal risk during a pandemic outbreak. Research has identified viral antigens in myocardial tissues, with PCR analysis revealing the presence of various viral genes in biopsy samples. While the exact pathogenesis of COVID-19-related cardiomyopathy or myocarditis remains unclear, existing literature suggests a potential role of endothelial dysfunction in their development. Electron microscopic observations in murine influenza myocarditis models have shown infiltrating lymphocytes directly interacting with cardiac myocytes, along with proinflammatory cytokines implicated in acute myocarditis pathogenesis. Given the known cytokine over-release in COVID-19, further investigation into the pathogenesis of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy in this context is warranted.
Our hypothesis posits that cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1, IL‑6, IL-8, IL-10, recognized for their cardio-depressant properties, along with endogenous and exogenous catecholamines pivotal in sepsis, could potentially induce cardio-depressant effects in COVID-19. Furthermore, we postulated that the cardiomyopathy observed might be reversible by eliminating cytokines from circulation during the recovery phase. Prior research has shown that inhibiting trypsin-mediated viral replication, as well as the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases and cytokines, significantly enhanced cardiac function in mice infected with influenza A virus. In light of these discoveries, it is imperative to promptly identify critically-ill patients and initiate treatment swiftly to avert fatal complications. Utilizing a range of diagnostic tools and treatment modalities during follow-up is crucial. Notably, Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) emerges as a cost-effective and convenient means to monitor these patients. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of specific drugs for treating COVID-19 patients. Drawing from the treatment experiences of SARS and MERS, certain medications like hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, oseltamivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir may exhibit beneficial effects on COVID-19 patients.
In conclusion, our patient did not exhibit myocarditis as evidenced by the absence of troponin-I elevation; however, we hypothesize that she may have developed cardiomyopathy as a result of cytokine overproduction. Treatment for the co-occurrence of cardiomyopathy and COVID-19 in this case involved a regimen of hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, azithromycin, and ultimately favipiravir. It is important to note that the efficacy of these medications in treating the condition remains unproven and warrants further investigation.
