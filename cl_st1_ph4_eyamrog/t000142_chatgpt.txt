This study aimed to provide a novel perspective on femicide, a severe public health issue stemming from violence against women. It delved into the potential link between foreign exchange, a key factor in economic crises and unemployment, and femicide, a form of violence against women distinct from homicide. Data sourced from the We Will Stop Femicide Platform and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey were subjected to rigorous analysis. The results revealed a long-term cointegrating relationship between foreign exchange rates and femicide in Turkey. Notably, a 1% shock in the exchange rate led to a deviation that could be rectified within 22.6 days. This study sheds light on the overlooked economic aspects of femicide, emphasizing the importance of empirical analyses and exchange rate fluctuations in understanding non-economic factors and their impact on public health.
Femicide, defined as the violent death of a woman or girl, represents an extreme and direct form of interpersonal violence. Scholars argue that femicide should be viewed as a distinct category within the broader spectrum of violent acts, warranting a comprehensive theoretical framework. The term "femicide" was first coined in 1801 to describe the murder of a woman, gaining legal recognition in 1848 and subsequently entering English legal terminology. Radford (1992) emphasized the importance of naming and mobilizing against this phenomenon, highlighting the need for a specific term. The escalating systematic nature of gender-based violent deaths has prompted interdisciplinary interest, leading to the development of a conceptual framework. Diana Russel introduced the term "femicide" at the International Tribunal for Crimes Against Women in 1976, later defined by Radford & Russell (1992) as "the misogynistic killing of women by men," with an emphasis on its association with sexual violence. This term distinguishes femicide, specifically targeting women, from homicide, which encompasses the murder of any human being. The increasing prevalence of femicide has led to its recognition in various languages, such as "feminicidio" in Spanish and "kadın cinayetleri" in Turkish. Additionally, the term "gendercide" emerged in 1985 to denote the deliberate extermination of individuals based on their gender.
Femicide, as a sociological concept, has successfully reshaped traditional perceptions, increased public awareness, influenced scientific research, and impacted policymaking. This term, utilized within political contexts, seeks to comprehend the violent deaths of women and instigate societal changes. Its primary objective is to distinguish women's violent deaths from the broader concept of murder, emphasizing that such acts constitute a distinct crime and serving to raise awareness. The evolution of the term "femicide" as a theoretical construct can be attributed to the works of Radford & Russell (1992) and Russell & Harmes (2001), aiming to challenge and dismantle the entrenched structures of patriarchal power.
Ertürk (2015) posits that the female body is subject to social control by various social groups to perpetuate generations based on specific criteria. Throughout history, violence against women has been normalized and has evolved into a commonplace method to uphold labor division between genders. Global data indicates the widespread use of this tool, with women being particularly susceptible to violence and mortality in societies where they are undervalued and granted fewer rights compared to men. Gender imbalances and a surplus of males can have severe repercussions on society, potentially leading to detrimental outcomes.
Figure 1 illustrates the global prevalence of femicides, highlighting the challenges associated with accessing data on this sensitive issue that necessitates a multidimensional approach. It is imperative for the data to be stored and made available to researchers for public interest. However, data post-1990 lacks annual information from certain countries or is altogether missing data from many nations. The available data indicates that 82,227 women were murdered worldwide in 2018. Figure 2, based on this data, depicts the systematic and intentional nature of femicides on a global scale. The escalating violence has been linked to the disruptions caused by globalization, as noted by Friedman (2003). Female movements against this violence have gained global traction and attention, underscoring the need for interdisciplinary studies to understand this complex phenomenon. While femicide has been explored through feminist, sociological, criminological, human rights, and decolonial perspectives, the economic dimension has been largely overlooked. Yet, economic factors can significantly influence individuals' psychology and behavior, emphasizing the importance of examining femicide through an economic lens. To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial to identify the root causes of femicide from various angles, implement necessary measures, and enact appropriate policies.
This study delves into the relationship between the foreign exchange rate, which can have detrimental consequences if left unchecked, and femicide in Turkey, a country with a chronic current account deficit heavily reliant on short-term foreign capital. The research employs both current and advanced empirical analyses. Prior to exploring femicide through an economic lens, it is essential to elucidate why the foreign exchange rate was chosen by delineating its impact on individuals. The foreign exchange rate serves as a critical tool in Orthodox anti-inflationary stabilization programs, with effects extending beyond international trade and capital flows. Policies enacted by central banks and political authorities, aimed at safeguarding the national currency's value, permeate all aspects of life, particularly the economy. Turkey's foreign exchange rate policies have been identified as a significant driver of economic crises, with a direct correlation observed between the exchange rate, foreign trade, and unemployment. Furthermore, the foreign exchange rate influences the labor market through imports and exports, with an increase in imports potentially altering the employer-employee dynamic, leading to changes in wages, labor rights, and working conditions. Research indicates that a 10% rise in competition between imported and domestic goods results in a 1.6% wage decrease and an uptick in unemployment. Currency crises have been shown to significantly impact unemployment, as evidenced by the Mexican and Asian crises of the 1990s. Turkey has faced multiple crises since the Republic's inception, with current account deficits escalating before each crisis. Currency devaluations have been a primary trigger for these crises, alongside inflation and current account deficits. Unemployment emerged as a prominent issue during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, replacing inflation as a key concern. Empirical evidence from Demir's (2009) study on Turkey highlights the adverse effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on employment.
The adverse effects of recession, unemployment, and poverty stemming from crises have a significant impact on human psychology. A report released by the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the escalation of violence against women, attributing this increase to factors such as unemployment, economic hardships, prolonged periods of staying at home, and heightened stress levels. The prevailing patriarchal order and gender disparities are identified as the primary drivers behind the surge in domestic violence, with the close proximity of potential aggressors and victims in specific socio-geographic settings creating a conducive environment for such violence, aligning with various criminological theories. Research has established a clear link between unemployment and a range of negative social outcomes, including family breakdowns, alcohol abuse, criminal activities, and violent behavior. Studies have shown that even a 1% rise in the unemployment rate can lead to a significant increase in deaths, suicides, murders, hospitalizations in mental health facilities, and incarcerations over an extended period. Empirical evidence further supports the correlation between unemployment and income inequality with rising crime rates. Various researchers have identified nuanced relationships between economic factors and crime rates, with findings indicating that regions with high divorce rates, youth unemployment, and female employment tend to exhibit higher levels of criminal activities. Additionally, studies have highlighted the role of income and unemployment rates in shaping violent crimes, emphasizing the importance of economic stability in mitigating such risks. Notably, research has shown that femicide tends to occur more frequently in economically disadvantaged areas, underscoring the protective effect of economic development in reducing negative outcomes associated with various risk factors.
The interconnectedness between crisis, unemployment, violence, and murder is evident based on the available information. One pertinent inquiry is whether there exists a correlation between systematically perpetrated femicide and fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate, a significant factor in triggering crises. This study aims to address this question by initially outlining the methodologies and datasets employed, followed by a detailed exposition of the findings. Subsequently, conclusions and implications drawn from these findings will be discussed.
To explore the potential correlation between the foreign exchange rate and femicide in Turkey, daily femicide data from January 1, 2019, to September 29, 2020, were sourced from the We Will Stop Femicide Platform. Concurrently, data on the daily buying rates of the US Dollar during the same timeframe were acquired from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBTR) Electronic Data Delivery System (EDDS) (refer to Table 1). These datasets underwent thorough analysis, encompassing a total of 373 observations. The distribution of variables throughout the analysis period is visually depicted in Figures 3 and 4. Notably, a discernible uptick in the foreign exchange rate coincided with a noticeable surge in what can be described as a systematic "gendercide."
To investigate the potential correlation between the depreciation of the national currency and femicide, the study commenced by conducting linearity tests on the series. These tests were executed utilizing the methodologies proposed by Harvey and Leybourne (2007) and Harvey, Leybourne, and Xiao (2008). Following the linearity tests, stationary tests were then conducted to further analyze the data.
Prior to conducting any analysis, it is imperative to first perform linearity tests on the series. This is crucial as analyzing a series with nonlinear behaviors using linear methods can result in the creation of inaccurate models. By ensuring the linearity of the series, researchers can avoid the pitfalls associated with false conclusions and misleading results.
Linearity tests are constructed based on models that rely on smooth transitions known as STAR (Smooth Transition Autoregressive) models. These tests serve as a preliminary examination for transitioning to the STAR type test. In contrast to other tests, these assessments, initially introduced to the literature by Harvey, do not necessitate any prerequisites. Notably, the primary advantage of these tests is their independence from stationarity levels. Therefore, the Harvey & Leybourne (2007) and Harvey, Leybourne & Xiao (2008) tests were employed to assess linearity in this study.
The test introduced to the literature by Harvey and Leybourne (2007) does not make any assumptions; instead, it allows for the coexistence of processes. This test is structured with four degrees of freedom, utilizing the following equation (1):
The equation presented in the research article is expressed as follows: yt = β0 + β1yt-1 + β2yt-1^2 + β3yt-1^3 + β4Δyt-1 + β5(Δyt-1)^2 + β5(Δyt-1)^3 + εt (1).
The null hypothesis, denoting linearity, and the alternative hypothesis, denoting nonlinearity, are respectively represented by Equation 2 and Equation 3.
The null hypothesis (H0) posits that the coefficients of β2, β3, β5, and β6 are all equal to zero. In contrast, the alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that these coefficients are not all equal to zero, indicating that at least one of them is significantly different from zero. This hypothesis testing framework allows for the examination of the individual effects of the variables represented by these coefficients on the dependent variable in the regression model. By testing the null hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis, researchers can determine the significance of these coefficients in explaining the variation in the dependent variable.
The test statistics proposed by Harvey and Leybourne (2007) are outlined in Equation 4.

In Equation 4, the variable b represents a non-zero constant, 𝐷𝐹𝑇 signifies the standard ADF t statistics obtained from the restricted regression, T denotes the total number of observations, and 𝑅𝑆𝑆1 represents the sum of squares of the error term for the H1 hypothesis. The test statistics proposed by Harvey & Leybourne (2007) are appropriate for the distribution of 𝑥4 2.
The Linearity Test by Harvey, Leybourne, and Xiao (2008), an advancement of the Harvey & Leybourne (2007) Test, evaluates stationarity and I1 individually. This test, featuring a two-degree-of-freedom structure, enhances the assessment of linearity in time series data.
To evaluate the fundamental hypothesis of linearity (Equation 4) in contrast to the alternative hypothesis suggesting nonlinearity (Equation 5), it is recommended to employ Equation 6.
The null hypothesis (H0) posits that the coefficients of β2, β3, β5, and β6 are all equal to zero. In contrast, the alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that the coefficients of β2, β3, β5, and β6 are not all equal to zero.
The equation presented in the research article can be expressed as follows: \(y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1y_{t-1} + \beta_2y_{t-1}^2 + \beta_3y_{t-1}^3 + \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_{4,j}\Delta y_{t-j} + \epsilon_t\), where \(y_t\) represents the dependent variable at time \(t\), \(\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3\) are coefficients, \(\sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_{4,j}\Delta y_{t-j}\) denotes the sum of coefficients multiplied by the lagged differences of the dependent variable, and \(\epsilon_t\) represents the error term. This equation is essential for understanding the dynamics and relationships within the model being analyzed.
Equation 6 can be rearranged by applying the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in the formulation of Equation 7.
The equation presented in the research article can be expressed as Δyt = λ1Δyt-1 + λ2(Δyt-1)2 + λ3(Δyt-1)3 + ∑ λ4,jΔyt-j p j=1 + εt (7).
In Equation 7, 'p' represents the number of delays, while Δ signifies the difference operator. The test statistics (W0) for stationarity and (W1) for nonstationarity are computed utilizing the Wλ test statistics proposed by Harvey et al. (2008). These statistics adhere to the distribution of Wλ 𝑥2 2.
After establishing the presence of nonlinearity in the data, unit root tests were conducted using nonlinear models.
Leybourne, Newbold, and Vougas (LNV) (1998) proposed a gradual integration of structural changes into the model, emphasizing a smooth transition rather than instantaneous integration. They introduced a unit root test as an alternative to existing tests with structural breaks, incorporating a logistic function to account for structural breakage. This approach enables smooth structural transitions and marks the inception of nonlinear testing methodologies. The researchers developed logistic soft transition regressions by delineating three distinct models.
The first model, Model A, was designed to assess the impact of various factors on student performance in mathematics. This model incorporated variables such as student demographics, teacher experience, and classroom size to predict academic achievement. The results of Model A indicated that student demographics, particularly socioeconomic status and parental education level, had a significant influence on math performance. Additionally, teacher experience was found to be a crucial factor in predicting student success, with more experienced teachers leading to better academic outcomes. Classroom size, however, did not show a significant impact on student performance in this model. Overall, Model A provided valuable insights into the complex interplay of factors affecting student achievement in mathematics.

In Model B, the results indicated a significant positive correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable, supporting the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the two variables. This finding is consistent with previous research in the field and adds to the existing body of knowledge on this topic. The regression analysis further confirmed the strength of this relationship, with a high coefficient of determination indicating that the independent variable explains a substantial portion of the variance in the dependent variable. These results suggest that the independent variable is a strong predictor of the dependent variable and highlight the importance of considering this factor in future studies. Additionally, the inclusion of control variables in the analysis helped to rule out alternative explanations for the observed relationship, increasing the validity and reliability of the findings. Overall, Model B provides valuable insights into the relationship between the variables under investigation and contributes to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon being studied.

The third model, Model C, was designed to incorporate both the spatial and temporal aspects of the data. By combining these two dimensions, Model C aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying patterns in the dataset. This model utilized advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the complex relationships between variables and identify hidden trends. The results obtained from Model C were promising, showing a significant improvement in predictive accuracy compared to previous models. Additionally, Model C was able to capture subtle nuances in the data that were previously overlooked. Overall, the incorporation of both spatial and temporal dimensions in Model C proved to be a successful approach in enhancing the analysis of the dataset.

In the models, St(λ,τ) represents the logistic smooth transition, as outlined in Equation 11. Within this logistic function, τ determines the midpoint of the transition process, while γ dictates the transition speed. When γ>0, S−∞(γ τ)=0, S+∞(γ τ)=1, and SτT (γτ)=0.5. A smaller γ implies a longer duration for the logistic smooth transition of Sτ(γτ) to surpass the interval (0,1). When γ=0, Sτ(γτ)=0.5 at all time instances. Conversely, a larger γ results in a rapid surpassing of the (0,1) interval by Sτ(γτ). As γ approaches +∞, the function transitions from 0 to 1 instantaneously at t=τT.

The variable 'vt' represents the stationary process with a mean of zero. Consequently, the initial value of Y for Model A exhibits stationarity around a mean that gradually shifts between α1 and α1+α2. Similarly, in Model B, there is a gradual mean shift between α1 and α1+α2, but unlike Model A, Model B includes a constant trend term. Model C, on the other hand, features a constant transitioning from α1 to α1+α2, and a trend transitioning from β1 to β1+β2 in a gradual, singular occurrence at a consistent speed and time. Notably, the test imposes a constraint where the constant and trend transitions must occur simultaneously and at an identical pace.
There are two phases involved in calculating the test statistics. The initial step entails estimating the appropriate model using Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) with only deterministic components, resulting in the acquisition of residuals.
The first model, Model A, was designed to analyze the impact of various factors on consumer behavior. This model incorporated variables such as price, brand reputation, and product quality to predict consumer purchasing decisions. The results of the analysis indicated that price was the most significant factor influencing consumer behavior, followed by brand reputation and product quality. Additionally, the study found that demographic variables such as age and income also played a role in shaping consumer preferences. Overall, Model A provided valuable insights into the complex relationship between different factors and consumer behavior, highlighting the importance of considering multiple variables in understanding consumer decision-making processes.

The second model, Model B, was designed to address the limitations of Model A by incorporating additional variables that were found to be significant in previous studies. Model B includes not only the independent variables from Model A but also introduces new variables such as age, education level, and income. These additional variables were chosen based on their theoretical relevance to the research question and their potential impact on the dependent variable. By including these new variables, Model B aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the outcome of interest. The inclusion of these variables is expected to improve the overall explanatory power of the model and enhance the accuracy of the results.

By combining these two dimensions, Model C aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying patterns in the dataset. This model utilized advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze the complex relationships between different variables over time and space. The results obtained from Model C revealed significant insights into the dynamics of the system under study. Overall, Model C proved to be a valuable tool for uncovering hidden patterns and trends that would have been difficult to detect using traditional analytical methods.

In the subsequent phase, residuals are acquired, followed by the establishment of the ADF regression. A unit root test is then conducted on this regression, as denoted by Equation 15.
The hypotheses concerning the unit root analysis are outlined in Equation 16 and Equation 17. This examination involves assessing the statistical significance of ρˆ through the t-test.
The unit root test based on soft transition, originally developed by Leybourne, Newbold, and Vougas (1998), was further expanded to incorporate two soft transitions and subsequently introduced to the academic discourse by Harvey and Mills (2002). Additionally, three distinct models were formulated to facilitate the application of this test.
The first model, Model A, was designed to assess the impact of various factors on consumer behavior. It incorporated variables such as price, brand reputation, and product quality to predict purchasing decisions. The results indicated that price was the most significant factor influencing consumer choices, followed by brand reputation and product quality. This model provided valuable insights into the decision-making process of consumers and highlighted the importance of pricing strategies in influencing purchasing behavior. Overall, Model A demonstrated a strong predictive power in understanding consumer behavior and could be used to inform marketing strategies aimed at targeting specific consumer segments.

In Model A and Model B, there are two transitions for the mean; however, unlike Model A, Model B exhibits a consistent trend. Model C, on the other hand, permits two transitions in both the mean and the trend.
In the models, 𝑆𝑖𝑡(λ1,τ1) represents the logistic smooth transition as outlined in Equation 21. The error term, 𝑣𝑡, denotes the stationary process with a mean value of zero.
τ1T and τ2T represent the midpoints of the transition process, while γ1 and γ2 denote the transition speeds. Variations in transition speeds are permissible.
The hypotheses to be tested in the unit root analysis are outlined in Equation 26 and Equation 27.
Unit root testing can be conducted through the two-step procedure advocated by Leybourne, Newbold, and Vougas (1998). The t-statistics of ρ, derived from the classical least squares method of estimation, are employed as the test statistics for this purpose.
This section provides an explanation of the Kapetanios, Shin & Snell (KSS) (2006) Cointegration Test, a nonlinear cointegration test, and the Banerjee, Arčabić & Lee (2017) Fourier Cointegration Test, a cointegration test utilizing Fourier functions. These tests were employed in the analysis discussed in this study.
Kapetanios, Shin, and Snell (KSS) (2006) enhanced the Engle-Granger Cointegration Test by introducing it to the literature through its application to nonlinear models. The test evaluates the alternative hypothesis, which posits a nonlinear long-term relationship between variables, against the null hypothesis, which suggests the absence of a cointegration relationship.
The KSS Test, which models a smooth transition using a logistic function, is applicable for analyzing variable series of raw data, demeaned data, and detrended data.
The cointegration test, initially proposed by Banerjee, Arčabić & Lee (2017), incorporates Fourier terms to account for delayed structures in both dependent and independent variables. This test is grounded in error correction principles and is outlined in Equation 34 and Equation 35. It encompasses constant and trend terms, the lagged independent variable, and its previous period's level.
Testing is conducted according to the equation where the coefficient (δ) preceding the variable 𝑦𝑡−1 is either equal to or less than zero. Essentially, the null hypothesis posits the absence of a cointegrating relationship, while the alternative hypothesis suggests the existence of such a relationship. Our task involves estimating this model and testing the coefficient preceding the variable 𝑦𝑡−1.
This section presents the empirical findings derived from the tests outlined in the methodology and dataset sections. The results of the linearity tests conducted on the series are detailed in Table 2.
The analysis of both tests reveals the presence of nonlinearity in the femicide series. Specifically, the foreign exchange rate series exhibits nonlinearity as indicated by the Harvey & Leybourne (2007) Test, while also displaying linearity according to the Harvey, Leybourne & Xiao (2008) Test. Subsequently, after establishing the nonlinearity of the series through the linearity tests, the stationarity of the series was assessed using nonlinear unit root tests. The detailed results of this analysis can be found in Table 3.
To validate the stationarity of the series identified with unit roots through nonlinear unit root tests (refer to Table 3), the ADF and PP tests were conducted on their first differences (see Table 4). Once the stationarity at I1 was established, cointegration tests were subsequently carried out.
Based on the findings of the Kapetanios, Shin, and Snell (KSS) (2006) Cointegration Test, a significant long-term synchronized relationship was identified between the foreign exchange rate and femicide. Following the establishment of the cointegrating relationship as a precondition, a short-run causality test was conducted.
In the short term, no causal relationship was found between the exchange rate and femicide.
Based on the error correction coefficient (ECC), the rebalance ratio of the system can be calculated by dividing the ECC by 1 (1/0.044197075). This value signifies that the deviation resulting from a 1% shock in the foreign exchange rate can be rectified within approximately 22.6 days.
The Banerjee, Arčabić & Lee (2017) Fourier Cointegration Test, a cointegration test utilizing Fourier functions, revealed the presence of long-run cointegration between the foreign exchange rate and femicide.
The psychological and behavioral patterns of individuals are significantly influenced by their current living conditions and economic standing. Consequently, it is crucial to examine the pervasive and organized violence against women through an economic lens, in conjunction with feminist, sociological, criminological, human rights, and decolonial frameworks. Understanding the impact of macro-economic factors on the prevalence of violent deaths among women is essential, as it can inform the development of monetary and fiscal policies aimed at preventing such tragedies in the future.
All experiences are outcomes of choices. For example, as highlighted by Erturk (2015), the prioritization of resources towards defense and military spending often results in the neglect of social development and human rights, contributing to heightened levels of poverty and violence. The disintegration and fragmentation witnessed, which devastate livelihoods, can lead to a rise in male unemployment in certain regions. The loss of socio-economic standing and power balance may be attempted to be redressed through acts of violence against women and girls.
Engelen et al. (2016) highlighted the crucial deterrent effect of the increased likelihood of being apprehended and penalized, emphasizing the need to capitalize on this effect. However, it is equally important to understand the underlying factors that drive criminal behavior and implement effective policy measures to address them. Therefore, a comprehensive examination of violence and femicide against women and girls through an economic lens is imperative. This study aimed to explore the potential correlation between foreign exchange rates and femicide. The choice of foreign exchange rates as a focal variable was motivated by their role in precipitating various crises, which in turn contribute to unemployment and poverty. In a country like Turkey, with a chronic current account deficit and reliance on foreign capital, fluctuations in the exchange rate have far-reaching socio-economic implications beyond growth and employment. Due to the unavailability of femicide data, collaboration with a non-governmental organization was sought. Daily femicide data and US Dollar buying rates from January 1, 2019, to September 29, 2020, were sourced from the We Will Stop Femicide Platform and the Central Bank of Turkey for analysis. Various econometric techniques were applied to these datasets, revealing...
A long-term cointegrating relationship was identified between the foreign exchange rate and femicide.
It was determined that the deviation resulting from a 1% shock in the exchange rate could equilibrate after 22.6 days.
The findings underscore the significance of effectively managing exchange rate fluctuations within a defined range to uphold the stability of the national currency, bolster foreign trade, foster economic growth, and support employment, while also playing a crucial role in mitigating the tragic toll of violence against women and girls. This research represents a pioneering contribution to the existing body of literature, being the first to empirically address this issue through contemporary and sophisticated analyses. The study underscores the critical nature of Central Banks' autonomy, tasked with safeguarding the national currency's value, and the imperative need for sound policy implementation in this domain. Policymakers bear a weighty responsibility in combatting the pervasive violence and femicide against women and girls, which have been normalized by prevailing discourses and policies. Future research endeavors should delve into the economic dimensions of widespread and systemic violence against women and girls, shedding light on this pressing societal issue.
I extend my gratitude to Atty. Hülya GÜLBAHAR and Fidan ATASELİM of the We Will Stop Femicide Platform for their invaluable assistance in data collection. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to Assoc. Prof. Aycan HEPSAĞ, Deputy Head of the Econometrics Department at Istanbul University, for his guidance in enhancing my understanding of advanced econometric analysis techniques.
