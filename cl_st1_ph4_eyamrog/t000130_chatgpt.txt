This study aimed to evaluate adolescents' subjective knowledge (SK) regarding the health effects of smoking and its association with smoking status. A cross-sectional school survey was conducted in Goi치s, Midwestern Brazil, involving 3034 students aged 13-19. SK was gauged through three questions concerning the evaluation of knowledge on: (1) the effects of smoking on the general health of smokers, (2) the effects of smoking on oral health, and (3) the effects of second-hand smoke on non-smokers (passive smokers). Participants were categorized as never-smokers, former smokers, or current smokers. Statistical analysis employed Poisson regression, with reported prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Approximately half of the participants exhibited low SK regarding the general health effects of smoking, while the majority displayed low SK concerning oral health (62.9%) and second-hand effects (61.5%). Never-smokers were more likely to have low SK about general (1.52; 95%CI=1.25-1.85), oral (1.17; 95%CI=1.03-1.32), and second-hand effects (1.21; 95%CI=1.16-1.38) of smoking compared to smokers and former smokers. Adolescents' knowledge about the health impacts of smoking was generally low, particularly among never-smokers.
Smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke have been widely recognized as detrimental to health, leading to the development of various chronic non-communicable diseases, respiratory ailments, and infectious illnesses. Furthermore, the impact of smoking extends to the oral cavity, where it exerts a devastating effect by promoting the formation of neoplasms and playing a role in the etiology of periodontal diseases.
Smoked combustible cigarettes continue to be the most widely used form of tobacco product globally. It is crucial to note that a significant number of adult smokers began smoking during their adolescent years, underscoring the importance of targeting this demographic to prevent smoking initiation. Additionally, among adolescent smokers, there is a critical need to promote smoking cessation interventions.
Many adolescents may lack awareness of the harmful effects of smoking, particularly in relation to second-hand smoke and oral health. This lack of knowledge has been identified as a significant predictor of smoking status and susceptibility to smoking among adolescents. Studies have shown that adolescents from Aboriginal and Black communities may be less likely than their White counterparts to associate smoking with health consequences. Additionally, research indicates that male students tend to have a lower level of understanding regarding the health risks associated with smoking compared to their female peers.
Previous research on adolescents' understanding of the health effects of smoking has primarily concentrated on their objective knowledge as assessed through standardized tests, neglecting their subjective knowledge (SK). Subjective knowledge, in this context, pertains to the information individuals believe they possess. Assessing SK regarding a particular product among its consumers or potential consumers holds significance as it not only reveals their knowledge proficiency but also sheds light on their self-assurance in their knowledge base.
Moreover, existing literature commonly examines the correlation between knowledge of smoking's health impacts and adolescent smoking behavior. Given that the primary global approach to alert individuals about the dangers of smoking has been through warning labels on tobacco products, it is plausible to propose that an individual's smoking status serves as a predictor for their awareness of these health risks, particularly among adolescents.
In this study, we aimed to evaluate how adolescents perceive their level of knowledge regarding the health effects of smoking, considering their roles as consumers or potential consumers of tobacco products and anti-tobacco messages. Specifically, we sought to assess the knowledge levels of adolescents (referred to as SK) concerning the health implications of smoking and how this knowledge correlates with their smoking status.
A cross-sectional school survey was conducted with adolescent students from the Federal Institute of Education Science and Technology of Goi치s (IFG), a public educational institution with high schools in 13 municipalities of Goi치s, located in the Midwest region of Brazil, including one of the Brazilian capital cities. All 14 IFG schools participated in the survey.
The sample size was determined using the online OpenEpi tool with specific parameters for calculating proportions: (1) an estimated population of IFG high school students in 2018, aged up to 19 years old (n=3694); (2) an expected frequency of 5.9% for current cigarette use (in the last 30 days) and 19.4% for cigarette experimentation, based on prevalence among Brazilian public school students aged 16 to 17 as found by the National School Student Health Survey in 2015; (3) a 2% sample error; and (4) a 95% confidence interval. The minimum sample size estimated was 467 students for the 'current smoker' outcome and 1068 for the 'tobacco use experimentation' outcome. To ensure an adequate sample size, all IFG high school students aged between 13 and 19 years old who were present in classes during data collection were invited to participate in the survey (n=3043).
The survey protocol received approval from the Research Ethics Committee (REC) of the sponsoring institution, the Federal University of Goi치s, Brazil (Approval #2142027). The REC granted an exemption for formal permissions from parents or guardians of underage adolescents (Approval #2431088). Following this, the protocol obtained approval from the REC of the data collection institution (Approval #2556510). School administrators provided formal authorizations, and all participants signed informed consent forms.
Data for this study were gathered through a self-administered printed questionnaire, which comprised validated scales and a series of questions tailored specifically for this survey. The development of these new questions was informed by a comprehensive literature review and subsequently evaluated by a panel of six PhD researchers well-versed in health questionnaire studies. Furthermore, the instrument underwent a pre-test phase involving 14 adolescents who were distinct from the intended target population of the study.
The study focused on three outcome variables: low subjective knowledge (SK) concerning general and oral health, as well as the second-hand effects of smoking. These variables were selected based on the health-related information provided on cigarette pack warnings in Brazil. The research questions aimed to investigate:
"How do you assess your understanding of"
The impact of smoking on the overall health of individuals who engage in this habit has been a subject of significant concern and study. Numerous studies have consistently shown that smoking is associated with a wide range of adverse health effects, including but not limited to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and various types of cancer. The harmful effects of smoking are not only limited to the smoker themselves but also extend to those exposed to secondhand smoke. It is well-established that smoking significantly increases the risk of developing chronic conditions such as emphysema, bronchitis, and lung cancer. Additionally, smoking has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and various other cardiovascular issues. The detrimental effects of smoking on health underscore the importance of public health campaigns and interventions aimed at reducing smoking prevalence and promoting smoking cessation.
The impact of smoking on the oral health of individuals who engage in this habit has been extensively studied. Research has consistently shown that smoking is associated with a range of detrimental effects on oral health, including an increased risk of periodontal disease, tooth loss, and oral cancer. The harmful chemicals present in tobacco smoke can lead to inflammation of the gums, reduced blood flow to the gums, and a weakened immune response, all of which contribute to the development of periodontal disease. Additionally, smoking can stain teeth, cause bad breath, and impair the sense of taste and smell. Furthermore, the carcinogens in tobacco smoke increase the likelihood of developing oral cancer, particularly in the mouth, throat, and tongue. Overall, the evidence is clear that smoking has a significant negative impact on oral health, highlighting the importance of smoking cessation interventions and regular dental check-ups for individuals who smoke.
The impact of secondhand smoke exposure on the health of non-smokers, also known as passive smokers, is a significant concern in public health. Numerous studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of inhaling tobacco smoke from others, including an increased risk of respiratory infections, cardiovascular diseases, and even certain types of cancer. Passive smokers are particularly vulnerable in environments where smoking is prevalent, such as homes, workplaces, and public spaces. Policies aimed at reducing secondhand smoke exposure, such as smoke-free laws and regulations, have been implemented to protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke. Despite these efforts, the issue of secondhand smoke remains a pressing public health issue that requires continued research and advocacy to safeguard the well-being of non-smokers.
The response categories for each question were delineated as follows: 'no knowledge', 'little knowledge', 'average knowledge', 'good knowledge', or 'excellent knowledge'. Subsequently, the sample was stratified into two groups based on these responses: low SK (comprising individuals with 'no', 'little', or 'average knowledge') and high SK (encompassing those with 'good' or 'excellent' knowledge levels).
The primary independent variable examined in this study was the smoking status of adolescents, determined through two yes/no questions: (1) 'Have you ever experimented with smoking cigarettes, even just one or two puffs?' and (2) 'Currently, do you engage in smoking cigarettes? (Choose yes if you have smoked at least one cigarette in the last 30 days)'. Respondents who answered 'no' to both questions were categorized as never-smokers, those who responded 'yes' to the first question and 'no' to the second were considered former smokers, and individuals who answered affirmatively to both questions were classified as current smokers.
Covariates in this study encompassed social exposure to smoking and various sociodemographic characteristics of the adolescents. Social exposure to smoking, delineated as either present or absent, was determined based on the adolescents' reports regarding the smoking habits of their parents, friends, and romantic partners. If any of these individuals were identified as smokers, the adolescents were categorized as being socially exposed to smoking. The sociodemographic variables considered included age, ranging from 13 to 19 years; gender, classified as male or female; race/skin color, following the official categories in Brazil: White, Black, Brown, Yellow, or Indigenous; and the educational level of the adolescents' mothers, which was divided into seven categories spanning from no education to higher education.
For the statistical analysis, we utilized IBM SPSS Statistics Software (v24). Our data was presented using counts (n) and proportions (%). Poisson regression with robust variance was employed to determine the raw and adjusted associations between smoking status and SK. The results are reported in terms of prevalence ratios (PR) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).
The covariates included in the multivariable models were selected based on existing knowledge regarding the determinants of smoking among adolescents, rather than statistical significance. As a result, all study covariates were incorporated into the analysis. In order to prevent the dissemination of misleading results, estimates for the associations between smoking behavior and the covariates were deliberately omitted from the reported findings.
A total of 3034 adolescents took part in the study, resulting in a response rate of 99.7%. The majority of participants were female (53.6%), identified as Brown (50.9%), with a mean age of 16 years (SD=1.1). The educational background of their mothers predominantly included high school (32.4%) or higher education (29.4%). A significant portion of the participants reported never having experimented with cigarettes (72.7%) and indicated social exposure to smoking (65.6%) as shown in Table 1.
The prevalence of low smoking knowledge (SK) was found to be 47.8% concerning the impact of smoking on general health, and exceeded 60% for both oral and second-hand effects, as indicated in Table 1. Notably, the highest prevalence of low SK for each of these three effects was observed among individuals who had never smoked, as illustrated in Figure 1.
In both the unadjusted and adjusted Poisson regression analyses, a significant association was found between low smoking knowledge (SK) and the smoking status of adolescents (refer to Table 2). When compared to smokers, never-smokers were 52% more likely to exhibit low SK regarding the general health effects of smoking, 17% more likely to have low SK concerning oral health effects, and 21% more likely to lack knowledge about second-hand smoke effects. Additionally, former smokers showed a 41% higher likelihood of having low SK regarding general health effects and a 16% higher likelihood of lacking knowledge about second-hand smoke effects, as compared to current smokers.
In this study, adolescent students disclosed their levels of knowledge regarding the impacts of smoking on general and oral health, as well as the effects of second-hand smoke. The results revealed high instances of inadequate knowledge, particularly concerning the effects on oral health and second-hand smoke, suggesting room for enhancement. These outcomes align with various prior studies that have also noted deficient awareness among adolescents regarding the dangers of smoking.
When comparing adolescents' smoking knowledge (SK) based on their smoking status, while controlling for social exposure to smoking and sociodemographic characteristics, it was found that never-smokers reported higher rates of low SK compared to smokers and former smokers. This observation may mirror the prevailing global trend of emphasizing the hazards of smoking. Over the past decade, there has been a significant rise in the inclusion of mandatory health warnings on tobacco product packaging worldwide; however, a decline in mass media campaigns addressing smoking risks has been noted.
The observation of health warning labels on cigarette packages has been linked to heightened awareness regarding the dangers of smoking. These health warnings, a key component of the Monitor, Prevent, Offer, Warn, Enforce, and Raise (MPOWER) initiative established by the World Health Organization to aid countries in combating the global smoking epidemic, are recognized as one of the most potent anti-smoking measures. Nevertheless, as these warnings primarily reach individuals when they encounter tobacco products, they should be viewed as a high-risk approach to anti-smoking education.
Anti-tobacco mass media campaigns have been proven to be effective interventions in reducing tobacco use and are considered cost-effective in educating large populations about the risks associated with tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke. Given the objective of informing the entire population about the hazards of smoking, these campaigns should be acknowledged as a population-based strategy for anti-smoking education.
Our research indicates that educating individuals about the health consequences of smoking can effectively decrease tobacco consumption. Therefore, it is crucial to specifically focus on raising awareness among non-smokers to fulfill the fourth MPOWER global objective, which aims to alert individuals about the hazards associated with tobacco use.
An analogy can be made between enhancing smokers' awareness of the dangers of smoking and enhancing the understanding of pregnant adolescents regarding the risks associated with pregnancy. This implies that waiting for adolescents to become smokers before educating them about the health hazards of smoking is unacceptable. By that point, it might be too late as their knowledge could be overshadowed by nicotine addiction.
In isolation, knowledge and its rational evaluation may not be sufficient to influence smoking behavior. However, it constitutes a crucial aspect concerning the psychological capacity of individuals to modify their smoking habits, in conjunction with motivation and the availability of opportunities for change.
The warning that 'smoking kills' must be effectively communicated to every adolescent, as well as individuals who are exposed to tobacco products. While enhancing high-risk education strategies to enhance the knowledge of tobacco users is essential, there is now a pressing need to intensify population-wide education efforts to ensure equitable access to information regarding the hazards of tobacco use among adolescents.
The study's limitations stem from its observational design, precluding causal inference. Furthermore, the exclusive focus on public schools restricts the generalizability of the findings. Including adolescents from both public and private schools would have enhanced representativeness and, consequently, the overall applicability of the results.
In summary, adolescents generally perceived themselves as having limited knowledge regarding the impacts of smoking and second-hand smoke on both overall and oral health. This lack of knowledge was found to be linked to their smoking status, with never-smokers exhibiting lower levels of understanding compared to both current and former smokers.
