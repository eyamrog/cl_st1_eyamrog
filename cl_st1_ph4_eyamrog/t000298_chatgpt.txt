The COVID-19 pandemic was officially declared on March 11, 2020. By April 18 of the same year, the global death toll had surpassed 150,000 individuals. In this study, we aim to analyze and compare mortality rates attributed to COVID-19 on a global scale. Our analysis will involve adjusting these statistics to account for variations in population size and the differing stages of the pandemic across various regions.
Methods: Data sourced from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and Our World in Data websites were utilized for this study. The analysis focused on the number of deaths per one million inhabitants. To ensure consistency across different stages of the pandemic, the baseline date was established as the day when the 10th death was officially reported. The study encompassed 78 countries and territories that had reported 10 or more deaths by April 9th.
Results: Mortality statistics exhibited significant global variation. By day 10, India reported 0.06 deaths per million, while Belgium and San Marino recorded 30.46 and 618.78 deaths per million, respectively. By day 20, India's mortality rate increased to 0.27 deaths per million, contrasting with China's 0.71 and Spain's 139.62. By day 30, Asian nations displayed lower mortality rates compared to their European counterparts. Italy and Spain surpassed 250 deaths per million by day 40, whereas China and South Korea maintained mortality rates below 4 per million. A moderate correlation was observed between mortality on day 10 and life expectancy (rho 0.53; P<0.001), while no significant correlation was found with population density (rho 0.12; P=0.31).
Conclusions: Asian countries exhibited significantly lower mortality rates in comparison to their European counterparts. The study also revealed a strong correlation between life expectancy and mortality rates.
The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, known as COVID-19, was initially identified in China towards the end of 2019. Following its classification as an international health emergency by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020, COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Within a span of less than six months from the first reported case, the global death toll had surpassed 150,000 individuals as of April 18, 2020. On a particularly grim day, April 16, 2020, nearly 5,000 lives were lost in the United States alone due to the impact of COVID-19.
Official statistics regarding COVID-19 cases are significantly skewed for several reasons. Firstly, testing protocols vary globally, with many countries primarily testing individuals displaying symptoms, particularly those with severe manifestations. Secondly, the availability of testing kits often falls short of the demand, further complicating accurate case identification. Consequently, relying solely on official figures for confirmed cases is akin to observing just the tip of an iceberg, with the true extent of the situation hidden beneath the surface. Recent studies have shed light on this disparity, with findings from a population sample in South Brazil suggesting that actual cases could be 7-8 times higher than reported. Similarly, in Santa Clara, US, estimates indicate that the true number of cases may be 50-85 times greater than those officially recorded. In essence, the focus on confirmed cases is misleading due to the absence of a standardized denominator, rendering the data incomplete and potentially inaccurate.
Official statistics on deaths provide a significantly more reliable foundation for comprehending the intricacies of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article delves into a comparative analysis of mortality statistics attributed to COVID-19 on a global scale, taking into account population size and the pandemic's stage in each country. Additionally, we explore the correlation between mortality rates and factors such as life expectancy and population density. Through the application of these analytical approaches, we aim to untangle misinformation and disprove false narratives, ultimately emphasizing the importance of relying on scientific evidence for a clearer understanding of the situation.
The data utilized in this analysis is readily accessible from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and Our World in Data websites. All analyses are grounded on the number of deaths per one million inhabitants. To consider the pandemic's stage, the baseline date for each country was established as the day when the 10th death was reported in that specific country. Mortality statistics are outlined for days 10, 20, 30, and 40 following the 10th death.
We have excluded from our analysis the 125 countries and territories that reported fewer than 10 deaths by April 18, 2020, and those where the 10th death was reported after April 8, 2020. The excluded countries and territories include Angola, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Aruba, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Bermuda, Bhutan, Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba, Botswana, British Virgin Islands, Brunei Darussalam, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Cayman Islands, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Costa Rica, Cote D’Ivoire, Curacao, Djibouti, Dominica, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Falkland Islands, Faroe Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greenland, Grenada, Guam, Guatemala, Guernsey, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Holy See, Iceland, Isle of Man, Jamaica, Jersey, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Latvia, Liberia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Madagascar, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Montserrat, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Northern Mariana Islands, Oman, Palestine, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Qatar, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Sint Maarten, Slovakia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Syria, Taiwan, Timor-Leste, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, United States Virgin Islands, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
In our research, we accessed publicly available statistics from the United Nations regarding life expectancy and from the World Bank concerning population density. It is important to note that life expectancy data for Puerto Rico and San Marino were not accessible through these initial sources, prompting us to gather this information from alternative sources (Puerto Rico: Statista.com; San Marino: Indexmundi.com). Subsequently, we graphed mortality rates on the tenth day following the occurrence of the 10th death in each country alongside both life expectancy and population density data. Additionally, we computed Spearman’s correlation coefficients (rho) to further analyze the relationships between these variables.
Table 1 presents the 78 countries and territories included in the analysis in alphabetical order. The mortality variation observed was notably significant: by day 10 since the 10th death, 17 countries (21.8%) exhibited mortality rates below one per million, while 19 countries (24.4%) reported rates exceeding 10 per million. Particularly striking were the figures from two small regions: San Marino, with a population of 33.8 thousand, recorded a mortality rate of 618.78 per million. Similarly, Andorra, with a population of 77.0 thousand, reported a mortality rate of 336.50 per million on the same day.
Data on mortality rates on day 20 since the 10th death were accessible for 48 countries and territories. Among these, only China, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Pakistan exhibited a mortality rate below one per million inhabitants on day 20. A majority of the countries (54.2%) reported mortality figures exceeding 10 per million on day 20. Notably, the highest mortality rates were observed in Europe, with Luxembourg (110.23 per million), Spain (139.62 per million), Belgium (175.59 per million), and San Marino (942.90 per million) recording the most alarming figures.
Only 17 countries and territories have reached day 30 since the 10th death. Among them, four Asian countries, namely Japan with 0.67 deaths per million, China with 1.55 deaths per million, South Korea with 2.71 deaths per million, and the Philippines with 3.06 deaths per million, reported the lowest mortality rates. Conversely, Italy (135.04 deaths per million), France (136.52 deaths per million), Sweden (138.62 deaths per million), the Netherlands (164.75 deaths per million), the United Kingdom (166.88 deaths per million), Spain (311.13 deaths per million), Belgium (445.48 deaths per million), and San Marino (1,119.69 deaths per million) exhibited the highest mortality rates on day 30 since the 10th death.
While the total number of deaths in San Marino on April 18, 2020 (N=39) may seem relatively small, it actually accounts for 0.12% of the country's total population. If this same catastrophic percentage were to occur in larger nations like China, India, the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Mexico, and Japan, it would translate to millions of deaths.
The six countries that reached day 40 after the 10th death exhibited significant variations in mortality rates (see Figure 1). Italy and Spain reported mortality rates exceeding 250 per million, while China and South Korea had rates below 4 per million. Iran (41.10 per million) and the United States (71.45 per million) fell in between these extremes.
In Figure 2, mortality per million figures on days 10, 20, and 30 are compared for 16 countries with available data, excluding San Marino. Belgium and Spain exhibited similar curves, although the difference between them grew notably from day 20 to 30. Following them were the United Kingdom and Netherlands, with the United Kingdom showing a significantly larger increase from day 20 to 30. The curves for Asian countries displayed similarities, with considerably lower mortality figures in comparison to European countries and the United States.
In Figure 3, ecological data regarding mortality on day 10 following the 10th death and life expectancy is depicted. The Spearman's correlation coefficient calculated for this data was 0.53 (P<0.001), indicating a significant relationship. Conversely, no correlation was observed between mortality on day 10 since the 10th death and population density, with a rho value of 0.12 and a P-value of 0.31.
All analyses in this article pertain to the number of deaths. While some degree of underreporting due to insufficient testing is possible, mortality statistics are considered more reliable than those related to the number of cases. Recent serological studies in South Brazil and Santa Clara, United States, have suggested that each confirmed case may represent a significantly higher number of actual cases at the population level. Recently published data from extensive testing in Iceland revealed that 13.3% of individuals tested had positive results for SARS-CoV-2, while the figure in the general population was 0.8%. To address this limitation, urgent serological surveys with population samples are necessary. Another report indicated that 86% of COVID-19 infections went undocumented, contributing to the rapid spread of the virus. It is crucial to note that, until reliable prevalence estimates are available, case fatality should not be used as a statistic at this stage due to the unavailability of the denominator (number of cases).
Two critical issues that scientists must communicate to the public and policymakers to prevent misinterpretation and misguided decision-making are highlighted in this research. Firstly, the analysis of absolute death numbers can be deceptive. For instance, as of April 18, 2020, China ranks 7th in total deaths, but when adjusted for population, approximately 80 countries and territories exhibit higher mortality rates per million than China. Secondly, considering the stage of the pandemic in different regions is crucial for accurately interpreting COVID-19 data. In this study, the baseline figure was set as the date of the 10th death. Disregarding this baseline could lead to biased conclusions. For instance, when comparing Italy and Spain, mortality rates appeared higher in Italy until April 5, 2020, without considering the pandemic stage in each country. However, the 10th death occurred on February 26 in Italy and March 10 in Spain. Adjusting for the pandemic stage revealed consistently higher figures in Spain compared to Italy (10.10 vs. 3.26 per million on day 10; 58.52 vs. 35.69 per million on day 20; and 138.62 vs. 135.04 per million on day 30).
In our study, we observed a moderate correlation between life expectancy and mortality, aligning with existing research that indicates higher fatality rates as age increases. However, we did not find any ecological link between mortality and population density, despite noting the highest mortality rates on day 10 following the 10th death in two small regions, namely San Marino and Andorra.
In conclusion, Asian countries exhibited significantly lower mortality rates in comparison to their European counterparts. While there was a correlation between life expectancy and mortality, it was only moderate, indicating the presence of other influential factors. Possible explanations for these disparities include the effective implementation and adherence to social distancing protocols, testing strategies, and variations in healthcare system infrastructures.
