Dental care typically involves close contact with patients, particularly in the vicinity of their upper airways. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly disrupted the operations of dental offices, leading to the temporary suspension of elective services and the restriction to emergency and urgent procedures only. Given that saliva is a potential carrier of SARS-CoV-2, dentists have been exploring alternative methods to reduce aerosol generation from high-speed equipment and mitigate the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic.
Teledentistry, an information and communication resource with the potential to enhance the quality of dental healthcare, has gained widespread acceptance among both dental professionals and patients. This innovative approach facilitates oral care and health services in remote areas, enabling professionals to identify high-risk groups and deliver prompt interventions, thereby reducing waiting lists.
In emerging countries such as Brazil, teledentistry serves as a viable alternative for providing high-quality telemonitoring, particularly for individuals in greatest need, at a cost-effective rate. This technology has been increasingly utilized within public health services, drawing from successful telemedicine programs in primary care settings globally, including Brazil's Telehealth initiative, spearheaded by the Ministry of Health. Within this framework, specialized services have been established to facilitate the examination of oral lesions.
This year, the Brazilian Federal Council of Dentistry issued Resolution No. 226 concerning remote dental practice. In accordance with Law 5081/66, which governs the practice of dentistry, the resolution stipulates the prohibition of technology-mediated dental consultations for purposes of diagnosis, prescription, and treatment planning. The resolution allows for remote care and telemonitoring of patients only in cases where patients receiving treatment are unable to physically visit the dental office, or when a teleorientation session is conducted by the clinician to determine the optimal timing for in-person assistance.
During the pandemic, amidst stringent distancing measures and the looming threat of SARS-CoV-2 contamination, patients have exhibited persistent concerns regarding their safety and the standard of dental care. Moreover, a significant portion of our patient demographic relies solely on public health services for essential oral oncology treatments, periodontal maintenance, oral hygiene, and regular check-ups. For these individuals, ongoing appointments are crucial. Consequently, implementing strategies like incorporating voice and video calls in the interim between in-person visits could serve as an optimal temporary solution to prevent exacerbations and deteriorations in the patients' health conditions, ensuring regular remote monitoring from a distance.
Carrard et al. (2017) emphasized the significant success rates observed among oral medicine patients who utilized the WhatsApp mobile application. In a study conducted in Greece, Georgakopoulou (2020) reported positive outcomes with telehealth services in her private dental clinic, attracting new patients in the process. Additionally, Machado et al. (2020) further supported the efficacy of mobile applications for telemonitoring patients, underscoring their utility in healthcare settings.
In conclusion, telecommunications strategies are deemed appropriate for the current scenario. It is anticipated that the telemonitoring tool for dentists and patients will gain popularity over time, with advancements in this field likely solidifying its integration into the daily routines of dental professionals.
