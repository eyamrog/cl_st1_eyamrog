School feeding is a crucial aspect of the daily routine for millions of students globally. The closure of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the significant challenge of ensuring that children and adolescents continue to receive essential nutrition through alternative means, such as governmental or other food programs. In Brazil, approximately 40.1 million children and adolescents enrolled in public basic education were impacted by the closure of schools, leading to a disruption in their daily meals. To address this issue, many local governments opted to provide financial assistance to parents. This study focuses on the challenge of monitoring whether children are receiving these meals effectively during prolonged school closures. The research delves into the current status of fund transfers and meal delivery in the 27 Brazilian federated entities. Additionally, a monitoring model is proposed to track the nutritional intake of children and adolescents throughout the pandemic, aiming to ensure their adequate nutrition during this challenging period.
The initial case of COVID-19 was documented in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [2]. In Brazil, the first confirmed cases emerged in February 2020 [3]. To curb the spread of the pandemic, social distancing has been extensively implemented as a non-pharmaceutical intervention. Additional measures encompass the shutdown of educational facilities across all levels, subsequent closures of restaurants, offices, and general commerce, among others.
As of April 2020, school closures due to the pandemic have impacted around 197 countries and approximately 1.6 billion children and adolescents. Among this vast number, an estimated 352 million are now deprived of the meals they used to receive at school, which for many, constituted their primary source of nutrition. The pandemic has particularly affected countries where a significant portion of students relied on school meals, including India (around 90.4 million), Brazil (40.1 million), the United States (30 million), Egypt (11 million), Nigeria (9.8 million), South Africa (9.2 million), Turkey (6.1 million), Colombia (4 million), Peru (2.3 million), Bolivia (2.3 million), Ethiopia (2.5 million), and Argentina (1.6 million).
One of the functions carried out by schools is providing food, alongside education, socialization, and care for children and adolescents [5]. Maintaining a healthy diet is essential for upholding the overall well-being of a population. A favorable nutritional status is closely linked to appropriate development and growth during childhood, enhanced immune response, reduced risk of disease development, and is pivotal for recovery in cases of infection [6,7].
School feeding programs operate within the framework of promoting Food and Nutritional Security (SAN), with the school environment being a crucial and strategic space for advancing SAN objectives by offering meals and fostering healthy eating habits. The significance of school meals cannot be overstated, as they play a vital role in child development by ensuring adequate nutrition, enhancing cognitive abilities, and helping to decrease school dropout rates. In countries facing significant social challenges like Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador, and Ghana, many children heavily rely on schools as their primary source of food. Particularly during the ongoing pandemic, the absence of food can hinder the growth of these children and adolescents, leading to a rise in school dropout rates.
It is important to note that the more precarious a child's food situation is, meaning the more vulnerable the family structure is in providing basic needs, the greater the significance of school [5] in addressing this deficiency. Furthermore, in contexts of social vulnerability, school meals serve as an indirect source of income for families, thereby potentially enhancing overall family income [10].
In the research article titled "Mitigating the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Food and Nutrition of Schoolchildren," UNESCO discusses the strategy of providing financial assistance to families impacted by the closure of educational institutions. This aid is distributed through a card typically used for purchasing school supplies. The amount of financial support allocated varies based on the typical number of meals children receive daily at school, as outlined in the article [11].
The Brazilian government enacted Law 13,987/20 to ensure the provision of food to families of students in public schools (aged zero to 17) whose classes were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing the National School Feeding Program (PNAE). Despite this initiative, there remains a lack of understanding regarding the efficacy of the implemented strategies.
When attempting to gather further insights into this process from the websites of Brazilian state education departments, scant information pertaining to this topic or the quantity of children and adolescents reaping the benefits of this initiative was discovered. This lack of data, among other factors, served as a catalyst for the initiation of this research endeavor.
In light of the aforementioned considerations, this study seeks to foster a discourse surrounding the critical and pressing issue at hand. Specifically, the research endeavors to elucidate the various forms of aid provided by Brazilian governmental bodies to school-aged children and teenagers in the form of either food or monetary assistance during periods of school closure. Furthermore, the study aims to put forth recommendations for the supervision and regulation of these aid distributions by households, with the ultimate goal of alleviating the potential hazards stemming from food insecurity among students amidst the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.
Illustrated in Figure 1, schools serve multiple crucial roles in the lives of children, adolescents, families, and society at large. Central to this framework, particularly in the realm of cognitive development, education is propelled by socialization, enabling the nurturing of socio-emotional skills in young individuals. Additionally, schools provide a sense of care, offering a secure environment where parents can entrust their children while they engage in work commitments. Moreover, schools often serve as a vital source of nutrition, ensuring that children and adolescents receive the necessary dietary requirements for optimal growth and health. The fulfillment of these diverse roles has become increasingly complex during the ongoing pandemic, posing significant challenges for educators, governments, schools, and families alike.
In Brazil, public schools are exemplified by the model depicted in Figure 1, as they serve a crucial function in the development, education, and welfare of children and teenagers, particularly considering their susceptibility within their societal contexts. These students often hail from impoverished households and face challenging social circumstances.
Throughout the pandemic, various alternatives to traditional classroom education, such as distance teaching and remote monitoring, have been implemented to mitigate the potential negative impacts on cognitive development that would typically be addressed during the school year. The nurturing environment and social interactions provided by schools are crucial elements that have been significantly affected by the closure of educational institutions. However, the challenges posed by social distancing measures complicate decision-making processes aimed at addressing these issues effectively. This study focuses on the critical issue of school food, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the adequacy and urgency of the measures implemented to tackle this problem.
Prior to the pandemic, extensive research had been conducted to evaluate the impact of school meals on students' well-being. Previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of school feeding programs on the enhancement of verbal fluency in malnourished children. Furthermore, Jomaa, McDonnell, and Probart conducted a comprehensive bibliographic survey spanning two decades, analyzing the influence of school feeding programs on the lives of children and adolescents. Their findings indicated a notable positive correlation between school meals and student enrollment and dropout rates, particularly when compared to students not participating in such programs.
In Latin America, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) advocates for the development of school feeding programs within countries. In the United States, there exist two prominent care initiatives targeting vulnerable children: the School Nutrition Program, which provides free meals to children from disadvantaged families, and the Farmers Market Nutrition Program (FMNP), designed as a supplementary nutrition effort for women, infants, and children. Additionally, the World Food Program (WFP) stands out as a globally significant initiative, catering to approximately 17.3 million school children by providing meals and snacks.
Brazil relies on the PNAE (National School Feeding Program), a social initiative under the purview of the Ministry of Education, established in 1955 with the aim of ensuring that students attending public schools and philanthropic institutions receive nutritious and balanced meals. In addition to this program, various other strategies have been devised to enhance the nutritional well-being of children and adolescents. For instance, there have been efforts to introduce micronutrient-fortified cookies manufactured in Vietnam, which, as indicated by studies, have proven effective in lowering the incidence of anemia and enhancing iron intake levels [15].
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the absence of school feeding programs has left numerous children vulnerable to starvation. By April, among the 197 countries with closed schools, only a fraction had devised strategies for ensuring the provision of school meals. Specifically, 10 countries opted for cash transfers to families, 47 distributed take-home food rations, 9 suspended their programs, and 16 adopted a combination of approaches. Nevertheless, the mere implementation of these initiatives does not ensure that children are actually receiving the necessary nourishment.
In addition to Brazil, several other countries have extended financial aid to families, including the United States through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and Peru through the Qali Warma National School Food Program, which involves cash transfers. The World Food Programme (WFP) reports that at least 10 nations have implemented cash transfer strategies to alleviate this issue. While this approach can prove effective, families may encounter additional challenges, such as covering the expenses associated with food preparation, particularly in the context of elevated unemployment rates.
It is imperative to uphold flexibility and adaptability in response to fluctuations in food supply, as well as changes in the distribution and delivery of nutrition services, all the while adhering to COVID-19 protocols.
Utilize the resources at hand to safeguard food and nutritional security for schoolchildren.
Enhance the current welfare structures to encompass vulnerable school children.
It is imperative to consider the food and nutritional requirements of vulnerable children when formulating any comprehensive national strategy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Develop a comprehensive strategy for the eventual reopening of schools, incorporating specific measurable benchmarks to guide the process. This plan should outline clear criteria and milestones that need to be met before schools can resume normal operations. By establishing specific benchmarks, educational authorities can ensure a safe and effective transition back to in-person learning, taking into account the evolving nature of the situation. This approach will provide a structured framework for decision-making and help to instill confidence in students, parents, and educators as they navigate the complexities of returning to school post-pandemic.
The duration of the pandemic is intricately linked to the progress in developing new drugs and a potential vaccine [16]. The timeline for school closures as a strategy to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 remains uncertain, raising questions about the possibility of intermittent openings and closures. This uncertainty underscores the importance of evaluating the sustainability and efficacy of implemented measures. In the context of school feeding programs, it is imperative to tailor the strategies to align with these evolving scenarios.
For instance, during the H1N1 outbreak, school closures, akin to those witnessed in the current pandemic, were implemented as a non-pharmaceutical containment strategy [17]. These measures, as suggested by researchers, played a pivotal role in curbing the transmission of the disease. Nevertheless, in the Brazilian context of 2009, only a handful of states opted to delay the resumption of classes by a mere 15 days in the latter half of the academic year [18], contrasting starkly with the prolonged and widespread school closures observed in 2020.
Short-term consequences of missed meals during the pandemic on students' health may manifest as fatigue and a compromised immune response, rendering children and adolescents more susceptible to contracting various infectious agents like viruses and bacteria, thereby increasing their risk of developing diseases due to an impaired immune system. Over time, this can have detrimental effects on their psychological, physical, and emotional development (Reference 19).
Federal Law 13,987/20 aims to ensure the provision of food to the families of students affected by school closures. In response, the government of the Federal District chose to distribute food allowances to parents of students in public schools. However, there is a lack of transparency regarding the monitoring of this measure. Information on this initiative in the Federal District of Brazil is available on the State Bureau for Education of the Federal District (SEEDF) website. According to the site, only 69,848 families, encompassing 106,435 students, are currently benefiting from the three phases of funds released. Notably absent are details on the criteria for food allowance distribution or the proportion of families receiving benefits relative to the total student enrollment in the public school system of the Federal District. Furthermore, even for those receiving government assistance, it is crucial to assess its efficacy in meeting the nutritional needs of children, given that the nutritional requirements provided by schools may not be adequately met at home.
Chart 1 (Appendix 1) displays data concerning the benefits associated with school meals distributed by the Brazilian states and the Federal District to students' families amidst the class suspension caused by the pandemic. This information was sourced from the websites of the 27 State Departments of Education of each federated entity, retrieved between June 6 and June 8, 2020. The objective was to ascertain the quantity of families and students receiving benefits, the nature and worth of the benefits provided, the method of transfer or distribution, and the criteria determining eligibility for these benefits.
It is important to highlight that the data depicted in Chart 1 primarily originates from press releases issued by the State Education Bureaus.
Despite the support extended to students through various means like pre-prepared meals, meal kits, or financial assistance, several unresolved issues persist. These include concerns regarding the ultimate recipients of the aid and whether students will directly benefit from such assistance, the nutritional value and quantity of food provided in meal kits, as well as the challenges families may encounter in accessing the aid and preparing meals.
This study introduces a proposed framework for monitoring, supervising, and regulating the financial assistance benefits allocated to children and adolescents amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
The model was delineated within the context of Brazil, with reference to the public policies implemented by the country and its prevailing social conditions. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that this model can serve as a blueprint for other regions seeking to intervene in similar circumstances, with the aim of guaranteeing that students have access to sufficient food during the ongoing pandemic.
In Brazil, the family health community agent, numbering over 200,000, is a prevalent figure tasked with supporting underprivileged communities in promoting health surveillance, primary care, and community health [21]. Amidst the current pandemic, these agents have the potential to oversee families and play a crucial role in monitoring the health and dietary habits of children and adolescents. This monitoring process could be facilitated through telemedicine and would involve various stakeholders such as families, schools, government entities, and health agents (Figure 2). The government may designate an alternative actor to replace health agents in fulfilling this responsibility.
The proposed monitoring should adhere to a checklist outlining specific issues to be observed within the family. This approach aims to offer insights into the nutritional status of the child or adolescent under consideration.
It is crucial to prioritize geographic intelligence to effectively map and monitor the most vulnerable areas, identify families benefiting from the food program, and randomly verify the program's efficacy. Utilizing web applications to track and gather information from non-recipients is essential. Registrations should adhere to an active surveillance model, ensuring timely and comprehensive data collection. This approach will offer the government valuable insights into the school feeding program's performance during the pandemic, enabling necessary adjustments to better meet students' nutritional needs.
During a pandemic, the nutritional well-being of children becomes a critical topic for societal discourse, particularly as schools often serve as a primary source of daily support. The challenge lies in guaranteeing that food reaches children and is actually consumed, a task made complex by the decentralized nature of government food distribution programs. When food or financial assistance is provided to families, the lack of oversight regarding its proper allocation and utilization hinders the assessment of its impact in addressing nutritional deficiencies among children.
Monitoring strategies must be effective, and family health agents could play a crucial role in assisting the government by utilizing methods akin to telemedicine, drawing on information provided by competent departments. To enhance the transparency of public resource utilization, it is imperative to conduct research on the prevailing conditions across various Brazilian regions and leverage geographic intelligence tools for spatial monitoring. This approach should be integrated with active surveillance mechanisms, aligning with the concept of participatory control of public funds. Information collection platforms should be employed to ascertain the effectiveness of benefit distribution to families, ensure children are receiving the mandated food under the Law and the PNAE, determine the dietary habits of children and adolescents, including the number of meals consumed daily, with the support of family health agents. These efforts will furnish the government with essential data to formulate monitoring strategies and oversee the nutritional well-being of these vulnerable populations during the ongoing pandemic.
This approach enables a contribution not only to the ongoing debates concerning the school's fulfillment of its role, exacerbated by the pandemic, but also to an understanding of the efficacy of public policies implemented during this declared state of emergency by federal and state authorities.
