SARS-CoV-2, a novel virus, is the causative agent behind the global outbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory illness that has rapidly spread across numerous countries, instigating widespread concern and apprehension within the global healthcare community. This research aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on self-perceived vulnerability, aversion to germs, and related behaviors among the adult population of Madrid, particularly in the context of dental practices. Conducted as a cross-sectional observational study, data was collected from 1,008 randomly selected individuals in Madrid, Spain, between March 1 and March 8, 2020. The participants' perceived vulnerability to disease was assessed using the perceived vulnerability to disease scale, alongside a supplementary questionnaire that delved into sociodemographic factors, medical history, personal hygiene practices, willingness to visit specific locations, and perceptions of contagion risk associated with dental visits. Noteworthy findings include significant gender disparities in germ aversion (p < 0.05) and perceived risks associated with waiting in dental practice waiting rooms (p < 0.01), tooth extractions (p < 0.05), endodontic procedures (p < 0.05), and fillings (p < 0.05), with women generally perceiving higher risks than men. Furthermore, the at-risk group (individuals over 60 years old with systemic diseases) exhibited notable differences in infectivity (p < 0.01) and germ aversion (p < 0.01) compared to other demographics. Overall, our study underscores elevated levels of vulnerability to COVID-19 and reluctance towards dental care among the elderly population with systemic illnesses.
SARS-CoV-2, a novel virus, is the causative agent behind the respiratory illness known as COVID-19, which has rapidly disseminated across numerous nations, prompting significant alarm within the global healthcare community. On January 30, subsequent to the second convening of the IHR (International Health Regulations) Emergency Committee, the Director-General of the World Health Organization officially classified this epidemic as a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern) owing to its pervasive global transmission, necessitating a unified, coordinated international effort in response.
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, consisting of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses identifiable by their distinct appearance in negative stain electron microscopy. COVID-19 manifests with a spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from mild symptoms akin to the common cold to more severe manifestations resembling those induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV).
The emergence of the novel coronavirus in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China marked a significant event. This virus, highly contagious among humans, primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and physical contact. Various factors contributed to its rapid dissemination, notably Wuhan's status as the capital of China's Hubei Province and a crucial transportation hub, facilitating increased person-to-person interactions and the potential exportation of cases to other regions. Moreover, infected individuals can remain asymptomatic for a period ranging from 1 to 14 days. Those diagnosed with COVID-19 through PCR testing have typically been around 55 years old, with cases in children being relatively uncommon. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, difficulty breathing, and in severe instances, pneumonia. The severity of COVID-19 appears to correlate with age, with older populations facing the highest risk; individuals over 80 years old exhibited a fatality rate of 14.8 percent. Furthermore, the case fatality rate was notably higher among individuals with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory ailments, hypertension, and cancer. Despite a lower mortality rate compared to MERS-CoV infections, SARS-CoV-2 is projected to result in a higher number of fatalities due to the significantly larger number of cases it has caused.
Understanding the critical importance of effectively managing COVID-19 patients for diagnosis and treatment is paramount, particularly in the absence of a specific treatment for the novel coronavirus. Recent studies have indicated some efficacy of certain antivirals currently in use. The primary modes of transmission for the new coronavirus encompass direct transmission through activities like coughing, sneezing, and inhalation of droplets, as well as contact transmission via interaction with oral, nasal, and ocular mucous membranes.
Mortality is undeniably linked to the virus, however, the most pressing issue lies in the potential strain on healthcare systems due to the rapid spread of the virus, resulting in affected patients being unable to access essential care. This situation not only jeopardizes the treatment of those infected but also poses a threat to individuals with other critical medical conditions who may also face challenges in receiving the necessary medical attention. Of specific concern are countries with fragile healthcare systems, as they are at a heightened risk of being overwhelmed by the demands imposed by the virus.
Many individuals have been exposed to distressing information regarding those afflicted through social networks and the media, leading to a detrimental impact on the general populace, inducing stress, fear of contracting the virus, frustration, and shortages of essential items like masks, safety glasses, hand sanitizers, and food. Despite the relatively low mortality rate of the new coronavirus, ranging between 2% and 3%, the focus on disease prevention has morphed into a pervasive dread of contagion. This apprehension is particularly heightened in crowded areas like shopping malls, transportation hubs, and fitness centers, as well as in environments where bodily fluids are encountered, such as hospitals, healthcare facilities, and dental practices.
Patients and dental professionals are at risk of exposure to pathogenic microorganisms, such as viruses and bacteria, that can infect the oral cavities and respiratory tracts. Dental care settings, due to their specific procedures involving face-to-face interactions with patients and frequent exposure to saliva, blood, and other bodily fluids, as well as the handling of sharp instruments, clearly pose a risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathogenic microorganisms can be transmitted in dental environments through various means, including inhaling airborne microorganisms that may linger in the air for extended periods, direct contact with patients' blood or oral fluids, contact of the conjunctival, nasal, or oral mucosa with droplets and aerosols containing microorganisms expelled by an infected individual through coughing or speaking without a mask at close range, and indirect contact with contaminated instruments or environmental surfaces.
The recent onset of COVID-19 has resulted in a limited understanding of its transmission patterns, severity, clinical features, and risk factors for infection among various groups, including the general population, medical professionals, and families. Consequently, there is a pressing need for studies that assess the susceptibility of the general population to germ transmission and the specific disease, given its significant implications on daily activities and, notably, on dental appointments and treatments.
This study seeks to ascertain the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on self-perceived vulnerability, infectiousness, aversion to germs, and related behaviors that influence dental practice within Madrid's adult population.
In order to fulfill the objectives of this study, the researchers devised and executed a cross-sectional observational investigation.
This cross-sectional study included 1,008 Caucasian participants aged 18 years and above who were randomly surveyed on the streets of Madrid, Spain between March 1 and March 8, 2020.
The study included participants aged between 18 and 83 years, with 41.50% being male and 58.50% female. Exclusion criteria involved individuals reporting symptoms suggestive of an infectious disease during data collection to prevent potential bias in their responses.
Prior to their inclusion in the study, all participants were briefed on the study's objectives, provided with essential guidelines for survey completion, and assured that their data would be collected anonymously. A signed informed consent statement was obtained from each participant. The study received approval from the Rey Juan Carlos University Ethics and Research Committee, with a registration number of 0103202006520.
The current study utilized self-reported measurements, with perceived vulnerability to disease being evaluated through the validated perceived vulnerability to disease scale in Spanish by Magallares et al. The participants' scores were derived by averaging their responses to the scale items, where higher scores indicated a heightened perception of vulnerability to infection. The response format employed a seven-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 ("Strongly Disagree") to 7 ("Strongly Agree"). This scale comprised two subscales: one focusing on perceived infectiousness, assessed by 7 items (e.g., "I am more likely to catch an infectious disease than people in my environment"), and the other on germ aversion, assessed by 6 items (e.g., "I prefer to wash my hands right after shaking someone’s hand"). The internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) for these subscales in this study was 0.78 for perceived infectivity and 0.72 for germ aversion.
The participants were also queried regarding:
The study examined fundamental sociodemographic factors, including gender, age, and educational attainment.
The medical history of individuals should be thoroughly examined, focusing particularly on the presence of cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, immunosuppression, or diabetes. These conditions are known to significantly impact an individual's overall health and can have implications for various medical interventions and treatments. By understanding a patient's medical history in detail, healthcare providers can tailor their approach to care and treatment, ensuring the best possible outcomes for the individual.
Personal hygiene behaviors, including the use of masks, disinfectants, and hand washing, were assessed through a dichotomous question format (yes/no).
The study investigated individuals' fear of visiting the dentist and their likelihood of canceling appointments due to concerns about infection. Data collection involved a dichotomous question format, where participants were asked to respond with a simple "yes" or "no" to indicate their feelings towards canceling appointments out of fear of infection.
The research focused on assessing individuals' perceptions of the risk of contagion in specific locations. Participants were asked to rate various places, including a dental clinic, supermarket, cinema/theater, hospital, sports stadium, gymnasium, nightclub, health center, public toilet, library, and domestic flight, based on the risk of coronavirus infection. A five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ("No risk") to 5 ("Very high risk") was employed for this purpose.
The study examined the perception of contagion risk associated with visiting a dental clinic for specific procedures or under certain circumstances, such as being the last patient of the day, waiting in the room for over 15 minutes, undergoing treatments like extractions, root canals, fillings, scale and polish, or a routine check-up. Participants rated their perceived risk on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ("No risk") to 5 ("Very high risk").
Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The data analysis encompassed descriptive statistics and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess the assumption of normality, which was validated. To explore potential differences based on gender and the risk group for coronavirus infection (individuals over 60 years old and those with underlying systemic diseases), t-tests were employed for quantitative variables, while chi-square tests were utilized for categorical variables. Existing literature posits that the elderly population with comorbidities faces an elevated risk of contracting and succumbing to COVID-19. Significance levels were set at 0.05.
In relation to the educational attainment of the entire sample, 12.3% had finished primary school, 27.7% had completed secondary school, and 60% had achieved a university degree.
In relation to systemic diseases, 3.5% of the participants exhibited cardiovascular conditions, 6.9% presented respiratory ailments, 2.6% were identified as immunosuppressed, and 1.6% were diagnosed with diabetes.
The mean and standard deviation (M and SD) were 3.29 (1.15) for infectivity subscales and 4.14 (1.19) for germ aversion. Among the sample, 2.3% reported using masks on the street, 38.7% used disinfectant gel, 76.1% practiced handwashing upon arriving home, 91.6% expressed no fear of contracting the coronavirus in dental clinics, and 90.1% indicated they would not cancel a dental appointment due to coronavirus fears. As illustrated in Table 1, the highest average perceived risk was associated with hospitals at 3.38 (1.12), followed by outpatients at 3.26 (1.10), and dental clinics at 3.06 (1.09), all falling within the medium-risk category. Notably, the most concerning risk during clinical procedures was identified as being the last patient of the day, as shown in Table 2.
There were no significant gender differences observed in the infectability subscale, however, variations were noted in the germ aversion subscale (p < 0.05).
No significant disparities were observed in safety and protection protocols, with the exception of hand disinfectant usage, which was notably higher among women (x2 = 11,321, df = 1, p = 0.001). Gender did not play a significant role in the fear of visiting the dental clinic or in the decision to cancel appointments due to concerns about coronavirus infection.
There were no significant differences observed between the two groups in terms of visiting any space. Nevertheless, notable disparities were evident in the risk associated with dental procedures, including waiting in the waiting room (p < 0.01), undergoing a tooth extraction (p < 0.05), as well as receiving endodontic (p < 0.05) and filling procedures (p < 0.05). Women perceived the risk to be greater than men for these specific variables, as indicated in Table 3.
The sample was stratified based on specific risk factors, including the presence of at least one underlying systemic disease such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, immunosuppression, or diabetes, as well as being aged over 60 years (comprising 34 subjects).
Statistically significant differences were observed in both the infectivity (p < 0.01) and germ aversion (p < 0.01) subscales.
Statistically significant differences were observed in safety and protection measures, specifically in the utilization of masks (χ2 = 169.221, df = 1, p = 0.000) and disinfectants (χ2 = 5.641, df = 1, p = 0.018). However, no statistically significant variances were identified concerning hand washing practices.
Significant disparities were observed among groups concerning the fear of visiting the dental clinic due to the threat of coronavirus infection (χ2 = 128.125, df = 1, p = 0.000) and the act of canceling appointments (χ2 = 113.635, df = 1, p = 0.000), with elevated scores noted in the at-risk group.
Significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of the risk associated with visiting various locations, including a dental clinic (p < .01), a hospital (p < .01), a nightclub (p < 0.01), a health center (p < 0.01), a sports stadium (p < 0.01), and a public toilet (p < .01), as well as taking a domestic flight (p < 0.05). The risk group exhibited a higher average risk level compared to the non-risk group across all locations, with the exception of the nightclub and sports stadium.
The risk group exhibits significantly higher scores for all dental procedures compared to the non-risk group, as indicated in Table 3.
In this study, we investigated the impact of perceived vulnerability to infectious diseases and germ aversion within the population, alongside the perception of contracting the coronavirus. Despite worldwide attempts to curb the spread of COVID-19, the outbreak persists, largely attributed to the transmission patterns of this infection. Notably, European nations such as Italy, Spain, Germany, and France have reported the highest number of confirmed cases. Moreover, there has been a notable surge in cases internationally, particularly in countries like Iran, South Korea, and the United States in recent days.
The onset of the coronavirus pandemic in Spain marked a critical juncture on March 9th, as the number of confirmed cases surged, doubling within a mere 24-hour span. Subsequently, on March 14, the government implemented stringent measures to curb the outbreak, declaring a state of emergency to mitigate the infection rate. Notably, during the survey period spanning from the 1st to the 8th of March, Spain reported 1,024 confirmed cases, a stark contrast to the current tally of 39,673 cases at the time of this writing, underscoring the evolving situation. The study revealed that solely the elderly population, deemed at higher risk due to their age, perceived dental clinics as potential hotspots for contagion, prompting them to avoid seeking dental services. Conversely, the broader populace exhibited lower levels of awareness regarding infectivity and germ aversion, continuing their daily routines, including dental appointments, inadvertently facilitating the virus's rapid transmission. Given the unique dynamics of dental procedures, characterized by the generation of droplets and aerosols, coupled with the close proximity in the treatment area, conventional protective measures such as surgical masks, gloves, nonwaterproof eyewear, and gowns prove inadequate in preventing COVID-19 transmission, particularly when patients are in the incubation phase or conceal their infection status.
This study reveals that a significant portion of the population adhered to the preventive measures recommended by health authorities, with 76.1% practicing handwashing upon returning home and 38.7% utilizing hand sanitizer. Despite these efforts, there has been a surge in the number of cases, with approximately 14% of those infected being healthcare professionals. A New York Times article published on March 15 titled "Workers at Highest Risk of Coronavirus" highlighted a striking diagram illustrating that dentists face a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to nurses and general practitioners. In the initial outbreak in Wuhan, 6.75% of the 44,672 cases were healthcare workers. A recent clinical study reported that 29% of the 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia in Wuhan were healthcare professionals. The implementation of public awareness campaigns and the consistent use of personal protective equipment have led to a gradual decline in risk within Hubei Province. Dental professionals are particularly vulnerable when treating infected patients due to close proximity and the potential exposure to blood, saliva, and respiratory droplets.
This study reveals notable disparities in germ aversion, with higher rates observed in women compared to men, aligning with prior research findings. This discrepancy can be attributed to the emotional aspects influencing perceptions of uncertainty, as existing literature suggests that women typically exhibit a greater aversion to risk than men, although this aspect remains inadequately explored.
This study adds to the comprehension of why individuals over the age of 60 with systemic pathologies may avoid visiting the dentist. This reluctance stems from their belief that there is a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus, particularly if they are the last patient of the day, experience delays of over 15 minutes, or are scheduled for procedures like dental extractions, root canals, or fillings.
It is essential to acknowledge certain limitations in this study. Firstly, the representativeness of our convenience sample may be subject to scrutiny. Nevertheless, the gender distribution among participants was relatively even, and the prevalence of susceptibility to infection and aversion to germs observed in the sample fell within the range reported in prior studies conducted with adult populations.
One potential limitation arises from the reliance on self-report measures, which may be influenced by responses driven by social desirability. Additionally, the timing of the study and its cross-sectional design capture a specific moment when the disease started to propagate. Nevertheless, the data gathered remains highly valuable due to the critical situation unfolding in neighboring Italy. Given the similarities in vulnerabilities among populations, the disease could potentially yield comparable outcomes in Spain, with a surge in infections and fatalities.
This research holds significant implications for dental practice. Throughout the data collection period, cases and fatalities resulting from COVID-19 had already been identified in Spain. Despite this awareness, the study reveals that the population expressed a reluctance to alter their engagement with dental clinics. Additionally, health authorities did not impose any restrictions on dental activities during this period. These two factors, coupled with the reported shortage of personal protective equipment by the Council of Dentists, have played a role in the transmission of the virus.
On March 16, 2020, the General Council of Dentists advised dentists to defer elective procedures for a period of five weeks, with the possibility of extension based on the progression of the pandemic. They also suggested that dental professionals focus solely on addressing dental emergencies. This directive, coupled with the scarcity of personal protective equipment, has resulted in the closure of a majority of dental clinics. Consequently, there has been a disruption in oral healthcare services, leading to a decline in the overall oral health of the population and a significant economic impact on the dental sector.
Future research endeavors will be necessary post-pandemic to validate the actual impact on population oral health and the economic implications for dental clinics.
In conclusion, this study highlights the heightened vulnerability to contracting COVID-19 perceived by individuals over 60 years of age with underlying health conditions at the onset of the epidemic in Spain, leading to their reluctance to seek dental care. In contrast, the rest of the population exhibits lower susceptibility to COVID-19 infection.
The authors express their gratitude to the study participants for their valuable contributions.
