In March 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared the outbreak of a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus that originated in China in late 2019, leading to the naming of the disease as COVID-19. Against this backdrop, the SBAIT (Brazilian Society of Integrated Care for Traumatized Patients) conducted a survey involving 219 trauma and emergency surgeons to assess the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the responsibilities of surgeons during this global health crisis. The survey, conducted electronically, revealed that surgeons are currently working in suboptimal conditions, facing shortages of essential supplies including critical items like N95 masks and facial shields necessary for the safe care of potentially infected patients. This scarcity heightens the risk of healthcare professionals becoming infected, thereby jeopardizing the integrity of medical teams. Urgent actions are imperative to ensure the widespread availability of protective gear nationwide, as all trauma and emergency patients must be treated as potential carriers of COVID-19, necessitating stringent safety measures to safeguard both patients and healthcare providers.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared the outbreak of a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 in China, leading to the naming of the disease as COVID-19. This virus exhibits a high level of transmissibility and spread within a global population lacking natural immunity, resulting in significant mortality rates, particularly among the elderly and individuals with underlying chronic conditions. Moreover, it poses a severe threat to healthcare systems worldwide, overwhelming hospitals and intensive care units with a sudden surge in patients, depleting crucial medical resources like mechanical ventilators, and causing shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers, thereby increasing the risk of infection among frontline personnel and contributing to the potential collapse of the entire healthcare infrastructure.
It is important to note that alongside the influx of COVID-19 patients, emergency departments in Brazil are also facing the challenge of managing other critical cases such as trauma and surgical emergencies. Surgeons are tasked with providing care to these patients while simultaneously dealing with the complexities of protecting themselves with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). This dual responsibility underscores the strain on healthcare professionals as they navigate the demands of the current healthcare landscape.
The scarcity of equipment and the excessive exposure to COVID-19 render health professionals a highly vulnerable group. Numerous studies have demonstrated that thousands of healthcare workers have already contracted the virus, with hundreds succumbing to the illness. The New York Times reported that out of Spain's more than 40,000 confirmed cases, around 5,400 are healthcare workers, accounting for 14% of the total cases, a trend mirrored in other heavily affected nations. By early March, China had documented over 3,300 infected healthcare workers and at least 22 fatalities. Given the heightened risks of contamination during invasive procedures, the necessity of stringent protective guidelines for emergency personnel and surgeons cannot be overstated.
In this context, the Brazilian Society of Integrated Care for Trauma (SBAIT) conducted a survey among trauma and acute care surgeons to assess the availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the responsibilities of surgeons during the ongoing pandemic.
This study utilized a prospective questionnaire administered through the SurveyMonkey tool (http://www.surveymonkey.com) and distributed electronically to SBAIT members, including trauma and acute care surgeons, as well as non-members, with a total of approximately 1,500 forms sent out. The questionnaire comprised 14 questions, with 13 being objective and one allowing surgeons to provide observations relevant to the topic. The questions focused on the type of facility and region of work, personal safety measures in place, availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for managing trauma patients, including those with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis, and those with potentially surgical conditions. The collected data was automatically transferred to an Excel file for subsequent analysis.
Participation in the questionnaire was voluntary and spontaneous, with all responses being provided anonymously. Given the nature of this survey, it does not necessitate approval from an ethics committee.
Out of the 1,500 forms distributed, 219 responses were collected, representing a response rate of 14.6%. The data indicates that a significant proportion of the surveyed surgeons originate from the South and Southeast regions of Brazil, accounting for 54.3% of the total respondents, as illustrated in Figure 1. Among these respondents, 82% are actively involved in emergency room and/or trauma bay duties, while a minority have reported direct contact with confirmed COVID-19 positive patients.
In evaluating the professionals' workplace settings, it was noted that a majority of them were engaged in professional activities within municipal public hospitals (22.8%), public state hospitals (63.9%), or social health organizations (OSS) (17.3%). Additionally, it was observed that over 50% of the surgeons also held positions in private hospitals, as illustrated in Figure 2.
In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident that a minority of surgeons, specifically 15.5%, perceive themselves as entirely safe to carry out their duties, whereas a larger proportion, accounting for 49.7%, view themselves as only partially safe. Conversely, a significant 32.4% of surgeons do not feel secure in delivering care to patients who may be infected, as illustrated in Figure 3.
In the realm of personal protective equipment (PPE), it was noted that none of the items identified as essential for the care of trauma victims achieved 100% availability among the 219 respondents. Even fundamental supplies like gloves (93.6%), surgical masks (89%), and surgical caps (86.3%), which ideally should be universally accessible in all services, were found to be lacking in certain locations (see Figure 4).
When queried about the safety equipment utilized by surgeons within the hospital setting, 115 individuals (52.5%) indicated the use of a traditional surgical mask, while 30% reported abstaining from any form of personal protective gear. Regarding protective measures employed when attending to patients lacking suspected COVID-19, findings revealed that 43.8% of surgeons opted for conventional surgical masks even in non-suspected scenarios, with 36.5% opting for N95 masks (Figure 5). Responses concerning the utilization of PPE during surgical procedures on patients without suspected viral infections mirrored those obtained for the care of individuals lacking clinical suspicion.
In relation to laparoscopic surgery and the potential risk of viral transmission through pneumoperitoneum, the study revealed that a majority of surgeons (52.9%) are currently not conducting these procedures. Additionally, 23.7% have opted to avoid such surgeries solely in suspected and/or confirmed cases, while 16.4% of surgeons have continued to follow the standard indications for laparoscopic procedures (Figure 6).
In terms of indications and surgical management for emergency cases, whether traumatic or not, it was noted that 36.9% of the 81 surgeons surveyed maintained their standard indications and approaches without alterations. However, a significant portion, 51.6%, opted to conduct thoracic CT scans and/or in specific cases, while 7.7% chose non-operative treatment when deemed feasible (Figure 7).
In light of the routine nature of securing an airway being a crucial aspect of the responsibilities of this cohort of professionals, our study focused on assessing the range of materials accessible for oral-tracheal intubation. The findings revealed that a significant proportion of surgeons (55.7%) possessed a face shield, while a slightly lower percentage (42%) had access to a fan filter. Regrettably, the availability of a video laryngoscope for intubation was reported by only a minority of professionals, as depicted in Figure 8.
In terms of the personal protective equipment (PPE) accessible to the surgeons for conducting operative procedures, it was noted that fewer than half of them possessed the recommended protective gear as outlined by Anvisa (National Health Surveillance Agency) at a rate of 46.5%. A total of seventy-nine surgeons, accounting for 36.1%, indicated having less than the recommended equipment, while 14.6% were unaware of these guidelines.
In this study, 63% of surgeons reported encountering challenges in acquiring Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) within their respective hospitals. Additionally, a notable 53.4% (116) of surgeons indicated that they were unaware of any health professionals who had contracted the virus.
Injuries stemming from trauma are widely recognized as the leading cause of mortality among individuals under the age of 45 globally. Approximately 6 million individuals succumb to these injuries annually, accounting for roughly 10% of all deaths worldwide. This staggering figure surpasses the combined mortality rates of malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV.
As of April 15, 2020, data from the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University indicates that over 2 million individuals globally, including more than 30,000 in Brazil, have contracted COVID-19, resulting in the loss of over 140,000 lives worldwide.
In contemporary Brazil, the predominant scenario involves trauma victims being admitted to public hospitals and OSS, with around 62% of participating surgeons conducting their practices in these settings. As of April 12, 2020, the Brazilian Medical Association (AMB) had documented 3,031 grievances concerning the inadequate availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for patient treatment. Presently, both public and private healthcare sectors are grappling with shortages of essential materials and equipment, thereby endangering the safety of medical professionals. Among the 826 institutions surveyed by AMB, a staggering 95% reported encountering challenges related to the procurement of necessary supplies.
The shortage of equipment reported to AMB was primarily linked to the limited availability of N95 masks (87%), followed by goggles or face shields (70%) and fluid-resistant gowns (66%). The level of exposure and associated risk is significant, with 26% of respondents indicating a shortage of gloves and 35% lacking alcohol-based hand sanitizers. These statistics align with the results depicted in Figure 4 of the current study.
Assistance provided to trauma victims typically adheres to established protocols like Advanced Trauma Life Support© (ATLS), which mandates that professionals aiding such individuals should be equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including face shields, goggles, fluid-resistant gowns, and gloves. These recommendations have been advocated for decades by the American College of Surgeons and its Committee on Trauma. Regrettably, in Brazil, both public and academic hospitals often fail to adhere to these guidelines, thereby placing healthcare workers at an elevated risk of exposure to bodily fluids, secretions, and more recently, aerosols emanating from the airways of potentially contaminated patients.
ANVISA has recently released a technical note stipulating that healthcare professionals conducting procedures within a distance of less than 1 meter from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients must adhere to specific guidelines. These include maintaining hand hygiene, wearing goggles and/or face shields, utilizing surgical masks, which are to be substituted with N95/PFF2 masks during aerosol-generating procedures, as well as donning gloves and fluid-resistant gowns.
Regrettably, the current study reveals that out of the 219 surgeons who participated in the survey, 32 of them exhibited a lack of awareness regarding ANVISA's recommendations. This highlights the pressing need for enhanced educational initiatives by medical societies and health authorities to ensure that all healthcare professionals are well-informed about the guidelines and recommendations set forth by regulatory bodies.
In a recent electronic publication, Machado Jr. recommends that all trauma centers ensure surgeons have sufficient access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and establish institutional policies for airway management. Similarly, Lima et al. have provided recommendations for emergency surgery during the pandemic, emphasizing the importance of utilizing protective equipment in conjunction with proper surgical techniques and meticulous surgical planning as effective strategies to minimize contamination rates among healthcare professionals.
When questioned about the indications for laparoscopic access in emergency surgeries, the surgeons exhibited a tendency to avoid or completely refrain from using it. This aligns with the current recommendations of various medical societies, which caution against its use due to the potential risk of team contamination through aerosol emission from pneumoperitoneum.
The global shortage of protective equipment has significantly impacted surgeons worldwide. This study reveals that over 80% of surgeons express feelings of being either partially or entirely unsafe while providing care. In the UK, Rimmer's research indicates that approximately one-third of surgeons (32.5% out of 1978 respondents) have highlighted issues concerning the availability of protective gear in their healthcare facilities. Furthermore, more than half of the surveyed surgeons reported difficulties in accessing PPE supplies within their hospitals over the past month.
Regrettably, a rise in casualties within hospital staff is anticipated, stemming from the contamination of surgeons on the front lines and the stress induced by daily exposure to cases of trauma and COVID-19 infection. In a study by Lai et al, which focused on 1257 healthcare workers in Wuhan during the pandemic's peak, alarming rates of psychological distress were observed, with 50.4% reporting depression, 44.6% anxiety, 34% insomnia, and 71.5% stress among respondents.
The onset of the recent pandemic caught many by surprise, revealing numerous vulnerabilities within global healthcare systems that were ill-equipped to handle such a crisis. Despite warnings issued by both scientific and non-scientific communities over the past decade, these alerts went largely unheeded, leaving many unprepared for the unprecedented challenges that have since unfolded.
The potential loss of contaminated healthcare professionals, some of whom may be temporarily incapacitated while others may not survive, poses a significant burden on both society and healthcare systems. It is imperative that safeguarding these professionals becomes a top priority during this critical period, alongside ensuring the dissemination of crucial information to the general populace.
This study, despite its national scope, has limitations as it did not encompass all states and medical services equally. Furthermore, the response rate of 14.6% may not provide statistical power to fully support the findings. However, despite these limitations, conducting this study was deemed a priority to swiftly assess the situation in the country and propose timely recommendations. Notably, this survey marks the first of its kind conducted in Brazil with a focus on the current pandemic.
SBAIT recently disseminated recommendations for surgeons through its media channels, yet there is a consensus that further efforts are needed to enhance communication. Particularly during periods of heightened crisis, effective communication plays a pivotal role in safeguarding a greater number of lives.
In conclusion, trauma and acute care surgeons find themselves in a vulnerable position during the ongoing pandemic, as they care for traumatized and critically ill patients often without adequate personal protective equipment, thus increasing their risk of exposure to contamination. The dissemination of crucial information that can safeguard the well-being of these surgeons is imperative during this crisis, not only within the healthcare system in Brazil but also on a global scale.
