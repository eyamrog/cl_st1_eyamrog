The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of emotional changes on the arterial stiffness index and cardiovascular risk among pre-hypertensive individuals.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 48 pre-hypertensive patients to assess emotional alterations, global cardiovascular risk, and arterial stiffness index. The arterial pulse wave in the first finger of the lower right limb was recorded using the PPG technique with the ANGIODIN® digital plethysmograph.
Results: Pre-hypertensive patients exhibiting emotional alterations displayed significantly higher values in Weight, Body Mass Index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and arterial stiffness index compared to those without emotional alterations. Among pre-hypertensive patients, 58.3% tested positive on the Cornell test, with 39.6% being female and 18.8% male. A notable association (p<0.001) was observed between the presence of emotional disturbances and a moderate cardiovascular risk.
Conclusions: Emotional changes in pre-hypertensive individuals are linked to elevated arterial stiffness and an augmented overall cardiovascular risk.
Investigating the physiological correlates of psychological stress is crucial in understanding the potential impact of stress on the development of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Key psychological factors influencing blood pressure control include depression, chronic anxiety disorders, and panic attacks. Studies have shown a higher prevalence of depression among individuals with resistant arterial hypertension, with a positive correlation between anxiety levels and blood pressure values. Individuals in the early stages of hypertension exhibit a more pronounced pressor response to mental stress compared to normotensive individuals. Recent literature on emotional hypertension emphasizes the importance of future research focusing on high-risk populations, such as those with prehypertension or genetic predispositions. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate the specific role of stress-related responses, particularly negative emotions, in the pathogenesis of high blood pressure.
Objective: This study aims to investigate the impact of emotional changes on the arterial stiffness index and cardiovascular risk among pre-hypertensive individuals.
A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 48 pre-hypertensive patients, of whom 30 were women, at clinic 2 of the "Josué País García" Polyclinic in Santiago de Cuba. The pre-hypertensive status was determined based on The 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension and 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guidelines, using the established code for blood pressure (5). Approval for the study protocol was granted by the ethics committee for research involving human subjects at the Universidad de Ciencias Médicas de Santiago de Cuba, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their enrollment in the study.
The exclusion criteria encompassed individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease or any condition necessitating medication that could impact the cardiovascular system (such as high blood pressure, asthma, or oral contraception), as well as those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, mental illness, and unwillingness to abstain from smoking within 12 hours prior to the session.
Emotional alterations were assessed using the Cornell Index test (6), global cardiovascular risk was determined through the Framingham model (7), and the lower limb arterial stiffness index was calculated based on the contour of the pulse wave (8). During the morning Photoplethysmography (PPG) recording session, which took place between 08:30-12:00 am, participants were seated in a comfortable chair in a dimly lit room with a controlled temperature ranging between 24-27 °C. They were given 10-15 minutes to rest and adapt to the local conditions before their blood pressure was measured using a certified Sphygmomanometer and stethoscope.
The PPG technique was employed to capture the arterial pulse wave in the first finger of the lower right limb, utilizing the ANGIODIN® digital plethysmograph. This device operates through the reflection method, detecting volume variations with an 850 nm and 3.5 mA photodiode. Subsequently, the PPG signal undergoes analog bandpass filtering, ranging from 0.1 Hz to 15 Hz (Butterworth 5th order filter), and is digitized at 8-bit resolution with a sampling rate of 106 samples per second. The collected data is then transmitted, processed, and stored using the VAPLET® auxiliary software, which facilitates the export of the arterial pulse wave on a beat-by-beat basis. This allows for individual processing by a separate system. The arterial stiffness index was determined using the model proposed by Pascau in 2011.
Continuous data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). To compare two groups, the nonparametric means test (Mann-Whitney U test) was employed for continuous variables, while the chi-squared test was utilized for categorical variables. Statistical analyses were conducted using JASP Team's software (2020), specifically JASP Version 0.13.1.
The pre-hypertensive patients exhibiting emotional alterations demonstrated significantly higher values in weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and arterial stiffness index compared to patients without emotional alterations.
The pre-hypertensive patients exhibiting emotional alterations showed a notable elevation (p = .031) in the arterial stiffness index (7.04 ± 2.59) compared to those without emotional alterations (5.85 ± 1.00).
In this study, emotional alterations were linked to a notable rise in weight, BMI, SBP, DBP, and arterial stiffness index. These results align with those of a previous study (10) where acute stress induction did not yield significant changes in autonomic function but did lead to a significant increase in arterial stiffness. Nevertheless, psychosocial stress during adolescence has been shown to induce sympathetic activity, resulting in elevated resting systolic blood pressure and heart rate, potentially contributing to arterial stiffness (11).
Numerous studies have indicated that social relationships and negative emotional traits are influential factors in cortisol secretion (11,12). Additionally, less supportive social connections and negative emotional characteristics have the potential to impact central adiposity through their effects on neuroendocrine function (11). The heightened release of cortisol is recognized for its role in the accumulation of abdominal fat, leading to visceral obesity (13). It is widely acknowledged that negative emotional states can render individuals more susceptible to a range of diseases (11,12).
The current study has revealed that pre-hypertensive patients with emotional disturbances are more likely to exhibit a higher cardiovascular risk compared to pre-hypertensive individuals without such emotional issues. Previous scientific research has indicated that an inclination towards an exaggerated cardiovascular response to stress can predict the future development of essential hypertension. This response involves elevations in arterial pressure that surpass what is considered a normal adaptive reaction to potential stressors. Gianaros (2012) demonstrated a correlation in healthy subjects between increased blood pressure reactions and heightened neural activation in limbic regions and the brainstem in response to mental stress. Additionally, it has been suggested that dysfunctional emotion regulation in essential hypertension may share neurocognitive mechanisms with stress and anxiety, implicating the thalamic pulvinar nucleus. Individuals with essential hypertension exhibit notably higher levels of anxiety and anger-hostility coping thoughts, along with a tendency towards more hostile and physically aggressive thoughts compared to normotensive individuals. The findings of this study indicate that emotional disturbances represent an independent and supplementary factor contributing to cardiovascular risk in pre-hypertensive individuals.
The presence of emotional alterations in pre-hypertensive patients is linked to elevated arterial stiffness and an increased overall cardiovascular risk.
Firstly, this study was cross-sectional in nature, which inherently restricts the ability to establish temporal or antecedent consequent relationships between risk factors and the onset of prehypertension. Additionally, a notable limitation lies in the likelihood that our study participants were potentially more well-adjusted individuals, thus not fully representative of the broader pre-hypertensive population. This notion is supported by the observation that pre-hypertensive individuals who did not engage in the follow-up assessment exhibited elevated levels of anger, anxiety, and hostility.
