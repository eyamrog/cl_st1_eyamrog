The emergence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has escalated into a worldwide public health crisis, characterized by a fatality rate spanning from 1% to 5%. The primary objective of this study was to pinpoint and delineate active high-risk transmission clusters of COVID-19 within the region of Sergipe.
Methods: A prospective space-time analysis was conducted utilizing confirmed cases of COVID-19 over the initial 7 weeks of the outbreak in Sergipe.
Results: The prospective space-time statistic identified "active" and emerging spatio-temporal clusters encompassing six municipalities located in the south-central region of the state.
Conclusions: The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with spatio-temporal scan statistics offers valuable and timely support for surveillance efforts and aids in informed decision-making processes.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a significant global public health challenge. Its clinical presentation encompasses a spectrum of respiratory symptoms, varying from mild upper respiratory disease to severe interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The initial outbreak of COVID-19 took place in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. However, it was not until March 11, 2020, that the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared it a global pandemic. Given the rapid spread and epidemiological dynamics of the virus, various containment and mitigation measures were swiftly put in place to flatten the curve of infection and prevent the overwhelming of national healthcare systems. Alongside the challenges of providing medical assistance, surveillance systems have been strained to keep up with the evolving epidemiological landscape, often requiring real-time updates. Unlike many diseases that are typically updated on an annual basis, the COVID-19 pandemic demands immediate attention. The surveillance systems must be agile enough to swiftly detect new clusters of cases, regardless of their size or location, to effectively map out the spatial patterns of disease occurrence.
Research on space-time patterns plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of disease transmission within populations and pinpointing the factors contributing to varied geographic distributions. The prospective analysis of space-time data proves to be a valuable tool in tracking outbreaks by enabling the timely identification of emerging clusters and assessing the relative risk posed to different locations during an epidemic. The primary objective of this study was to pinpoint active high-risk transmission clusters of COVID-19 within the region of Sergipe.
An observational study utilizing spatial analysis techniques was conducted, encompassing all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Sergipe and its capital, Aracaju, spanning from March 12 to April 30, 2020. The units of analysis in this study were the 75 municipalities of Sergipe and the 39 neighborhoods of Aracaju. Data, along with the spatial coordinates of the patients' residences diagnosed with COVID-19 and reported to the Department of Health of Sergipe (SDH/SE), were collected for analysis.
Sergipe, depicted in Figure 1A, stands as the smallest state in Brazil, covering an area of 21,918,454 km2 and situated in the Northeast region of the country. This state is further subdivided into 75 municipalities, with a total population estimated at around 2,242,937 individuals. Aracaju, illustrated in Figure 1B and serving as the state capital, spans an area of 181.90 km², encompasses 39 neighborhoods, and is home to an approximate population of 623,766.
Diagnostic tests to confirm COVID-19 through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were conducted at the Central Public Health Laboratory (Lacen). Lacen routinely tests all symptomatic patients exhibiting influenza-like illness (ILI) at hospitals and sentinel units. Notably, there were modifications in the sample collection criteria for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test during this period. Initially, tests were administered to suspected cases originating from transmission areas; however, following the declaration of community transmission, the criteria were narrowed to encompass only cases necessitating hospitalization or involving healthcare workers.
The confirmed cases of COVID-19 were georeferenced, and points were marked by capturing latitude and longitude coordinates from Google Maps. Subsequently, the non-parametric Kernel intensity test was employed for statistical smoothing, resulting in the generation of a density surface to visually identify hot spots, indicating clustering in spatial distribution and a continuous surface based on the georeferenced data. The level of smoothing, or the width of the influence radius, was set at 3,000 meters, as this value provided a suitable representation of the case distribution.
The prospective space-time scan statistic was utilized to pinpoint high-risk spatio-temporal clusters for COVID-19 transmission through the discrete Poisson probability distribution model. This analytical approach facilitated the identification of ongoing clusters at the conclusion of the study period, distinguishing them as active space-time clusters. Any clusters lacking a statistically significant relative risk were excluded from consideration.
In this model, the distribution of cases in each location adheres to the Poisson distribution, which was selected due to its ability to reflect a specific mass risk within the base population. These cases are subsequently integrated into the overall population count. According to the null hypothesis, the anticipated number of cases in each region is directly proportional to the population size or person-years within that specific area. The Poisson discrete model necessitates the enumeration of cases and populations across a defined set of data locations.
In our model, we make the assumption that COVID-19 cases adhere to a Poisson distribution based on the population of the specific geographic region under consideration. The null hypothesis (H0) posits that the model represents a consistent risk characterized by an intensity μ, which is directly proportional to the population at risk. On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis (AH) suggests that the observed count of COVID-19 cases surpasses the anticipated number of cases calculated from the null model, indicating a higher risk scenario.
The anticipated quantity of COVID-19 cases (μ) under the null hypothesis H0 is calculated according to Equation 13: μ=p* C/P (1), where p represents the population in i; C signifies the total count of COVID-19 cases in the region; and P denotes the estimated total population in the region. It is important to highlight that the model operates under the assumption that the population remains constant in each location during each time period.
A model was constructed under specific conditions: an aggregation time of one day, non-overlapping circular clusters, with the spatial cluster's maximum size set at 50% of the population at risk, and the temporal cluster's maximum size at 50% of the study period. The identification of primary and secondary clusters was achieved through the log likelihood ratio (LLR) test and visually depicted on maps. Relative risks (RR) for COVID-19 occurrence were computed for each cluster compared to neighboring areas. Significance was determined for results with p-values < 0.05 based on 999 Monte Carlo simulations.
Maps were generated utilizing QGIS 3.4.11 (Open Source Geospatial Foundation, Beaverton, Oregon, USA) and TerraView 4.2.2 (National Institute for Space Research, INPE, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil). SaTScan™ 9.6 (Harvard Medical School, Boston, and Information Management Service Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA) was employed for conducting the space-time scanning analysis.
Informed consent was deemed unnecessary for this study, given its exclusive reliance on publicly accessible secondary anonymous data that precluded any potential identification of individuals. Consequently, ethical review board approval was not sought. The researchers provided assurances regarding the confidentiality and anonymity of all data, including any personal information involved.
Throughout the study period, a total of 2,512 COVID-19 diagnostic tests were conducted on residents of Sergipe. Among these tests, 453 cases were confirmed positive, accounting for 18.03% of the total tests conducted. However, it is worth noting that 3 cases, representing 0.66% of the confirmed cases, were excluded due to either the individuals not residing in Sergipe or insufficient information regarding their place of residence.
The initial instances of the disease were officially verified on March 14, 2020, among individuals residing in the Atalaia neighborhood of Aracaju city, situated to the south of the capital. The average age of the afflicted patients was 43 years with a standard deviation of 18.9 years. The majority of those affected were female, accounting for 54.70% of the cases, predominantly falling within the age range of 20 to 59 years, representing 80.12% of the total cases. Additionally, a significant proportion of the patients, amounting to 65.56%, were residents of the capital city.
All confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the specified period were georeferenced, and their spatial distribution is illustrated in Figure 2. Kernel analysis revealed clusters of higher density (hot spots) of cases primarily in the metropolitan region encompassing Aracaju, Barra dos Coqueiros, Nossa Senhora do Socorro, and São Cristóvão (Figure 2A), indicating the spread of the virus across Sergipe's territory. Additionally, potential risk areas were identified in the central region of Aracaju municipality, including the neighborhoods of Jardins, Grageru, Ponto Novo, Luzia, Salgado Filho, Inácio Barbosa, São José, 13 de Julho, and Suíça (Figure 2B).
Figure 2C illustrates the statistically significant emerging spatio-temporal clusters of COVID-19 observed between April 26 and April 30, 2020. This particular cluster is located in south-central Sergipe and encompasses 6 municipalities as detailed in Table 1. The Relative Risk (RR) associated with this cluster is calculated to be 23.69, with a p-value of less than 0.0001, indicating a high level of statistical significance.
In Aracaju, a statistically significant space-time cluster was identified (Figure 2D). This cluster comprises 19 neighborhoods, including Atalaia, América, Cirurgia, Centro, Coroa do Meio, Farolândia, Grageru, Inácio Barbosa, Jabotiana, Jardins, José Conrado de Araújo, Luzia, Pereira Lobo, Ponto Novo, Salgado Filho, São José, Suíça, Siqueira Campos, and Treze de Julho, all centrally located in the capital. The Relative Risk (RR) within this cluster was calculated to be 12.59, with a p-value of less than 0.0001 (Table 1).
The findings of this research present space-time dissemination patterns of COVID-19 in Sergipe and its capital, Aracaju. This study represents a pioneering effort in utilizing prospective space-time scan statistics to delineate active clusters of the disease within our state. The implications of these results are significant, offering valuable insights for shaping public health policies to effectively combat the epidemic. Comparable investigations employing technological tools to comprehend the spatial dynamics of COVID-19 have been conducted in China, the nation where the initial infections were documented.
Although COVID-19 is considered a disease with relatively low lethality, its rapid spread and subsequent overwhelming of healthcare systems are notable characteristics. In response to the global public health crisis, the state government took action following the confirmation of the initial five cases by issuing Decree 40,560 (https://www.se.gov.br/uploads/download/midia/9/a3621f04488 01b738cc5cce794263b49.pdf) to regulate pandemic measures related to COVID-19. It is crucial to emphasize that surveillance and control measures focusing on monitoring Influenza-Like Illnesses (ILI) in Sergipe began a month before the first cases were confirmed. During this period, all 54 individuals showing symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 tested negative, underscoring the proactive approach taken by health authorities in the state.
The disease's spread mirrored that of other states, with initial cases concentrated in the capital, particularly in affluent neighborhoods possibly linked to infections abroad or contact with travelers. As community transmission solidified, the disease extended to the southern regions, creating a significant space-time cluster in the central-southern area of the state. Notably, commercial activities and intercity mobility in these municipalities, like Estância, which currently ranks second in confirmed cases, are robust.
The sociodemographic analysis reveals a higher participation of adults, particularly within the 20 to 59-year-old age bracket, aligning with findings from a South Korean study which similarly highlighted the majority of affected individuals falling within the 20 to 59-year-old range. The average age of the cases under review, at 43 years, closely mirrors figures reported in Indian studies (40.3 years). While individuals of all age groups are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, research indicates that the disease tends to manifest more severely in the elderly, particularly those with underlying health conditions like heart disease and diabetes mellitus. This underscores the potential role of a compromised immune system in exacerbating the progression of the viral infection. In contrast, children typically exhibit milder symptoms upon presentation.
In terms of gender distribution, the study revealed a predominance of female individuals, aligning with previous research that similarly identified a higher proportion of women affected. Nevertheless, contrasting findings have been documented in other studies, which have reported a preponderance of men.
In this context, remote sensing, big data spatial technologies, and GIS have been pivotal. These tools enable space-time predictions regarding transmission speed and epidemic scale, along with mapping the dynamics of health resource supply and demand within a territory. The utilization of GIS in this study facilitated risk mapping in territories by establishing statistical associations between various data types and disease distribution knowledge. This approach enhances the alignment of control programs with local realities, ensuring greater consistency and effectiveness.
In the context of an emerging and rapidly spreading disease like COVID-19, the utilization of techniques that analyze space-time data becomes crucial for supporting decision-making processes necessary for disease surveillance within a geographical context. These analytical tools enable the identification of at-risk areas, aiding in the prioritization of health resource allocation and the implementation of interventions that streamline the monitoring and control of cases.
COVID-19 presents a burgeoning global public health challenge, particularly in Sergipe, where issues primarily stem from its potential for rapid spread, adaptability to diverse environments, universal susceptibility, and the potential for widespread epidemics and severe respiratory complications. Consequently, any emergence of a public health issue in an indigenous setting should never be disregarded.
The battle against COVID-19 necessitates the implementation of comprehensive policies and interventions that engage multiple sectors of society. Despite the challenges posed by socioeconomic factors, urgent investment in the health sector of this country is imperative for the execution of virologic epidemiological surveillance measures, particularly during periods of heightened risk to public health.
The global dissemination of COVID-19 and its repercussions in Brazil prompted the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization to declare a public health emergency. This declaration necessitated a concerted effort to allocate resources and coordinate actions among various levels of government to mitigate the transmission of the virus.
Our study is subject to certain limitations. Notably, the inclusion of certain details in the notification forms was discretionary. This optional nature of information provision poses a challenge to the comprehensive gathering of essential data, potentially impeding epidemiological research outcomes and resulting in skewed conclusions and insufficiently informed public policy strategies.
As the pandemic spreads to new regions, additional data can be incorporated into prospective space-time scan statistics to track active clusters and pinpoint areas that are not at high risk from COVID-19. While the findings are significant, it is crucial to account for the diversity in transmission rates among various regions, which can differ based on interventions, daily practices, healthcare infrastructure, and surveillance measures. Therefore, further research will be essential to comprehend the disease's impact across different territories.
