Abstract 
The severe acute respiratory syndrome of the new coronavirus, SARS CoV-2, which 
became a pandemic, was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019. It 
can cause mild symptoms, but in some cases it can cause serious complications, 
leading to death. The disease spreads through aerosol droplets and has estimated 
incubation period between 2 and 14 days (a period in which the patient has high 
potential to infect other people). Endodontists have high risk of exposure to COVID-
19 when compared to other health professionals, since most of the work involves the 
generation of aerosols and care for patients in emergency situations, such as 
symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, acute apical 
abscess and traumatic dental injuries, is imperative. Thus, this critical review 
addresses considerations about endodontic care in times of pandemic, whose 
emergencies imply real need for treatment, as well as the care that must be adopted 
in order to minimize risks for both professionals and patients who seek the resolution 
of their clinical pain conditions. 
Indexing terms: COVID-19; coronavirus; dental practice; dentistry; Endodontics. 
 
Introduction 
The severe acute respiratory syndrome of the new coronavirus - SARS CoV-2 
(COVID-19), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 [1] and 
since then it has become a public health crisis worldwide [2], being declared a 
pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Although 
COVID-19 infections in humans generally cause mild symptoms in most cases, in 
some situations, it may cause serious complications, leading to death [3]. 
  
The disease spreads through aerosol droplets [4] and has estimated 
incubation period of 2 to 14 days [5]. It is known that patients without symptoms or 
who are during the virus incubation period have the potential to infect other people 
[5]. 
  
Thus, the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend to oral health professionals extreme 
caution and warn them to limit dental work strictly to situations of dental emergencies 
[6,7], since aerosol is the source of COVID-19 spread, in addition to other viral 
infections, which puts dentists and other dental professionals on the first line of the 
risk exposure scale [8]. 
  
The aerosol produced by dental practice instruments can remain in the air and 
surfaces for several hours [9] and although the operator can be unhurt if well 
protected during therapeutic practice, the air will remain contaminated, representing 
a risk to operators after removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) and for the 
next patient [10]. 
  
Thus, patients with non-urgent oral conditions should temporarily avoid 
attending the dental office [11]. In addition, as the understanding of this new disease 
is evolving, dental practices should be prepared to identify possible COVID-19 
infection and refer the patient with suspected, confirmed or history of COVID-19 
infection to appropriate treatment centers [12]. 
  
In this pandemic, it is necessary to reduce face-to-face consultations to 
decrease the risk of infection, and teleodontology can be an alternative for dentists to 
investigate the need for treatment and ensure continuity of care [13,14], especially for 
COVID-19 patients or those suspect to be infected [14]. However, if there is need for 
treatment, at this epidemic moment, every patient should be considered potentially 
infected with the virus because the clinical presentations of this disease can be 
dynamic and therefore there are chances that dentists will treat some patients with 
asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, and all dental practices need to review their 
infection control policies, engineering controls and supplies [12]. Therefore, every 
patient must be considered potentially infected with this virus, and all dental practices 
need to review their infection control policies, engineering controls and supplies [12]. 
  
In view of the above, this critical review aims to present considerations about 
dental care in time of pandemic, specifically, endodontic care, whose urgencies imply 
real need for treatment. 
 
Considerations on Dental Care in Endodontics 
  
Studies addressing important aspects of COVID-19 regarding clinical severity, 
extent and types of transmission, as well as the most appropriate treatment, have 
been carried out worldwide since the beginning of the disease [4] and until now, there 
is no consensus on dental treatment protocols that must be adopted for COVID-19 
patients [15]. 
  
However, it is imperative that the dentist, especially endodontists, take 
appropriate measures to keep themselves protected [2,13] and also ensure the 
maintenance of patients' health in the dental environment, since only protective 
measures do not guarantee the non-contamination of other patients [13.16]. 
  
Endodontists have higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 when compared to 
other health professionals, since most of the work involves the generation of aerosols 
and the care of patients with dental pain is imperative. In addition, close and 
prolonged face-to-face contact between patient and dentist during endodontic 
treatment creates a high risk for cross-infection [4,17]. 
  
Protection guidelines for dental care during the COVID-19 pandemic are being 
formulated based on grouping patients according to their health condition and 
considering the risks and benefits of the necessary procedures [18]. Most studies 
recommend the postponement of elective dental treatment, focusing on emergency 
care only [12,19], since endodontic infections can cause severe pain and endodontic 
emergencies are considered an important category of dental emergencies [2]. 
  
The possible clinical conditions that constitute endodontic emergencies 
include symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, acute 
apical abscess and traumatic dental injuries [4]. When studying the characteristics of 
dental emergencies during the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China, Yu et al. [2] 
found that only dental emergency cases were referred to the hospital during online 
health consultations. They concluded that most dental emergencies were of 
endodontic origin (50.6%), including symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic 
apical periodontitis, acute apical abscess and traumatic dental injuries. Bai et al. [11] 
observed that the frequency of endodontic emergencies and the proportion of 
patients with acute pain were significantly higher in 2020 than the same period in 
2019. 
  
Emergency dental care for a positive COVID-19 patient may be necessary 
and, to date, there is no consensus on dental treatment protocols for an infected 
patient [15], but the advice is not to provide care in a primary dental environment, 
since the COVID-19 patient is classified as having a level-three biosafety risk, which 
means that procedures involving microbes can cause serious and / or potentially 
lethal diseases through the airways [20]. In these cases, the hospital environment is 
the most appropriate for providing frequent air renewal, reducing the risks to the 
health of professionals [15,21]. 
 
Considerations on Suggested Protocols 
  
Yang et al. [16] and Ather et al. [12] suggest that three simple assessments 
should become routine. The first and most important is the patient's history, 
preferably remotely, which can be performed by phone or video call. With this, it is 
possible to know if the patient has had contact with other infected people or shows 
symptoms that may suggest COVID-19 infection, or even if he / she has already had 
the disease. 
  
Then, checking the patient's temperature before entering the dental office and, 
finally and most importantly, the performance of a quick test in the office environment 
in order to verify whether the patient is infected or not [12,16], because rapid and 
accurate detection is essentially to limit the spread of the virus, in addition to 
reducing the waiting period, allowing immediate intervention for negative cases [4]. 
  
In situations where rapid tests are inconclusive or positive, care should be 
postponed and the patient referred to the doctor or health care provider for additional 
tests to confirm that the patient has COVID-19 and to ensure that he / she is properly 
treated and clinically isolated [12,16]. The current standard approach for COVID - 19 
screening requires real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-
PCR) test. However, according to Sharma et al. [4], this approach depends on high-
cost facilities, well-trained staff and generally demands more time. 
  
Studies have shown promising results is testing the diagnosis of coronavirus 
through saliva, such as the loop mediated isothermal amplification - LAMP [22,23] 
and microfluidic RT-PCR devices - Lab-on-a-chip tests [1] . 
  
According to Yu et al. [2], reducing care time and controlling exposure to the 
virus are two relevant ways to reduce the risk of contamination during endodontic 
treatment. The most recent recommendations regarding the use of personal 
protective equipment (PPE) for dental emergencies include the use of N95 
disposable masks, goggles, disposable gloves and caps, shoe protection, face 
shields and use of cloaks [15,19]. However, in the case of endododontic emergency 
care for positive COVID-19 patients, the recommendation is total protection for face 
and eyes against aerosols, through the use of full face masks with air purifier, which 
provide protection five to ten times higher than the N95 mask [15]. 
  
With regard to radiological examination, pre-treatment radiographs should be 
limited to extra-oral techniques only, as intraoral radiography can stimulate vomiting 
and / or cough reflex [24]. The use of computed tomography is also an alternative 
that can be considered [2], despite the high cost. 
  
Another recommended preoperative approach is to rinse the patient's mouth 
with hydrogen peroxide and / or povidone-iodine in order to decrease the viral load in 
saliva [18,19]. The use of 0.12% chlorhexidine dodigluconate, in turn, still lacks more 
robust scientific evidence [18]. 
  
Isolation barriers such as dykes or rubber sheets should be used during 
clinical care in endodontics, because, although they are not able to limit aerosol 
diffusion by themselves, they can drastically reduce or even eliminate the presence 
of salivary components in the aerosol [2, 12]. 
  
For cases of vital pulp or pulpitis, pulpotomy or pulp capping can be useful in 
terms of shortening treatment time [2]. In COVID-19 patients, once initial emergency 
pulpectomy or pulpotomy has been performed, definitive treatment should be 
postponed until the patient recovers, which must be at least three days after 
symptoms disappear [7]. However, it may be prudent to postpone this procedure for 
at least a month [15], since the time during which the virus can remain active in the 
patient remains unknown [25]. In addition, the single file systems can be used in 
endodontic treatment as another alternative to decrease clinical time [26], in addition 
to avoiding the risk of contamination during resterilization [2]. 
  
The post-care period must involve patient care and supervision, as well as 
environmental disinfection procedures [18]. In addition, waste management must be 
carried out in a safe manner, and must be conditioned in impermeable bags, made of 
material resistant to rupture and leakage, and placed in closed containers until 
collection by specialized services [18]. 
  
It is noteworthy that changes in biosafety protocols during the COVID-19 
pandemic, the increase in PPE values, and the need to purchase new equipment 
such as thermometers have significantly increased the costs of dental treatments 
[27]. 
 
Concluding remarks 
  
The main recommendations point out that endodontic care should only be 
performed in cases of patients with clinical pain conditions, and in cases of COVID-
19 patients, the orientation is not to provide care in a primary dental environment, but 
in a hospital environment. 
  
Currently, the main challenge is the development of a vaccine against SARS 
CoV-2. Dentists should focus not only on dental treatment and risk reduction, but 
also be aware of patients' psychological state. Further studies should be carried out 
using approaches to mitigate aerosol transmission and reduce the risks of COVID-19 
contamination.
