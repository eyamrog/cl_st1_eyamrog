INTRODUCTION 
 
Coronaviruses (CoV) belong to the Coronaviridae family, Nidovirales order. 
These viruses are enveloped, have a positive-sense single-stranded RNA 
genome and are classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. 
The alpha, beta, and delta CoV infect mammals. However, they all have the 
ability to jump between species, leading to the emergence of severe 
respiratory syndromes in humans, such as the Middle East respiratory 
syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV, the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV, and, more recently, COVID-19, 
caused by SARS-CoV-2.1  
CoV-related disease was first described in 1931, with the isolation of 
the first human virus per se (HCoV-229E) in 1965. Until the epidemic of SARS 
in late 2002, only two human CoV types were known — HCoV-229E and 
HCoV-OC43. Since then, another six human CoV have been identified, 
implicated as causes of cold (2 to 10%), the second most common after 
rhinoviruses, manifesting in adults with limited symptoms, including rhinitis, 
sore throat, and dry cough. Although CoV also cause enteric and systemic 
diseases, most infections are mild, resolving spontaneously.1  
 
Despite the fact that the neurotropic, neuro-invasive and neurovirulent 
capabilities of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been described in animals 
and humans leading to encephalitis, meningitis or encephalomyelitis, the 
specific mechanisms of this process are not well characterized.2  
SARS-CoV-2 was first described in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. 
In a few months, it has spread to nearly every country throughout the world, 
with large economic, social and health impacts, in addition to an 
overwhelming number of deaths.3 The clinical syndrome caused by SARS-
CoV-2 is called COVID-19. In a fair proportion of cases, COVID-19 symptoms 
are clinically indistinguishable from those of common flu, namely fever (90%), 
cough (70%), myalgia and fatigue (50%), less frequently headache (8%), and 
diarrhea (5%), while anosmia and ageusia may be initial manifestations.3 A 
smaller proportion of severe cases present more intense lower respiratory 
tract disease, often requiring respiratory assistance. On the opposite side of 
the spectrum, 5% of cases are asymptomatic.4 Moreover, as the pandemic 
unfolds, there is growing evidence that COVID-19 is a multisystemic disease. 
For instance, renal failure is more common than initially realized, whereas 
cardiac dysfunction has also been well described in many SARS-CoV-2 
infected individuals.5,6 
Although the data are preliminary, a substantial proportion of patients 
develop neurological complications associated to COVID-19. Data from a 
series of patients from Wuhan, China, indicate that neurological abnormalities 
are found in 36.4% of hospitalized patients.7 It is likely that this figure may 
vary depending on several factors, such as clinical setting (outpatients versus 
inpatients), demographic features (age, sex, ethnicity) and methodology of 
neurological assessment.  
The mechanism of neurological involvement in COVID-19 remains to 
be determined, but it is probably heterogeneous and multifactorial, including 
direct involvement of the brain due to SARS-CoV-2, auto-immune factors, 
inflammation (“cytokine storm”), drug side-effects, metabolic disturbances and 
critical care neuropathy.8,9 The data from Wuhan show that most 
complications have an early onset suggesting that direct involvement of the 
nervous system by the virus is an important factor. This is unlikely what 
happened with SARS, whose neurological findings had a late onset, 
suggesting an underlying autoimmune mechanism.8  
Absence of reports of phenomena such as chorea, myoclonus, 
opsoclonus and ataxia, and the scarcity of cases of acute demyelinating 
polyradiculopathy suggest that immune mediated phenomena are not as 
common in COVID-19 although caution is warranted in interpreting such data, 
because many of these autoimmune manifestations have a prolonged latency. 
Moreover, there are descriptions of ataxia, stroke associated with 
antiphospholipid antibodies and even Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in 
individuals with COVID-19.7,10,11 Another important question about the 
interplay between infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the nervous system is if 
pre-existing neurological diseases increase the risk of severe complications, 
such as respiratory failure in COVID-19. As of the writing of this review, there 
is no evidence that this is the case.9 Yet, intuitively, one may argue that 
conditions associated to respiratory issues (e.g., severe myopathies, 
neuropathies, neuromuscular junction disorders), as well as degenerative 
diseases, such as advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD), render subjects prone 
to a more malignant course of COVID-19. Despite the lack of data, one also 
expects worsening of neurological conditions as a result of COVID-19. 
Unpublished experience of the authors confirms this may happen in PD, 
which is not surprising, considering that it is well known that patients with 
underlying degenerative disease, including dementing conditions, develop 
significant, often irreversible, worsening as a result of clinical disturbances. 
Other potential issues that may negatively interfere with the course of 
neurological illnesses are social isolation and lack of exercise due to staying 
at home and social distancing.12  
Finally, at a global level, the worsening of the pandemic has rightly led 
the health systems to focus on preventing and combating COVID-19. There is 
growing evidence that patients with other medical conditions are facing 
difficulties in accessing health providers despite a substantial increase in 
telemedicine. In the New York City area, for instance, there has been an 
800% increase in cardiac arrest deaths at home after the onset of the COVID-
19 pandemic.13 As such, it is possible that people with neurological diseases 
are also having trouble in contacting their neurologists and the neurological 
community must strive to keep offering care to their patients despite the 
hardships created by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
The aim of this article is to provide a review of the existing data, 
including epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical and laboratory findings 
of neurological findings in COVID-19. 
 
 
METHODS 
 
A literature search was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines14 in both MEDLINE and 
LILACS databases, using “coronavirus COVID-19”, “COVID-19”, “COVID 19”, 
“SARS-CoV-2” as search terms, along with “neurology”, “neurological“ and the 
specific disorder designations: cerebrovascular, stroke, encephalopathy, 
encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis, Guillain Barré, Guillain-Barré syndrome, 
myalgia, headache, hyposmia, anosmia, ageusia, in the medical subject 
headings, title, abstract, or author‐supplied keywords. Research was 
broadened to include screening of reference lists of systematic review articles 
for additional studies initially missed or presented only in abstract form. No 
restrictions were predetermined as to the year of the study, with investigations 
dating from the earliest available date until May 10th, 2020. Only studies in 
English were included. We analyzed publications with laboratory confirmed 
cases only, ranging from relatively large series to more limited case series 
and case reports (Figure 1).  
Figure 1 shows the ﬂow diagram for inclusion of articles.

Cerebrovascular disease  
 
 
Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially critically ill elderly 
cases, appear to be more susceptible to develop cerebrovascular disease 
(CVD), including cerebral hemorrhage and ischaemic stroke. The cases 
described so far indicate that ischaemic CVD in this setting may have distinct 
characteristics, with implications for diagnosis and treatment: the vast majority 
had large-vessel occlusion, and a significant number had multiple territories 
affected. Although some of the reported events were the first-ever in these 
patients medical history, most cases already had other cerebrovascular risk 
factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking or 
previous stroke history.15,16 On the other hand, two recent reports identified a 
total of six cases of large-vessel stroke in SARS-CoV-2 patients younger than 
50 (33‒49) years of age. Three had no vascular risk factors, five had anterior 
circulation strokes, and all had mild to moderate symptoms of the viral 
infection. Most remained severely disabled at last follow-up assessment.17,18  
 
There is strong evidence that vascular complications may arise for the 
most part due to the well recognized potentially fatal inflammatory storm, 
which reflects a hyperactivation of inflammatory factors and dysfunction of the 
coagulation system, especially D-dimer and platelet abnormalities, increasing 
the risk of CVD. Furthermore, hypertense SARS-CoV-2 infected patients 
frequently develop changes in blood pressure, potentially explained by the 
fact that the virus specifically binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 
(ACE2) receptors. In addition, thrombocytopaenia, a risk factor for cerebral 
haemorrhage, is distinctively found in severe cases of the disease.15 This 
equation may be further complicated by cardiogenic and hematologic factors, 
as data from previous coronavirus and influenza epidemics suggest that viral 
infections can trigger acute arrhythmias, exacerbation of heart failure, and 
myocarditis.3,19 In turn, Zhang et al.10 described severe coagulopathy, multiple 
infarcts (brain, upper and lower extremities), severe coagulopathy and the 
presence of antibodies against cardiolipin and β2-glycoprotein I in patients 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
 
The aforementioned evidence is partially corroborated by clinical data 
derived from a case series of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Mao et al.7 
identified neurologic symptoms in 45.5 % of patients in a series of 88 severely 
infected patients, 5.7% of them presenting either ischemic or hemorrhagic 
CVD. Asadi-Pooya and Simani20 published a systematic review of studies on 
the neurological findings of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, identifying 
ischemic CVD in about 5%, in addition to cases of cerebral venous sinus 
thrombosis and cerebral hemorrhage. CVD cases were significantly older, 
more likely to present with severe infection, to have cardiovascular risk 
factors, and to show increased serum markers of inflammatory response and 
hypercoagulable state. Overall, more than a third of these CVD patients 
eventually died. Although a pooled analysis of studies on this topic showed 
that stroke was associated to a 2.5-fold increase in odds of severe COVID-19, 
there was no statistically significant association of stroke with mortality.21 
Figure 2 illustrates a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated to cerebral 
hemorrhage seen by one of the authors of this review.  
 
Finally, Khosvarani et al.22 developed guidelines entitled “Protected 
Code Stroke” for the management of hyperacute stroke during the 
coronavirus disease pandemic, providing considerations for screening, 
personal protective equipment and crisis resource management.

due to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Axial T-2 imaging shows bifrontal lesions 
which, added by additional sequences, suggested subacute parenchymal 
hematomas. Further imaging showed diffuse petechial hemorrhage throughout most 
of the hemispheric grey matter, suggestive of coagulopathy. 
 
 
Encephalopathy 
 
 
The largest data available on neurologic complications associated to 
SARS-CoV-2 arose from a retrospective case series of 214 hospitalized 
patients with confirmed COVID-19.7 Out of the 214 patients (36.4%), 78 were 
found to have nervous system-associated manifestations, which were divided 
into three subgroups: central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous 
system (PNS), and skeletal-related injury. CNS involvement, in particular, was 
seen in 53 patients (24.8%); these manifestations comprised dizziness (n=36; 
16.8%), headache (n=28; 13.1%), impaired consciousness (n=16; 7.5%), 
acute CVD (n=6; 2.8%), ataxia (n=1; 0.5%), and seizure (n=1; 0.5%). Among 
these CNS-related manifestations, impaired consciousness and CVD were 
significantly more common in patients with severe versus nonsevere COVID-
19 infection. The authors defined impaired consciousness as any change in 
level (e.g., somnolence, stupor, and coma) and/or content of consciousness 
(e.g., confusional state and delirium). In other words, an encephalopathic 
state. As to seizures, there was one patient in the study who experienced 
acute limb twitching, foaming in the mouth and loss of consciousness for three 
minutes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and invasive procedures, such 
as lumbar puncture, were avoided given the risk of cross-contamination. 
Therefore, it is not possible to further characterize these patients’ 
encephalopathy with confidence.7  
A similar retrospective study, also from China, included 274 patients 
with COVID-19: 113 deceased and 161 recovered patients.23 Headache or 
dizziness were the initial presenting symptoms in 31 patients (11%) and 21 
patients (8%), respectively. Hypoxic encephalopathy was identified in 24 
patients (9%). Whereas headache and dizziness were similarly seen in the 
deceased and alive patient groups, hypoxic encephalopathy was more 
frequent in deceased patients (n=23/113) in comparison to those from the 
recovered patient group (n=1/161). The reported rate of confusional state was 
also 9% in a similar Chinese retrospective series involving 99 patients with 
confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia.24 In another Chinese retrospective 
multicenter study with 304 patients who had been either discharged or died, 
eight were encephalopathic (2.6%; n=8/304): one obtunded, one delirious, 
and the remaining six comatose. Non-convulsive status epilepticus was 
excluded as a cause for altered mental status.25 
A French case series reported on neurologic complications in a cohort 
of 58 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 infection.26 Confusional state and agitation were seen in roughly 
two-thirds of patients. A total of 13 patients underwent brain MRI because of 
unexplained encephalopathy, eight of them showing leptomeningeal 
enhancement. Eight patients underwent electroencephalography (EEG), 
which only revealed nonspecific changes. Lastly, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
analyses of seven patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The authors 
speculated on the underlying mechanism of neurologic injury in these 
patients, raising the possibility of multifactorial factors, including intensive care 
unit (ICU) related encephalopathy, cytokine storm, and the effect or 
withdrawal of medications. 
 
The first case of presumed COVID-19-associated acute necrotizing 
hemorrhagic encephalopathy27 was of a middle-aged woman who presented 
respiratory symptoms along with fever and altered mentation. COVID-19 was 
confirmed with a nasopharyngeal swab. CSF studies were limited due to a 
traumatic lumbar puncture. The available tests reported by the authors 
included HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV and West Nile virus, which were all negative. 
SARS-CoV-2 was not tested in the CSF. Neuroimaging was remarkable for 
hemorrhagic, rim-enhancing lesions in the bilateral thalamus, medial temporal 
lobes and subinsular regions. Computed tomography (CT) angiography and 
venography were normal. This patient was treated with intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG), but details of outcome are unavailable. It is important 
to note the presumptive nature of this diagnosis because SARS-CoV-2 was 
not tested in this patient’s CSF. Moreover, despite being rare, acute 
necrotizing encephalopathy may be caused by a myriad of pathogens, 
including influenza A and B, parainfluenza, varicella, and HHV6.28 In addition, 
two other reports should me mentioned. The first is a 54 year-old woman 
found unconscious at home and diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia due to 
SARS-CoV-2. Upon steady clinical deterioration, EEG showed focal 
frontotemporal seizure activity while brain and spine MRI revealed alterations 
of the periventricular white matter, bulbo-medullary junction and in both the 
cervical and thoracic spinal cord, hyperintense in T2WI, without restriction of 
diffusion or contrast enhancement. CSF examination was normal, including 
mutiple sclerosis markers and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. 
The authors label the clinical presentation as brain and spine demyelinating 
lesions induced by a delayed immune response secondary viremia.29 The 
second is a case of possible acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) 
described in a female patient in her early forties with acute dysphagia, 
headache, dysarthria and encephalopathy, nine days after presenting with 
fever and respiratory symptoms.30 Chest imaging showed signs of 
pneumonia, whereas brain MRI T2 FLAIR imaging showed extensive patchy 
areas of abnormal signal involving bilateral frontoparietal white matter, 
anterior temporal lobes, basal ganglia, external capsules and thalami 
suggestive of a demyelinating process. Vascular imaging was normal. CSF 
analysis was also normal, including PCR for meningitis and encephalitis 
causing agents. The testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection was positive. The 
patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, ceftriaxone and a five-day 
course of IVIG with overall good response. A major caveat in this case is the 
fact that it was published in a non peer-reviewed source; thus, the occurrence 
of ADEM in this context still lacks confirmation.30  
 
It was not until a few days later that the first confirmed case of CNS 
infection by SARS-CoV-2 was published,31 confirming the neuroinvasive 
properties of the virus. The patient was a 24 year-old man who developed 
headache, fatigue and fever roughly a week before presenting to the hospital 
due to a convulsive episode. Meningeal irritation was identified with 
examination warranting workup with a head CT and lumbar puncture. The 
former did not show cerebral edema, whereas the latter revealed increased 
opening pressure (320 mm H2O), mononuclear-predominant pleocytosis 
(12/uL), no red blood cells, and presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Serum HSV-1 
and VZV IgM antibodies were negative. Neuroimaging showed right mesial 
temporal encephalitis and right ventriculitis without abnormal enhancement; it 
also showed pan-paranasal sinusitis. Chest imaging confirmed pneumonia, 
although nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. This patient 
was treated with acyclovir, ceftriaxone, vancomycin and steroids, as well as 
anti-convulsants.31  
 
Later, three additional patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were 
reported as having meningoencephalitis presumably related to the virus. The 
first, a Chinese man, had the diagnosis of CNS infection based on clinical 
grounds — altered mentation and meningeal signs. This patient’s CSF studies 
were within normal limits, including negative testing for SARS-CoV-2, and 
head CT with no acute findings. Mental confusion resolved by the time of 
discharge.32 The second patient was a middle-aged woman who presented to 
an emergency department in the United States with fever, headache, and 
new-onset seizure. Initial examination was notable for meningeal signs. Head 
CT was normal, but CSF studies showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and 
increased protein and red blood cells; SARS-CoV-2 was not tested and HSV 
PCR was negative. Although the patient did not have significant respiratory 
symptomatology, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her hospital course 
was complicated by encephalopathy despite no recurrence of seizures after 
anti-convulsant medication was initiated; EEG showed generalized slowing 
only. There is no available information on follow-up.33 The third case is of a 40 
year-old man presenting acute brainstem dysfunction three days after onset of 
symptoms that eventually led to the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Brain 
and spine MRI showed changes in keeping with inflammation of the brainstem 
and the upper cervical cord, leading to a diagnosis of rhombencephalitis.34 
Altered mental status, hyperreflexia and meningeal signs were also observed 
in a 64 year-old man from China, whose main symptoms were fever and 
respiratory-related symptoms; his testing was remarkable for negative SARS-
CoV-2 in the CSF, but positive in a throat swab.35 
 
CNS involvement in the context of COVID-19 may be truly neurologic, 
a consequence of systemic injury, or a combination of both. The neurotropic 
nature of SARS-CoV-2 is supported by the observation of viral spread into 
CSF35 and the possible neuroinvasive potential of this virus. The latter is 
based on the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which in turn 
has 
established 
neuronal 
invasion 
capabilities.36,37 
Other 
possible 
mechanisms of CNS insult secondary to COVID-19 include hypoxic injury 
from lung disease, overactive systemic immune response and resultant 
cytokine storm (including IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, and TNF-alpha), and damage to 
endothelium and blood-brain-barrier resulting in vascular injury.38  
 
Guillain-Barré Syndrome 
 
 
GBS can potentially be linked to any viral infection and is a 
documented complication found in previous viral pandemics, including those 
due to Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and H1N1 influenza viruses.39 Due to the 
rising pandemics of SARS-CoV-2 infection since the early months of 2020, 
vigilance for signs and symptoms of GBS should be part of the assessment of 
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection given that, although a rare event in 
general, GBS is a potentially treatable complication that may rise the viral 
infection lethality if not promptly identified.  
 
As of the time of the writing of this review, 11 cases of GBS potentially 
linked to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.11 The first affected patient, 
published in early-April 2020, was a 61 year-old woman who returned to 
Shanghai from Wuhan in mid-January 2020, four days before presenting to 
medical attention. At admission, she denied the typical signs of SARS-CoV-2 
infection, had normal lung auscultation and, as such, was not tested for it. Her 
complaints were of a one-day history of progressive fatigue and areflexic 
symmetric weakness in the lower extremities. Initial blood workup showed low 
lymphocyte count and thrombocytopenia. Three days after admission, 
symptoms were more profound, also affecting her upper extremities and 
added by a decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick. At this point, CSF 
indicated normal cell count, but increased protein levels of 124 mg/dL (8–43 
mg/dL). Nerve conduction studies performed on the fifth day after admission 
were in keeping with a diffuse demyelinating process. A diagnosis of GBS 
was established and a course of IVIG was started. Eight days after admission 
(11 days since returning from Wuhan), she developed dry cough and fever 
(38.2°C), and a chest CT showed ground-glass opacities in both lungs. At this 
point, oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR 
assay. The patient was isolated, received supportive care and empirical 
antivirals (arbidol, lopinavir, and ritonavir). She improved gradually and was 
discharged 30 days after admission with normal global strength and reflexes, 
no respiratory symptoms, and a negative SARS-CoV-2 test.11 Although the 
patient was not tested for the viral infection upon admission, the co-ocurrence 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS intuitively raises the possibility of a causal 
relation. The pattern, however, is, if anything, that of a parainfectious process 
(based on the recent travel history and bloodwork findings on admission), 
rather than the classic post-infectious pattern reported during previous 
pandemics, Zika virus being the best example. Besides that, one can 
speculate that IVIG treatment may have triggered the presentation of 
symptoms and signs of the viral infection.  
 
The second case, published in mid-April, was of a 65 year-old male 
patient from Iran, presenting typical symptoms of acute progressive symmetric 
ascending quadriparesis, two weeks after been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 
pneumonia based on positive RT-PCR and chest CT imaging, and treated 
with 
hydroxychloroquine, 
lopinavir/ritonavir 
and 
azithromycin. 
Neurophysiological study was consistent with acute axonal polyradiculopathy 
variant of GBS. CSF analysis was not performed due to a lack of consent, and 
the patient was treated with IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day for five days). No details 
regarding the outcome were provided.40 At the same time, another case of a 
54-year-old male with a two-day history of numbness and progressive 
weakness of his lower extremities was reported. Upon initial assessment, the 
patient also had fever and cough over the past 10 days, and diarrhea. 
Neurological examination confirmed an areflexic motor strength deficit. SARS-
CoV-2 infection was confirmed with RT-PCR with chest imaging showing 
bilateral basilar lung opacities. Based on clinical presentation, the diagnosis of 
GBS was presumed even though the authors did not pursue further 
paraclinical confirmation and started IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day for five days) and 
hydroxychloroquine. The outcome was positive, with improvement in 
respiratory and neurological status.41  
 
The most solid report on this topic came from Italy, including five 
patients diagnosed with GBS after RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Presentation were lower-limb weakness and paresthesia in four patients and 
facial diplegia followed by ataxia and paresthesia in one patient, with 
tetraplegia evolving over a period of 36 hours to four days in four patients. 
The interval between the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS symptoms 
ranged from five to 10 days. CSF analysis showed normal white cell count in 
all of them, and elevated protein in three. Electrophysiological studies were 
consistent with an axonal variant of GBS in three patients, and a 
demyelinating process in two. All patients were treated with IVIG, one had a 
repeated IVIG course and another one was treated with plasma exchange. 
Outcomes varied: four weeks after treatment, two remained in the ICU 
receiving mechanical ventilation, two were still recovering with significant 
weakness, and one had been discharged, able to walk independently.42  
Another Italian report arguably had a parainfectious presentation and 
was, unfortunately, the first fatal case of GBS in this setting: a 71 year-old 
man with rapidly progressive ascending tetraparesis, paresthesias, and 
areflexia. CSF and nerve conduction studies confirmed a severe form of acute 
polyradiculoneuritis with prominent demyelinating features. Given that the 
patient also presented with a one-week complaint of fever and dyspnea, he 
was tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and underwent a chest CT, testing 
positive for COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite prompt treatment with IVIG, 
antiviral therapy (lopinavir and ritonavir), and hydroxychloroquine in intensive 
care setting, the patient died a few hours after admission.43  
Finally, a Spanish report of two cases, one presenting with anosmia, 
ageusia, oculomotor palsy, ataxia, areflexia, albuminocytologic dissociation 
and positive testing for GD1b-IgG antibodies, five days after developing 
cough, malaise, headache, low back pain and fever with positive RT-PCR for 
SARS-CoV-2; and another of a 39 year-old man with ageusia, bilateral 
abducens palsy, areflexia and albuminocytologic dissociation, three days after 
developing diarrhea and fever with positive testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus 
infection. The first patient was treated with IVIG and both made a complete 
neurological recovery, except for residual anosmia and ageusia.44 
 
Until the writing of the present review, there seems to be reasonably 
good evidence for an association of SARS-CoV-2 infection, GBS and GBS 
variants. Furthermore, the apparent dysproportional frequency of axonal 
damage raises the possibility of the occurrence of more severe forms in this 
setting. Awareness for this specific complication is advised, as well its 
inclusion in the differential diagnosis of cases with suspected critical-illness 
polyneuropathy. Conversely, it also seems reasonable to test new GBS cases 
for the virus during the ongoing pandemic.  
 
Olfactory and taste disorders 
 
Anosmia or hyposmia refer, respectively, to the absence or reduction of 
the sense of smell, whereas ageusia is the loss of taste. Both conditions, 
anosmia or ageusia, may occur in isolation (idiopathic) or associated with 
structural damage to the nervous system. Several neurological diseases may 
present with olfactory impairment, such as head trauma, multiple sclerosis, 
PD and Alzheimer’s disease.45 More frequently, 11 to 40% of patients with 
upper airway tract infection, common cold or influenza may present anosmia 
or hyposmia.46  
 
Recently, a few studies have identified both anosmia and ageusia as 
frequent and marked clinical features observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Giacomelli et al.47 evaluated, with a simple questionnaire, 88 hospitalized 
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, detecting olfactory or taste disorders in 
33.9% of patients, whereas both were subjectively detected at the same time 
in almost 20% of them. In terms of timing for the detection of these symptoms, 
20.3% presented anosmia before admission, and for ageusia, 91% described 
it before hospitalization. This study also observed that olfactory and/or taste 
disorders were more frequent in female and young patients.  
In a larger multicentric study evolving 12 centers, Lechien et al.48 
evaluated 417 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and observed that 85.6% 
and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, 
respectively, and recovery rate was 44% in a short period. It is noteworthy 
that 11.8% of the patients had olfactory dysfunction as the presenting 
symptom. This study also showed that females were significantly more 
affected.  
Beltrán-Corbellini et al.49 evaluated the frequency of taste and smell 
disorders in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared them to 
patients with influenza infection as a control group, showing that these deficits 
were significantly more frequent in SARS-CoV-2 infection than in the controls. 
Moreover, another study demonstrated that patients with SARS-CoV-2 
infection may present isolated anosmia, without other upper airway infection 
symptoms or signs.50 
Although pathophysiological mechanisms related to anosmia and 
ageusia in SARS-CoV-2 are not completely understood, a mouse model has 
demonstrated penetration of the virus through the olfactory bulb.51 
Furthermore, the cells of the oral mucosa are comprised by ACE2 receptor, 
which is used by the virus to infiltrate into the cells.52 A dopaminergic pathway 
dysfunction is also presumed to be related to anosmia in patients infected by 
SARS-CoV-2.53 Finally, SARS-CoV-2 may infect the inner lining of the nasal 
cavity, triggering localized inflammation.51  
Overall, anosmia and ageusia are very common in SARS-CoV-2, more 
frequently than observed in other upper airway infections, and must be 
included as a clinical clue to guide the investigation through serology or PCR 
testing. There is no specific treatment for anosmia and ageusia related to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, recovery is variable and should occur in most of the 
affected patients after two or three weeks. A follow-up reassessment will be 
necessary to determine if these symptoms are indeed transient findings or 
permanent sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
  
Myalgia 
 
 
Myalgia is a common symptom in the neurological clinical practice, 
which, in isolation, often represents a non-specific manifestation of several 
conditions.54 In addition, myalgia has to be differentiated from mimics, such as 
cramps, which are often associated to diseases of the peripheral nervous 
system and muscles, whereas myalgia is more often a clue to a muscle 
disease per se.55 This symptom has a relatively broad differential diagnosis, 
ranging from metabolic myopathies to a side effect of the use of statins.56  
 
Brazil, among a few other countries, has recently witnessed epidemics 
of arbovirus infections, including Zika, chikungunya and dengue viral 
diseases, which present with ample spectra of neurological complications, 
including meningoencephalitis, myelitis, radiculitis, GBS, and myositis. 
Myalgia, in or out of the context of myositis, is one of the most common 
symptoms of this group of arbovirus, besides infections by influenza 
viruses.57,58,59  
During the ongoing pandemics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, descriptions 
of muscle involvement have been consistently reported.7,8,60,61,62,63,64 The 
aforementioned study by Mao et al.,7 a retrospective observational study of 
214 hospitalized patients in the city of Wuhan, China, recognized muscle 
involvement in 19.3% of patients. When compared to the patients without 
muscle symptoms, patients with myalgia had higher serum titers of creatine 
kinase (CK), regardless of symptoms severity. Myalgias correlated with higher 
neutrophil and lower lymphocyte counts, higher C-reactive protein and D-
dimer levels, indicating increased inflammatory response and blood 
coagulation function. In addition, these patients had multiorgan damage, 
including 
more 
severe 
liver 
and 
kidney 
laboratory 
abnormalities. 
Unfortunately, this publication did not explore other paraclinical markers used 
to assess the peripheral nervous system, such as nerve conduction 
studies/electromyography, CSF analysis, and muscle biopsy.7 Another study 
from Wuhan with five patients with pneumonia due to coinfection with SARS-
CoV-2 and influenza viruses, demonstrated that 40% of them had myalgia.60  
Li et al.61 performed a systematic literature review search of the main 
online databases from December 2019 to February 2020, totaling 1,994 
patients with COVID-19 and concluding that 35.8% of these cases presented 
myalgia or fatigue. The study did not perform a correlation analysis of these 
symptoms with any other variable. Huang et al.62 collected data prospectively 
on 41 hospitalized cases of COVID-19, all presenting with pneumonia and 
abnormal chest CT imaging, and observed myalgia or muscle fatigue in 44% 
of them, but reaching 54% among cases admitted to the ICU. Accordingly, CK 
and lactate dehydrogenase serum levels were elevated in 33 and 73%, 
respectively, for all patients, reaching 46 and 92%, respectively, for ICU 
patients.  
Rhabdomyolysis associated with myalgia and fatigue has also been 
described in cases with severe COVID-19 with potential implications on renal 
function.63 Finally, Han et al.64 compared the findings of 25 adults and seven 
children 
with 
confirmed 
COVID-19, 
observing 
that 
myalgia 
was 
disproportionally more common among adults, reaching 52%, although the 
children had elevated CK levels more frequently than adults (57.1 vs. 4%). 
 
Other neurological manifestations 
 
 
In addition to the conditions mentioned above, other neurological 
symptoms, signs and potential complications have been described in SARS-
CoV-2 infection. Headache, a non-specific and frequent symptom in common 
upper airway infections and, in fact, in infections in general, has been 
described almost invariably in a series of patients with SARS-CoV-2.65 In this 
scenario, however, considering that meningeal involvement and CVD are part 
of the clinical spectrum of the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is 
essential to rule out meningo-encephalitis and cerebral venous thrombosis in 
infected patients with refractory or persistent headache. Finally, although 
unusual, Mao et al.7 have reported epilepsy, dizziness, and ataxia in patients 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
 
In conclusion, we aimed at pointing out the main neurological 
manifestations described in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as of the writing of this 
review. Their frequency is relevant, occuring in more than one third of the 
hospitalized patients and varying from mild (i.e., hyposmia and myalgia) to 
life-threatening complications, such as encephalopathy and stroke. The 
existing data on the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to some of 
these neurological manifestations in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
reinforce the idea that this virus may be neuroinvasive and/or affects directly 
or indirectly the CNS or the PNS.66 As the pandemics unfold, pathological 
studies will be needed to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from neuronal cells, CSF and 
endothelium of cerebral vessels. Recognition of neurological manifestations of 
SARS-CoV-2 should be emphasized despite the obvious challenges faced by 
clinicians caring for critical patients who are often sedated and presenting 
other concurrent systemic complications. 
 
Finally, the intuitive concern regarding the potential interference of 
disease modifying agents used for the treatment of immunomediated 
neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and neuromuscular 
disorders, has been addressed in a few recent publications that should be of 
interest to clinicians involved in the care for these patients within the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic.67,68
