In the context of studying Siluriform fish monogeneans in Lake Tanganyika, two new species of Bagrobdella were identified from Auchenoglanis occidentalis. Bagrobdella vanhovei sp. nov. stands out due to its distinctive morphology of the male copulating organ (MCO) with a terminal opening. On the other hand, Bagrobdella vansteenbergei sp. nov. is distinguished by the uniform size of its hooks and the unique shape of its male copulating organ, which features a sub-terminal opening without a surrounding membrane.
Lake Tanganyika, the oldest of the East African Great Lakes at 12 million years, is distinguished by its exceptionally diverse ichthyofauna, rendering it a crucial hotspot for global freshwater lacustrine biodiversity. Spanning 3200 km2, the lake's surface area is unevenly distributed among four countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the West (14800 km2 or 45%), Tanzania in the East (13500 km2 or 41%), Burundi in the North (2600 km2 or 8%), and Zambia in the South (200 km2 or 6%). This distribution is illustrated in Figure 1 (Cohen et al., 1993; Fermon, 2007).
The fish fauna of Lake Tanganyika has garnered significant interest from evolutionary biologists due to its highly diverse cichlid population, which is regarded as a 'natural laboratory' by researchers (Martens 1997, Langenberg et al. 2003, Albrecht & Wilke 2008, Cristescu et al. 2010). The cichlid species in the lake exhibit remarkable phenotypic, ethological, and genetic diversity (Nishida 1991, Salzburger et al. 2002, 2005), boasting the highest level of endemism among the great lakes of Africa and the Americas (Salzburger et al. 2014). Out of the 241 described species, 239 are endemic to Lake Tanganyika, representing an impressive endemism rate of 99% (Ronco et al. 2020, 2021). Beyond evolutionary biologists, Lake Tanganyika Cichlids have also captured the attention of parasitologists, particularly in the realms of host biogeography, systematics, and parasite evolution (e.g. Bates, 1997, Grégoir et al. 2014, Pariselle et al. 2011, 2015, Raeymaekers et al. 2013, Steenberge et al. 2015, Vanhove et al., 2013, 2015, 2016).
The non-cichlids of Lake Tanganyika, though less diverse than the Cichlidae, have received limited attention from researchers. This group comprises 75 species across 11 families, with a notable endemicity rate of 59%. While certain families like Clupeidae and Latidae have been the focus of ecological (Coulter 1976, Mannini et al. 1999), parasitological (Kmentova et al. 2018, Kmentova et al. 2020), and genomic (De Keyzer et al. 2019) investigations, the Siluriformes, encompassing five families (Bagridae, Claroteidae, Clariidae, Mochokidae, and Malapteruridae) within this group, have been largely overlooked. Lake Tanganyika stands out as the most diverse lake globally in terms of Siluriformes diversity (Fermon 2007, Peart et al. 2014). Consequently, this study aims to explore the Monogenea parasites within this particular group.
The history of the Lake Tanganyika parasitic fauna commences with the initial description of Ancyrocephalus limnothrissae by Paperna in 1973, found on the gills of Limnothrissa miodon as documented by Boulenger in 1906. This species underwent a subsequent redescribing process and was renamed Kapentagyrus limnothrissae by Kmentova et al. in 2018. The second monogenean species from Lake Tanganyika was described as belonging to Gyrodactylus by Vanhove et al. in 2011. Subsequently, there has been a notable increase in studies focusing on Lake Tanganyika monogeneans, with a specific emphasis on Cichlidogyrus monogeneans found on Cichlid fish. Currently, there are 30 published species and an additional 10 species that remain undescribed, as highlighted by Rahmouni in 2017, 2020, and 2021.
This study represents the first documentation of Bagrobdella species in Lake Tanganyika. Up to this point, four species have been identified in Ghana, Uganda, Mali, and Cameroon within this genus: Bagrobdella auchenoglanii Paperna, 1969, B. fraudulenta Euzet & Le Brun, 1990, and B. anthopenis Euzet & Le Brun, 1990 (Euzet & Le Brun 1990) found on Auchenoglanis occidentalis (Valenciennes, 1840), and one species, B. parauchenoglanis Akoumba, Pariselle, Tombi & Bilong Bilong, 2017, discovered on Parauchenoglanis monkei (Keilhack 1910) (Akoumba et al. 2017).
The parasites discussed in this study were obtained from 11 specimens of Auchenoglanis occidentalis (Claroteidae, Siluriformes) captured in the North-Western region of the lake, a short distance from the orthodox church in Uvira (Northern part) and at the Mouth of River Mutambala (Southern part) (refer to Fig. 1). These parasites were euthanized by severing their chordal spines and were initially identified on-site as Auchenoglanis occidentalis utilizing the keys provided by Fermon et al. (2012). Subsequently, the gills and a small portion of the pectoral fins were preserved in 96% ethanol for further analysis.
Fish DNA isolation was conducted following the Aljanabi & Martinez (1997) protocol, where approximately 50 μg of pectoral fin fragment was fragmented and digested at 55 °C overnight with 20 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) in 180 μl of extraction buffer solution (1M Tris, 0.5M Na Cl2, 1 % SDS). The extracted DNA was then suspended in 150 μl sterile double distilled water and stored at −20 °C until PCR amplification (Louizi et al., 2019). The partial mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase (COI) gene was amplified using FishF1/F2 and FishR1 universal primers (Ward et al. 2005) in a 50 μl reaction volume containing 0.25 mM of MgCl 2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 mM of each primer, 5 μl buffer (10×), and 10 units of Taq polymerase. The amplification protocol included 30 cycles of 94 °C (3 min), 48 °C (30 s), 72 °C (5 min), with a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min (Louizi et al., 2019). Sequencing was carried out at the genotyping-sequencing platform of the “Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution of Montpellier” (ISE-M) in France using a Genomix sequencer (MGX) and the same primers as for PCR. Sequence cleaning and alignment were performed using MEGA X software (Kumar et al., 2018). Vouchers (Fig. 2) were deposited in the CRH-Uvira collection (DRC).
The gills were examined using a Wild Heerbrugg® M8 binocular. Monogeneans were carefully recovered with an entomologist needle, and some specimens were mounted in a drop of Hoyer’s medium (Anderson, 1954) on a slide. A coverslip was then placed over the specimen to flatten it, and the slides were allowed to dry in a horizontal position for 24 hours before sealing the coverslip with Glyceel (Bates, 1997). Other individuals were mounted using tap water and identified under a Leica® DM 2500 microscope equipped with a digital camera (Leica DMC 4500). Following identification, the monogeneans were individually stored in Eppendorf® tubes in 96% ethanol for subsequent genetic studies.
Measurements, following the methodology outlined by Euzet & Le Brun (1990), were conducted utilizing LAS version 4.12.0 software, with results presented in micrometers as an average value followed by the range in parentheses, along with the number of individuals measured. Illustrations of the sclerotized components of the Monogeneans were generated using CorelDRAW 2019 software, incorporating images captured by the camera. Statistical analyses were carried out using R 4.1.2 software developed by the R Core Team in 2022.
Data from 45 individuals of a newly discovered species, 10 individuals of another species, and 10 individuals of Bagrobdella parauchenoglanii underwent Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This analysis was conducted using the FactoMineR (Husson et al., 2020) and factoextra (Kassambara & Mundt, 2020) packages in R. Additionally, Bagrobdella auchenoglanii, B. fraudulenta, and B. anthopenis were included in the analysis as supplementary individuals, with each represented by the mean values of the parameters analyzed in Euzet and Le Brun's (1990) study.
In accordance with the guidelines outlined in article 8.5 of the revised 2012 edition of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), pertinent information regarding the recently discovered species was duly registered with ZooBank. The unique Life Science Identifier (LSID) assigned to the article is XXXX, a crucial reference for accurate identification and classification. Each novel species introduced is accompanied by its respective Life Science Identifier (LSID) in the taxonomic summary, ensuring clarity and accessibility in scientific communication.
Specimens were deposited in the Helminth collection of the Royal Museum for Central Africa (MRAC) in Tervuren, Belgium.
The authors of the new species differ from the authors of this article (International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 2015).
The host species were identified through molecular analysis, and the corresponding sequences were deposited in Genbank (Identification number XXX). Parasite infection in the gills of eleven Auchenoglanis occidentalis specimens was examined, revealing that seven out of eleven hosts were parasitized. The most heavily parasitized fish host was the single specimen caught at the Mouth of Mutambala River.
The anatomical features of Bagrobdella are as follows: length measuring 681.2 (521.7–964.9) 72, with a greatest width of 200.4 (139.8–273.2) 72, and a pharynx length of 70.6 (49.4–97) 61. The dorsal anchor parameters are as follows: a = 81.6 (64.7–94.1) 78, b = 66.1 (52.7–75.9) 78, c = 8.9 (3.0–17.2) 78, d = 20.9 (12.9–29.6) 78, e = 18.5 (13.3–22.4) 78, with no visible filaments. The dorsal bar measurements are x = 86.9 (62.2–111.6) 72, w = 14.7 (9–22.6) 71, with a posteriorly oriented median projection denoted by Y = 59.4 (33.2–81.9) 61. The ventral anchor exhibits slight drilling at the blade beginning, with parameters a = 65.3 (38–73.9) 78, b = 70.9 (60.1–79.2) 78, c = 10.5 (4.5–16.3) 78, d = 17.5 (12.6–24.0) 78, e = 6.2 (3.0–9.1) 77, and no visible filaments. The ventral bar extends as an outgrowth, with x = 111.9 (75.6–146) 75, w = 16.3 (9.4–27.4) 74, BL = 10.6 (4.6–19.8) 60, Bl = 5.8 (3.2–13) 60, and a posteriorly oriented median projection in a cross-shaped form, denoted by Cx = 72.3 (57.8–91.3) 77 and Cy = 20.4 (14.3–28.5) 76. At the posterior extremity of the median projection, a trapeze-shaped sclerotized piece is attached. Fourteen hooks are arranged in seven symmetrical pairs of varying sizes, with I being the largest and longest at 51.6 (34.3–64.2) 77, II the smallest at 16.8 (12.9–20) 69, III and IV almost identical in size at 38.6 (26.6–47.5) 74, and V to VII also almost identical in size at 25 (16.5–35.4) 72. A medium-ventral trapezoidal plate is located between hooks I, with measurements TL: 37.3 (28.4–49.8) 15 and Tl: 27.6 (21.7–34.6) 16. The penis (MCO) measures 60.5 (50.7–67.3) 71 and begins with a well-developed basal bulb, AL = 15.3 (9.9–22.4) 41, Al = 9.7 (3.4–20.3), followed by a thick-walled tube of constant diameter, folded at 30° at the middle, and surrounded by a membrane in the distal half. At the distal extremity of the tube, a triangular part tapering at its end is formed by a portion of the wall, with a length one quarter of that of the tube. The ovoid lidded eggs measure 92.8 (82.7–109.9) 12, are slightly arched, and feature a filament ending in a small disc at the pole opposite to the operculum, consistent with the description by Euzet et Le Brun (1990) in the diagnosis of Bagrobdella.
Remarks. Bagrobdella vanhovei is characterized by possessing seven pairs of hooks of varying sizes, along with a trapeze-shaped structure linked to the median projection of the ventral bar (as depicted in Fig. 6, the latter being visible in 15 out of the 78 specimens examined). These features have been noted in the descriptions of the four previously identified species within this genus. Notably, the dorsal anchors of Bagrobdella vanhovei exhibit a lengthy point, contrasting with the very short point observed in its ventral anchors, a trait shared with Bagrobdella auchenoglanii and B. fraudulenta (in contrast to B. parauchenoglanii and B. anthopenis, where both ventral and dorsal anchors have points of equal size). Furthermore, Bagrobdella vanhovei stands out from all previously documented species due to the unique morphology of its MCO, characterized by a sub-terminal opening (as illustrated in Fig. 5).
Description. The anatomical features of Bagrobdella are as follows: the total length measures 621 (ranging from 542.8 to 748.7), with a greatest width of 182.2 (ranging from 112.8 to 262.1) and a pharynx length of 63.8 (ranging from 42.3 to 79). The dorsal anchor dimensions are as follows: a = 70.6 (ranging from 66.7 to 77.3), b = 64.4 (ranging from 58.6 to 70.2), c = 0.7 (ranging from 0.0 to 4.9), d = 9.9 (ranging from 6.8 to 12.6), and e = 22.9 (ranging from 21.2 to 26.1). The dorsal bar measurements are x = 87.7 (ranging from 76.9 to 99.5), w = 13.5 (ranging from 9.5 to 18.3), with a posteriorly oriented median projection Y = 55.1 (ranging from 50.6 to 69.5). The ventral anchor is slightly drilled at the blade proximal extremity, with dimensions a = 63 (ranging from 60.7 to 67.1), b = 61.9 (ranging from 59.5 to 64.3), c = 6.0 (ranging from 3.6 to 8.1), d = 12.2 (ranging from 9.4 to 16.6), and e = 25.9 (ranging from 22.3 to 27.5). The ventral bar measures 92.3 (ranging from 77.5 to 103.2) in length, with a width of 13.7 (ranging from 11.1 to 17.9), extending in the form of an outgrowth with BL = 7.4 (ranging from 5.1 to 10.5) and Bl = 4.9 (ranging from 4.5 to 6.2). This bar features a posteriorly cross-chapped median projection with cx = 76.6 (ranging from 68.9 to 84.5) and cy = 25.3 (ranging from 20.8 to 31.4). All hook pairs are nearly uniform in size: I = 26.1 (ranging from 23 to 31.1), II = 16.9 (ranging from 13.9 to 19.4), III and IV = 22 (ranging from 18.9 to 26.7), and V up to VII = 18.8 (ranging from 17.7 to 21.5). The penis measures 66.1 (ranging from 58.1 to 71.0) in length, beginning with an asymmetrical bulb AL = 15.5 (ranging from 10.7 to 20) and Al = 9.3 (ranging from 5.2 to 12.1). It is characterized by a curved tube with a thick wall and constant diameter; in B. vanhovei, a portion of the wall extends to about 25% of the penis extremity, and unlike other species in this genus, no surrounding membrane has been observed around the penis.
Remarks. Bagrobdella vansteenbergei distinguishes itself from all previously described species by the size of its hooks, which are almost uniform in length (with pair I only slightly longer than the others), a characteristic not found in any other known species, including B. vanhovei sp. nov. Additionally, the trapezoidal piece, typically slightly sclerotised and difficult to observe, was not detected in the 17 individuals examined (15 Hoyer’s mounted and 2 preserved in ethanol), suggesting its potential absence in this species. The ventral anchors exhibit slight perforations, and the male copulating organ displays a distinctive morphology unique to Bagrobdella spp., characterized by a sub-terminal opening and the absence of a surrounding membrane.
Figure 10 displays the haptors of six species within the Bagrobdella genus, namely: 1. Bagrobdella vanhovei, 2. Bagrobdella vansteenbergei, 3. Bagrobdella auchenoglanii, 4. Bagrobdella fraudulenta, 5. Bagrobdella anthopenis, and 6. Bagrobdella parauchenoglanii (Akoumba et al., 2017; Euzet, Le Brun, 1990). The scale bar provided in the figure corresponds to 20 μm.
Our dataset comprised 68 individuals with 21 quantitative variables (Fig. 3). Within this group, three individuals were singled out as illustrative (#66 corresponding to B. auchenoglanii, #67 to B. fraudulenta, and #68 to B. anthopenis). The initial two dimensions of the PCA encapsulate 71.73% of the total dataset inertia. These individuals are categorized into three distinct groups aligning with the three species under scrutiny (Bagrobdella vanhovei, B. vansteenbergei, and Bagrobdella pauchenoglanii) (Fig. 12 & 13). Dimension 1 primarily segregates individuals from the B. vanhovei group (positioned to the right of the graph with positive axis coordinates) from those in the B. vansteenbergi and B. parauchenoglanii groups (from Cameroon), situated to the left of the graph with markedly negative axis coordinates.
Individuals belonging to the B. vanhovei group, characterized by a positive coordinate on the axis, exhibit a tendency to share certain traits or characteristics.
High values were observed for III_IV, Hd_d, Bd_w, I, Hv_b, Hd_a, Bv_x, Hv_a, Hv_d, and Hd_b, with the variables listed in descending order of strength.
Low values for Hv_e and Pe (variables are sorted from the weakest) indicate a significant decrease in the strength and effectiveness of the system under consideration. These metrics, when observed to be at the lower end of the spectrum, suggest a potential vulnerability or inefficiency within the system. It is crucial to address and rectify these low values to enhance the overall performance and robustness of the system. By focusing on improving Hv_e and Pe, the system can be fortified against potential risks and challenges, ensuring its optimal functionality and resilience in various operational scenarios.
Individuals belonging to B. parauchenoglanii, characterized by a negative coordinate on the axis, exhibit a tendency to share certain traits or characteristics.
High values were observed for the variables Pe, Hv_c, Hd_c, and Bv_w, with these variables arranged in descending order of strength.
Low values were observed for the variables Hd_b, Bd_.x, Bv_x, cx, Hv_a, Hd_a, Hv_b, Hd_e, III_IV, and Hd_d, with the variables arranged in ascending order of strength.
Within the group of Bagrobdella vansteenbergei, characterized by a negative coordinate on the axis, individuals exhibit a shared set of traits and behaviors.
High values for the variables Hv_e and Hd_e (variables are listed in descending order of strength).
Low values were observed for the variables V_à_VII, Hd_c, Hv_c, I, Bd_w, Hd_d, Hv_d, Bv_w, and III_IV, with the variables listed in descending order of strength.
The second dimension contrasts individuals of B. parauchenoglanii (located at the top of the graph with a distinctly positive coordinate on the axis) with individuals of Bagrobdella vansteenbergei.
In the graph, Bagrobdella auchenoglanii (#66) and B. anthopenis (#68) are distinct from the other species, with B. fraudulenta (#67) being grouped with B. parauchenoglanii. However, these two latter species are easily distinguishable, at least based on their penis morphology as shown in Figure 11.
Among the 11 host specimens examined, the individual caught at the Mouth of Mutambala River stood out as the most heavily parasitized, harboring a total of 286 Monogeneans, comprising 269 Bagrobdella vanhovei and 17 B. vansteenbergei. In contrast, the remaining ten individuals captured near the Orthodox Church of Uvira exclusively hosted Bagrobdella vanhovei. Within this group, four individuals showed no presence of monogeneans, three had one individual each, while the remaining three hosts exhibited varying numbers of parasites, with counts of five, six, and 35 individuals respectively. This uneven distribution of parasites among host populations is a common phenomenon, as highlighted in previous studies such as Dold and Holland (2011). Recent observations in species like Brachyplatystoma vaillantii Valenciennes, 1840 (Siluriformes, Pimelodidae) in the Amazon by Brito-Junior and Tavares-Dias (2021) further support this pattern.
There may be a correlation between water quality and helminth infections, as evidenced in Cyprinid fish (Zargar et al., 2012). The overdispersion of Bagrobdella vanhovei and the absence of B. vansteenbergei in the other six host individuals captured near the Orthodox Church of Uvira could potentially be attributed to differing water qualities at these two sampling sites. This suggests that Bagrobdella vansteenbergei might be better suited to the conditions present at the Mouth of Mutambala River, while Bagrobdella vanhovei could exhibit greater resilience to fluctuations in abiotic conditions.
Bagrobdella vanhovei and B. vansteenbergei are newly discovered species endemic to Lake Tanganyika. However, the four previously identified species of Bagrobdella have been documented in various locations: B. auchenoglanii was initially described in Ghana, with a subsequent redescription based on specimens collected in Mali and Togo. B. anthopenis was identified in Mali, B. fraudulenta in Uganda and Mali (refer to Euzet and Le Brun 1990), and more recently, B. parauchenoglani was found in Cameroon (Akoumba et al. 2017).
With the exception of Auchenoglanis occidentalis individuals sampled by Euzet and Le Brun in Bamako (Niger River), which host three species of Bagrobdella (B. auchenoglanii, B. fraudulenta, and B. anthopenis), it appears that in various other locations such as Lake Albert, Uganda (Paperna 1971); Kara River, Togo (Kritsky & Kulo 1999); Oti River (Euzet & Le Brun 1990) and Volta Lake (Paperna 1969) in the Volta Basin; Sassandra in RCI (Euzet & Le Brun 1990), and on Parauchenoglanis monkei in Cameroon (Akoumba et al. 2017), only one species is typically found (B. fraudulenta in Uganda, B. parauchenoglanii in Cameroon, B. auchenoglanii in the other locations).
Among the five Bagrobdella species described from A. occidentalis, three are found in the watershed of the Nilo-Sudanian province, while the other two are from the Tanganyika province. This suggests that these monogenean species may be specific to their respective ichthyofaunal provinces, or it could indicate the presence of two different host species. The systematic status of A. occidentalis remains debated, as discussed by Geerinckx & Vreven (2013).
Bagrobdella vanhovei exhibits significant variability in its morphometric characteristics (Fig. 12), displaying small, medium, and large measurements for similar hard parts. This variation, observed within specimens of the same species, could be attributed to two potential factors: 1) the presence of distinct species, or 2) variations in the medium used to prepare the slides (refer to Fankoua et al., 2017). Notably, despite the range in sizes, no discernible morphological distinctions were observed between the "large" and "small" specimens, as both were present on the same slides within the same medium. Consequently, it is likely that this species demonstrates considerable variability in the size of its haptoral hard parts.
During the examination of these two novel species, previously unreported small hard components in the description of Bagrobdella species were identified. These include: 1) a button-shaped structure located between the bar and ventral anchors (Fig. 14), and 2) a semi-circular structure situated at the tip of the ventral bar median projection (Fig. 15). To accurately characterize their intricate morphology and purpose, it is imperative to examine fresh specimens or utilize scanning electron microscopy. Consequently, these structures were not included in the description of the two newfound species.
