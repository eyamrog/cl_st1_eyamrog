The initial documented case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Brazil and Latin America was officially recorded on February 26, 2020, in São Paulo. The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has exerted unparalleled pressure on healthcare systems globally. Asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a significant reservoir for potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly posing a risk to immunocompromised Oncology patients. Implementing screening protocols for these HCWs could prove instrumental in curtailing transmission and effectively isolating only those individuals necessitating such measures.
At Centro de Terapia Oncológica (CTO), an oncology clinic in Petrópolis, RJ, Brazil, all healthcare workers (HCWs) underwent screening for SARS-CoV-2 to identify and isolate individuals who were either asymptomatic or symptomatic but tested positive for the virus. The screening process involved the use of IgM/IgG rapid tests. Additionally, HCWs displaying symptoms were subjected to nasopharyngeal swabs for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in conjunction with IgM/IgG reactivity assessments.
Out of the 60 employees who were tested, 4 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were subsequently isolated. This approach could prove beneficial for healthcare facilities in identifying asymptomatic healthcare workers and safeguarding the health of both employees and patients. By potentially lowering the risk of transmission and preventing staffing shortages during this critical period, this method holds promise for maintaining a safe and efficient healthcare environment.
Testing, diagnosing, and isolating are crucial components in controlling the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its clinical manifestations, known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19), as emphasized by the World Health Organization. It is essential to recognize that asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) represent an underestimated yet significant potential source of infection and therefore warrant thorough testing.
Currently, Brazil has reported 85,380 confirmed cases and 5,901 deaths as of April 30, 2020. However, it is important to note that underreporting and limited testing, attributed to social distancing measures and a shortage of testing kits, may be compromising the accuracy of these figures, suggesting that the published statistics may not accurately reflect the true situation in Brazil. In parallel, the state of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) has recorded 9,453 confirmed cases and 854 deaths as of April 30, 2020.
The Centro de Terapia Oncológica (CTO) is an oncology clinic located in Petrópolis, in the countryside of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The clinic administers approximately 565 chemotherapy infusions monthly, excluding hormone therapy treatments. Between January and the end of March 2020, the oncology center conducted approximately 7,291 outpatient consultations.
There is existing data indicating that patients with cancer who have undergone chemotherapy may face a higher risk of severe influenza complications, but the implications for COVID-19 remain uncertain. A recent study highlighted a rise in COVID-19 incidence and severity among cancer patients, although these findings have been contested by other researchers. Initial findings from Zhang et al revealed a notable mortality rate of 29% among hospitalized COVID-19 patients previously diagnosed with cancer.
As asymptomatic transmission has been extensively documented in previous studies18-22, this discussion seeks to emphasize the importance of conducting mass testing for both symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs). This approach is crucial to prevent the need for extensive workforce quarantines, minimize the spread of the virus in asymptomatic or mild cases, and safeguard the health of both HCWs and patients.
Between the 9th and 29th of April 2020, a total of 60 healthcare workers (HCWs) from CTO underwent COVID-19 testing, encompassing the entire workforce at the clinic. The testing methodology employed involved IgM/IgG rapid testing using near-patient lateral flow devices for all HCWs. In cases where HCWs exhibited symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat, nasopharyngeal swabs and real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were utilized as a supplementary investigative approach.
The test results yielded two primary outcomes: firstly, individuals who tested positive for asymptomatic and/or symptomatic IgM or positive RT-PCR were promptly quarantined for a period of 14 days. Secondly, healthcare workers (HCW) who tested negative for serology and exhibited no symptoms were advised to uphold protective measures and utilize personal protective equipment (PPE). Lastly, HCW with indeterminate IgM results underwent re-testing after one week under the supervision and guidance of an infectious diseases physician.
In total, all 60 employees underwent testing, with a total of 61 IgM/IgG tests conducted (accounting for the one healthcare worker who required re-testing), along with 1 nasopharyngeal swab for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, bringing the total number of tests to 62. The testing outline is depicted in Flowchart 1.
On April 28, 2020, a total of 4 healthcare workers (HCWs) tested positive out of 62 tests conducted. Following their positive results, all four individuals were promptly placed in quarantine for a period of 14 days. This group of infected HCWs accounts for nearly 7% of the total workforce within the service, representing 4 out of 60 HCWs. Among the positive cases, 2 were female individuals aged 60 years or older, while the remaining 2 were male individuals aged between 30 and 42 years. Interestingly, 3 out of the 4 HCWs were asymptomatic, showing no visible signs of the disease, while only 1 individual exhibited symptoms associated with the illness.
Among the three asymptomatic healthcare workers, two tested positive for IgM but negative for IgG, while one tested positive for both IgM and IgG. One individual required re-testing after a week due to an indeterminate result, ultimately testing positive for IgM and negative for IgG. The sole confirmed symptomatic case tested negative for both IgM and IgG but positive for RT-PCR.
All healthcare workers (HCWs) tested in this study exhibited positive results for IgG antibodies, with none showing solely IgG positivity.
The results are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
It is crucial to consider the implications of testing healthcare workers (HCWs) within a particular service. In this instance, identifying three asymptomatic and one symptomatic worker provided the service with the chance to appropriately isolate individuals who could potentially endanger themselves and patients, particularly considering the immunosuppressed nature of the patients who typically visit the CTO.
Moreover, the widespread availability of antibody testing and universal testing of healthcare workers (HCWs) could significantly impact the healthcare setting. Firstly, it can decrease in-hospital transmission rates. Secondly, it can mitigate the risk of asymptomatic transmission during periods of social distancing. Thirdly, it can enhance the well-being of HCWs by promptly identifying and isolating infected colleagues. Additionally, it allows for the isolation of individuals who need it, preventing staffing shortages caused by self-isolation or widespread HCW contamination.
Regrettably, widespread testing remains an elusive goal for the majority of healthcare services in Brazil, particularly within the public health sector, primarily as a result of financial constraints.
Finally, telemedicine emerges as a prudent choice for healthcare services, especially within the field of Oncology, as it mitigates disease transmission, lowers potential expenses associated with patient care, and enables the continuation of nearly normal service operations.
As of April 30, 2020, no oncological patient with chronic total occlusion (CTO) had been officially diagnosed with COVID-19. The mass testing of healthcare workers (HCWs) may have played a role in reducing asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and ensuring the continued health of patients receiving services.
