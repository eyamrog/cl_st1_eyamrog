Amid the pressing need to address numerous and severe health issues, the question of what constitutes health and who is entitled to it may initially appear trivial. However, certain responses can shed light on prevailing practices that serve to deflect attention from fundamental issues, thereby perpetuating privileges and exacerbating health inequities. The concept of One Health of Peripheries emerges from these inquiries and encompasses three interconnected dimensions. The first dimension pertains to the attributes that influence the well-being and suffering of peripheral multispecies collectives, encompassing a state, a process, and the realization of capacities. The second dimension challenges the marginalizing mechanisms that delineate health and determine who is eligible to access it. The third dimension encompasses the practices within social spaces that extend beyond the human realm, where One Health is both experienced and reshaped. The term "one" in One Health does not signify a lack of diversity or a mere combination of health components (human + animal + environmental), but rather denotes the intricate nature of health within peripheral contexts, where privileges are conferred upon those within while legitimizing the exploitation of those on the outside. The interplay among these margins gives rise to varying degrees of privilege and vulnerability, shaping epidemiological profiles and highlighting diverse peripheral strengths and needs that underpin collective efforts to dismantle these boundaries. While the concept of social determination, central to the Latin American collective health movement, informs these profiles, it tends to overlook the more-than-human aspect of social determination, thus rendering One Health of Peripheries a blind spot within collective health discourse. Mapping out the landscape of One Health of Peripheries necessitates tailored approaches to participation, research, and inclusive policies aimed at decolonizing the promotion of healthy lifestyles.
The definition of health, the individuals who can achieve it, and the most critical health concerns are topics that have been influenced by power struggles, cooperation, and imposition to construct and validate hierarchies that serve the interests of the most privileged positions. Existing perspectives on the social determination of health and the social determinants of health have shed light on social hierarchies, offering insights and tools to combat specific health disparities. However, this paper contends that these frameworks simultaneously overlook and perpetuate certain marginalizing mechanisms that result in health inequities beyond human populations. Drawing on the works of Foucault and Agamben, an apparatus is defined as a system of relationships between discursive practices, institutions, and entities capable of governing, controlling, shaping, or managing living beings. Marginalizing apparatuses, in this context, establish boundaries and justify the exploitation and violence against beings on the other side of these boundaries, assigning them less value and suppressing their resistance and autonomy. Peripheries exist outside these boundaries, with patriarchal margins creating gender peripheries and species margins leading to species peripheries, alongside racial, ethnic, and geographical margins, among others.
The field of collective health in Latin America has shown a concern for certain peripheries, yet it consistently perpetuates systems that marginalize nonhuman animals, hereafter referred to as animals. Within collective health, animals are viewed as having instrumental value in preventing and controlling specific human health issues. However, they are not considered as carriers of health or explicitly included in the conceptual frameworks regarding the social determinants of health. While this marginalization is not unique to collective health and is present in various health perspectives, my critique will specifically target the collective health field due to its significant influence on the One Health of Peripheries.
Is the marginalization of animals from the field of collective health justified? This study argues that it is not. The Bourdieusian approach supporting this field and critical analysis of social hierarchies, along with other perspectives, highlight the more-than-human dimension of social entanglements. Additionally, addressing concerns about health inequities could be enhanced by considering theories of multispecies justice. Furthermore, labor perspectives on health, as discussed by Almeida-Filho in relation to Laurell's works, could benefit from incorporating more-than-human labor theories.
Health is a concept that extends beyond the human realm, as evidenced by the extensive body of One Health research that explores the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health (16). The One Health approach has garnered support from various sectors and international bodies due to its relevance in addressing pressing issues like pandemics, bioterrorism, food-borne illnesses, and emerging health challenges such as antimicrobial resistance (16,17). Despite its merits, One Health frameworks often overlook the role of social processes in both empirical investigations and theoretical frameworks. These approaches tend to promote intersectoral collaboration as a form of equitable negotiation between institutions, sometimes inadvertently perpetuating a narrative of global North dominance over the global South (18).
The concept of biologism within the framework of One Health presents notable exceptions (19â€“25). In this study, I introduce a novel perspective termed One Health of Peripheries. This reimagining of One Health is informed by Latin American collective health principles, more-than-human biopolitics, and critical theoretical frameworks. Consequently, this approach confronts inherent contradictions and elements that defy easy comparison. Nevertheless, it is imperative that we confront these complexities rather than attempting to impose simplistic solutions derived from idealized contexts onto the intricate web of real-world dynamics characterized by power differentials and inherent contradictions, rather than a harmonious network of rational agents.
The epistemologies of the South present alternatives like the ecology of knowledge and hybrid cultures to contemplate complexity, contradiction, plural knowledge, and intercultural translation. However, my aim is not to make significant strides in epistemic translation. Rather, this paper focuses on introducing conceptual tools that aid in recognizing peripheries and challenging boundaries. This serves as a foundation for introducing One Health of Peripheries, emphasizing its social determinants, and expressing a clear dedication to promoting structural alternatives for multispecies justice.
In a subsequent publication, we delve further into the ecology of knowledge, the decolonial perspective inherent in One Health of Peripheries, and outline seven specific actions aimed at enhancing the well-being of marginalized multispecies communities (18).
The subsequent sections of the paper delineate the emerging domain of One Health of Peripheries, necessitating novel practices, policies, and the incorporation of existing actions from other contexts. While acknowledging its significance, the aim here is not to delve into specific procedures for health practices or offer concrete recommendations for health policies. The more-than-human biopolitics segment identifies marginalizing mechanisms within a broader biopolitical landscape, discussing the roles of domestication and animalization in shaping hierarchies that influence epidemiological profiles. It also explores the convergence of margins and potential avenues for resistance. The One Health segment reimagines One Health and provides an initial mapping of its peripheral realms. The social determination of health section briefly contrasts the concepts of social determination of health and social determinants of health. Building upon this comparison and the preceding sections, I expand on the notion of triple health inequity to encompass other forms of disparities and their interplay, with a specific focus on species-based inequities. The praxis field section draws on Bourdieu's habitus and field concepts and Freire's praxis understanding, framing One Health of Peripheries as a blind spot in collective health. Lastly, I offer some concluding remarks.
Biopolitics delves into novel forms of power previously unexplored, encompassing a wide array of phenomena such as concentration camps, migratory processes, cognitive capitalism, domestication, sovereignty, the immunitary paradigm of modern politics, human interactions with animals and technology, the state of exception, and power/knowledge dynamics. This diversity introduces ambivalence and contradiction, along with both negative (marginalizing, excluding, repressing) and positive (affirmative, productive, empowering) perspectives. Biopolitics reveals the blurring of the public/private divide, the governance of life and politics surrounding it, the management of populations, the creation of compliant and profitable bodies, and the apparatuses that perpetuate hierarchies.
It is pertinent to revisit the concept of apparatus as the intricate network of connections between discursive practices, institutions, and entities capable of influencing, controlling, shaping, or managing living organisms. This concept is intertwined with the authorities of demarcation, encompassing philosophical, religious, scientific, and legal realms, which delineate and endorse boundaries while validating associated practices. As elucidated by Derrida, the foundational act of marginalization is pivotal in the socialization of human culture and politics, relegating animals to the periphery and facilitating their domestication. This process engenders disciplinary and oppressive systems, along with population management technologies aimed at regulating life. Consequently, it evolves into a paradigm of exploitation, laying the groundwork for hierarchical structures.
Animal domestication necessitated the implementation of demographic technologies to regulate population densities, a combination of enforcement measures and behavioral strategies to manage animal resistance, and caregiving protocols to ensure their well-being. These interactions gave rise to intricate more-than-human social dynamics, creating a network of mutual influence. The utilization of demographic technologies for animals mirrored human demographic trends, facilitating growth and specialization. The surplus of food prompted the development of storage specialists, resulting in a cycle of increased food surplus and time availability, enabling the rise of population administrators, accumulation experts, and bureaucrats. It is important to note that this complex array of tactics was not solely directed towards animals.
The expansion in size and intricacy of multispecies settlements served as the foundation for heightened social stratification, uneven allocation of resources, and colonization (42,43). This progression was underpinned by the conflict with animals (44), the domestication of human communities, and the development of accumulation technologies.
Domestication has also played a significant role in shaping another crucial aspect of more-than-human health. The increased densities of multiple species within domesticated environments have created a conducive setting for the emergence of zoonotic diseases and epidemics. Therefore, domestication can be viewed as a historical precursor to epidemics, which have the potential to escalate into pandemics, particularly when coupled with processes of colonization.
The biopolitics of domestication is an ongoing historical phenomenon rather than a distant past occurrence. Medical texts aimed at 19th-century landowners detailed methods for breeding slaves to enhance their productivity, mirroring contemporary livestock production practices. These included strategies such as segregating populations based on productivity and reproductive criteria, monitoring and categorizing morbidity and mortality rates, disease prevention, genetic selection for improved traits, as well as implementing hygiene, nutrition, and socialization practices to minimize biological capital losses. Notably, scholars like Smithers and Camacho have extensively analyzed these practices. Moving into the 20th century, figures like the anti-Semitic Henry Ford referenced the disassembly line of a Chicago slaughterhouse in his autobiography, which later influenced his development of the assembly-line method and subsequently informed the assembly lines used in the mass killings of Jews during the Nazi regime. In the contemporary era, advancements in big data and artificial intelligence have propelled genetic and molecular interventions and disease surveillance practices across various species, thereby complicating biopolitical dynamics and eroding traditional distinctions between natural and artificial, human and nonhuman, as well as public and private realms.
Marginalizing apparatuses are activated within the realm of biopolitics, where they perpetuate suffering and establish privileges. These mechanisms are integral to various forms of marginalization based on species, race, ethnicity, class, gender, ability, and geography. Moreover, the interplay between these marginalizing apparatuses gives rise to numerous peripheral spaces.
Animalization is a mechanism of marginalization that has been historically applied to certain human groups. An illustrative example dates back to 1920 when the Wildlife Conservation Society, the same institution that later introduced the One Health concept, exhibited Ota Benga, a young black man, at the Bronx Zoo. Pugliese offers a "deanthropocentric" interpretation of Foucault's Madness and Civilization, suggesting that the absence of rationality was used to justify the animalization of individuals deemed "mad," leading to their confinement and physical constraints. In addition to these well-known instances of animalization, subtler practices contribute to the marginalization of certain human populations in everyday contexts. Furthermore, animalization extends beyond humans to animals themselves, creating a class of beings exploited for human gain.
It is important to acknowledge that animalization does not always diminish animals. At times, characteristics typically associated with animals, such as affection, power, and agility, are glorified and ascribed to humans, while traits considered "human," like criminality, terrorism, or poverty, are used to rationalize violence against specific human populations. Animalization is inherently paradoxical as it hinges on the perception of who is already deemed an animal, regardless of their species. Additionally, it is crucial to recognize that animalization is not a factor in every instance of marginalization experienced by humans.
The interplay of marginalizing mechanisms extends beyond mere animalization, encompassing a broader spectrum of dynamics. Within multispecies households, social class plays a pivotal role in shaping the distribution of material resources. The prospects available to both humans and animals, particularly farm animals, are significantly influenced by factors such as disability and gender. Gender, in particular, is closely linked to advocacy efforts for animal welfare. The operations of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations not only exploit animals but also rely on marginalized ethnic groups to undertake hazardous tasks (50). The racial marginalization experienced by certain human communities has a direct impact on the interconnectedness of multispecies collectives in which these individuals are involved.
The examples provided above illustrate that certain margins intersect exclusively in humans, some intersect in both humans and animals, and others serve to segregate multispecies collectives. Margins related to race, gender, class, and ethnicity are based on human attributes and consequently impact multispecies collectives. On the other hand, margins concerning species, sex, and disability encompass both human and animal subjects. Additionally, geographic margins play a role in segregating multispecies collectives.
The examples provided are oversimplified representations of intricate intersections. A Black non-heteronormative woman residing in a favela, who is dedicated to animal protection, grapples with the challenges posed by various marginalized identities that hinder her ability to adequately care for her animals. Deteriorating animal health and inadequate reproductive control amplify the psychological and financial strains she faces, while the transmission of zoonotic diseases and the issue of animal overpopulation further compound the burdens on the community. Additionally, a significant portion of favela residents were once small-scale farmers displaced by the mechanisms of agribusiness, which simultaneously have detrimental impacts on traditional communities, wildlife, as well as exploited farm animals and laborers.
The concept of intersecting margins is not a novel one, as it lies at the heart of intersectionality, a framework that originated to address the legal constraints hindering the rectification of injustices faced by Black women. According to intersectionality, the marginalization of Black women cannot simply be understood as the combined effects of sexism and racism; rather, it posits that gender discrimination is not uniformly experienced by Black and White women, just as racial bias varies between Black men and women. Over time, intersectionality has undergone a transformation within scholarly and activist circles, leading to a blend of heightened awareness, ambiguity, excessive usage, and more profound elucidations. The complexity of intersectional issues has expanded due to the diverse array of marginal experiences that exist.
The intersection of peripheries generates unique encounters with marginalization and resistance, even in the absence of direct attributes of marginalization within the same individual, as illustrated in the examples above. Additionally, these various peripheries intersect, presenting an intriguing opportunity: by acknowledging the strengths and needs of each periphery, a collective resistance can be fostered, not to simply invert hierarchies but to dismantle margins altogether. Consequently, marginalized multispecies collectives have the potential to enhance intersectionality and derive advantages from it, albeit contingent on effective articulation, a task that is far from straightforward.
In the preceding discussion, reference was made to accumulation experts and accumulation technologies. Subsequently, the instances of multispecies intersectionality served to implicitly illustrate that capitalism functions as a collective marginalizing mechanism, thereby becoming a focal point for intersectional resistance. The biopolitical management of animal populations laid the groundwork for human biopolitics, colonization, and the rise of capitalism. These systems, in turn, not only bolstered and refined animal biopolitics but also gave rise to additional marginalizing mechanisms. Consequently, the situation is far from being a one-way process. A intricate web of power dynamics continually shifts boundaries in various directions, rendering individual and collective experiences of marginalization inherently dynamic.
Marginalizing apparatuses operate through the mobilization of exploitation, care, administration, discipline, subjectification, resistance, affects, and legitimization. These mechanisms are instrumental in the creation and perpetuation of peripheries that play a significant role in shaping the health experiences of multispecies collectives.
The concept of One Health traditionally denotes the interconnectedness between human, animal, and environmental health, a notion gaining traction and practical application in light of the heightened awareness surrounding numerous human diseases originating from animals and the persistent zoonotic diseases, ranging from AIDS and dengue to COVID-19, visceral leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, and influenza A. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports that 60% of human infectious diseases are zoonotic, 75% of emerging human infectious diseases stem from other animal species, and 80% of potential bioterrorist agents are zoonotic. Neglected tropical diseases, predominantly zoonotic or vector-borne, impact over a billion individuals and a substantial number of animals, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) Assembly 66.12 in 2013 to prioritize One Health strategies for member States to combat their unchecked proliferation. Given the escalating global apprehension regarding emerging and re-emerging zoonoses and antimicrobial resistance due to the excessive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in human and animal populations, the collaboration between the WHO, OIE, and FAO was catalyzed by One Health. Recently, One Health methodologies have been integrated into the overarching and specific objectives of the European Union Programme for the Unionâ€™s action in the field of health ('EU4Health Programme') for the period 2021-2027.
One Health is commonly depicted as three partially intersecting sets, namely human, animal, and environment. While humans and animals are encompassed within the environment, a portion of both the human and animal sets lies outside of it. Moreover, the partial overlap between the human and animal domains contradicts evolutionary theory, considering humans are classified as animals. Although representations may highlight various aspects, there is no necessity to exclude parts of the sets from the intersection. Subsumption is utilized to illustrate the relationships, aligning with the inclusivity essential for advancing the concept of One Health of Peripheries.
The concept of One Health of Peripheries does not rigidly segregate animal taxonomy into distinct categories of humans on one side and a diverse array of other species on the opposite side (see Figure 1). Rather, it acknowledges the existence of multispecies collectives whose composition is contingent upon the specific health issue under consideration. The conventional dichotomy of animal taxonomy into "human" versus "animal" is recognized as a useful tool with didactic and strategic merits, serving as a form of semantic shorthand. However, uncritically adhering to this division risks conflating it with a presumed natural order and obscuring its biopolitical implications. The environment is not viewed as a separate realm tangentially related to or partially overlapping with human and animal spheres; rather, it is comprised of multispecies collectives and various other agents. The application of actor-network theory can aid in conceptualizing the environment as a network of relationships and agents, intertwined in complex ways. These agents, even when considered as "individuals," harbor internal microbiota environments and form intricate assemblages of holobionts. This perspective envisions an environment devoid of the binary ontology that traditionally separates "human society" from "nature."
Numerous holistic approaches exist to enhance the health of the environment, drawing on the wisdom of indigenous communities who have historically demonstrated an integrated and sustainable relationship with their surroundings. Agroecology, for instance, has assimilated traditional knowledge while integrating modern technologies to prioritize equity (62,63). Initiatives such as living cities and recombinant ecosystems, along with other sustainable urban movements, present viable alternatives for urban centers (64â€“66). Nevertheless, the prevailing colonial and capitalist mindset continues to deplete resources and undermine collective efforts focused on well-being rather than profit. Therefore, dismantling these marginalizing structures is imperative, both in this context and beyond.
The disparity between conventional One Health and One Health of Peripheries extends beyond just conceptual frameworks. One Health of Peripheries is a multifaceted term with ontological, epistemological, and practical implications. The ontological aspect pertains to the factors influencing the welfare and distress of peripheral multispecies communities, encompassing states, processes, and the actualization of capabilities (notably, capacity plays a pivotal role in health promotion). The epistemological dimension delves into the mechanisms of marginalization that shape health outcomes. The practical sense involves actions taken to combat marginalization, promoting peripheral resistance and drawing insights from it.
These three senses are interconnected; each one is intrinsic to the others. Understanding and practice are integral to multispecies collectives, with attributes and understandings being shaped and transformed through practice. At the same time, understanding lends meaning to attributes and practices. This polysemy carries material implications, as the conceptualization of new attributes prompts the adoption of different practices aimed at enhancing the well-being of marginalized multispecies collectives.
The focus on marginalizing apparatuses inherently gives rise to the presence of a diverse peripheral cartography. Therefore, the subsequent section provides a delineation of peripheral regions that do not encompass the entirety of the cartography. Selecting certain peripheries over others poses a challenge; it has the potential to perpetuate marginalization. While it is impossible to address everything concurrently, it is crucial to critically examine the implications of prioritization. My choices are somewhat subjective and influenced by my background. Nonetheless, I aim for these choices to offer insights into ways to recognize and disrupt even the margins that I may have overlooked.
Renowned institutions highlighting neglected diseases shed light on the pharmaceutical industry's tendency to overlook the healthcare needs of unprofitable populations. However, emphasizing specific diseases may shift focus away from a crucial aspect of neglect. While many travelers possess knowledge about optimal travel periods to evade malaria, access to preventive medications, and health insurance for top-tier treatment in case of infection, the persistence of rabies-related fatalities remains alarming. Despite the availability of rabies vaccines for decades, an estimated 60 thousand individuals succumb to the disease annually, predominantly in regions of the global South. This underscores the complexity of neglect, revealing that not all individuals afflicted with neglected diseases are truly neglected. The issue at hand extends beyond the mere existence of pharmaceutical treatments.
The core issue lies in the oversight of multispecies collectives, necessitating a shift beyond mere outreach policies. Individuals representing these collectives require meaningful political inclusion, comprehensive education to address their challenges and foster community development, as well as initiatives promoting food security and sovereignty. Additionally, the multispecies collectives themselves necessitate holistic health systems that encompass non-human entities, along with participatory conservation programs to ensure their well-being and preservation.
Violence, a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality, necessitates multifaceted approaches for mitigation, one of which involves preventing violence against animals. The prevalence of companion animals in households is on the rise, with some countries reporting more dogs and cats than children residing in homes. Within these multispecies households, animals become integrated into family dynamics and unfortunately can fall victim to domestic violence. The abuse inflicted upon animals is intricately linked to violence against both children and women. Furthermore, animals are not only victims themselves but are also utilized as tools of coercion by perpetrators to inflict further suffering and maintain control over their human victims.
Domestic violence is not solely rooted in individual psychological factors but is also influenced by lifestyles shaped by social reproduction processes, which can either promote or mitigate domestic violence based on their specific configurations. Hence, it is crucial to examine the interplay between social vulnerability, interpersonal violence, and violence directed towards companion animals (79â€“83).
The examination of violence against animals serves to uncover instances of domestic violence with multiple victims and enhances comprehension of the psychological characteristics of the perpetrators. Additionally, animals play a role in fostering communal and individual care as a means to combat violence. Nevertheless, the successful prevention of domestic violence necessitates addressing social vulnerability and its societal roots comprehensively, beyond just economic impoverishment, and delving into the underlying mechanisms of marginalization. It is imperative to dismantle the patriarchal structures that underpin domestic violence. Domestic violence within the context of One Health in marginalized areas is socially influenced, impacting both humans and animals, and possesses institutionalized facets.
Geographic peripheries exhibit a diverse range, including countries, regions within countries, and cross-border areas like rural zones, indigenous territories, and favelas. Focusing on favelas as an illustration, we observe how geographical marginalization shapes epidemiological patterns. The term "favela" carries negative implications that euphemisms fail to mitigate, directly alluding to the localized vulnerability stemming from historical economic exploitation and wealth concentration. Its multifaceted nature underscores ongoing reinterpretation and reconstruction from within; serving as a locus for resistance, innovation, and empathy that give rise to alternative epistemologies and ways of life.
The favelas present a challenge to traditional census methods, leading to their distinct treatment, beginning with their identification. For example, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) characterizes favelas as areas with a minimum of 51 housing units irregularly occupied, facing urban irregularities, or lacking essential public services, labeling them as subnormal agglomerates. While census definitions offer a limited perspective, they provide a sense of scale, revealing that in 2010, there were 6329 favelas housing 6% of Brazil's population. SÃ£o Paulo State exhibited the highest concentration of favela households at 23.2%, encompassing around 11% of its metropolitan population. Consequently, health issues prevalent in favelas impact millions of individuals nationwide. Looking ahead, global estimates indicate that by 2030, the world's population will reach 8.1 billion, with 5 billion (61.7%) residing in urban areas and 2 billion (24.7%) living in favelas.
The worldwide neglect of favelas persists, with their unique health challenges setting them apart from urban and impoverished areas. It is crucial to recognize that not all favela residents are impoverished, and not all urban poor reside in favelas. The contextual impact of favelas on health is shaped by imposed risks and a scarcity of resources such as money, time, infrastructure, and knowledge. This creates a detrimental cycle of vulnerability, as the heightened disease burden hampers individuals' chances for economic and social integration.
The impact of favelas on multispecies collectives is often overlooked, particularly in terms of animals who are exposed to various environmental stressors such as pollution, humidity, darkness, inadequate ventilation, malnutrition, and high population densities. It is crucial to prioritize animal health not only for the well-being of the animals themselves but also for the humans coexisting with them. Animals have shorter life cycles compared to humans, making monitoring essential for early detection of chronic diseases and health issues stemming from exposure to unhealthy surroundings. Given that the effects of favelas extend beyond their boundaries, improving animal health within these communities has broader implications. While favelas may be on the periphery, they are not isolated, and enhancing their health can have positive ripple effects. Transforming favelas into healthier environments can help reduce infectious diseases, decrease reliance on antibiotics, and combat antimicrobial resistance, a significant global health concern identified by the WHO. However, achieving this transformation necessitates structural changes and the dismantling of marginalizing systems that perpetuate inequality.
"Homelessness" typically denotes the state of individuals lacking a permanent residence, a fluid circumstance that may range from a transient experience to a lifelong condition, contingent upon the accessibility of social and economic resources facilitating the acquisition of stable housing.
Homelessness is a structural issue rooted in the social organization centered on private property, exacerbated by unstable working conditions and welfare policies. Additionally, it can stem from various other factors, including individuals fleeing homes to escape domestic violence or living environments unsuitable for managing drug addiction, mental health disorders, and other related conditions.
Companion animals, like humans, can become homeless either through abandonment or by getting lost. Some may be born into homelessness, remaining in that state until rescued or for the duration of their lives. Dogs and cats are considered property, which means that their homelessness also poses a private property issue. The legal repercussions of abandoning an animal property may not always serve as a strong enough deterrent to prevent abandonment. Furthermore, the property status of these animals could potentially diminish or even absolve individuals of their moral responsibility when it comes to abandoning them.
While the pathways to homelessness for humans and companion animals may differ, there are shared consequences that transcend species boundaries. Both homeless individuals and their animal companions experience abuse and face various adversities such as climatic, nutritional, and emotional challenges. These adversities not only lead to suffering but also compromise the immune system, exacerbating the lack of hygiene practices that can predispose individuals to infectious diseases. Furthermore, the lack of access to health services further compounds these health risks for both humans and their animal companions experiencing homelessness.
In their marginalized state, homeless individuals and dogs form emotional connections with each other (91,92). Humans demonstrate a preference for sharing their food with dogs over other humans (93) and may choose to stay on the streets rather than seek shelter in locations that do not accommodate their canine companions (94). Taylor, referencing Sakelaropoulos et al. (95), discusses the emotional attachments that humans form with cats and even rats (92). These synanthropic species, including rats, inhabit public areas and present unique challenges that contribute to the health complexities of multispecies communities living on the streets.
Direct interventions targeting homeless multispecies collectives could encompass the establishment of shelter networks and adoption programs, primarily focusing on children in the case of adoption, alongside initiatives for companion animals. Additionally, contraceptive measures and "humanitarian" elimination programs for synanthropic populations could be implemented. These actions serve as complements rather than substitutes for structural strategies aimed at health promotion and disease risk mitigation. Irrespective of their species, individuals experiencing homelessness are integral members of the living cities framework as conceptualized in critical geography. Within the urban context, One Health pertains to the well-being of these living cities, emphasizing the necessity for tailored considerations regarding homelessness. This involves advocating for lifestyles that prevent individuals and companion animals from becoming homeless, as well as urban planning strategies that foster biodiversity, including the development of recombinant ecosystems and green cities.
Ending hunger stands as a pivotal objective within the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (96). In response to this imperative, agribusiness has significantly ramped up production, leading to reduced food prices, increased job opportunities, and a notable contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Nevertheless, a comprehensive evaluation of this response necessitates a thorough consideration of externalities. While certain externalities have garnered attention and recognition, there are still peripheral aspects that demand closer scrutiny.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has confidently concluded that climate change is anticipated to result in heightened levels of ill-health in numerous regions, particularly in developing countries with low incomes, when compared to a scenario devoid of climate change (97). Greenhouse gases (GHG) stand out as the primary driver of climate change (98), with farm animals emerging as the largest contributor within the realm of agriculture (99). Additionally, single-crop farming represents another significant source of GHG emissions. The expansion of this practice frequently results in increased emissions due to the intensified production of farm animals to offset the loss of pastures (100).
The expansion of agricultural frontiers has been shown to decrease biodiversity and heighten the likelihood of zoonotic diseases (101). Despite this, current proposals for zoonotic disease control tend to be primarily biomedical in nature, focusing on immediate risk factors without challenging the existing status quo of food production systems. This approach often overlooks the potential for creating more favorable conditions that could benefit not only zoonotic disease prevention but also biodiversity conservation and other related externalities. Furthermore, the direct impact of biodiversity loss is frequently not recognized as a significant One Health issue, leading to increased mortality rates among various animal and plant species (102) as well as the erosion of diverse ethnic communities.
Water consumption and pollution represent significant externalities of agribusiness. In Brazil, for instance, land irrigation is estimated to account for 72% of the country's water supply, while feeding farm animals consumes 79% of the cultivated protein. Alarmingly, in 2018, the water network failed to reach 33.2 million people. Within animal production systems, water pollution stems from various sources such as pharmaceutical residues (including antibiotics), heavy metals, chemicals, excrement, and pathogens. Similarly, in crop production, concerns revolve around heavy metals, chemicals, and particularly worrisome pesticides with carcinogenic potential.
Agribusiness plays a significant role in job creation and GDP contribution, yet the nature of these jobs is crucial, especially in light of employees' limited bargaining power in the face of expanding oligopolies. In developing countries, subsidies often coerce smallholders into accepting exploitation by transnational corporations, hindering agrarian reforms aimed at fostering fair and diversified agricultural practices. Conversely, in developed nations, the challenging working conditions within intensive production systems have made it difficult to attract domestic labor, leading to the employment of immigrants, including unauthorized workers, as a workaround.
Unhealthy work environments can arise from various factors. For instance, in the cultivation of fruits and vegetables, the use of pesticides introduces potential carcinogens into the equation (106, 111, 112). Within intensive animal production systems, the emission of toxic gases, vapors, and particles contributes to air pollution, leading to respiratory ailments (113â€“115). Farm settings and slaughterhouses expose workers to physical injuries, mental health issues like depression, and substance abuse (50, 110). Additionally, the stress and overcrowding in these environments can heighten the risk of animal diseases, necessitating antibiotic treatment that, in turn, fosters antimicrobial resistance among human workers and their families (116â€“119). The act of mass animal slaughter in slaughterhouses is a psychologically taxing task that can negatively impact employees' mental well-being and has been associated with increased crime rates in communities adjacent to such facilities (120).
The impact of externalities on farm animal welfare has been extensively examined in previous studies (108,121). However, it is crucial to highlight that despite recent theoretical progress in the realm of multispecies justice and labor concerns related to animals (13,15), the practice of compelling animals to produce goods persists without due consideration for their labor rights. Farm animals are often treated as commodities, a strategy that not only overlooks their inherent rights but also normalizes the violence inflicted upon sentient beings as a means to enhance production efficiency.
While idyllic representations of happy farm animals are often depicted in children's books and on milk packages, the reality is far from picturesque. Ag-gag laws further compound the issue by obstructing investigations into and the disclosure of animal abuse. In truth, farm animals are subjected to relentless genetic, medical, and pharmacological interventions that push them to their physiological limits. The sheer number of animals slaughtered necessitates rapid and often inhumane procedures, posing challenges to both labor safety and the mitigation of animal suffering. Shockingly, cruel practices persist, such as the live shredding of male chicks in the egg production industry, the confinement of sows in restrictive cells, the use of small cages that prevent birds from extending their wings, the premature separation of mothers from their offspring, and routine amputations without anesthesia of beaks, teeth, horns, and tails to increase confinement density and prevent cannibalism in stressful environments.
Agribusiness generates externalities that are shielded by governmental strategies (108), resulting in environmental degradation and the use of inhumane practices on animals. Mere discussions on job generation and GDP contributions fail to address issues concerning working conditions and equitable profit distribution. The externalities, such as subsidies, often surpass the final prices borne by consumers of agribusiness products, posing a significant threat to global sustainability. Furthermore, agribusiness operations tend to marginalize multispecies collectives both within and beyond farm boundaries.
Discussions surrounding health complexity extend beyond biomedical concerns, particularly evident in Latin America where social medicine, now known as collective health and critical epidemiology, has been formulating conceptual frameworks for understanding the social determinants of health since the 1970s. In more recent times, the World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced a widely recognized conceptual framework on the social determinants of health. Despite criticisms from critical epidemiology regarding the WHO's approach, which is seen as reinforcing existing inequities, both perspectives emphasize the necessity of moving beyond biologism and individualism in health discourse, albeit with a focus primarily on human social dynamics. Contrarily, certain One Health approaches challenge the notion that social relations are solely human-centric, highlighting the limitations of such a perspective. Drawing from biopolitics and sociology, there is a growing foundation for considering a broader, more inclusive understanding of social determinants of health that transcends human boundaries and incorporates a more-than-human perspective.
In the WHO's conceptual framework, structural determinants contribute to health inequities through intermediary determinants. Structural determinants encompass the ways in which political, economic, and social contexts establish "hierarchies of power, prestige, and access to resources." On the other hand, intermediary determinants consist of material and psychosocial circumstances, behavioral and biological factors, and the health system, all of which stem from individuals' hierarchical positions. These intermediary determinants not only result from individuals' positions in society but also give rise to exposures and vulnerabilities that ultimately lead to health inequities.
Social cohesion and social capital are viewed as structural and intermediary determinants, with health status influencing individuals' opportunities and feeding back into the hierarchical structure. This conceptual framework operates on a causal basis, emphasizing the precedence and prominence of structural determinants. By identifying and measuring the hypothetical effects of causal factors, decision-makers can better address and mitigate health inequities.
The concept of social determination of health as theorized in Latin America is not consolidated in a single reference, yet various perspectives share the notion that social determination serves as a critical analytical category. Samaja posits that social determination is an ongoing historical process wherein social hierarchy levels are essentially self-produced and perpetuated, leading to tensions and conflicts that drive actions aimed at restoration and transformation. This hierarchical structure reproduces itself as a cohesive unit, overseeing its constituent parts to uphold the overall framework. Nonetheless, this regulation is not absolute, and the relative autonomy of these parts serves as a catalyst for change, giving rise to new wholes that encompass them.
In the interplay between regulation and relative autonomy, a dynamic process shapes epidemiologic profiles across hierarchical levels and their respective positions (130). Take the family unit, for example. The interplay of relative autonomous behaviors within the family, alongside regulations imposed by higher social structures like communities, political-administrative territories, contractual associations, and other institutions, collectively influence the epidemiologic profile of its members.
Despite the fundamental disparities between the two conceptual frameworks, they converge at two critical junctures. Firstly, they both acknowledge a structural dimension - the socioeconomic and political context in the social determinants framework, and the social production and reproduction in the social determination framework. These dimensions highlight the hierarchical structures that place constraints on individuals based on their position within the hierarchy. Secondly, both frameworks emphasize the triple inequity of health, which is influenced by class, gender, and race/ethnicity. This intersection underscores the interconnectedness of these factors in shaping health outcomes and disparities within society.
One Health of Peripheries also intersects these points from a biopolitical perspective, where the political is not seen as an external precursor of hierarchies or a tool monopolized by the most privileged hierarchical levels. Instead, it is viewed as the relationships among individuals within the hierarchical order, realized rather than owned, embodying Foucauldian micro-physics of power (132) that includes animals. Consequently, One Health of Peripheries contributes to the second intersection by theorizing multispecies forms of health inequity.
Structural One Health serves as a valuable resource that delves deeper into the pivotal role of agribusiness in the genesis of zoonoses and pandemics through capital circuits (52). However, it is crucial to distinguish between structural One Health and One Health of Peripheries. Firstly, One Health of Peripheries surpasses infectious diseases in its scope. Secondly, while structural One Health emphasizes extensive empirical causal processes, One Health of Peripheries acknowledges the necessity for comprehensive causal explanations but emphasizes a dialectical approach to transcend the limitations of causal reasoning and empirical evidence. Thirdly, power dynamics and health disparities are overt multispecies phenomena in One Health of Peripheries. Given the constraints of this paper, a detailed exploration of the social determinants of One Health of Peripheries is deferred to future research endeavors.
The concepts of field and habitus, rooted in Bourdieusian theory, are integral to the realm of collective health. These concepts prompt us to consider health practices and knowledge as constructed by individuals who are influenced by symbolic structures such as language and culture, which in turn shape their perceptions and behaviors. Consequently, health, for healthcare practitioners, is contingent upon their understanding of it, implying that altering the conditions that facilitate knowledge acquisition can lead to changes in health outcomes. Put differently, the modification of symbolic structures is itself a form of health practice that has a direct impact on health.
Practices are shaped, perceived, and valued through habitus, a framework of schemas that are "formed in the collective history and acquired [and altered] in individual history" (8,133) [translation mine]. The habitus of individuals is influenced by hierarchies, with their perceptions, understanding, and actions reflecting their position and influencing their interactions with others in different hierarchical positions.
The field is a social space defined by hierarchical relationships that shape the habitus and derive meaning and value from it (134). Within this space, cooperation and conflict either maintain existing hierarchies or bring about their transformation. Those in the most privileged positions possess greater capitalâ€”economic, cultural, social, and symbolicâ€”which they use to mold and justify hierarchies in alignment with their own interests. These interests may not always be consciously pursued, as they are ingrained in the habitus through exposure to "institutionalized spaces (family, school) by specialized agents who enforce arbitrary norms through disciplinary methods" (8) [translation is mine].
Peripheral positions serve as passive, contrasting reference points, as highlighted in the text (8). Animals, in this context, occupy a contrasting position where those seeking greater capital to assert and validate their interests undergo a social promotion perceived as an ontological shift or a civilizing process, transitioning from nature to culture, from animality to humanity (8). Consequently, our interactions with animals play a crucial role in shaping the habitus we develop, ultimately attributing significance and worth to multispecies assemblages.
Depending on the habitus and the field, individuals may perceive unfitted individuals as deserving of their misfortunes, psychiatric patients who can potentially enhance productivity through treatments from the pharmaceutical industry, or exploitation regimes disguised as progress. There are also instances of pests and reservoirs of infectious agents posing threats to public health, alongside multispecies collectives with shared susceptibilities that necessitate comprehensive health policies. Consequently, the entry of various elements into the health domain and the manner in which they do so represent a social process.
Health practice is inherently biased and has the potential to perpetuate inequalities. Conversely, advocating for One Health of Peripheries represents a deliberate effort to address disparities that extend beyond human populations. This approach signifies a focused commitment to reducing inequities that encompass both human and non-human entities. The arena in which this advocacy takes place is more precisely defined as a field of praxis. Drawing inspiration from Paulo Freire, praxis is understood as a form of reflective action aimed at challenging oppression and working towards liberation. It involves taking informed action based on an understanding of the detrimental impacts of marginalization, as well as utilizing knowledge derived from previous efforts to combat marginalization.
In the realm of collective health, there is a significant emphasis on concepts such as "health promotion" and "life preservation" (136), non-anthropocentric viewpoints (1), and the acknowledgment of a "diversity of objects and theoretical discourses, without imposing any hierarchical or evaluative stance on them" (137) [translations provided by the author]. Nevertheless, the prevailing discourse tends to exclusively focus on the human aspect, neglecting the broader, more-than-human dimensions of life and health. This oversight represents a notable blind spot within the field of collective health, a deficiency that has been illuminated by the practical application of the One Health of Peripheries approach.
As a subfield within the realm of health, collective health is not obligated to encompass all aspects related to health; it could be confined solely to human health. Nevertheless, if collective health is transdisciplinary, as indicated by previous research (138), focused on the social factors influencing health (1), and striving for the advancement of a broader understanding of health (139), it ought to advocate for the concept of One Health of Peripheries.
The concept of One Health of Peripheries encompasses the experience, understanding, and transformation necessary to enhance the well-being of marginalized multispecies collectives. It involves the breaking of boundaries and margins in order to strive towards achieving justice for all species involved.
Biopolitics and other critical perspectives provide valuable conceptual frameworks for comprehending the mechanisms through which marginalizing apparatuses disproportionately impact individuals' health outcomes. It is crucial to recognize the role of multispecies intersectionality in fostering more equitable alternatives and addressing the systemic inequalities that contribute to disparities in health and well-being.
Biological solutions divorced from the intricate web of non-human social interactions will not effectively address the complex challenges presented by mainstream One Health initiatives. The insistence on maintaining an illusion of apolitical and non-ideological epidemiological environments when dealing with transmissible and physiopathological processes only serves to perpetuate the issue at hand. Similarly, the belief that a robust pharmaceutical industry, backed by patents, intersectoral collaborations devoid of consideration for asymmetric power dynamics, and benevolent actions of the global North towards the global South are all that is required, is misguided. These oversights hinder the comprehensive and inclusive approach necessary for tackling the multifaceted issues at the core of One Health.
The concept of social determinants of health serves as a comprehensive framework for understanding the complexities of health. However, it is important to acknowledge a blind spot within this framework, namely the neglect of the One Health of Peripheries. The anthropocentric focus of collective health perpetuates marginalization and constrains the effectiveness of health promotion efforts.
The concept of One Health of Peripheries leverages more-than-human biopolitics, One Health principles, collective health approaches, and various knowledge sources to guide the effort of elevating multispecies collectives from the margins. This inclusive approach inherently presents theoretical challenges that need to be addressed.
In discussing One Health of Peripheries rather than One Health on Peripheries, the commitment is emphasized as not being a top-down endeavor, thereby strengthening its foundation. Working directly with communities in favelas prompted a realization of the necessity for a distinct theoretical framework, leading to the exploration and development of the concept of One Health of Peripheries.
The diverse forms of academic, popular, and traditional knowledge, along with the collaborative dedication to One Health in peripheral regions, require a clearly defined agenda. In a separate study, we analyze the colonial mechanisms of marginalization, discuss the compatibility of Southern epistemologies with diverse knowledge systems, and suggest seven specific actions to advance the concept of One Health in peripheral areas (18).
