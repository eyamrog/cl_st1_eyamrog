The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the 
betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread 
worldwide from the city of Wuhan, China. Since its 
beginning, it has affected more than 2,700,000 individuals 
and caused almost 185,000 deaths in 185 countries, 
compounding the difficulties in medical healthcare 
worldwide. By April 23, 2020, Brazil had registered 
almost 47,000 confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths.1

COVID-19 aggravates the inequalities and 
uncertainties of science in general. This is no different 
when it comes to the heart. Unlike other epidemics 
caused by respiratory viruses, COVID-19 affects the 
heart, not only because most confirmed cases and deaths 
involve individuals with hypertension, heart failure, 
arrhythmias and coronary artery disease, but also 
because the disease is associated with a higher number 
of cardiac complications, such as myocardial injury, 
cardiogenic shock, Takotsubo syndrome, pulmonary 
embolism, myocarditis and arrhythmia.2 Apart from 
inflammation, endothelial activation, oxidation of 
low-density lipoproteins, platelet activation and tissue 
factor expression caused by respiratory virus epidemics, 
such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 
and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS), poor 
COVID-19 prognosis is compounded by the deleterious 
effect of the association of treatment drugs (chloroquine/
azithromycin) that can cause malignant arrhythmias in 
patients with heart disease.3

The challenges concerning COVID-19 are huge, 
because it tests us all - patients, healthcare personnel, 
health systems and the general population. In light of 
this, the importance of the safety of healthcare workers 
has never been so emphasized.2

Working in a hospital during a pandemic of a highly 
contagious disease, such as COVID-19, reminds healthcare 
workers of the need to reinforce all safety measures 
inside a cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL). That is 
because, in addition to the cardiovascular alterations due 
to COVID-19, patients with cardiovascular diseases, such 
as acute myocardial infarction and advanced structural 
diseases, continue to require interventional procedures.

Therefore, the safety measures for healthcare 
professionals and patients become even more 
important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of 
the safety issues that might affect both patients and 
healthcare personnel are as follows: ionizing radiation, 
equipment, and contact with chemical and biological 
agents. All health professionals in contact with patients 
should follow the local and national guidelines for 
infection control and use of personal protective 
equipment (PPE), which should be available and on 
hand for all staff members. In addition, strict adherence 
to all safety rules required for a catheterization 
procedure indication should be encouraged; moreover, 
all urgent cases should be prioritized, and all routine 
cases postponed if this carries no loss to either 
prognosis or the patients’ quality of life.4

The Brazilian Society of Interventional Cardiology 
(SBHCI) has published a position statement on some 
general measures to tackle COVID-19: limitation of 
social exposure; adoption of stricter personal hygiene 
habits; home confinement of individuals with the mild 
form of COVID-19; hospital support with isolation 
for patients with the severe forms of the disease; 
quarantine for the close contacts of suspected cases; 
priority allocation of healthcare resources to urgent and 
emergent cases; protection of the professionals involved 
in patients’ care. In addition, regarding specifically the 
CCL, the SBHCI recommends: to postpone elective 
procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected 
COVID-19; to limit the performance of CCL procedures 
to cardiovascular emergencies, and, for the other cases, 
procedures must be postponed until the non-infecting 
stage of disease; in CCLs with multiple procedure 
rooms, one should be dedicated to the treatment of 
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.5

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the general safety 
protocols and those concerning CCL procedures, as well as 
the safety measures for patients and healthcare personnel 
need to be reviewed, because that infection increases 
the requirements for indication and effectiveness of the 
procedures performed. 

A study conducted in China with 72,314 patients 
with COVID-19 (44,672 laboratory-confirmed cases, 
16,186 suspected cases, and 10,567 clinically diagnosed 
cases) has reported fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, 
fatigue and diarrhea as the most common symptoms. 
Other signs and symptoms have been reported, 
such as sore throat, chest pain, mental confusion, 
and lethargy. The authors have highlighted that 
COVID-19 had a benign course in 80% of the cases, 
and that many patients, although asymptomatic, could 
carry the virus.6 It is worth noting the importance 
of the differential diagnosis of dyspnea and fatigue, 
especially when associated with the other symptoms. 

During a respiratory pandemic, patients and 
their families should be informed about the risks of 
contamination, despite all additional measures taken 
to minimize them. Because the number of elective 
procedures will be drastically reduced during that 
period, the length of hospital stay is predicted to be 
the minimum necessary for each protocol consensually 
elaborated.7 Moreover, defining a procedure as elective 
requires clinical judgement, because postponing it 
might have effects that will increase the likelihood 
of decompensation and adverse events during the 
pandemic, such as in high-risk patients with unstable 
angina. Therefore, the decision about performing a 
procedure should be individualized and based on the 
patient’s risk and benefit analysis.8

Despite the adoption of measures to reduce 
exposure, healthcare personnel shortage should be 
anticipated based on the likelihood of the removal of 
infected, exposed, at-risk and quarantined healthcare 
personnel. Particular attention should be given to avoid 
simultaneous exposure of healthcare professionals 
sharing the same skill set to prevent simultaneous 
contamination, especially in teaching institutions 
where the staff usually act together.4 In addition, it is 
worth emphasizing the importance of reducing as 
much as possible the circulation in the procedure room 
to ensure the minimum safety threshold established in 
CCL procedural protocols.4

It is worth noting that patients with suspected or 
confirmed COVID-19 should ideally undergo procedures 
at the end of the day or in CCL rooms dedicated to 
COVID-19, when available, because of the need for 
terminal disinfection.4

Patients already intubated represent a lower risk 
of contamination to healthcare personnel, because 
they are on closed-loop ventilation. In patients with 
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who need orotracheal 
intubation, this intervention should be performed before 
arrival to the CCL; in addition, intubation should be 
considered as early as possible in borderline patients to 
avoid the need for an urgent procedure and to minimize 
the contamination of the staff.4

Healthcare personnel exposure and benefits to 
patients should be balanced for all interventional 
procedures. For example, during a respiratory epidemic, 
for hemodynamically stable patients with COVID19+ 
and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, 
fibrinolysis might be an alternative according to some 
authors;6,9 however, the length of hospital stay waiting 
for coronary angioplasty after fibrinolysis should be 
carefully considered. 

It is worth noting that COVID19 is spread via respiratory 
droplets and contact with surfaces on which the virus can 
last for long periods, such as cell phone, keyboard, mouse 
and door handles, thus, the procedure duration should 
be reduced to a minimum.10,11 Moreover, patients with 
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be using a face 
mask upon arrival to the CCL and continue to use it during 
procedure preparation and the procedure itself.4 

All CCL personnel should wear PPE, including 
FFP2/N95 respirators, goggles, full face shields, 
disposable caps, gowns, surgical gloves, and shoe 
covers, during the entire procedure, because of the 
potential for those patients’ clinical deterioration 
and the consequent risk that comes with intubation, 
aspiration and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
In addition, CCL staff should be well educated in the 
proper donning and doffing of PPE because of the high 
likelihood of contamination involved in the process.3-5

It is worth noting that myocardial injury has been 
reported in 7% of the patients with COVID-19 and 
might correspond to type 2 myocardial infarction or 
myocarditis.11 Thus, no effort should be spared in 
reaching the differential diagnosis before the procedure 
with the aid of imaging tests, such as point-of-care 
echocardiography.

In addition, it is worth emphasizing that percutaneous 
coronary intervention should only be performed to the 
culprit vessel, unless a nonculprit lesion is deemed 
unstable or in the presence of multiple culprit lesions.12

During the pandemic, in anticipation of a surge 
in hospitalization required for COVID-19 infected 
patients and because not only most inpatient beds will 
be made available for COVID-19 treatment, but also 
to avoid additional contamination, hospital discharge 
will occur earlier for stable patients who might be 
followed up via telemedicine.12

Within the CCL, all nonessential equipment should 
be moved out of the procedure room or covered with 
clear drapes before patient’s arrival to the room, and the 
same applies to the control and post-procedure recovery 
rooms. After a procedure in a patient with COVID-19, 
thorough terminal disinfection can be performed with 
ultraviolet light.12

The standard positive pressure ventilation system 
of the CCL consists of an air-handling unit that 
distributes conditioned air to different functional units, 
including the procedure, post-procedure, and control 
rooms. Positive pressure with adequate air changes 
can rapidly eliminate the virus from the environment; 
in   addition the risk of cross-contamination from 
airborne infections has been shown to be low if 
the personnel is protected with appropriate PPE.9 
The positive pressure ventilation system should be 
extended to the rooms associated with the procedure. 

It is worth noting that the inflammatory state of patients 
with COVID-19 often determines a hypercoagulable 
condition that requires additional use of heparin.11 

Figure 1 shows the safety recommendations for 
CCL procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Those written in bold letters should receive special 
attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, all material used 
for invasive procedures, including the equipment for 
anesthesia, orotracheal intubation and mechanical 
ventilation, in addition to PPEs, should undergo a 
daily check and be readily available for easy and 
rapid use to minimize the work and burnout of 
healthcare professionals.13

The PPE should be removed preferably in an anteroom. 
If no anteroom is available, doffing of PPE should be done 
inside the procedure room, at the end of the procedure 
and after the patient has been transferred away, except 
for the PPE for respiratory protection, which must be 
removed outside the procedure room.13

Post-procedure visits should be performed by the 
lowest number possible of professionals; moreover, 
discussions about additional management should be 
converted to an online or telephone format, and the same 
applies to morning CCL rounds.12-14

Most sanitizers contain alcohol at different 
concentrations and are used for cleaning and 
disinfecting high-touch surfaces (floor, walls, ceiling, 
and countertops), a precaution that is important during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, a single-strand 
RNA virus, is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat, 
being inactivated by lipid solvents, such as ether (75%), 
ethanol, sanitizers containing chlorine, peroxyacetic acid 
and chloroform, except for chlorhexidine.15 

Terminal disinfection of the procedure room at the end 
of each procedure is highly recommended during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Disposable PPE, sheets, fabric, and 
sponges contaminated with blood should be placed into a 
waste container marked with the biological hazard symbol 
and disposed into a waste bin labeled as ‘COVID-19’.10 

Figure 2 shows the general safety items for CCL 
procedures. Those written in bold letters should receive 
special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Figure 3 shows the steps for putting on and removing 
PPE for CCL procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A recent case series of 5700 inpatients with 
COVI‑19 (median age, 63 years; male sex, 60.3%) in 
the city of New York, United States, has reported 
a high prevalence of comorbidities, especially 
cardiovascular ones, as follows: arterial hypertension, 
56.6%; coronary artery disease, 11.1%; heart failure, 
6.9%; obesity, 41.7%; and diabetes, 33.8%. In-
hospital lethality rate was 21%, which increased to 
88% among those requiring mechanical ventilation. 
In addition, the authors have reported that most 
patients maintained their routine medications, such 
as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 
angiotensin II receptor blockers. These data reinforce 
the need to maintain the traditional treatment of 
patients with heart diseases to avoid decompensation 
during the pandemic.29

The challenges presented during the COVID-19 
pandemic are huge, not only the approach of 
patients with cardiovascular diseases, who need 
to continue their treatments regardless of having 
or not COVID-19, but also the management of the 
complex cardiovascular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 
infection, such as myocarditis, Takotsubo syndrome 
and myocardial injury, which can mimic ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction. In addition, patients 
usually delay seeking hospital treatment because of 
fear of contamination.30,31

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the established 
strategies, such as primary angioplasty, remain 
the standard treatment. These strategies should be 
performed at hospitals that are well equipped for a 
timely response and that have a team of specialized 
professionals wearing the aforementioned PPEs. 
The fibrinolysis-based strategy should be reserved 
for situations in which primary angioplasty cannot 
be performed.31 

Although interventional cardiology certainly entails more 
engaging topics than safety, extraordinary times call for 
extraordinary measures. It is essential to revisit the different 
aspects of protection for patients and healthcare personnel in 
the CCL, as well as to tailor them to the COVID-19 scenario. 

Health systems around the world have been overwhelmed 
for months. However, unlike ventilators and wards, 
healthcare personnel cannot be ‘manufactured’ urgently, 
mainly highly specialized professionals, such as CCL staff.32 

All activities performed in CCL rooms need to be 
restructured, and registries should be kept to quantify 
the effects of COVID-19 on the treatment of patients 
with cardiovascular diseases. In doing so, we will be 
able to learn from this pandemic and thereby both add 
value to this field and contribute to a rapidly growing 
body of knowledge on COVID-19.
