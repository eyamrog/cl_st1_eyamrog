Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is characterized by lymphocytic scarring leading to hair loss along the frontal hairline and potentially affecting other body areas. Current treatments, including topical and systemic drugs like methotrexate (MTX), often fail to effectively manage disease progression, highlighting the necessity for novel therapeutic approaches.
Objective: This study aims to assess the efficacy of methotrexate microinfusion in the treatment of aseptic femoral necrosis (AFF).
Methods: A prospective, controlled clinical trial was conducted involving 17 volunteers diagnosed with Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia (FFA) clinically and histologically. Methotrexate (MTX) was administered using the MMP® (microinfusion of drugs into the skin method) every 30 days, totaling 3 applications, on the right half of the alopecia area, while the other half served as a control. Measurements were taken on the frontal-glabella and frontal temporo-parietal regions, dermoscopy photos were analyzed by blinded external evaluators, and patients' perceptions of signs and symptoms along with the Lichen Planopilaris Activity Index (LPPAI) were assessed. Additionally, total blood count and liver function tests were conducted.
Results: Significant reductions were observed in frontal-glabella and frontal temporo-parietal measurements at the treated site, while an increase was noted in the untreated site. Patients reported improvements in pruritus and desquamation, but not in hair loss or local erythema. Dermoscopic photo analysis and LPPAI calculations did not reveal significant changes. Approximately 95% of participants expressed satisfaction or high satisfaction with the outcomes, and no alterations were detected in laboratory test results.
In conclusion, the application of MTX by MMP® demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms related to AFF, as well as in the measurements of frontal-glabella and frontal temporo-parietal regions. The technique was found to be both safe and well tolerated, suggesting its potential as an effective treatment option for individuals with these conditions.
Fibrosing frontal alopecia (FFA) is a progressive and chronic cicatricial alopecia of unknown etiology, considered to be a form of lichen planopilaris. This inflammatory disease not only affects the scalp and eyebrows but also other regions of the body, leading to hair loss, local pain (trichodynia), and pruritus. FFA primarily affects post-menopausal women and may be linked to the emergence of lichen planus pigmentosum and normochromic facial papules. While FFA can be clinically identified, trichoscopy serves as a crucial noninvasive method aiding in diagnostic assessment by revealing scalp erythema, desquamation, and perifollicular hyperchromy, as well as assessing the degree of inflammation. However, the most reliable diagnostic tool remains the biopsy, which demonstrates a decrease in the number of terminal hair follicles in the dermis, perifollicular concentric fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrate in the follicular isthmus, presence of necrotic keratinocytes, and the scarring pattern of the alopecia. Early detection and treatment play a pivotal role in altering the disease's course and preventing its progression.
Treatment for FFA involves the administration of oral, intralesional, and topical glucocorticoids, antimalarials, methotrexate, acitretin, mycophenolate mofetil, finasteride, naltrexone, pioglitazone, doxycycline, and tofacitinib. Additionally, medications such as cyclosporine, thalidomide, and griseofulvin have also been utilized, albeit with varying degrees of success (references 11-13).
Methotrexate is administered orally or through subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, but its systemic use is linked to various side effects including gastrointestinal intolerance, hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression, and teratogenicity. Additionally, the drug's bioavailability is restricted due to significant metabolization during the initial liver passage. Local application can reduce these complications; however, the hydro-soluble nature of MTX limits its ability to penetrate the skin's corneal layer. In the context of psoriasis, methods like electroporation, iontophoresis, and ablative lasers have been employed to enhance the drug's skin penetration.
The microinfusion technique known as MMP® involves the insertion of microparticles into the skin through micro needling, allowing for the delivery of active ingredients. The depth of the needling is customized based on the specific condition being targeted for treatment. Studies have demonstrated promising outcomes in the treatment of psoriasis using MMP® for the infusion of MTX, with patients showing high levels of tolerability. By administering the drug percutaneously, its local efficacy is enhanced, and the risk of inactivation through hepatic metabolism is minimized, leading to more effective therapeutic outcomes.
This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of methotrexate infusion (MTX) using the MMP® technique on the scalp in a prospective controlled trial, given the challenging nature of FFA treatment.
This study received approval from the Ethics Committee on the Use of Animals at Faculdade Evangélica Mackenzie do Paraná, Curitiba, PR, Brazil, with the reference number CAAE 09928919100000103. Inclusion criteria required participants to be over 18 years old and have a confirmed diagnosis of frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) through clinical, trichoscopic examination, and biopsy. Exclusion criteria encompassed individuals with abnormal liver function tests, a history of chronic hepatitis, renal failure, hemolytic anemia, or pregnancy. Patients who had undergone corticosteroid infiltration, systemic methotrexate (MTX) treatment, or any micro-infusion therapy within the past four months were also excluded. All enrolled patients provided informed consent.
The research involved assessing Fitzpatrick phototype, hair loss in other body areas, frontal-glabella measurement, and determining the frontal temporo-parietal distance. The frontal-glabella measurement focused on determining the distance between the frontal hairline (excluding isolated hairs) and the glabellar crease, while the frontal temporo-parietal measurement assessed the distance between the lateral eye epicanthus and the hairline implantation at the temporo-parietal region. These measurements were conducted using a flexible manual ruler suitable for the convex forehead region and were taken at day 0 and 30 days post the final application. The examiner, who measured these distances, was unaware of which side was undergoing treatment (refer to Figure 1).
This index assesses symptoms including pain, pruritus, and local burning sensation, as well as local findings such as desquamation, diffuse and perifollicular erythema, anagen traction test, and alopecia progression. The scale ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 representing the best scenario and 10 indicating the worst. The LLPAI was assessed at day 0 and 30 days following the final treatment session.
In the trichoscopy study, the frontal line of the scalp was segmented into eight regions, each three centimeters apart and labeled as A, B, C, D on the right side and E, F, G, H on the left side (refer to Figure 2). The assessments were conducted on day 0 and 30 days post the final treatment by two certified examiners who were unaware of the treated side, utilizing videodermatoscopy Dino Lite® for the examination.
Trichoscopic findings were captured using a Canon® EOS Rebel T7 Ef-S 18-55 F/3.5-5.6 Is II camera in the specified 8 regions (Figure 2) on day 0 and 30 days post-treatment. The images were standardized under identical lighting conditions, at the same location, and with a consistent distance of 30 cm from the participant. Pre- and post-treatment images were juxtaposed (Figure 3) and independently assessed by three certified dermatologists, unaware of the treated side, utilizing a classification system of -1 (worsening), 0 (no changes), and +1 (improvement). The dermatologists evaluated parameters such as scalp and perifollicular erythema, telangiectasis, desquamation, and pigmentation alterations.
Hematological parameters including total blood cell count, transaminases (GOT and GPT), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, prothrombin time, as well as hepatitis B and C serologies and BHCG levels were assessed at baseline (day 0) and at 30 days post each application.
Before administering the scalp injection, the areas to be treated underwent inspection and antisepsis with 0.2% chlorhexidine. The application involved three doses of 1 ml methotrexate (50 mg/2 ml) using the MMP® technique with a Magnum 23 tip from a Cheyenne MMP® device, spaced 30 days apart. A single dermatologist performed the procedure, administering the medication to the right side of the alopecia area, while the left side, serving as a control, did not receive any treatment.
Procedures were conducted by a sole investigator on half of the alopecia area (specifically the right side), with the other half (left side) serving as the control. Mild erythema was anticipated in the treated region. Each segment of the treated area, delineated as per Figure 2, was administered an equal dosage of 0.25 ml of MTX. Patients were advised against washing the treated area for 24 hours post-procedure and instructed to commence using SPF 30 sunscreen 72 hours after the intervention.
The level of patient satisfaction was evaluated using a questionnaire that focused on various factors such as the size of the alopecia area, hair thickness, hair loss, and density, in addition to any local or systemic symptoms linked to the treatment. This assessment was conducted 30 days following the final treatment session.
The collected data were organized into frequency and contingency tables. Measures of central tendency were represented by the mean and standard deviation, given that all numerical data met parametric assumptions. Nominal data comparisons were conducted using Fisher and chi-squared tests, while numerical data comparisons were performed using the Student's t-test. A significance level of 5% was adopted for all analyses. Statistical tests were carried out using the software SPSS (version 17.0, USA).
Seventeen female patients were included in the study. Table 1 presents the primary characteristics of this sample, predominantly comprising middle-aged individuals with phototypes III and IV. The table further indicates that the most prevalent clinical manifestations were pruritus and desquamation, with nearly two-thirds of the sample experiencing hair loss in various body regions.
The findings from the comparison of frontal-glabellar and frontal temporo-parietal distances are presented in Table 2. The data in this table indicate a notable decrease in the frontal-glabellar distance and the right frontal temporo-parietal distance, whereas there is a significant increase in the left front-temporo-parietal distance.
No significant differences were observed in the comparison of frontal temporo-parietal measurements between the right and left sides both before treatment (p=0.80) and after treatment (p=0.73). The comparison of symptoms and clinical findings before and after treatment is presented in Table 3, indicating improvements in pruritus and desquamation. Prior to treatment, the LPPAI on the right side (the treated area) had a mean value of 4.61±1.86, which decreased to 4.15±1.62 after treatment, with no significant difference observed (p=0.45).
The direct comparison of trichoscopic findings between the treated (right) side (A, B, C, D) and the untreated (left) side (D, E, F, G) revealed no discernible differences. This lack of distinction was further confirmed through photographic evaluation by external assessors, with all results yielding p-values greater than 0.05.
The procedure was well tolerated, as indicated by the patients' responses. Table 4 presents the symptoms reported by the patients both during and after the administration of MTX.
Regarding patient satisfaction with treatment outcomes, the results are depicted in Figure 4. It is noteworthy that none of the patients expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment they received.
No significant changes were noted in blood cell count, liver function, or renal function tests.
There is a scarcity of clinical trials focusing on Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia (FFA) treatment, particularly none examining Methotrexate (MTX) use via the Microneedling-Mesotherapy-Photodynamic therapy (MMP) technique, making this study the inaugural account of its application for this condition. While MTX has been utilized systemically for FFA, the outcomes have been inadequately documented. A review conducted by IMHOF et al. documented two cases with conflicting results. A study conducted at Duke University involved three FFA patients treated with oral MTX, with only one experiencing disease stabilization. Conversely, a study at Mayo Clinic, involving just two patients, demonstrated that systemic MTX could halt disease progression.
Arbache et al. documented the utilization of methotrexate (MTX) drug delivery in conjunction with the microneedle patch (MMP) technique for treating vulgar psoriasis in two patients, resulting in the complete remission of skin lesions following three applications. In the current study, this approach demonstrated enhancements in pruritus and desquamation, while also halting the advancement of alopecia, as assessed by measurements taken at the frontal-glabella and right frontal temporo-parietal regions, ultimately contributing positively to the well-being of the patients.
In the current study, the LPPAI utilized to assess treatment response did not demonstrate any amelioration of signs and symptoms following the proposed treatment. As noted by Andrade et al., who examined 22 patients with FFA undergoing treatment and evaluation using LPPAI and FFASI (Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia Severity Index), these two scales, when employed independently, do not yield satisfactory results as their final scores do not directly correlate but rather serve to complement each other. Consequently, it can be inferred that an effective tool for assessing FFA severity remains elusive.
Based on the frontal-glabella and frontal temporo-parietal measurements, the current treatment has effectively prevented the advancement of retraction of the frontal glabellar implantation line. This approach, previously utilized by Rakowska et al. in their investigation of isotretinoin and acitretin in FFA patients, demonstrated that the assessment tool successfully indicated the absence of AAF progression post-medication cessation. Presently, a comparison between treated and untreated sides revealed a significant decrease in the right frontal-glabella and frontal temporo-parietal distances, while the left frontal temporo-parietal distance exhibited progression, underscoring the critical nature of these metric parameters in monitoring the development of this fibrosing disease.
The comparison of symptoms and clinical findings pre- and post-treatment revealed a notable improvement in pruritus and desquamation, with these manifestations being more pronounced on the untreated side (left). This suggests that the treatment effectively alleviated these symptoms on the treated side (right). However, erythema and hair loss were deemed less significant in assessing treatment response.
Currently, there are no studies demonstrating a correlation between trichoscopy and histological findings in assessing AAF activity. STARACE et al. suggest that symptoms like hair loss, itching, erythema, desquamation, and heightened scalp sensitivity could serve as indicators for monitoring the progression of AAF.
Previous research has not explored the use of the MMP technique in FFA treatment, although its application has been described in other contexts. For instance, Contin investigated the efficacy of MMP® combined with 5% Minoxidil for treating androgenetic alopecia through three monthly sessions, demonstrating its effectiveness, simplicity, and suitability for outpatient settings. This study aligns with Contin's findings, highlighting the comfort, tolerability, and affordability of the technique. Importantly, the procedure was deemed safe, with no severe side effects observed, and no exacerbation of FFA or Köebner phenomenon post-MPM sessions. Biochemical assessments post-three MTX applications revealed no abnormalities in blood count, liver, or renal function, underscoring the safety profile of this approach.
Patient satisfaction was a notable positive aspect observed in the current study, with the majority expressing contentment with the outcomes. The technique employed was well tolerated, eliciting minimal pain and pruritus, further contributing to the overall satisfaction reported by the patients.
Limitations of the current study include the small sample size and uncertainty regarding the number of applications and intervals between them. The rarity of the disease and stringent exclusion criteria support the use of a small sample. Determining the optimal number of applications and intervals is an ongoing process, given that this study represents the first report on MTX use through MMP® in FFA. Further research is necessary to address these uncertainties. Additionally, the extent of systemic absorption of MTX remains unknown, raising concerns about potential spread to the untreated side.
This study demonstrates notable strengths, notably the innovative application of a novel technique for addressing AAF, yielding favorable outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and ease of implementation.
The utilization of MTX in drug delivery via MMP® demonstrated efficacy in symptom reduction and halting the progression of AAF. Trichoscopy and LPPAI were found to be inadequate tools for assessing treatment response, whereas measurements of the frontal glabella and bilateral frontal temporo-parietal regions proved to be more reliable. The procedure was deemed safe and well-tolerated, presenting a promising alternative for the treatment of AFF patients.
