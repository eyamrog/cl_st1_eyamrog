The world is currently grappling with a surge in emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, setting the stage for what may be a century defined by frequent, complex, and impactful epidemics. Presently, the globe is in the throes of an unparalleled pandemic linked to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in significant social and economic repercussions. In response, preventive strategies like travel limitations and widespread quarantines are being implemented worldwide, leading to a strain on the healthcare systems of both developing and developed nations as they struggle to cope with the escalating demand for services.
The health systems of all countries must remain consistently prepared to address emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases through an integrated cycle of preparation, response, and recovery. Global health necessitates a swift and effective local response due to the rapid spread of infectious diseases in today's interconnected world. Therefore, the adoption of the International Health Regulations (IHR) by all nations, along with the establishment of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), is imperative in addressing this challenge and working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
In Brazil, the Unified Health System (SUS) assumes a central role in preparing the country for the challenges posed by the current era. Even prior to the identification of the first case of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in Latin America, SUS has been actively involved in responding to the crisis, declaring a national public health emergency. Subsequently, Emergency Health Operations Centers for Covid-19 were mobilized to facilitate structured and synchronized efforts, offering guidance to the healthcare sector regarding contingency strategies and response protocols aimed at curtailing the transmission of the disease.
In 2018, Brazil surpassed the global average in IHR all capacities due to its universal public health system. However, challenges were identified in health service provision and points of entry. Areas such as zoonotic events and the human-animal interface, food safety, risk communication, national health emergency framework, and legislation and finance require enhancement to ensure prompt and efficient prevention, detection, assessment, notification, reporting, and response to health risks and emergencies (Table 1).
Brazil's health service provision indicators fall below the global average, reflecting limited functional capacity. Scoring 40% for managing health emergency response operations and infection prevention and control, as well as chemical and radiation decontamination (compared to the world average of 57% and 56% respectively), highlights a compromised ability to respond effectively due to deficiencies in case management and infection control. With a score of 60% for access to essential health services (compared to the global average of 66%), Brazil's capacity to prevent, detect, and control infectious disease outbreaks is hindered. Enhancing this capacity is crucial for delivering critical services to uphold the health and safety of local populations, not only for safeguarding against cross-border outbreaks. The indicators related to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) underscore the need for Brazil to enhance infectious disease control, including basic sanitation, which necessitates sustained intersectoral investments. In the context of the Covid-19 response, concerns persist regarding the availability of intensive care units and mechanical ventilators, further underscoring the challenges in health service provision.
Core capacity requirements at designated airports, ports, and ground crossings, as well as the effectiveness of public health responses at points of entry, both key indicators of entry capacity, scored 60% in Brazil (compared to the global averages of 55% and 48%, respectively), highlighting a deficiency in preventive and control measures at the subnational level. It is imperative that all points of entry possess the necessary capabilities to manage incoming travelers, animals, and cargo, as they could potentially serve as reservoirs or vectors for various pathogens. Many of the viruses currently circulating in Brazil, including SARS-CoV-2, Zika, and Chikungunya, have been imported from other countries in recent years. Consequently, the National Agency of Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA), primarily responsible for IHR-related activities at Brazilian points of entry, requires increased investments to enhance core capacities and facilitate an effective response.
Brazil achieved a score of 80% for indicators related to collaborative efforts in addressing zoonosis, surpassing the global average of 63%. Similarly, the country scored 80% for multisectoral collaboration mechanisms in food safety events, exceeding the global average of 61%. Additionally, Brazil scored 80% for its capacity in emergency risk communications, surpassing the global average of 57%. These results indicate that Brazil possesses the necessary national and subnational functional capacity to effectively manage various health events and implement preventive measures. However, there is room for improvement in order for the country to be considered highly advanced and sustainable in these critical areas.
Zoonotic events and the human-animal interface are critical considerations in the context of emerging infectious diseases, as 75% of the pathogens associated with these events originate from animals. Enhancing this capacity could lead to a greater understanding of zoonotic events, timely detection of animal reservoirs, and vectors. Given that food can serve as a vehicle for various pathogens, enhancing food safety capacity is essential for preventing infection outbreaks. The integration of the One Health approach into the country's health system is crucial to address these issues effectively. Furthermore, there is a need to improve risk communication to engage communities at the local, national, and global levels, encouraging their active participation in disease prevention and control efforts.
In Brazil, the management of health emergency response operations scored 60% (compared to the world average of 64%) and stood out as the only indicator related to the national health emergency framework that fell below 100%, highlighting the need for enhancements in incident management systems for public health events at the subnational level. Additionally, the country achieved a score of 80% for financing mechanisms and funds allocated for the prompt response to public health emergencies, surpassing the global average of 63%. This particular indicator, linked to legislation and financial capacity, pertains to the accessibility of funds, an aspect that requires significant improvement, particularly at the subnational level.
Despite achieving a high score in laboratory capacity, the Brazilian National Laboratory Network has struggled to effectively respond to the challenges posed by Covid-19. Specifically, the network has been found to have insufficient capability to conduct the necessary tests, particularly in relation to RT-PCR testing. This discrepancy raises concerns about the accuracy of the country's self-assessment regarding its actual testing capacity.
Brazil needs to prioritize enhancing its capacities in International Health Regulations (IHR) and Universal Health Coverage (UHC), particularly in areas where there are deficits. Simultaneously, it should implement measures to prevent outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, focusing on animals, human sentinels for spillover events, and the general population. By doing so, Brazil can better prepare itself for a globalized world characterized by changes in the environment and human behavior, urbanization, climate change, and increased travel, all of which contribute to the complexity of infectious disease epidemics.
