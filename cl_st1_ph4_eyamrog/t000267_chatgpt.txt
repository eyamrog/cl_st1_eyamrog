In January 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of the COVID-19 disease, which rapidly escalated into a significant epidemic threat in China. The virus, which began spreading in December 2019, quickly disseminated not only within China but also across numerous countries worldwide, posing a substantial challenge to public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in March 2020, marking it as a public health emergency of international concern. By April 20, 2020, the global tally had surpassed 2.3 million confirmed cases and 157,000 deaths. The repercussions of COVID-19 on the global economy and financial stability have already been keenly felt. The widespread implementation of quarantines, disruptions to daily routines, travel restrictions, work and school closures, and enforced social isolation have the potential to significantly impact mental health on a global scale.
Previous public health emergencies have been shown to impact mental health. Research indicates that psychological responses to past epidemics and pandemics are influenced by individual factors such as intolerance of uncertainty, perceived susceptibility to disease, and anxiety. In the current context, numerous uncertainties surround the origin, characteristics, governmental response capabilities, and severity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Additionally, skepticism towards the healthcare system's ability to manage new cases, concerns about contracting the virus, fear of mortality, heightened hygiene practices, avoidance behaviors, misinformation, and a lack of accurate information contribute to excessive fear, fostering an atmosphere of anxiety and depression that disrupts daily functioning, including sleep patterns. Quarantined individuals experience social isolation, potentially leading to feelings of loneliness and anger. The psychological impact of COVID-19 in China has been extensively documented, with a significant portion of the population reporting moderate to severe anxiety. Female healthcare workers, in particular, are experiencing elevated levels of anxiety and stress.
The significance of psychosocial factors in the development and persistence of Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) is widely acknowledged, particularly in individuals with masticatory muscle disorders. Additionally, there exists a notable correlation between painful TMD, depression, and anxiety. Psychological disturbances, prevalent in TMD patients, can be exacerbated during emergency situations such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, triggering a cascade of events leading to heightened sympathetic activity and increased release of adrenocortical steroids, resulting in muscle vasoconstriction and elevated peripheral vascular resistance. Autonomic stress responses can manifest as sensations of warmth and cold, palpitations, tachycardia, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation. These responses are believed to contribute to a state of system overload commonly observed in TMD patients. Autonomic dysfunction may further exacerbate sympathetic drive and hyperarousal sensations, perpetuating sleep disturbances. This cycle, if sustained, could play a crucial role in the maintenance of pain, particularly in individuals with psychological vulnerabilities. Consequently, the emergence of chronic orofacial pain symptoms post-pandemic, including TMD, is anticipated to mirror the patterns seen in posttraumatic stress syndrome.
The relationship between bruxism and psychological factors has been extensively studied, with previous research indicating that the severity of sleep bruxism is not necessarily linked to self-reported stress, depression, temporomandibular disorders (TMD), or TMD-related pain. However, a recent systematic review suggested that certain symptoms within the spectrum of anxiety disorders may be associated with probable sleep bruxism. On the other hand, awake bruxism appears to be influenced by psychosocial elements such as anxiety, stress, and challenges in emotional expression, which are as significant as physical causes in its development and persistence. Individuals experiencing high levels of stress are nearly six times more likely to exhibit awake bruxism. The sustained muscle tension in the head and neck region seen in awake bruxism may be linked to a defensive response associated with anxiety and stress, possibly reflecting a fight-or-flight reaction. The processes related to anxiety involve complex interactions within the central nervous system (CNS), including the prefrontal cortex, limbic and paralimbic structures (such as the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate gyrus), and motor regions of the brainstem, leading to motor and physiological responses not only to stress but also to heightened alertness and focus. Under normal circumstances, the prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in regulating behavior, thoughts, and emotions, including inhibiting inappropriate motor reactions. However, during periods of stress, the amygdala can activate pathways in the hypothalamus and brainstem, disrupting the regulation by the prefrontal cortex.
Furthermore, it is crucial to emphasize that additional long-term effects of COVID-19 may emerge in the future and warrant further investigation. Viral infections affecting the nervous system have been linked to conditions such as meningoencephalitis and neuropathies, as observed with herpesviruses, Zika virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Given that SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with central nervous system manifestations, potential outcomes such as neuropathic pain states could potentially manifest as long-term consequences of the ongoing pandemic.
In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to have significant implications for applied oral sciences in the coming years. It is anticipated that the psychological factors linked to the pandemic could increase the risk of developing, exacerbating, and prolonging conditions such as bruxism (particularly awake bruxism) and temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Orofacial pain specialists need to be cognizant of this potential impact. There are already guidelines available on the web for educating patients, promoting self-management, offering home care strategies, and teaching relaxation techniques. These resources can be valuable tools during periods of social isolation and when managing pain.
