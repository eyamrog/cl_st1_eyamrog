The Parque Nacional da Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is recognized as one of the world's largest urban forests, yet a systematic inventory of its herpetofauna is lacking. This study aimed to survey the amphibians and reptiles within the park to evaluate species composition, estimate species richness and abundance, and incorporate secondary data. Active searches were conducted for 460 hours from January 2013 to December 2015. Taxa endemic to the Atlantic Forest or Rio de Janeiro state were identified, and the conservation status of each species was cross-referenced with international, Brazilian, and state red lists. Species richness and sampling sufficiency were assessed using rarefaction curves and the Bootstrap richness estimator, while species abundance distribution was analyzed through Whittaker plots. A total of 3,288 individuals were recorded over 36 months, comprising 24 amphibian and 25 reptile species. The cumulative species curves, rarefaction, and richness estimates suggested adequate sampling effort. Species abundance followed the log-series model for both amphibians and reptiles. The top four amphibian species accounted for 70% of individuals, while the two most abundant reptiles represented 60% of the total. Incorporating secondary data increased the number of amphibian species to 38 and reptiles to 36. Around 80% of amphibian species and 28% of reptile species were endemic to the Atlantic Forest, with six amphibians endemic to Rio de Janeiro state. Six amphibian and one reptile species were classified as threatened, while two reptile species were exotic. The diverse herpetofauna of Parque Nacional da Tijuca, including endemic and threatened species, underscores the success of reforestation efforts in this protected area and underscores the importance of conservation efforts.
The Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome stands as one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, albeit now diminished to a mere 12% of its original extent due to centuries of relentless deforestation. Within this biome, approximately 625 amphibian species and 300 reptiles have been documented, with ongoing discoveries of new species. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, a total of 201 amphibian species, including 197 anurans and four caecilians, have been identified, alongside 149 reptile species. This region exhibits a notable level of endemism for both amphibians and reptiles, making its metropolitan area a crucial site for the preservation of Brazilian biodiversity.
The state capital, Rio de Janeiro, with a population exceeding six million inhabitants, encompasses one of the world's largest urban parks, the Parque Nacional da Tijuca (PNT), the sole Brazilian national park situated within an urban area. Similar to other coastal ranges in the Atlantic Forest domain, the Tijuca massif boasts a dense network of watercourses (Coelho Netto 2005), facilitating the presence of amphibians. However, during the 18th and 19th centuries, the forest in this region faced near-total destruction due to charcoal production, sugarcane, and coffee plantations (Rocha et al. 2003, Rocha 2017), leading to the drying up of many water sources supplying the city (Abreu & Rodrigues 2010, Rocha 2017). It is probable that remnants of forest persisted in the more inaccessible areas within the Tijuca massif, particularly the highest mountain peaks and steepest valleys (Coimbra-Filho et al. 1973). These forest fragments likely played a crucial role in providing native species seeds for subsequent reforestation efforts in the region (Coimbra-Filho et al. 1973, Abreu & Rodrigues 2010) and served as vital refuges for numerous local animal species (e.g., Rocha et al. 2003). The deforested areas once occupied by plantations were extensively reforested through a pioneering project - the world's first of its kind - involving the planting of 100,000 trees, initiated in the latter half of the 19th century during the Brazilian Empire era. This endeavor led to the establishment of a lush forest, eventually designated as a national park in 1961 (Brasil 1961).
Within the urban zone of Rio de Janeiro, aside from the Parque Nacional da Tijuca (PNT), two other significant parks exist - the Parque Estadual da Pedra Branca and the Parque Natural Municipal da Serra do Mendanha (PNM Serra do Mendanha). The PNT boasts a rich scientific history, having been frequented by naturalists in the 19th and 20th centuries. These early explorers documented various amphibian species found in the area, such as Aplastodiscus albofrenatus (Lutz, 1924), Dendrophryniscus brevipollicatus Jiménez de la Espada 1870, Ischnocnema guentheri (Steindachner, 1864), Ischnocnema octavioi (Bokermann, 1965), Phasmahyla guttata (Lutz, 1924), and Scinax trapicheiroi (A. Lutz and B. Lutz, 1954). Recent herpetofaunal studies in the park have delved into the ecology, natural history, and bioacoustics of various taxa, as evidenced by works such as Heyer 1973, Hepp & Carvalho-e-Silva 2011, Dorigo et al. 2014, Machado et al. 2016, Hepp et al. 2017, Silva-e-Souza 2019, and Guarabyra et al. 2020. While initial lists of amphibian species (Carvalho-e-Silva et al. 2008) and reptiles (Mocelin 2008) were compiled for the park's management plan (ICMBIO 2008), a comprehensive systematic inventory is yet to be completed. To address this gap, we conducted a thorough three-year inventory of the PNT's herpetofauna, employing intensive sampling techniques to determine species composition, richness, and abundance of amphibians and reptiles within the park. Our inventory was further enriched by incorporating occurrence records from herpetological collections and species reintroduction programs within the PNT.
The Parque Nacional da Tijuca (22º55’–23º00’ S, 43º11’–43º19’ W) is situated within the Tijuca massif in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro in southeastern Brazil. Encompassing a total area of 3,958.38 hectares, the park is characterized by dense ombrophilous forest spanning altitudes ranging from 80 m to 1,021 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Officially, the park is segmented into four sectors as designated by ICMBIO in 2008: Sector A – the Tijuca Forest, Sector B – the Carioca Mountains, Sector C – Pedra Bonita/Pedra da Gávea, and Sector D – Pretos-Forros/Covanca (refer to Figure 1). The park's landscape showcases a variety of land uses and vegetation cover, including forests in different stages of succession, open fields, rocky outcrops, and man-made structures like buildings and roads, as noted by Coelho Netto in 2005.
The climate in this region falls under the Aw type (humid tropical) according to the Köppen classification, characterized by heavy rainfall in the austral summer and drier conditions in the winter. Average monthly temperatures vary from 25°C in February to 19°C in June, with an annual mean temperature of around 22°C. Annual precipitation levels usually range between 2,000 and 2,500 mm, but in particularly wet years, it can reach up to 3,300 mm (Coelho Netto, 2005; ICMBIO, 2008).
During a 36-month period spanning from January 2013 to December 2015, we conducted surveys for amphibians and reptiles in Sector A of the park, focusing on altitudes ranging from 400 m to 800 m above sea level. Employing the Visual Encounter Survey (VES) method developed by Crump & Scott (1994), our efforts amounted to a total of 460 person-hours, evenly split between diurnal and nocturnal searches, with two researchers systematically exploring microhabitats like streams, ponds, bromeliads, leaf litter, tree trunks, and rocks. To prevent resampling and ensure data independence, searches proceeded in a single direction. All encountered individuals were captured, identified, and released at the capture site, with voucher specimens deposited in the herpetological collection of the Museu Nacional (MNRJ) at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (voucher number in Appendix 1). Supplementing our findings were secondary records from herpetological collections (Appendix 2) and a faunal reintroduction project for the PNT. Following Frost's (2020) nomenclature for amphibians and Costa and Bérnils (2018) for reptiles, updated as needed with references from Poe et al. (2017) and Hoogmoed et al. (2019).
Rarefaction curves and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the moment-based estimator of species richness (Colwell et al., 2004) to assess the sampling effort in terms of species recorded for both amphibians and reptiles. Each hour of Visual Encounter Surveys (VES) served as a sampling unit, resulting in a total of 460 samples collected throughout the study. The convergence of confidence intervals to zero was considered indicative of adequate sampling effort (Colwell et al., 2004). Additionally, species richness and standard deviation were estimated using the Bootstrap richness estimator (Smith & van Belle, 1984) with 1,000 runs. Both rarefaction curves and Bootstrap analyses were conducted in EstimateS 8.2.0 (Colwell, 2009). The distribution of species abundance was further examined through rank abundance curves or Whittaker plots (Whittaker, 1965), illustrating the ranked log abundance of each species (Krebs, 1999). These plots were analyzed using PAST 2.17 (Hammer et al., 2001).
Species endemism in the Atlantic Forest for amphibians was determined by referencing Lingnau et al. (2008), Haddad et al. (2016), and Frost (2020), while for reptiles, it was based on the study by Tozetti et al. (2017). The conservation status of each species was assessed using the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2020), the Red List of Threatened Brazilian Fauna (ICMBIO 2018), and the List of Threatened Fauna of Rio de Janeiro state (Bergallo et al. 2000). Population trends for each species were sourced from the IUCN (2020).
A total of 74 species of herpetofauna were recorded at the PNT, encompassing 38 amphibians (37 anurans and one caecilian) and 36 reptiles (three chelonians, one amphisbaenian, nine lizards, and 23 snakes). The amphibian family Hylidae exhibited the highest species richness with 10 species, followed by Brachycephalidae and Cycloramphidae with five species each. Except for Gymnophthalmidae, which had two species, all lizard families were represented by a single species. The snake family Dipsadidae had 14 species, while Colubridae had five. Over the 36-month study period in Sector A of the Parque Nacional da Tijuca, a total of 3,288 individuals were recorded, comprising 49 species. The majority (3,174) were amphibians, belonging to 24 species of Anura and Gymnophiona. Reptiles, on the other hand, were represented by 114 individuals across 25 species, distributed in Chelonia and Squamata. Two amphibian species and 11 reptiles were opportunistically recorded during the study period, not during standardized surveys.
The cumulative curve depicting amphibian species reached its asymptote after 213 hours of sampling, revealing a total richness of 22 species. In contrast, the curve for reptiles reached its asymptote at 276 hours, identifying a total of 14 species, all within a total sampling effort of 460 hours (see Figure 8). While the confidence intervals of the rarefaction curves for amphibians converged to zero, indicating a high level of precision, the same was not observed for reptiles, with an estimated error of 2.3 species (Figure 8). The species richness estimated through the Bootstrap procedure closely mirrored that obtained by the VES method for both amphibians (estimated richness = 22.4 species) and reptiles (estimated richness = 15.6 species).
The Whittaker plots (Figure 9) unveiled significant variation in the abundance of amphibian and reptilian species, which was best described by the log-series model. Among amphibians, the most prevalent species included Ischnocnema parva (N = 617 records; 19.4% of all amphibians), Hylodes nasus (N = 601; 18.9%), Ischnocnema guentheri (N = 544; 17.1%), and Crossodactylus gaudichaudii (N = 500; 15.8%) (Table 1). In terms of reptiles, the dominant species were the lizards Enyalius brasiliensis (N = 55; 48.2% of all reptiles) and Ecpleopus gaudichaudii (N = 15; 13.2%), collectively representing 61.4% of all reptiles observed during the surveys (Table 2). The most abundant snakes included Bothrops jararacussu (N = 8; 7.0% of all reptiles), Thamnodynastes cf. nattereri (N = 7; 6.1%), and Bothrops jararaca (N = 6; 5.3%).
Approximately 80% of the amphibian species and 28% of the reptile species documented in the PNT are exclusive to the Atlantic Forest biome, as indicated in Tables 1 and 2. Notably, six of these amphibians, namely Aplastodiscus albofrenatus, Dendrophryniscus brevipollicatus, Euparkerella brasiliensis, Hylodes nasus, Ischnocnema guentheri, and Scinax trapicheiroi, are specifically endemic to Rio de Janeiro. The majority of these species, both amphibians and reptiles, are classified as Least Concern or Not Threatened across international, Brazilian, and state conservation status lists. However, six amphibian and one reptile species within the PNT are categorized under various levels of extinction threat. Furthermore, it is concerning that populations of 15 amphibian species are believed to be in decline, as outlined in Table 1. Notably, two reptile species, the lizard Hemidactylus mabouia and the chelonian Trachemys scripta, are identified as exotic within the PNT, as detailed in Table 2.
The findings of this study reveal that the forests within the PNT play host to a significant portion of the herpetofaunal diversity found in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro. Combining data collected during fieldwork with secondary sources, it is estimated that the park is home to a minimum of 38 amphibian species, constituting 19% of the known amphibian species in the state (N = 201 species; Dorigo et al. 2018), 6% of those in the Atlantic Rainforest (N = 600; Rossa-Feres et al. 2017), and 3% of Brazil's total amphibian fauna (N = 1,136; Segalla et al. 2019). Additionally, a total of 36 reptile species have been identified in the PNT, representing 24% of the reptile species in Rio de Janeiro (N = 149; Oliveira et al. 2020), 12% of those in the Atlantic Rainforest (N = 300; Tozetti et al. 2017), and 4% of the country's reptilian diversity (N = 795 species; Costa & Bérnils 2018). The data, both primary and secondary, suggest that the number of amphibian and reptile species documented in the PNT aligns well with expectations given the area sampled and the effort expended. Notably, the cumulative species curves for both amphibians and reptiles reached an asymptote midway through the study period, indicating sufficient sampling effort. Furthermore, while the confidence intervals of the rarefaction curves for amphibians approached zero, signifying adequate sampling, those for reptiles neared convergence with reduced estimated error.
The findings of the present study, when compared with the PNM Serra do Mendanha, another significant remnant of dense rainforest in the urban zone of Rio de Janeiro with available systematic medium-term data, are largely consistent. Pontes et al. (2015) documented 45 amphibian and 39 reptile species at PNM Serra do Mendanha, figures closely resembling the 38 amphibians and 36 reptiles we observed at PNT. The amphibian species richness noted in PNT also stands out in contrast to other forested areas in Rio de Janeiro where data is accessible (Table 3). Although species richness varies significantly across sites, it is probable that much of this fluctuation is linked to differences in survey techniques, sampling intensity, and the duration of the study period (Table 3).
The reptilian species richness documented within the PNT surpassed that of other Atlantic Forest remnants in Rio de Janeiro, as evidenced by both short-term studies such as those conducted at Morro São João, Casimiro de Abreu (N = 9 species; Almeida-Gomes et al. 2008), and medium-term studies like the one at Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu (N = 37 species; Almeida-Gomes et al. 2014a). Even the short-term investigation by Vrcibradic et al. (2011) at the Estação Ecológica Estadual do Paraíso revealed a total of 29 species when incorporating secondary data.
Hylidae, comprising 10 species, emerged as the most diverse amphibian family within the PNT, closely followed by Brachycephalidae and Cycloramphidae, each with five species. This prevalence of hylids within the amphibian community is a recurring pattern observed not only in various Atlantic Forest locations (Heyer et al., 1990; Almeida-Gomes et al., 2014a; Silva et al., 2017) but also in other Neotropical regions (Toft & Duellman, 1979; Duellman, 1988; Menin et al., 2017). The notable richness of hylids in South America is attributed to the region being recognized as the epicenter for the origin and diversification of this particular clade (Wiens et al., 2006).
With 14 species, Dipsadidae emerged as the most diverse reptilian family within the PNT, aligning with the prevalent trend observed for Squamata in Atlantic Forest remnants within Rio de Janeiro (e.g., Pontes et al. 2009, Rocha et al. 2018, Martins et al. 2019). The Dipsadidae family, extensively distributed across the Americas and West Indies (Hedges et al. 2009, Zaher et al. 2009, Grazziotin et al. 2012), encompasses the majority of Neotropical snakes, boasting over 700 species (refer to Uetz et al. 2019).
The PNT and the PNM Serra do Mendanha (Pontes et al., 2015) exhibited a shared presence of 25 amphibian species (Sørensen index of similarity = 0.6; Magurran & McGill, 2011) and 29 reptiles (= 0.8). Notably, 13 amphibian species were exclusive to the PNT, while 27 were exclusive to the Serra do Mendanha. Similarly, seven species of reptiles were exclusive to PNT and ten to the Serra do Mendanha. The similarities observed in the herpetofauna between these regions could be attributed, at least in part, to their historical connection as part of a single continuous forest. This resemblance may also reflect the success of the reforestation efforts on the Tijuca massif during the 19th century (Rocha et al., 2003; Rocha, 2017). Nevertheless, the presence of distinct fauna in both areas underscores the significance of conserving both forests to safeguard the herpetofauna of the Atlantic Forest as a whole.
The relative abundance of both amphibian and reptilian species in the PNT was modeled according to a log-series pattern, which is typical of communities with medium diversity and demonstrates a certain equilibrium between rare and dominant species (Magurran & McGill, 2011). Within this model, most species are relatively rare compared to the more abundant taxa (Magurran, 2004). The four most prevalent amphibian species in the park, namely I. parva, H. nasus, I. guentheri, and C. gaudichaudii, accounted for approximately 70% of all amphibian records. The genus Ischnocnema, part of the superfamily Brachycephaloidea (as per Padial et al., 2014), lays its eggs on the moist forest floor and undergoes direct development, eliminating the need for water bodies for breeding and growth (Haddad & Prado, 2005; Pombal & Haddad, 2007). Species with direct development tend to dominate leaf litter-dwelling anuran communities in Neotropical rainforests (e.g., Crump, 1971; Allmon, 1991; Donnelly, 1994; Rocha et al., 2001; Siqueira et al., 2014). The two most abundant frog species found in the PNT, Hylodes nasus and C. gaudichaudii, are typically associated with streams. Hylodidae species are commonly abundant in small streams within preserved areas of the Atlantic Rainforest (e.g., Weygoldt, 1989; Patto & Pie, 2001; Almeida-Gomes et al., 2008; Siqueira et al., 2011b).
The most prevalent reptiles in the PNT were Enyalius brasiliensis and Ecpleopus gaudichaudii, constituting approximately 60% of the total reptilian abundance documented in this study. Enyalius brasiliensis, known for its preference for forested habitats, exhibited relatively higher abundance in the area compared to other forest remnants in Rio de Janeiro, as evidenced by previous short-term (Morro São João; Almeida-Gomes et al. 2008) or mid-term studies (Guapiaçu Ecological Reserve; Almeida-Gomes & Rocha 2014a). Ecpleopus gaudichaudii, a Gymnophtalmidae species endemic to the Atlantic Forest, is a significant presence in local leaf-litter reptile communities, as highlighted in studies such as Dixo & Verdade 2006, Almeida-Gomes & Rocha 2014a, and Cruz et al. 2014.
During our surveys, two out of the three most abundant snakes observed belonged to the Viperidae family, specifically B. jararaca and B. jararacussu, which are frequently found in mainland Atlantic Forest regions (Marques & Sazima, 2004; Pontes et al., 2009). Additionally, the Dipsadidae Thamnodynastes cf. nattereri ranked as the second most prevalent snake in the PNT area and was similarly abundant in the PNM Serra do Mendanha (Pontes et al., 2009).
Approximately 80% of the amphibian species documented in the PNT are endemic to the Atlantic Forest, a result that aligns with the biome's known high levels of amphibian endemism. In contrast, only 28% of the reptilian species recorded exhibit endemism to the Atlantic Forest, a pattern consistent with expectations for this group. Notably, six of the amphibians are recognized as endemic to the state of Rio de Janeiro, with two, H. nasus and I. guentheri, specifically endemic to the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Hylodes nasus, known to inhabit the forests of this municipality, has been exclusively documented in the PNT and the PNM Serra do Mendanha. However, Canedo's analysis of specimens potentially linked to H. nasus, collected in Volta Redonda, Rio de Janeiro, and Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Espírito Santo, suggests the need for further research to confirm taxonomic identity. Ischnocnema guentheri is currently viewed as a species complex, with Gehara et al. (2013) identifying I. guentheri sensu stricto as a lineage confined to the PNT based on genetic and bioacoustic data, although its presence in neighboring regions is probable.
Overall, only six species documented in the PNT (Allobates olfersioides, Cycloramphus eleutherodactylus, Scinax trapicheiroi, Thoropa lutzi, Vitreorana eurygnatha, and V. uranoscopa) are identified as facing some level of extinction threat (Bergallo et al. 2000, ICMBIO 2018, IUCN 2020), with populations of 15 species believed to be in decline (IUCN 2020). Among these six species, only S. trapicheiroi was observed during our field surveys. Despite being classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN due to its significantly reduced range of less than 20,000 km2 (Rodrigues & Carvalho-e-Silva 2004), S. trapicheiroi is categorized as Least Concern in the Brazilian red list (ICMBIO 2018). Verdade and Rodrigues (2007) merged three geographically widespread populations under the synonymy of Allobates olfersioides (Lutz, 1925): A. alagoanus (Bokermann, 1967), A. capixaba (Bokermann, 1967), and A. carioca (Bokermann, 1967). A. olfersioides is distributed extensively along the eastern coast of Brazil, spanning from Rio de Janeiro to Alagoas, a distance of 2,000 km to the north. However, Haddad et al. (2013) still consider these isolated populations as distinct species: A. olfersioides in Rio de Janeiro, A. capixaba in Espírito Santo, and A. alagoanus in Alagoas. The determination of whether these populations represent separate species or lineages of the same species is crucial (Forti et al. 2017). In their evaluation of the conservation status of this amphibian, Haddad et al. (2016) only recognized A. carioca as a synonym of A. olfersioides, limiting the species' range to the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro. Consequently, the reduction in the taxon's range to around 7,730 km², the absence of recent records from certain areas, including the PNT, in the last three decades, and the deterioration of habitat quality during this period have led to the classification of this species as Vulnerable in both the Brazilian red list (ICMBIO 2018) and the IUCN list (2020).
Thoropa lutzi is classified as Endangered by the IUCN (2020) but as Data Deficient in Brazil (ICMBIO 2018). This species is known to occur only in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo. Populations have not been observed in Rio de Janeiro over the past 30 years, including PNT (Sabbag et al. 2018). The other three species, Cycloramphus eleutherodactylus, Vitreorana eurygnatha, and V. uranoscopa, are listed only at the state level (Bergallo et al. 2000) as Presumably Threatened, and only C. eleutherodactylus is listed by the IUCN (2020) as Data Deficient. Cycloramphus eleutherodactylus is known to occur in the Brazilian states of Paraná, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais (Rossa-Feres et al. 2017, Santos-Pereira et al. 2018), although some studies have reported its disappearance by the beginning of the 20th century (Izecksohn & Carvalho-e-Silva 2001, Eterovick et al. 2005). We did not collect C. eleutherodactylus during fieldwork, and it has not been found at PNT since 1972 (Matos 2011). Nevertheless, Lima et al. (2012) concluded that this species may be relatively abundant in some cave environments and emphasized the importance of including these habitats in amphibian inventories.
Species of the Hylodidae family, belonging to the genera Crossodactylus, Hylodes, and Megaelosia, are rheophilic and endemic to the Atlantic Forest, as noted by Laia and Rocha (2012). Typically inhabiting well-preserved forest fragments, these species, as highlighted by Santos-Pereira et al. (2016) and Malagoli et al. (2017), rely heavily on streams throughout their life cycle, encompassing eggs, tadpoles, and adults, rendering them highly susceptible to the degradation of riparian forest areas (Almeida-Gomes et al. 2014b). Given their strong association with this specific habitat, these anurans play a crucial role in conservation efforts, as their habitat is usually confined to water courses, representing a small fraction of the overall forest area and thereby increasing their vulnerability to extinction (Almeida-Gomes et al. 2014b).
In the current study, only one reptile, the tortoise Chelonoidis denticulatus, is identified as facing a potential risk of extinction, classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN (2020), although it holds a Least Concern status in Brazil (ICMBIO 2018). The presence of Chelonoidis denticulatus was first documented in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro in 1820 by Prince Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied, who discovered carapaces of this species on the sandy plains in the northern region of Cabo Frio municipality (Vanzolini 1994, Vargas-Ramírez et al. 2010, Vanzolini & Myers 2015). Despite its initial sighting in the Atlantic Forest, C. denticulatus seems to have been eradicated from the forests of eastern Brazil subsequently (Vanzolini & Myers 2015). Efforts are currently underway to reintroduce this species into the PNT through the Refauna Project (Refauna 2019).
An unresolved question pertains to the historical presence of the tortoise species Chelonoidis carbonarius in Rio de Janeiro. Initially documented by Spix (1824) based on specimens from the Amazon River area, subsequent works by Pritchard and Trebbau (1984), Vanzolini (1994), Ernst and Leuteritz (1999), and Vargas-Ramírez et al. (2010) outlined the species' distribution in Brazil, notably highlighting its absence in Rio de Janeiro. Despite conflicting reports suggesting the presence (e.g., Rocha et al. 2004, Köhler 2008) or potential occurrence (Tozetti et al. 2017) of C. carbonarius in Rio de Janeiro, it remains challenging to ascertain whether this region was part of the species' original range or if its presence (if verified) is a result of intentional release of captive animals into the wild for either pet trade or consumption purposes.
Two species of the herpetofauna documented in the PNT, Hemidactylus mabouia and Trachemys scripta, are considered exotic invaders. H. mabouia, commonly known as the house gecko, was initially introduced to Brazil from Africa during the colonial era and has since significantly expanded its distribution within the country's natural environments (Rocha & Bergallo, 2011; Telles et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2016; Winck et al., 2017). Hemidactylus mabouia has been sighted in the urbanized areas of the PNT, a pattern consistent with its presence in other regions (Rocha et al., 2011; Oliveira et al., 2016). The proximity of this lizard to the park's natural habitats necessitates particular attention due to the potential invasiveness of the species (Rocha et al., 2011).
The pond slider, Trachemys scripta, originally native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, has seen a significant increase in numbers in the United States since the 1970s due to being raised for the pet trade. This surge has led to the species being introduced to various locations worldwide. The presence of T. scripta in natural habitats has been linked to detrimental effects on native freshwater turtle populations. Within the PNT, T. scripta has been observed in disturbed areas, likely due to intentional releases of pet-raised animals. The establishment of a sustainable population of this exotic species in the state of Rio de Janeiro remains uncertain. (Ramsay et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2011; Cadi & Joly 2004, Hidalgo-Vila et al. 2009; Oliveira et al. 2020).
Several amphibian and reptile species of interest are found in the PNT, including endemics to the Atlantic Forest or Rio de Janeiro state and/or municipality, those facing extinction threats, and those experiencing population declines. The presence of these taxa underscores the park's significance in conserving the region's herpetofauna. The substantial diversity of reptiles and amphibians in the PNT also reflects the success of its reforestation program, offering a crucial sanctuary for species from both groups. Our inventory results, documenting a total of 74 species, represent the first comprehensive published overview of the composition and abundance of the herpetofauna in the Parque Nacional da Tijuca.
