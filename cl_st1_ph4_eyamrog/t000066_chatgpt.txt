This paper delves into the fundamental principles of play, collaboration, and agency that underpin the online workshops conducted by the Global Play Brigade (GPB), an international collective of activists from diverse backgrounds who united to combat the multifaceted global crisis precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. To illustrate a segment of the theoretical and methodological framework guiding the initiative, this paper will outline the workshop's structure, objectives, and a specific session, drawing on insights from Spinoza, Vygotsky, Freire, and other scholars to elucidate how individuals can be mobilized towards effecting social change. Recognizing the complexity of the current upheaval, the GPB endeavors to establish environments where creativity and critical thinking can foster emotional resilience, personal growth, optimism, and proactive engagement.
The year 2020 marked a significant turning point in human history, not solely due to the global impact of the coronavirus pandemic but also in shedding light on enduring social inequalities that continue to plague societies. This crisis underscored the fragility of our achievements thus far in safeguarding against various existential threats. It has become increasingly apparent that combating pervasive forces like racism, exploitation, violence, and prejudice is imperative. Urgent action is required to advocate for the well-being of our planet and to reassess the manner in which we navigate our roles as inhabitants (Krenak, 2020).
The motivation behind the Global Play Brigade (GPB) was driven by the necessity to address the increasing need for connection and support during the global pandemic. Artists, improvisers, educators, musicians, clowns, therapists, and activists from nearly 40 countries came together to offer free online workshops to individuals worldwide. With the advent of platforms like ZOOM, WhatsApp, and Facebook in March 2020, these activists, known as Brigadiers, established a website featuring a wide array of activities aimed at those grappling with the challenges of social distancing and seeking engagement with the themes being addressed.
Since its inception, the GPB has conducted complimentary Play and Talk workshops in various languages and across different time zones globally. Aligned with the GPB Mission, these sessions provide individuals with an opportunity to engage in play, improvisation, personal development, and collaborative storytelling. This platform serves as a space for participants to both share their own narratives and actively listen to others, fostering a sense of community during times of crisis. Catering to a diverse audience ranging from children to adults, the GPB has endeavored to connect with individuals virtually, compensating for the lack of physical interaction. Through these workshops, the organization aims to facilitate experiences of joy, introspection, creativity, and emotional connection through play, with a dual focus on immediate impact and long-term transformation.
In Brazil, this occurred with the establishment of group Brincadas2, an initiative that was launched by the LACE Research Group when their leader, Fernanda Liberali, joined the GPB. Brincadas swiftly evolved into a Brazilian community that not only offered support to educators, principals, coordinators, parents, and students within school settings but also extended aid in the form of food, medicine, and conversations to those in need. The group further engaged in various intervention activities through national campaigns and international collaborations, including the donation of masks and other personal protective gear to healthcare professionals who were combating the challenges of COVID-19 without adequate government support at the time.
The actions of the LACE Research Group are rooted in the principles of Applied Linguistics (AL), a field of study that challenges societal norms through language and its role in shaping human identity and social interactions. It is essential for AL research to adopt a critical perspective on social issues, establishing connections with various disciplines such as Education, Psychology, Sociology, and Philosophy (Moita Lopes, 2006). The goal of AL is to integrate new discourses and methods to construct reality through diverse modes of expression, emotion, and behavior, essentially defining one's existence in the world. Furthermore, LACE subscribes to a socio-historical-cultural approach within a Vygotskian framework, a topic that will be explored further in this paper.
In this particular situation, two professors from Brazilian Higher Education, affiliated with the LACE Research Group, became Brigadiers in the GPB and organized a workshop for their college students. The aim was to provide a platform for students to enhance their English language abilities and engage with professionals from various countries. Participants were encouraged to explore opportunities for global collaboration, taking into account the ongoing crisis that was affecting everyone in different ways. The workshop took place in July via ZOOM, attracting approximately fifteen attendees who interacted, shared personal and professional anecdotes, and engaged in discussions for an hour.
This paper aims to explore theoretical and practical concepts crucial to the GPB session, specifically collaboration and play. Collaboration, as rooted in Critical Collaborative Research (Magalhães & Fidalgo, 2019), emphasizes co-authorship and co-construction among all participants engaged in an activity. During the play session, participants collaborated by sharing their experiences, engaging with available resources, and recognizing the significance of diversity within the group for collective development.
Play, a concept highlighted by Vygotsky (2001) and Holzman (2009), is integral to this discourse as it involves participants engaging with rules, navigating the unknown within an online setting, and exercising agency amidst conflicts that arise during the session. This paper delves into how these principles manifest in participants' experiences, mirroring the intentions outlined in the workshop plan and subsequently referenced by participants at specific junctures in the session. By correlating these concepts with select testimonials, it becomes apparent that play serves as a potent intervention tool, enabling the realization of what Freire (1970) envisioned as the potential to transform reality into the viable yet unexplored.
Embedded within the core principles of the Global Play Brigade (GPB) is the notion that play serves as a catalyst for social change across a wide spectrum. Through participation in workshops, individuals not only share their personal experiences but also broaden their perspectives to encompass a global outlook, facilitated by the creativity and connections fostered during these sessions (Vygotsky, 2004). The act of playing and engaging in dialogue within the GPB framework serves as a platform for hope, emotional sustenance, and personal growth, enabling participants to explore possibilities beyond their immediate crises. This community-driven approach within the GPB aims to provide avenues for questioning, envisioning, and constructing new realities in response to the dehumanization of individuals and the degradation of ecosystems.
Following the GPB launch on June 8, 2020, workshops were initiated, allowing Brigadiers to participate in weekly meetings where they could share ideas, engage in improvisational games, utilize play and performance tools, and partake in social therapy sessions. These sessions aimed to foster emotional growth and provide support for the activities outlined on the GPB website. Within these gatherings, Brigadiers had the opportunity to collaborate with one another, discussing and planning sessions they intended to lead. In a particular meeting, two Brigadiers, who were English professors at government-owned colleges in São Paulo, Brazil, decided to collaborate with a colleague from the same institution to host a workshop titled "Global Collaboration: What can young professionals do?"
The decision to host the workshop was made in July 2020, following a challenging semester where students in disciplines like Logistics, Human Resources, Commercial Management, Systems Analysis, and Business struggled to grasp the significant changes in their course routines amidst the uncertainty of the job market. The workshop aimed to assist participants in addressing their apprehensions about speaking English online to unfamiliar individuals and to explore global strategies for navigating the crisis. The goal was to encourage participants to engage critically with diverse perspectives, form their own opinions, and collaborate in any capacity possible.
The three Brazilian professors organizing the workshop extended invitations to young professionals from various fields to participate as guests. Among these invitees were individuals residing overseas, enabling them to provide authentic insights into the workshop's central query: "What can young professionals do?" Meanwhile, the remaining participants, predominantly college students at an intermediate level of English proficiency, were slated to engage in a play session. This activity promised a departure from their conventional classroom learning environment, offering greater autonomy and the opportunity to embrace risks within their language practice.
The context preceding the workshop is inherently collaborative, involving individuals working together and providing mutual support. This collaborative setting necessitates trust and commitment from all parties involved in order to achieve a shared goal. These attributes align with the philosophical concept put forth by Spinoza (2003, IV, p. 9), which suggests that when two individuals of similar nature come together, they create a synergy that is twice as potent as each individual on their own. Embracing a collaborative perspective entails actively engaging with others to discover common ground that enhances the potential for collective and individual growth. It involves finding ways to interact that foster both group cohesion and personal development.
In the Critical Collaborative Research (PCcol) perspective (Magalhães, 2009), this movement is perceived as an intervention in practice, where the participants actively contribute to knowledge production. PCcol emphasizes voluntary engagement, fosters critical participation, and incorporates diverse voices into the research setting. The presence of multiple voices in collaboration sparks contradictions and tensions, which are crucial for stimulating critical reflection and potential transformations within the context. The conflicts that arise in social relations can be rationalized through language, which is a central focus in AL studies. This collaborative viewpoint underscores an involved approach through collective effort, formed by the combined contributions of all participants.
In light of these considerations, the workshop was structured in alignment with guidelines established by the GPB community. These guidelines served as a framework for the organization and execution of the workshop, ensuring that it adhered to established best practices within the field. By following these guidelines, the workshop aimed to optimize its effectiveness and relevance to the community it served.
The initial musical piece performed at the commencement of the event was a captivating and melodious composition that set the tone for the rest of the evening. The opening song, with its intricate harmonies and dynamic rhythm, immediately captured the attention of the audience and created a sense of anticipation for what was to follow. The skilled musicians delivered a flawless performance, showcasing their talent and expertise in a way that left a lasting impression on all those in attendance. The choice of this particular piece as the opener was a strategic one, as it effectively engaged the audience and established a strong connection between the performers and the listeners. Overall, the opening song served as a perfect introduction to the event, leaving a lasting impact on the audience and setting the stage for an evening filled with exceptional musical performances.
Greetings, the opening script of the GPB and a brief orientation to ZOOM tools.
During the Play/Talk session, participants engaged in a series of interactive activities designed to facilitate communication and collaboration. The session began with a brief introduction outlining the objectives and structure of the activities. Participants were then divided into small groups to work on specific tasks that required both verbal communication and problem-solving skills. Throughout the session, facilitators encouraged active participation and provided guidance when needed. The Play/Talk session concluded with a debriefing where participants reflected on their experiences and shared insights gained from the activities. Overall, the Play/Talk session proved to be an effective method for promoting communication and teamwork among participants.
Thank you for considering the request to enhance the writing of the following passage in the research article to align with the accepted standards of English for Academic Purposes. Your assistance in improving the clarity and coherence of the text is greatly appreciated. Looking forward to the revised version. Best regards.
The final musical piece performed at the end of the concert was a captivating and emotionally charged composition. The closing song, a poignant ballad, resonated with the audience, eliciting a range of emotions from nostalgia to hope. The haunting melody, coupled with the powerful lyrics, created a sense of unity among the listeners, drawing them closer together in a shared experience of music. As the last notes faded away, there was a collective sigh of appreciation from the audience, signaling the end of a truly memorable performance. The closing song served as a fitting conclusion to the evening, leaving a lasting impression on all those in attendance.
For this particular workshop, the facilitators opted to conduct a play and talk session to create a more conducive environment for participants to engage in English across various contexts, as opposed to a traditional one-hour lecture, which deviates from the Good Practice Benchmark (GPB). Despite this intention, there was a possibility of a lecture occurring due to the learners' apprehensions, given their lack of familiarity with conversing in English with unfamiliar individuals. The workshop comprised five interlinked activities centered around play and conversation, aiming to incorporate fundamental principles like collaboration, affect, and agency within the discussions and interactions during the play sessions.
This workshop approach takes into account the various multimodal resources offered by ZOOM, facilitating interactions among participants through audio, video, and written chat. Drawing on Vygotsky's (2004) work, the facilitator's intentionality is emphasized in creating a collaborative learning environment, where they play a crucial role in organizing resources to stimulate engagement. During this particular session, the facilitators, who were the professors leading the workshop, focused on promoting participation through play and dialogue as the primary forms of engagement.
Facilitators structured the activities in a specific sequence, including the opening and closing songs, and ensured that play and discussions were directly linked to the theme of global collaboration. This approach aimed to enable the young professionals attending the workshop to connect their personal experiences to the discussions and potentially interact with others during and beyond the workshop, fostering the generation of innovative ideas to enhance their ability to take action. The overarching goal was to establish an environment where the group could enhance their conatus, as referenced by Spinoza (2003, III, Prop. VII), which denotes the inherent potential to enhance and cultivate one's existence.
In this section of the paper, we will describe the workshop and discuss some of the activities included to exemplify the theoretical and practical concepts of collaboration and play. Figure 1 displays the poster used on the GPB website to promote the workshop in June 2020.
The poster (Figure 1) displays the names of the three professors who organized and facilitated the workshop, along with the professionals they invited to participate as guests. A total of eight professionals attended, hailing from Brazil, the USA, and Ireland during the workshop. Among them, one was Kenyan, three were Brazilians residing abroad, and four were Brazilians from various regions within the country. Due to the workshop's international nature and its accessibility to subscribers via the GPB website, English was the designated language for communication. The subsequent sections will delve into the activities conducted and analyzed during the workshop.
The initial activity, known as "Find someone who," was designed to encourage participants to identify the guests and introduce themselves by engaging in questioning to foster mutual acquaintance. The primary goal of this exercise was to underscore the multifaceted nature of language use beyond mere information retrieval. It served as a platform for initiating conversations with strangers, establishing connections through non-verbal cues like eye contact and facial expressions, and honing the skill of selecting appropriate words to facilitate deeper interpersonal understanding and foster comfort in unfamiliar social settings. To achieve this objective, facilitators organized participants into three separate breakout rooms and furnished them with a reference table containing the job titles, cities, and countries of the guests (refer to Figure 2). Armed with this data, participants were tasked with formulating impromptu questions to deduce the identities of their fellow room occupants before the designated time for the activity elapsed.
Upon returning to the main room, participants engaged in discussions regarding the identities of the guests they had encountered and shared additional insights they had gathered. Concurrently, facilitators prompted select guests to articulate their perspectives on the topic of global collaboration, specifically focusing on the potential contributions of young professionals. This exercise aimed to expand the discourse on strategies for manifesting ideas into tangible outcomes through diverse modes of expression, emotion, action, and existence within the global context.
The collaborative perspective (Magalhães & Fidalgo, 2019) of the workshop emphasized its virtual nature, specifically as an online meeting. Participants in such meetings must navigate various constraints, including time management, negotiating rules to achieve activity goals, active listening, sharing, and seeking information, necessitating strategies beyond just the English language to facilitate interaction. This dynamic unfolded initially in breakout rooms and later in the general session. The icebreaker activity served as a crucial introduction, setting the stage for subsequent discussions and information sharing. It also underscored the significance of collective effort in deriving meaning from the activity.
In this context, Marx (1980, XVI, p. 378) elucidates the significance of collective labor by asserting that the worker transcends the confines of their individuality and cultivates the potential of their species. Engaging in social interactions within a particular task propels individuals towards a shared objective, thereby augmenting their efficacy in action and facilitating superior outcomes compared to individual efforts (Spinoza, 2003).
The Vygotskian perspective, emphasizing the role of others in one's actions, was evident in this activity, emphasizing collaboration as a platform for knowledge co-construction. It is crucial to note that roles played do not adhere to a hierarchy (Magalhães & Fidalgo, 2019), fostering increased interdependence and shared responsibility in pursuit of a common goal, essential for successful collaborative work.
In the second activity, known as "What’s true about me," facilitators aimed to provide all participants, not just the guests, with an opportunity to share personal information. In this activity, all participants were asked to turn off their cameras and listen to a general fact about one of them, for example, "What’s true about me is that I like to wake up late." Those for whom the statement was true would then reveal their cameras, allowing them to identify others who shared a common trait. Through several rounds of this activity, participants gradually gained confidence in connecting with each other by recognizing both their differences and similarities.
Initially, this seemingly simplistic activity may appear as mere entertainment, yet it serves as a catalyst for participants to establish connections with one another based on their preferences and behaviors. This interaction provides them with the opportunity to recognize the omnipresence of diversity and to contemplate the various sentiments individuals may harbor towards it. Essentially, it enables participants to acknowledge that, despite potential conflicts, there exists a shared humanity among us, characterized by a mutual desire for respect. From this vantage point, play emerges as a potent tool for instigating revolutionary change (Newman & Holzman, 2002), prompting individuals to engage in introspection regarding both themselves and others as they navigate their personal evolution (Liberali, 2019).
This activity provided participants with an opportunity to freely share personal facts with the group and respond to others' facts by revealing their camera. This gesture, or lack thereof, effectively communicated messages such as "I relate to you" or "I do not identify with that behavior." Through this process, participants were exposed to various personal traits, allowing them to explore their own reactions and how these emotions contributed to their subjectivity, which they then shared with others (Sawaia, 2018).
During the third activity, facilitators encouraged participants to pose additional questions to individuals they found intriguing or to provide feedback on any topic covered during the workshop. Attendees were also given the opportunity to elaborate on how they were fostering collaboration with others in their respective professional environments amidst the pandemic. An example of the discussions that took place during this session is provided in Excerpt 1, which features a guest testimonial.
We have transitioned to online teaching, however, a significant portion of my students are facing challenges due to job losses, financial constraints, evictions, and food insecurity. In addition to teaching, I am actively assisting my students in locating food resources, securing housing, and navigating the process of applying for unemployment benefits to alleviate their financial burdens. The situation has been exceptionally difficult, exacerbated by the stark disparities between white individuals and those from minority groups. It is distressing to witness the heightened struggles experienced by my students of color, including black and brown students, in comparison to their white counterparts. Consequently, I find myself deeply engrossed in supporting my students, whom I consider akin to family, making it challenging to find respite amidst their hardships.
After engaging in the two preceding play activities, this testimonial appears to have shed light on genuine issues that participants were grappling with. It served as a catalyst, prompting them to open up about their experiences and respond to the narratives and emotions being unveiled. The attentive listening, expressions of shock, support, and relief evident on the faces of the participants on screen throughout each testimonial vividly demonstrated the profound impact these stories had on them.
The testimonial presented in Excerpt 1 appeared to have a significant impact on all participants, likely due to the recent visibility of demonstrations carried out by the Black Lives Matter movement in the USA. Concurrently, in Brazil, individuals were also affected by the tragic news of the death of Miguel, a five-year-old black child who tragically fell nine floors from a luxury seaside apartment after being left alone by his mother's employer. It was evident that this particular testimonial, as depicted in Excerpt 1, captured the attention of the participants, eliciting nods of agreement and expressions of surprise as they attentively observed or listened to each shared testimonial within the group.
The moment of conversation during the workshop had a significant impact on college students and young professionals, as they found themselves able to connect with their own challenges and successes in online learning, the job market's response to the crisis in their field, and their personal coping mechanisms. These reactions evoke the concept of affectus from a Spinozian perspective, where affectus plays a role in self-transformation through the creation of "joyful encounters with bodies" (Spinoza, 2003). Excerpts 2 and 3 from additional testimonials further illustrate the participants' comfort in sharing their experiences during the workshop.
Life has undergone significant changes since March. I no longer feel entirely at ease venturing out and engaging in activities. The challenges we faced in New York were immense, yet we managed to navigate the situation somewhat effectively. We approached the circumstances with seriousness, successfully flattening the curve. Like many others, my English classes transitioned to an online format. This adjustment proved challenging as I value the in-person interactions with teachers and classmates. I enjoy conversing and found the online setting somewhat isolating as I lacked the opportunity to engage with others. However, life is gradually returning to a semblance of normalcy, and I remain optimistic that things will improve in due course.
I have been engaged in research on the coronavirus, specifically focusing on finding effective treatments for individuals. My work has involved studying chloroquine and ivermectin, two widely recognized drugs in Brazil; however, our findings indicate that they are not effective treatments. Therefore, I advise against the use of chloroquine and ivermectin. Our ongoing efforts are directed towards identifying medications that demonstrate efficacy against the virus. This process is challenging and time-consuming as extensive research is required to ascertain the effectiveness of potential treatments. As a result, I find myself at the forefront of this critical research endeavor.
In Spinoza's Ethics, affectus are viewed as the continuous fluctuation of the power of acting, as defined by Spinoza (2003, III, Def. 3), which is brought about by affectio or modifications experienced in the body, with their effects manifested through affectus. Depending on the configuration of relationships among bodies, affectus can be either active, signifying a transition towards greater perfection (joy), or passive, indicating a contrary movement (sadness). The augmentation or diminution of an individual's power of acting (to be and act) - conatus - is a result of encounters. Consequently, encounters have the potential to either enhance or diminish a person's power of acting.
The potency of human agency is rooted in encounters as it pertains to the boundless potential for interaction between affectus. Put simply, it involves the capacity to influence and be influenced. Sawaia (2009) elucidates that affectus plays a pivotal role in amalgamating powers to form a cohesive body and mind. This fusion of power gives rise to the collective political entity and the multitude, stemming from individuals' aspirations to enhance their living conditions towards a shared goal that can enhance the societal welfare of the community (Spinoza, 2017).
The final activity discussed in this paper, titled "The change I want to see is," followed a series of questions, answers, and testimonials within the workshop. Participants were prompted to share their desired change by typing it into the chat, serving as their concluding statement for the session. This exercise aimed to stimulate their creativity by incorporating elements from the workshop. Individuals were urged to articulate personal aspirations or desired societal transformations. After a brief period of reflection, participants simultaneously input their thoughts into the chat. These responses were visible to all attendees and were subsequently vocalized by a facilitator. Excerpt 4 provides a glimpse into some of the contributions made during this activity.
The transformation I aspire to witness encompasses a profound shift towards fostering respect and love, eliminating hate speech, upholding reverence for scientific inquiry, acknowledging and valuing the lives of Black individuals and members of the LGBTQI+ community, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration that benefits society at large, honoring diverse cultural perspectives, and enhancing housing infrastructure to better serve communities.
Excerpt 4 from the workshop sheds light on the participants' desires for a different reality. Despite some issues not directly impacting their immediate circumstances, the discussions resonated with all attendees, fostering a sense of global solidarity and shared responsibility evident through their expressions on screen. Given the universal experience of the pandemic, individuals were collectively affected, whether they had encountered similar situations firsthand or through secondhand accounts.
The activities outlined demonstrate how participants in GPB incorporate play into a revolutionary cause that aligns with the concept of a dynamic world. In this context, individuals are both influenced by and influencing others, thereby enhancing their abilities to act (conatus) collaboratively. Through mutual support and a commitment to a fairer society, an activist agency can be cultivated. Stetsenko (2017) suggests that addressing the crisis of inequality by surpassing current norms can lead individuals to collectively shape history and society while transforming their own capacities for agency.
Liberali (2020) emphasizes the necessity of fostering social change to address the growing disparities in our society. The workshop experience detailed in this study aims to empower participants to partake in politically and ethically motivated endeavors. Engaging in such activities requires a critical examination of values and aspirations. The reciprocal relationship between personal growth and societal shifts underscores the importance of cultivating agency for transformative action. This imperative extends beyond the confines of routine existence, which often perpetuates social divisions.
In light of the global pandemic, Global Partnership for Betterment (GPB) can be viewed as an international community with a collaborative inclination, akin to Spinoza's philosophy, impacting partners across various domains and practices, aiming to promote transformative initiatives on a global scale. This initiative underscores the necessity of addressing oppressive circumstances in support of the collective welfare, urging individuals to actively confront challenges and take tangible steps towards improvement. Embracing an activist perspective, it acknowledges the pressing need for societal transformation, emphasizing the significance of political and ethical involvement, with critical thinking serving as a linchpin for fostering justice, enhancing living conditions, and promoting well-being on a worldwide scale.
Within this context, this paper introduces an initiative undertaken by the GPB community—an online play and talk workshop that was part of the group's monthly events. The workshop delved into and illustrated the theoretical and practical aspects of collaboration and play, which are fundamental concepts within this international group. Titled "Global collaboration: what can young professionals do?", the workshop appears to seamlessly integrate these two concepts in its structure and content, emphasizing its aim to address the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and its ripple effects on other significant social issues.
Participants from diverse professional backgrounds convened to engage in activities that involved both play and discussions about their experiences during the crisis and their hopes for the future. The workshop's structured activities pushed college students, who were learning English, to approach language critically, encouraging them to analyze real-life scenarios and articulate their perspectives drawing from personal and communal experiences. Within this multimodal setting, the English language served as a tool alongside facial expressions, laughter, gestures, sounds, and written texts, all of which were employed to foster connections and facilitate communication among the participants.
Such a connection was facilitated by play, which establishes a collaborative environment for individuals to navigate immediate communication barriers and, significantly, delve into broader contexts while contemplating feasible pathways for their existence. Within the realm of play, the resolution of obstacles can be perpetuated through a shared experience that enhances everyone's capacity towards fostering social justice. Play evolves into a continuous, introspective, and hands-on practice for engaging with diversity, managing conflicts, and addressing our innate drive for progression, all of which are enduring and essential aspects of human growth and development.
In response to the challenges posed by the global pandemic, the GPB community actively promotes global collaboration across various domains. The workshops, including the one under discussion, aim to involve participants in social transformation through affectus (Spinoza, 2017) elicited during interactive play and dialogue sessions. These workshops strive to envision new realities through discourse and a variety of creative methods, including imagination, improvisation, and performance. This initiative represents a concerted effort to combat forces that hinder the potential for peaceful coexistence, which ultimately encompasses all aspects of individual identity and the factors that empower us.
In Freire's perspective (1970), the potential for innovation can be observed in various active community movements, such as the GPB, and in programs like Brincadas that adapt these principles to local needs, as demonstrated by the LACE Research Group's reinterpretation of GPB's principles within the Brazilian context. This highlights the interdisciplinary nature of AL, which has served as the theoretical and methodological foundation for LACE over time. It is essential for this group to integrate language research with social engagement as an integral part of the ongoing learning process that everyone is involved in, while also serving as a thought-provoking and responsive approach towards individual and collective transformation.
We express our gratitude to Ulysses Diegues, a Brigadier and member of Brincadas in Brazil, for his role as a facilitator in the workshop and for providing feedback on the initial draft of this paper. Additionally, we extend our thanks to Alexandre Borin, Bruno Marques Panccioni, Caio Gustavo Cruz, Danielle Fuga, Danubia Sales de Oliveira, Ferial Pearson, Maik Lima da Silva, and Vitor Fagundes for graciously accepting our invitation as workshop guests, contributing to its success. Our appreciation also goes out to all participants who engaged in discussions and activities with us, as well as to CAPES for their financial support of the research conducted by the first author, as indicated by Ethical Appreciation Certificate number 4.341.663.
