This article presents a theoretical work with the objective of discussing methodologies and methods in educational research, specifically focusing on the analysis of classroom discursive interactions. The initial section delves into the two primary research paradigms, positivism and interpretivism, along with their respective ontological and epistemological foundations. Subsequently, two methods for analyzing discursive interactions are introduced and examined, one corresponding to each paradigm. Systematic coding, situated within the quantitative framework, is recommended for handling data from extensive samples, identifying general trends, and enabling statistical comparisons or temporal analyses by converting discourse into variables. This method is applied to a series of 42 group dialogue episodes, with the results contextualized in relation to the research questions, elucidating the types of statistical tests that can be conducted. Within the interpretivist paradigm, sociocultural discourse analysis is exemplified as a qualitative method and is employed to analyze excerpts from classroom dialogues. A key discovery involves the identification of typologies that elucidate how teachers and students construct scientific explanations. The concluding section deliberates on the potentials and limitations of each method, ultimately advocating for their complementary nature in advancing knowledge within the educational domain.
Numerous studies have delved into the significance of language and discursive interaction in the knowledge-building process within classroom settings, with notable contributions from Howe and Mercer (2007), Mercer et al. (2020), Resnick et al. (2015), and Schwarz & Baker (2016). Over the past four decades, this area of research has thrived, often falling under overarching terms like 'classroom dialogue' or 'dialogic teaching' as highlighted by Kim & Wilkinson (2019) and Mercer & Dawes (2014), encompassing investigations that seek to optimize discursive exchanges within educational settings (Alexander, 2008). This educational paradigm shift, termed the 'dialogic turn', underscores the importance of student voice, agency, and active involvement in the collaborative construction of knowledge (Wilkinson & Son, 2011).
The initial comprehensive investigation into classroom dialogue is attributed to Flanders (1970), who introduced the concept of the two-thirds rule, indicating that in typical classroom settings, two-thirds of the time is dedicated to verbal exchanges, with two-thirds of this dialogue being initiated by the teacher, predominantly in the form of lecturing. Another significant observation is encapsulated in the triadic discourse model comprising initiation, response, and feedback or evaluation (Mehan, 1979; Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975). This structured pattern emerges as a prevalent characteristic in whole-class discussions, potentially constituting up to 70% of all teacher-student interactions (Cazden, 1988; Nassaji & Wells, 2000; Wells, 1993). While the majority of these investigations have been conducted in English-speaking nations, the triadic discourse model is acknowledged as a global phenomenon (Alexander, 2001).
Interventionist research has delved into and pinpointed various forms of improved teacher-student interactions that bolster the process of teaching and learning (Mercer, 2002). A key takeaway from these studies is the significant impact that different modes of communication have on the content that students are able to grasp (Howe & Mercer, 2007; Kelly, 2014; Lemke, 2001). As Nystrand (1997) aptly puts it, "the caliber of student learning is intricately tied to the caliber of discourse within the classroom" (p. 29).
Recent publications have focused on reviewing methods for analyzing classroom dialogue (Kershner, Hennessy, et al., 2020; Kumpulainen et al., 2009; MÃ¤rtsin, 2012), contributing to the expanding research in this area. This discussion paper aims to delve into the methodologies and methods used to analyze classroom discursive interaction. Rather than immediately delving into analytical methods, the paper initiates a broad methodological discussion rooted in research paradigms that consider elements like epistemology and ontology. The subsequent section of the paper outlines methods and procedures for discursive data analysis, presenting two main approaches: quantitative and qualitative. Both approaches are thoroughly discussed and exemplified using instances from previous studies.
The conventional perspective often associates methodology with the choice and utilization of methods in a study for data analysis. However, a broader understanding of methodology encompasses the researcher's adherence to various epistemological and theoretical frameworks that not only impact method selection but also shape the formulation of research inquiries and study design (Mercer et al., 2004; Taber, 2012, 2013; Treagust et al., 2014).
Crotty (1998) posits that a research conceptualization should encompass four key elements: epistemology, theoretical perspective, methodology, and methods. In a similar vein, Taber (2013) discusses the importance of ontological and epistemological assumptions in research, highlighting elements such as theoretical perspective, methodology, research design, and the consistent application of techniques for data acquisition and analysis.
These components collectively form what is commonly referred to as the research paradigm, a worldview or fundamental belief system that establishes the significance of research and directs the researcher not only in selecting methods but also in certain underlying assumptions (Guba & Lincoln, 1994; Treagust et al., 2014). Essentially, the research paradigm is viewed as a 'point of reference', 'vision', or 'philosophy' that integrates beliefs, values, and research methodologies (Taber, 2013; Treagust et al., 2014). In practical terms, paradigms represent how the researcher conceptualizes and comprehends their study.
Different paradigms can embody starkly contrasting features, particularly evident when examining the two broadest perspectives. The first paradigm, characterized as positivist, nomothetic, and confirmatory, is rooted in the pursuit of definitive and objective knowledge, the identification of general patterns or laws, and the rigorous testing of hypotheses. Central to this paradigm is the belief that there exists a possibility to articulate unambiguous truths based on observable phenomena and verified facts (Taber, 2013, p. 49). Guba and Lincoln (1994) highlighted that this approach is underpinned by a realistic ontology and an objectivist epistemology. Realistic ontology posits the existence of an apprehendable reality governed by immutable natural laws and mechanisms (p. 109), while an objectivist epistemology assumes the independence of the investigator and the investigated 'object,' with the investigator capable of studying the object without mutual influence (p. 110). This perspective in social science is characterized as objectivist and determinist, viewing human beings as products of their environment and responses to it (Cohen et al., 2007).
Positivist research aims for objectivity, measurability, predictability, controllability, patterning, and the establishment of laws and rules of behavior, seeking causal explanations to support claims (Cohen et al., 2007, p. 26; Treagust et al., 2014). Quantitative methods are particularly suited to this approach, as they strive to capture social reality through predefined categories and measurements, offering causal-effect explanations within this framework.
The second paradigm is interpretivist, idiographic, and centered on discovery. Within this paradigm, knowledge (or nature) is perceived as a fundamentally subjective human interpretation, emphasizing specific and contextual cases. It focuses on the "meanings that those participating in educational situations give to what they experience" (Taber, 2013, p. 52). Researchers operating within this paradigm contend that meanings are not predetermined but rather co-constructed through interaction. Consequently, they may involve participants in activities and solicit their perspectives (Treagust et al., 2014). Guba and Lincoln (1994) posit that this approach is rooted in a relativist ontology and subjectivist epistemology. Relativist ontology suggests that "realities are graspable in the form of multiple, intangible mental constructions, socially and experientially grounded" (p. 110). Conversely, a subjectivist epistemology implies that "the investigator and the object of investigation are assumed to be interactively linked so that the 'findings' are shaped as the investigation progresses" (p. 111). Within this framework, individuals are viewed as agents of their own actions and creators of their own environment, leading to its characterization as subjectivist and voluntarist (Cohen et al., 2007).
Interpretive researchers aim to comprehend and interpret the world through the lens of its participants (Cohen et al., 2007, p. 26) and contextualize the meaning of human experiences within specific settings (Treagust et al., 2014). This approach predominantly utilizes qualitative methods to analyze social contexts and derive interpretations from collected data.
Criticism surrounds both paradigms. Positivist researchers are often perceived as superficial and restrictive, failing to acknowledge internal contradictions and presuming universal applicability of findings or solutions (Taber, 2013). Conversely, interpretivist studies have faced scrutiny for being anecdotal or lacking methodological rigor, leading to challenges in generalizability and scalability.
Some researchers argue that critical theory constitutes a distinct research paradigm, as highlighted by scholars such as Cohen et al. (2007), Guba and Lincoln (1994), and Treagust et al. (2014). Scholars within this tradition underscore the significance of political and ideological perspectives in human interactions, contending that elements like power dynamics and inequality play a pivotal role in shaping individuals' behaviors, perceptions, and overall lived experiences (Cohen et al., 2007).
The presence of numerous research paradigms does not inherently pose a problem, particularly within the realm of educational research. Treagust and his associates (2014) argue that this variety fosters the development of a more well-rounded knowledge base and a more comprehensive approach. Similarly, Taber (2013) recognizes that each paradigm possesses its own set of strengths and weaknesses, indicating that valuable insights can be gleaned from any of them and that they can be utilized in conjunction with one another.
At this juncture, the adoption of a research paradigm necessitates consideration of three key aspects. Firstly, it is imperative that the chosen paradigm offers a consistent and coherent framework that guides every stage of the study (Taber, 2013, p. 55). Secondly, it is crucial to acknowledge that different paradigms serve distinct purposes and employ varied methodologies, ultimately leading to divergent outcomes (p. 68). Lastly, any study inherently aligns with a paradigm, whether explicitly stated or implicitly reflected in the formulation and addressing of research inquiries (p. 68). These considerations underscore the significance of carefully deliberating on the interplay between research objectives and the most suitable methodologies to achieve them.
Certainly, all paradigms can be applied to generate new knowledge when analyzing classroom interaction. For example, the positivist approach necessitates simplifying social practices to make research more manageable by selecting a specific set of dialogue variables and controlling others related to learning outcomes (Asterhan et al., 2020). This method enables us to draw conclusions about how dialogic teaching impacts students' learning. Conversely, the interpretivist paradigm offers a more nuanced perspective on dialogue dynamics, often through ethnographic case studies that delve into the cultural context of the classroom setting (Asterhan et al., 2020). It is important to note that different methods are essential for each paradigm when addressing research questions of varying natures. The primary goal of this discussion paper is to explore these differences and their implications.
For pedagogical clarity, the subsequent sections are categorized into quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Each section provides a concise overview of an analytical approach and its practical implementation using authentic classroom discourse data from a prior study. The research inquiries and outcomes are showcased here solely as a demonstrative illustration of how paradigms and methodologies can be put into practice. Therefore, the intention is not to delve into the novel insights on dialogic teaching derived from this dataset.
Analyzing discursive interaction is inherently subjective, involving the construction of meaning from the thoughts and voices of others within social, cultural, and situational contexts. This analytical process necessitates interpretation and reflexivity, as researchers inevitably bring their own preconceptions, interests, biases, and agendas to the study (Cohen et al., 2007).
Researchers have engaged in discussions regarding the conflicting tensions between 'deductive' and 'inductive' approaches when analyzing data (Evans, 2013; Taber, 2013). The former method involves seeking evidence that aligns with pre-established themes, thereby influencing the direction of the analysis, while the latter approach originates from a more open-minded inquiry, where themes are derived from the data itself and utilized as analytical tools (Evans, 2013). Essentially, the analysis can either be rooted in a conceptual framework or grounded in the data itself (Taber, 2013), with both scenarios involving the creation of categories, their organization under higher-order headings, and the development of a comprehensive description of the research topic (Elo & KyngÃ¤s, 2008).
Various approaches exist for analyzing discursive data and interactions, all of which typically require researchers to engage in reflective and extensive examination of the data to uncover underlying patterns and meanings (Evans, 2013, p. 158). The degree to which data is fragmented often determines whether quantitative or qualitative methods are employed. In the analysis of discursive interactions, researchers commonly reach a point where they categorize or 'code' individual utterances, speech turns, or episodes (Hennessy et al., 2020).
In the quantitative analysis, small-group dialogues were examined across seven distinct tasks. The researchers observed patterns in communication dynamics, noting variations in participation levels and conversational turn-taking. These findings shed light on the collaborative processes within small-group interactions, highlighting the importance of balanced participation and effective communication strategies. In contrast, the qualitative analysis focused on episodes of whole-class teaching centered on the topic of evaporation. Through detailed observations and thematic coding, the researchers identified key themes and instructional strategies employed by the teacher. The analysis revealed the teacher's emphasis on hands-on experiments, visual aids, and real-world examples to enhance student understanding. Overall, both analyses provide valuable insights into the dynamics of classroom interactions and instructional practices, contributing to a deeper understanding of effective teaching and learning strategies.
In this section, we delve into the systematic coding method, widely favored by researchers for its examination of interaction as a turn-taking system and subsequent categorization of each interaction. This method involves an analytical process of discursive data that entails data reduction by marking relevant points of interest. Often referred to as 'coding,' this process allows researchers to both organize and structure data while translating raw information into specific conceptual references, facilitating the identification of connections to various categories (Evans, 2013, pp. 158â159). Objectivity plays a crucial role in systematic coding, necessitating the development of an unambiguous scheme where coding criteria are clearly defined to ensure consistent coding by different observers for the same discursive unit (Galton et al., 1980). Codes frequently stem from a theoretical framework or prior research, leading to what can be termed as a 'template' research approach, where the analytical framework is guided by a theoretical perspective, enabling analysts to have a clear focus on what to seek in the data from the outset (Robson, 2002; Taber, 2013, p. 293).
When codes are tallied, this method offers a comprehensive overview of the data sample, facilitating the identification of patterns within and across events (Snell & Lefstein, 2011). Nonetheless, this approach is not devoid of challenges, as it tends to fragment the data, potentially leading to the loss of context or other nuances not captured by the codes (Cohen et al., 2007). Consequently, systematic coding could be viewed as reductionist (Mercer et al., 2004; Snell & Lefstein, 2011). The subsequent subsection presents an illustration of the types of research inquiries and discoveries that systematic coding can yield.
In the study conducted by Author (XXXX), three key questions were addressed concerning group-work interaction. Firstly, the inquiry aimed to characterize the nature of small-group dialogue within a Brazilian primary school setting. Secondly, the study sought to investigate how this dialogue evolved throughout the intervention period. Lastly, the research aimed to determine whether the groups exhibited an increase in dialogic communication over time. It is important to note that the research project was grounded in a teacher professional development program designed to enhance dialogic discourse in both small-group interactions and whole-class teaching sessions.
A total of 42 episodes of group discussions were recorded, transcribed, and meticulously analyzed. Given the substantial sample size and the complexity of the inquiries posed, a quantitative analysis was deemed the most appropriate method to discern the overarching trends in discursive interactions within the groups and to potentially track any shifts in these patterns over time.
A coding scheme was developed by drawing on existing literature, consisting of ten codes that pertain to dialogic classroom discourse at the level of individual utterances. This scheme, which emerged from previous research, encompasses ten distinct categories categorized into three contexts: content, task, and off-topic, which serve to differentiate the nature of each utterance. In essence, these codes can be organized to determine whether an utterance aligns with the content being discussed in the task (the topic at hand), pertains to task-related procedures or classroom management, or falls into the category of off-topic discourse, which does not directly relate to either the content or the task at hand (refer to Table 1).
The utterances pertaining to task content were categorized based on their discursive functions, drawing inspiration from the IRF pattern and dialogic features that characterize productive talk (Howe et al., 2019). Consequently, six codes were developed, with two assigned to each phase of the triadic discourse: invitation (INV), dialogic invitation (D_INV), contribution (CON), dialogic contribution (D_CON), follow-up (FOL), and dialogic evaluation (D_EVA). This differentiation was specifically applied to content utterances, as they serve as the conduit for knowledge construction and conceptual learning to take place.
The term 'dialogic' is employed to describe conversations where participants actively contribute to advancing ideas by critically considering others' perspectives to collectively build knowledge (Kershner, Dowdall, et al., 2020; Mercer, 2003). In this study, engagement in dialogic talk was measured by the frequency of occurrences of three specific dialogic codes.
In conclusion, this scheme facilitated the description of classroom discourse and the assessment of dialogicity, which were central to the research inquiries. Classroom discourse was delineated through a comparison of the prevalence of different codes within specific contexts (such as content, instructional, and off-topic), while dialogicity was assessed by examining the ratio of dialogic utterances to non-dialogic ones.
This form of positivist coding operates under the assumption that the codes are capable of encapsulating elements or attributes of the discursive interaction. With the goal of objectivity in mind, the coding scheme underwent testing for inter-reliability. Three Master's students were enlisted to assist the researcher in piloting and refining the scheme, setting up coding rules, and ensuring consistency.
In the initial round, all raters coded a single group-talk episode and engaged in discussions regarding the alignment and convergence scheme and rules. Following the acquisition of moderate scores, the scheme underwent simplification by eliminating certain codes, while rules were further elucidated and detailed in writing. A subset of two raters coded 28% of the total episodes (12 out of 42), with inter-rater reliability assessed using Cohenâs Kappa scores in R (RStudio team, 2020). Through an iterative process, a satisfactory to excellent level of agreement was achieved, with Cohenâs Kappa scores averaging K = .79 (specific Kappa values for each code are detailed in Table 1). Subsequently, the remaining material was coded by the researcher, solidifying the reliability of the scheme.
In addressing the first research question, the results are presented based on the entire dataset. Initially, the analysis considered group talk as a whole, with relative code frequencies used to measure the number of content-related utterances (codes 1 to 6), instruction-related utterances (code 7), and off-topic utterances (code 8) divided by the total number of utterances. As depicted in Figure 1, it is evident that groups allocated approximately 56% of their utterances to discussing the content of the task, around 25% to negotiating task instructions, and about 19% to off-topic discussions. This indicates that only half of the group work was dedicated to discussing content, which is the type of discourse most directly linked to gains in conceptual-disciplinary learning.
The data could be further examined by investigating variations in the frequencies of the codes across tasks (question 2) and utilizing statistical analysis to identify significant differences. The dataset exhibited consistency for non-parametric tests in comparing three or more populations (Fligner-Killeenâs test indicated significance above the threshold for all codes except D_EVA when comparing tasks or groups, p > 0.05). This outcome permitted the use of non-parametric tests for analyzing group comparisons through the Kruskal-Wallis test and the post-hoc Nemenyi test. The codes 'other' and 'inaudible' were excluded from the analysis and not taken into consideration.
Figure 2 illustrates the code distributions concerning group talk contexts and discursive functions across various tasks. The analysis revealed only a few significant differences between the groups. Notably, significant disparities were observed in content (H(6) = 17.575, p = .007) between Tasks 3â4 (p = .037) and Tasks 3â5 (p = .022) for the context category, as well as in off-topic discussions (H(6) = 14.007, p = .029) between Tasks 3-5 (p = .046). However, no notable distinction was found in terms of instructional discourse. In general, students tended to focus more on the content and engage less in off-topic conversations during Tasks 2 and 3.
To address the question of whether the groups exhibited increased dialogic interactions (question 3), the study compared the combined outcomes of non-dialogic utterances (comprising codes 1, 3, and 5) with those categorized as dialogic (codes 2, 4, and 6). Given that dialogic and non-dialogic measures are essentially mirror images of each other, it was deemed sufficient to perform statistical analyses on only one of these categories.
Only three task-pairs exhibited significant differences (H(6) = 24.881, p < .001): tasks 1-2 (p = .008), tasks 2-6 (p = .001), and tasks 4-6 (p = .04). As illustrated in Figure 3, task 2 emerged as the most dialogic, closely followed by task 4, whereas tasks 1 and 6 predominantly featured non-dialogic utterances. Consequently, the hypothesis positing an improvement in dialogic utterance usage across tasks was not substantiated. The variations observed between tasks were minimal and did not align with the anticipated effects of the intervention.
It is important to highlight that the findings regarding classroom interaction were derived without the inclusion of any discursive extracts for the reader's reference. Occasionally, researchers opt to provide only a brief extract to demonstrate the application of a particular scheme, rather than incorporating it as an integral part of the analysis. Consequently, the outcomes are entirely reliant on the explanatory capacity of the codes and the dependability of the coding procedure. Furthermore, given the nature of the inquiries posed, it is evident that a qualitative methodology would not facilitate generalization for descriptive purposes nor provide objectivity for comparing alterations in discursive variables across time.
For instance, Extract 1 exemplifies dialogic discourse that emerged within these groups: an episode meticulously chosen to demonstrate the high levels of interaction among students. The recognition of this particular episode amidst the rest was achievable solely through the systematic coding and frequency analysis of the complete dataset. Quantitatively, over half of the utterances were deemed dialogic (17 out of 30; approximately 57%). To provide a brief comparison, the average dialogicity observed across the seven tasks hovered around 33% (refer to Figure 3).
Qualitative methods rooted in the interpretivism paradigm typically consider the cultural and social context and practices that influence classroom interactions (e.g., Gee & Green, 1998). It is widely acknowledged that knowledge is socially constructed through language. These approaches encompass linguistic ethnography, sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, and other related methodologies (Hennessy et al., 2020). Emphasizing contextual and sociocultural dimensions over mere verbal exchanges (such as turn-taking), these methods view discourse in a broader framework that includes the text (speech, writing, or image), the discursive analysis within the text, and the social practices and structures intertwined with notions of power and knowledge (Gregory, 2020).
Researchers working with discursive data and qualitative methods utilize a range of techniques, including identifying themes, generating units, classifying and categorizing these units, structuring narratives to depict content, interpreting scenarios, and developing theory (Cohen et al., 2007; Robson, 2002).
An illustration of a qualitative method, sociocultural discourse analysis is showcased and utilized to map out connections between classroom interaction and conceptual learning. This analytical approach involved a meticulous scrutiny of episodes with the goal of creating categories and supporting them with chosen excerpts. By honing in on this aspect, researchers were able to delve beyond mere discursive functions and explore the entirety of interactions, which could then be utilized to construct typologies and assess their influence on specific educational objectives. Furthermore, this methodology delves into the "content, function, and the ways shared understanding is developed in social context, over time" (Mercer, 2010, p. 9).
Sociocultural discourse analysis is characterized by its emphasis on using actual talk as the primary data for analysis, allowing for a detailed examination of the processes involved in the joint construction of knowledge (Mercer, 2004, p. 143). In this approach, the central focus is not on discursive functions or language per se, but rather on the content of the conversation and the collaborative intellectual endeavors that take place within it (Mercer, 2004). This methodological framework is inherently inductive, meaning that themes or categories are expected to emerge organically from the data itself (Evans, 2013; Taber, 2013).
The analysis often includes selected extracts accompanied by commentary, drawing on prior knowledge of the field and context. It focuses on syntax and cohesive language structures to illustrate how knowledge is socially constructed in educational settings (Mercer, 2004). Dialogue remains central to the analysis, with emergent typologies serving as heuristic tools to interpret conversations in relation to specific issues (Mercer, 2004). Mercer's research identified three types of group talk: disputational, cumulative, and exploratory, highlighting the positive impact of the latter on student learning. Rather than reducing data to categories, the aim is to outline broad contextual features that shape discursive dynamics in achieving educational goals (Mercer et al., 2004). The subsequent subsection provides an example of the research questions and findings that sociocultural discourse analysis can offer.
The data for this study originates from the aforementioned project, which involved a classroom-based intervention aimed at fostering dialogue. Specifically, the second module of the TPD programme utilized a predetermined set of classroom materials designed to encourage extensive student engagement through discussions and critical thinking. This approach enabled students to formulate their own hypotheses regarding water evaporation by drawing upon their observations and everyday experiences (SPRinG, n.d.).
The research question aimed to explore the role of classroom discourse in enhancing students' comprehension of scientific concepts. It was posited that a significant portion of conceptual learning in elementary science is facilitated through the collaborative construction of explanations. Therefore, the focus of this study was to examine the process by which teachers and students collectively develop a scientific understanding of evaporation through verbal interactions.
Defining what constitutes an explanation or outlining its structure proves to be a challenging endeavor, despite the general agreement that it involves an intellectual elaboration that elucidates a cause-effect relationship and employs logical connectors such as 'because' to link the cause and the outcome. In light of this understanding, the dataset was meticulously examined to identify patterns that mirror scientific explanations.
Given the interpretivist nature of this analysis and the specific focus on primary science, scientific discourse, and evaporation, a more comprehensive framework was deemed necessary for data analysis. Specifically, the aim was to establish criteria for what constitutes an explanation in classroom discussions within the context of primary science. Through iterative examination of both the data and relevant theoretical frameworks, two key structural components were identified: forms of explanations and causation, as outlined by Braaten and Windschitl (2011). Consequently, the analysis sought to identify sequences of speech that conveyed instances of explanation, such as definitions, descriptions, and reasoning, as well as causation, which involves cause-and-effect explanations of observable phenomena. By pinpointing these instances within the data, the study aimed to develop typologies, provide commentary and descriptions, and explore potential implications arising from these patterns.
The data corpus was analyzed to identify instances where explanations were collaboratively constructed by teachers and students. Within the 18 episodes of whole-class teaching documented in this module, five distinct types of explanatory sequences were identified. These sequences were further categorized into three overarching discursive acts based on the role of the teacher: exploring, guiding, or providing explanations.
The distinction between exploring and guiding explanations in real classroom interactions is not always clear-cut due to the presence of unplanned utterances, deviations, and uncontrolled flows. This complexity makes it challenging to neatly categorize these sequences under a single label (Barnes, 1976). Consequently, these explanatory sequences should not be viewed as strictly defined or crystalline, as various categories can overlap within certain utterances. Mercer (1995) highlighted this issue when he introduced the concept of three types of group talk.
In the research article, the process of 'exploring explanations' was described as encompassing the advancement, extension, and addition to students' ideas, while 'guiding explanations' denoted sequences leading towards a scientific explanation, with an emphasis on the precise use of scientific terminology. These categories were then subdivided into four detailed typologies. The final category, 'providing explanations,' referred to instances where the teacher directly presented an explanation to the students. In the context of talk-intensive lessons examined in the study, this form of direct instruction was characterized by high levels of interactivity, with students contributing some words, although the bulk of conceptual development was led by the teacher.
The comprehensive research report by Author (XXXX) delves into various forms of collective construction, offering a framework of reference for each typology and supplementing the discussion with illustrative examples from lessons. Due to limitations in space and scope, this paper focuses on a single typology, employing response narrowing to guide the explanations and discussions effectively.
In this study, two examples highlight the extensive application of cued elicitation (Mercer, 1995) and Socratic questioning (Roth, 1996), respectively. These techniques involve prompting responses that steer the discussion towards a specific direction. Students were prompted to provide brief responses to navigate the discussion within the scientific context. For instance, in the first scenario, the objective of the lesson was to draw a comparison between the evaporation processes of water and perfume. Given that students couldn't visually or tactilely perceive water evaporation, the teacher used perfume as a tangible example to demonstrate the concept of a substance transitioning from liquid to gas. This line of reasoning was further developed by the teacher in the second extract.
In the teacher's third interaction (line 82), she employed a forceful intonation ("SEE") to dismiss a student's response. Subsequently, in the succeeding exchange (line 84), she reiterated the correct answer while providing a rationale: "We don't see them, these particles are tiny, they are invisible." Simultaneously, she inquired about the purpose behind bringing the perfume into the classroom. Despite the student's assertion that the visual impact was not the reason, they contended that it was about the sensation.
While posed as a why-question, the abundance of clues pointing towards the correct answer rendered it more of a statement than an invitation for dialogue, thus not coded as such. Subsequently, in lines 87 and 88, the teacher proceeded to offer a comprehensive explanation, withholding only the concluding term for the students to supply - 'vapour'. With the anticipated response provided, the teacher seamlessly transitioned into elaborating on the concept of vapour, its associated scent, and how it disperses throughout the room. Despite the linear and somewhat directive approach taken by the teacher, the overall structure of the explanation remained predominantly informative and instructive.
In this particular excerpt (3), students had recently engaged with a concise text on particle theory and were collaboratively responding to questions on a handout. Throughout the interaction, the teacher acknowledged responses such as 'separate', 'move further apart', and 'increase in speed'. Additionally, she explicitly prompted for two specific 'elements' (mentioned in lines 50 and 53), which were promptly identified as 'energy' and 'freedom'. The teacher appeared to be seeking key terms from the text within the students' contributions. Armed with these anticipated answers (or their equivalents), the teacher concluded the discussion with a comprehensive explanation. Notably, these queries were not classified as dialogic (as indicated in lines 50, 53, and 55) since the expected responses were provided in the handout; students were essentially echoing them verbally and, as evidenced in line 56, somewhat tentatively. While it can be argued that the students' grasp of the text was assessed, it is more challenging to assert that deeper explanations were probed.
Neither of the examples demonstrate a clear effort to explore or enhance students' ideas. Rather, it appears that the teachers had specific objectives in mind and worked towards achieving them in collaboration with the students. It could be argued that they effectively highlighted the comparative analogy between water and perfume evaporation, focusing on a microscopic explanation of the process. The students seemed to contribute minimally, mostly aligning with the teachers' perspectives and reasoning.
This micro-analysis of the content of the utterances in these extracts has enabled us to delve deeper into certain factors, such as the development of conceptual understanding and the outcomes of each discursive strategy utilized by the teacher. Through this analysis, we were able to pinpoint a specific classroom activity and discursive techniques that significantly influenced the nature of classroom discourse.
This paper explores two research paradigms and their connection to two methodological approaches for analyzing educational dialogue: systematic coding (positivism-quantitative) and sociocultural discourse analysis (interpretivism-qualitative). The systematic coding approach involves allocating utterances to predefined categories that can be expanded or refined as needed. Hennessy et al. (2020) outline the benefits of frequency counting, including the ability to handle large datasets, identify key indicators, efficiently search for correlations between specific actions, recognize patterns, assess changes in practice, and conduct comparisons amenable to statistical analysis.
Utilizing this method enabled us to delineate a broad outline of the small-group discussions that transpired in a Brazilian primary school, while also facilitating the identification of variations over time. This latter aspect was accomplished through the quantification of the relative frequencies of code occurrences. Consequently, the results presented herein have elucidated the aforementioned positive attributes. However, a significant limitation of this analysis pertains to the temporal evolution of meanings and the inherent ambiguity stemming from the multifunctionality of utterances. It has been noted that in certain instances, coding may be perceived as lacking theoretical underpinnings or exhibiting dogmatic tendencies in its interpretations (Hennessy et al., 2020).
The paper also delves into sociocultural discourse analysis, which emphasizes the contextual and situated nature of speech turns, thereby enhancing the depth of contributions. Through qualitative analysis, researchers can uncover participants' underlying intentions and responses to others, allowing them to move beyond the data to identify overlooked opportunities for expansion or challenge (Hennessy et al., 2020, p. 6). Rather than simply noting the presence or absence of specific discourse moves, categorizing extracts as a whole can facilitate the construction of models, with categories and typologies emerging as outcomes rather than being predetermined (Mercer, 2010).
Utilizing this approach, the study demonstrated the collaborative efforts of teachers and students in constructing scientific explanations through classroom discourse. Out of the five typologies initially outlined, only one has been discussed in this context. The analysis revealed the teacher's role in steering students' thoughts along a logical path while co-creating explanations. Various techniques such as confrontation, narrowing responses, and posing questions were observed as integral components of this interactive process.
Although quantitative and qualitative methods have often been juxtaposed, they each hold significant value and can be viewed as complementary approaches (Snell & Lefstein, 2011). Systematic coding serves as a tool for managing vast datasets, facilitating the identification of overarching patterns across various lessons or tasks, enabling statistical comparisons, and supporting developmental analyses (Mercer et al., 2004). Conversely, sociocultural discourse analysis delves into the intricate details, providing a multi-dimensional comprehension of the intricacies within classroom dialogues (Asterhan et al., 2020). While the former method confines discursive interactions to quantifiable variables, aligning with a positivist perspective, the latter method uncovers the intricate layers and richness of discursive exchanges, offering a more interpretative approach.
Filho (2013) presents a thought-provoking theoretical discussion on the incommensurability, complementarity, and unity of paradigms. Advocates of the first thesis posit that realism and interpretivism are diametrically opposed, rendering them incompatible. Conversely, proponents of complementarity argue that both paradigms hold legitimacy as they do not inherently conflict. Furthermore, within the empirical realm, each paradigm is aligned with specific goals that cannot be effectively addressed by the other. The notion of unity between these paradigms is primarily supported by post-positivist and critical philosophers who assert that there is no logical or consistent way to rigidly partition knowledge into distinct categories.
In this research article, I advocate for a complementary approach primarily within the analytical-empirical dimension. Given the nature of the research inquiries in educational studies, there is a need for both quantitative and qualitative methods (Souza & Kerbauy, 2017). By adopting a mixed-method methodology (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998), researchers can effectively blend different methodologies to address research questions in a comprehensive and cohesive manner. Consequently, while qualitative analysis is favored for exploratory research questions, those with a confirmatory bias should utilize quantitative characterizations and comparisons.
