Objective: This study aims to investigate the incidence of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in patients with ipsilateral femur and tibia fractures, commonly referred to as a "floating knee." The research will explore the potential correlation between DVT occurrence and variables such as hospitalization duration, fracture classification, treatment modalities, and the presence of comorbidities.
Methods: This retrospective observational analytical study utilized the medical charts of thirty patients who were admitted with a floating knee to a trauma hospital during the period from October 2016 to July 2017.
Results: Out of the 30 patients evaluated, 25 (83%) were male and 5 (17%) were female. The age group most significantly impacted fell between 21 and 30 years, accounting for 36% of cases. The dominant limb was affected in 17 (57%) patients. Among the patients, 19 (63%) were categorized as Fraser type I, with 18 (60%) presenting open (compound) fractures, 16 (53%) involving the tibia, and 8 (26%) affecting the femur. The primary emergency treatment administered was external fixation of the femur and tibia, utilized in 25 patients (83%). Seven patients underwent treatment with a femur plate and external fixator for the tibia as a definitive measure. Within the cohort, 14 patients (46%) experienced infectious complications, with 9 (30%) classified as superficial and 5 (16%) as deep. Deep venous thrombosis was detected in 17% of patients (p=0.409) in the study.
In conclusion, despite the administration of antithrombotic prophylaxis, a notable incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was observed in the affected limb of patients with floating knee injuries. Factors such as Fraser I fractures, male gender, and the involvement of the non-dominant limb were found to significantly elevate the risk of DVT development in these patients. This study provides Level I evidence supporting the association between these variables and the occurrence of DVT in individuals with floating knee injuries.
One significant complication associated with lower limb fractures is Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), a condition that can lead to serious consequences including the risk of death, particularly from pulmonary thromboembolism. The occurrence of DVT is closely linked to high-energy trauma.
Various protocols are employed to mitigate this complication, with the prevalent approach involving the regular administration of anticoagulants in prophylactic quantities, notably low molecular weight heparin. Despite the associated expenses, this strategy has proven to be efficacious in averting Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), thereby reducing treatment expenses and mitigating morbidity, which could otherwise result in significant risks of mortality or enduring sequelae for the patient.
Ipsilateral femur and tibia fractures, commonly referred to as a floating knee as described by Blake and McBryde in 1975, typically result from high-energy mechanisms and are therefore anticipated to have a stronger association with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Fraser categorized floating knee injuries into two distinct types. Type I is distinguished by fractures occurring in the diaphysis of the femur and tibia, whereas Type II primarily involves the knee joint and is further divided into subcategories: IIA, involving diaphyseal femur fractures and intra-articular tibia fractures; IIB, characterized by intra-articular femur fractures and diaphyseal tibia fractures; and IIC, featuring intra-articular fractures in both the femur and tibia.
The objective of this study is to retrospectively examine the relationship between deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ipsilateral fractures of the femur and tibia, commonly referred to as a floating knee, in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy.
This study is a retrospective cross-sectional analytical investigation of patients who received treatment at a tertiary trauma referral hospital in Fortaleza, Ceará state (CE), Brazil, between October 2016 and July 2017. A total of 37 patients with floating knee injuries were included in the analysis.
All patients diagnosed with a floating knee and admitted to the hospital during the specified period were enrolled in the study. Diagnosis was established through the utilization of anteroposterior radiographs (AR) and a profile of the leg and femur bones of the affected limb.
Exclusion criteria encompassed patients with pre-fracture clinical comorbidities that might impact complication incidence, such as diabetes, thrombophilia, hemophilia, and smoking, as well as those with a previous history of thromboembolic events.
A cohort of 30 patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study.
The data retrieved from the patients' medical charts encompassed various key variables, including age, sex, affected side, Fraser's classification of fractures, trauma mechanism, fracture type (open or closed), initial treatment administered in urgent care, definitive fracture management, and post-treatment complications such as superficial infection, deep infection, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Subcutaneous antithromboembolic prophylaxis was administered to all patients, with enoxaparin (40mg/day) given to 30 patients upon admission and continued for a period of 2 months, provided there were no complications, in accordance with the institution's protocol. Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was established based on clinical symptoms such as pain and rigidity, and further confirmed through Doppler ultrasound for direct visualization of the venous thrombosis.
The data were managed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program (SPSS, version 18.0, NY, USA) and organized in Microsoft Excel 2007 (Microsoft, WA, USA) to compute the percentage frequency for categorical variables. Associations between the variables were assessed through Pearson’s chi-squared test, with statistical significance set at a p-value < 0.05 for all analyses.
The study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee under protocol number 2.259.144, and written informed consent was acquired from the Medical Chart sector of the institution.
Out of the 30 patients evaluated, 25 (83%) were male and 5 (17%) were female. The age group most significantly impacted fell between 21 and 30 years, accounting for 36% of the cases. The dominant limb was affected in 17 (57%) of the patients.
Fraser's classification revealed that the majority of patients fell under type I, denoting extra-articular femur and tibia fractures (Graph 1).
Out of the 30 patients included in the study, 18 (60%) presented with open fractures, with 16 (53%) occurring in the tibia and 8 (26%) in the femur. Among the open tibia fractures, five were classified as grade I according to the Gustillo & Anderson scale, seven as grade II, and six as Grade IIIa. In the case of open femur fractures, five were categorized as grade II and three as grade IIIa.
The predominant emergency treatment employed was external fixation of the femur and tibia, utilized in 25 patients, accounting for 83% of cases. As for definitive treatment, a combination of a femur plate and external fixator in the tibia was the most commonly chosen approach, administered to 7 patients, constituting 23% of the total cohort (refer to Table 1 for details). Regrettably, one patient encountered clinical complications stemming from severe infection and soft tissue necrosis, necessitating a suprapatellar amputation subsequent to a negative venous Doppler ultrasound for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
The mean duration for transitioning to definitive treatment was 8.14 days, ranging from a minimum of 2 days to a maximum of 22 days.
Seventy percent of the patients included in the study experienced trauma resulting from high-energy motorcycle accidents, as indicated in Graph 2 and Table 1.
In the 30 cases examined, the average consolidation time for the femur was 19.4 weeks (ranging from 16 to 25 weeks), while for the tibia, it was 16.2 weeks (ranging from 13 to 20 weeks). Among these cases, there were 2 instances of pseudoarthrosis in the femur, one managed with an autologous iliac crest graft and the other with bone transport. Additionally, there were 3 cases of pseudoarthrosis in the tibia, all of which were successfully treated with autologous grafts followed by subsequent consolidation.
Out of the 30 patients examined, 14 (46%) experienced infectious complications, with 9 (30%) classified as superficial and 5 (16%) as deep infections. Superficial infections were managed with oral antibiotics and local care, whereas deep infections necessitated surgical debridement upon identification of S. aureus in culture. A 4-week course of intravenous antibiotic therapy was administered, followed by an additional 2 weeks of oral antibiotics, guided by the antibiogram results.
One patient experienced a vascular lesion of the popliteal artery during the traumatic event, necessitating revascularization three hours post-injury. Additionally, this patient developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a severe deep infection.
Four patients exhibited neurological lesions within the territory of the deep fibular nerve and experienced spontaneous recovery following expectant treatment during outpatient follow-up. All four patients were classified as Fraser type IIC.
Among the patients examined, Doppler ultrasound identified deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 5 individuals, accounting for 17% of the sample. Specifically, cases 3, 5, 7, 11, and 22 in Table 1 were found to have DVT (p = 0.409). Four of these cases involved deep leg veins, while one was located in a deep thigh vein. Notably, all instances of DVT were diagnosed during the period spanning the second to fourth week following the initial trauma.
All five patients diagnosed with DVT were male (p = 0.209), involved in traffic accidents (p = 0.372), and initially treated in the emergency setting with an external fixator (p = 0.570). In two cases (3 and 22), the severity of skin injuries precluded the possibility of converting to internal synthesis, necessitating the use of an external fixator as the definitive treatment. The definitive treatments administered in the remaining three cases included plate/screw fixation in the femur and external fixator in the tibia, retrograde intramedullary nail osteosynthesis in the femur, and plate/screw fixation in the tibia along with an external fixator, respectively.
Among the patients diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), 80% fell under the Fraser I classification while the remaining 20% were categorized as Fraser IIC (p=0.480). Notably, all individuals in this cohort had experienced high-energy trauma, with 60% being involved in motorcycle accidents and the remaining 40% in automobile accidents (p = 0.372).
In four cases, clinical treatment involved full heparinization at a dosage of 60mg per day, while one case required vena cava filter placement. For the cases that were converted for internal synthesis, surgical intervention took place subsequent to the diagnosis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis, following approval from the institution's vascular surgery team.
Our study revealed that male patients categorized as Fraser I have a higher propensity for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and display elevated indices of concomitant injuries, particularly other fractures, which are considered rare occurrences with uncertain incidence rates. Furthermore, these individuals are at an increased risk of sustaining additional associated injuries, including organ damage that could potentially lead to fatal outcomes.
In the current study, the majority of patients were males in their thirties, a trend also noted in a previous study that identified 238 cases of floating knee, with a predominance of males (85%) in the same age group. The current research revealed that the patients predominantly suffered high-energy trauma from traffic accidents, particularly involving motorcycles. These findings align with those of Rethnam et al.11, who similarly reported that 27 out of 29 cases of floating knee were a result of traffic accidents.
In a retrospective study involving 172 cases of floating knee, the distribution was as follows: 71.5% were classified as Fraser type I, 8.2% as type IIA, 11.2% as type IIB, and 8.7% as type IIC. This distribution mirrors the findings of the present study, where the majority of cases (63%) were categorized as Fraser type I.
In the vast majority of patients included in this study, the primary emergency treatment administered was external fixation. This choice could be attributed to the severity of the patients upon arrival, as most of them had sustained injuries from high-energy trauma, as indicated in Table 1. These results align with a study conducted by Marco et al., where 64.71% of patients with floating knee injuries underwent external fixation as an initial measure to stabilize fractures upon hospital admission.
In their research, Kapoor et al. (14) examined 125 patients with lower limb fractures and identified DVT positivity in 6 cases. Specifically, within the cohort, 47 patients had periacetabular fractures, with 4 individuals (8.51%) developing DVT, and 8 sustaining floating knee, 2 of whom experienced DVT. Notably, none of these patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis. The current study revealed a DVT incidence of 17% among patients with floating knee, despite the implementation of antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The variables examined, including sex, dominant limb affected, Fraser classification, trauma mechanisms, and emergency treatment, did not demonstrate statistical significance as risk factors for the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with a floating knee within the studied sample.
Donath et al. (Year) reported a higher incidence of distal thrombotic events when fondaparinux was used as antithrombotic prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery compared to enoxaparin. However, the present study did not find any statistical significance in this relationship.
Early diagnosis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can significantly reduce complications associated with this condition. In a study involving five patients diagnosed using venous Doppler ultrasound, none exhibited symptoms of pulmonary thromboembolism.
One primary limitation of this investigation was the brief follow-up period, a constraint inherent to its retrospective nature. The initial fixation method involving an external fixator was identified as a drawback due to the extended period of restriction and immobilization it necessitates, further compounded by the failure to confirm the presence of other concomitant injuries like knee ligament damage. It is worth noting that the reported incidence might be underestimated, as Doppler ultrasound was exclusively employed in cases exhibiting symptoms.
However, we have presented a substantial number of cases involving a rare lesion, supported by a significant volume of data. Our future plans include the execution of a prospective randomized study with a more extensive cohort of cases in the imminent future.
Despite the implementation of antithrombotic prophylaxis in these patients, a notable prevalence of deep vein thrombosis was observed among individuals with floating knee injuries. Factors such as Fraser I fractures, male gender, and injury to the non-dominant limb were identified as contributors to the heightened risk of developing DVT in this patient population.
