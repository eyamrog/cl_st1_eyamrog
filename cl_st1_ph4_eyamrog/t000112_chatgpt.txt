In 2021, Brazil initiated a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign, yet the emergence of the P.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2, known for its increased transmissibility and resistance to previous immunity, swiftly resulted in a significant surge in COVID-19 mortality rates. To investigate the evolution of COVID-19 mortality rates as vaccination efforts progressed in Brazil throughout 2021, secondary data on COVID-19 deaths and vaccination coverage were analyzed. Utilizing Poisson regression with adjustments for age and federal states, mortality rates were calculated. By mid-April 2021, mortality rates had surged 2-3 times compared to the already elevated levels in January, particularly affecting individuals aged 60 and above, with rates peaking at 5-15 per 100,000 in this age group. Despite a subsequent decline in mortality rates, by the end of May, rates remained approximately 50% and 80% higher for individuals aged 40-79 and 80 and above, respectively. While the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine had reached 80% coverage for those aged 60-69 and exceeded 95% for individuals aged 70 and above, the second dose had only been administered to 26%, 76%, and 64% of those in the 60-69, 70-79, and 80 and above age groups. Throughout the study period, the average age-standardized mortality rate was highest in the northern Brazilian states of Rondônia, Amazonas, Acre, and Roraima, ranging from 6 to 8.4 per 100,000. The findings underscore the insufficient vaccination coverage in Brazil between January and May 2021, necessitating immediate actions to enhance vaccine distribution and promote adherence to non-pharmacological preventive measures.
The surge in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and fatalities in Brazil in 2021 was closely linked to the emergence and spread of the P.1 variant, alongside a notable rise in hospitalizations and deaths among the non-elderly population. This new variant, characterized by increased transmissibility and resistance to prior immunity from other strains, exacerbated the strain on healthcare systems. The surge in demand for oxygen and intensive care services surpassed existing capacities, leading to widespread chaos and prolonged wait times for patients in need of critical medical attention. While this crisis was felt nationwide, the state of Amazonas faced particularly dire circumstances.
By the end of May 2021, nearly all Brazilians aged 70 years or older had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, while the percentage dropped to 80% in the 60-69 age group. A simulation study from the UK indicated a significant decrease in mortality rates among the vaccinated population compared to the non-vaccinated group, although the latter also benefits from herd immunity, particularly once 50% of the adult population is vaccinated. In Brazil, vaccination progress had surpassed 20% for the initial dose and approximately 10% for the second dose by the end of May 2021. This report aims to analyze the changing COVID-19 mortality rates, considering the age demographics of the population, as the COVID-19 vaccination campaign progressed in Brazil throughout 2021, both at a national level and across individual states.
Data sources for this study comprised a death registry compiled by a non-governmental organization, vaccination data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health available on its website, and population statistics for the country. The death registry primarily featured principal causes of death categorized into six broad groups (COVID-19, other serious acute respiratory illnesses, other respiratory diseases, septicemia, other causes, unknown causes), along with details such as state, municipality of residence, gender, age bracket, and place of death. Any indication of COVID-19 or Coronavirus on a death certificate with the ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 prompted a COVID-19 diagnosis, confirmed by laboratory tests (ICD-10 codes B34.2 + U07.1), clinical examination, clinical and epidemiological criteria, or imaging, or suspected (ICD-10 codes B34.2 + U07.2) if these criteria were not met. This comprehensive case definition aimed to address the lack of timely laboratory testing, enhancing the sensitivity of epidemiological surveillance at the expense of specificity. Deaths with undetermined causes were classified under ICD-10 chapter XVIII. The location of death encompassed hospitals, community health centers, other healthcare facilities, homes, streets, ambulances, or other sites. Age groups were delineated as 0-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80 years or older for the purposes of this study.
The vaccination data included socio-demographic information such as sex, age, state, municipality, race, and nationality, as well as details about the vaccine, including the producer, batch number, country of origin, importation and application dates, and whether the dose administered was the first, second, or unique. Population data for municipalities and states within corresponding age groups used for mortality data analysis was obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography (IBGE).
Both death certificate and vaccination data are being updated on a daily basis.
The number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 but classified as unknown causes (Na) was calculated using the formula: Na = (Nc / Nt) Nu, where Nc, Nt, and Nu denote the reported COVID-19 deaths, total deaths, and deaths of unknown origin, respectively. Consequently, the total estimated COVID-19 deaths (Ntot) were determined as Ntot = Nc + Na.
The adjustment described above is a standard procedure that involves the proportional redistribution of unknown causes of death based on the proportions of known causes. These proportions were calculated for each combination of state/district and sex-by-age group.
Poisson regression was employed with COVID-19 death count as the dependent variable to assess the impacts of five distinct periods in 2021 (1 January to 19 March, 20-29 March, 30 March to 14 April, 15 April to 11 May, and 12-27 May) across various age groups and federal states/districts. Age-adjusted and state-specific marginal rates were calculated for each analyzed period, involving direct standardization of the marginal rates with age-group-specific exposure time as an offset. The model included twenty-seven federal states and the district as fixed effects. Exposure time for each state/district, age group, and period was determined by multiplying the corresponding population with the duration of the period. In the final period examined, a locally weighted regression ("lowess”) was utilized to correlate COVID-19 marginal rates with the coverage of the first and second doses of the vaccine across federal states, separately for each of the three oldest age groups. Data management and statistical analyses were conducted using Stata13.
The demarcation between the initial and subsequent periods was determined based on the milestone of 90% of individuals aged 80 and above receiving a minimum of one dose of the anti-COVID-19 vaccine, as per official records. In the subsequent phase, stringent social distancing protocols were implemented on a national scale to mitigate the escalation of the COVID-19 outbreak and address the strain on the national healthcare system, particularly the shortage of intensive care facilities. The subsequent phase witnessed a partial relaxation of these measures, albeit with varying degrees of reinforcement across different regions. The fourth and fifth phases were characterized by a decline in COVID-19 morbidity rates, with the conclusion of the final phase coinciding with 20% of the populace having received at least one dose of the anti-COVID-19 vaccine.
By the final week of May 2021, approximately 80% of the administered vaccine doses consisted of CoronaVac, developed by Sinovac (China), with 18% being AZD122(ChAdOx1-S) from Oxford/AstraZeneca, primarily sourced from the Serum Institute in India. First-dose vaccination coverage for the age groups of 60-69, 70-79, and 80 years or older stood at 80%, 96%, and 99%, respectively (see Figure 1). However, second-dose vaccination coverage was notably lower at 26%, 76%, and 64% for the same age brackets. Individuals aged 60 years or older exhibited a second-dose vaccination coverage rate of 46.2%.
Although approximately 4.3 million Brazilians aged 80 years or older exhibited the highest vaccination coverage, the mortality rate (MR) within this age group was the most elevated throughout the period under examination (Figure 2). The MR experienced a rapid escalation during the initial phase up to mid-April, followed by a significant decline across all age categories of 60 years and above. Individuals below 60 years of age, with an MR of less than 5 per 100,000 inhabitants per day and a vaccination coverage below 20%, could be deemed as having low rates. However, the MR among individuals aged 40-59 years surged by approximately 50% during the period, rising from 1 to 1.5 per 100,000 inhabitants per day. Those aged 60-69 and 70-79 years witnessed a comparable increase, while individuals aged 80 years or older experienced a 70% rise over the same timeframe.
Both measles and vaccination coverage exhibited significant variability across federal states, as illustrated in Table 1 and Figure 3. The highest age-adjusted average measles rate per 100,000 inhabitants per day during the study period was noted in the northern states of Rondônia, Amazonas, Acre, and Roraima, ranging from 6.00 to 8.39, followed by the midwestern states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Goiás, with rates ranging from 4.63 to 5.02. São Paulo, a southeastern state, reported a rate of 4.21, while the southern states of Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, and Paraná had rates ranging from 3.80 to 4.27. The nationwide measles rate over the study period stood at 0.78 per 100,000 inhabitants per day.
In the three oldest age groups, the data suggests that the highest levels of vaccination coverage with both the first and second doses are associated with a slight reduction in MR, as depicted in Figure 3. However, it is important to note that this trend did not reach statistical significance. Conversely, a contrasting trend was noted among individuals aged 60-69 years.
The solid line in the graph represents the locally weighted regression trend. The state and district codes are as follows: 11 for Rondônia, 12 for Acre, 13 for Amazonas, 14 for Roraima, 15 for Pará, 16 for Amapa, 17 for Tocantins, 21 for Maranhão, 22 for Piauí, 23 for Ceará, 24 for Rio Grande do Norte, 25 for Paraíba, 26 for Pernambuco, 27 for Alagoas, 28 for Sergipe, 29 for Bahia, 31 for Minas Gerais, 32 for Espirito Santo, 33 for Rio de Janeiro, 35 for São Paulo, 41 for Paraná, 42 for Santa Catarina, 43 for Rio Grande do Sul, 50 for Mato Grosso do Sul, 51 for Mato Grosso, 52 for Goiás, and 53 for the Distrito Federal.
Despite the progress made in COVID-19 vaccination efforts in Brazil during 2021, mortality rates (MR) associated with the virus continued to increase, particularly among individuals aged 80 and above. The slow pace of vaccination administration for the initial dose resulted in 20% of individuals in the 60-69 age group remaining unvaccinated. Furthermore, the low rate of uptake for the second dose contributed to a lack of protection against severe COVID-19. With social distancing levels below 50% across most regions, particularly among younger demographics, the elderly, who often rely on younger individuals for daily assistance, are left particularly vulnerable. Many older adults are unaware that full immunity against COVID-19 is only achieved approximately three weeks after receiving the second dose of the vaccines available in Brazil, leading to an underestimation of infection risks following the initial dose. A nationwide study in Brazil revealed a higher prevalence of COVID-19 comorbidities among older individuals, significantly increasing their risk of mortality compared to younger age groups. These factors collectively elucidate the seemingly contradictory observation of elevated and rapidly escalating COVID-19 mortality rates within the age group that exhibited the highest vaccination coverage between January and May 2021.
Only one nationwide study has provided estimates of COVID-19 deaths (excluding MR) among older Brazilians in 2020, focusing solely on those in long-term care facilities and relying on lethality data from other countries. This study revealed over 117,000 deaths within this age group, accounting for nearly 45% of all COVID-19-related deaths in Brazil. Another study, centered on the initial two months of the epidemic in Ceará in 2020, identified a mortality rate 3.6 times higher among the elderly due to underlying health conditions. Comorbidities were highlighted as primary contributors to increased COVID-19 mortality in recent reviews, alongside compromised immunity. The findings of our current study align with these observations on a national scale in 2021. Notably, individuals below 60 years of age exhibited minimal vaccination coverage, with a relatively stable COVID-19 mortality rate below 40 years. Conversely, among those aged 60 and above, where initial dose vaccination rates neared 90%, a substantial decline in mortality rates has been observed since mid-April.
In the Serrana municipality of São Paulo state, the vaccination campaign achieved an impressive coverage of nearly 96% of the population aged 18 years or older, administering two doses of CoronaVac between February and April 2021. This initiative led to a substantial reduction in COVID-19 mortality, hospitalizations, and asymptomatic cases by 95%, 86%, and 85%, respectively. While the safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac have been previously established in phase 1/2 clinical trials for individuals aged 18-59 and 60 years or older, the community trial in Serrana demonstrated both direct and indirect (herd immunity) effects. Concurrently, a similar study is underway utilizing the AZD122(ChAdOx1-S) vaccine developed by Oxford/AstraZeneca in collaboration with the Fiocruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The ecological design of the current study does not permit definitive conclusions regarding vaccine effectiveness. However, on a descriptive level, the observed decrease in COVID-19 mortality rates for individuals aged 70 years or older with high vaccination coverage appears to be intuitive (Figure 3). Conversely, the contrasting trend among individuals aged 60-69 years could potentially be attributed to the prioritization of individuals with comorbidities and a higher utilization of the AstraZeneca vaccine within this age group. This practice may have resulted in a significant gap of over three months between the initial dose and the attainment of full immunity, which was only achieved several weeks after the second dose. Additionally, many individuals in this age bracket were employed outside their homes, leading to challenges in adhering to social distancing measures due to the use of public transportation or direct client interactions. Nevertheless, the available data in this study do not permit the verification of these hypotheses.
The strengths of the present study lie in several key aspects. Firstly, the COVID-19 diagnosis was primarily based on medical records, with over 90% of cases being laboratory-confirmed. This approach ensures a high level of accuracy in the data. Additionally, the study encompassed individuals across all age groups, providing a comprehensive overview of the impact of COVID-19 across different demographics. Furthermore, the research presented data on both the first and second dose vaccination coverage, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the effectiveness of vaccination efforts. By relating these vaccination rates to age-standardized COVID-19 mortality rates, the study accounts for variations in the percentage of older individuals within different states. This adjustment is crucial as older populations often have higher rates of chronic diseases, which can increase the risk of death from COVID-19 due to comorbidities. Moreover, the use of age-standardization enables a comparison of the collective influence of state-specific factors, including vaccination coverage, social distancing measures, access to medical care, and non-pharmaceutical interventions. While the study acknowledges the importance of these factors, it does not delve into quantifying the individual contributions of each element, as this falls outside the scope of the research.
Several limitations were identified in the study, including the potential for misdiagnosis and reporting delays in COVID-19 deaths. The accuracy of diagnoses heavily relies on the availability of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which vary significantly in Brazil. Additionally, reporting delays were estimated to be up to two weeks in the data source utilized for this study. Moreover, there was an estimated underestimation of COVID-19 mortality rates in 2020, ranging from 20-25% nationwide, a trend likely to have persisted into 2021. The selection of dates to delineate the analyzed periods was somewhat arbitrary, although it is unlikely that an alternative choice would have significantly altered the main findings. Furthermore, the extent and duration of social distancing measures varied widely across the country, as did the adherence to these measures.
The proportional redistribution of unknown causes of death based on known ones relies on the assumption that both distributions are equal across state/district and sex-by-age group, though this assumption may not always hold true. While investigation methods could be more reliable, they are not feasible when working with secondary data. However, it is highly improbable that forgoing this redistribution method would lead to less biased estimates, particularly considering the significant variation in the quality of death registers across states, the novelty of COVID-19, and the absence of widespread laboratory testing for the virus. Therefore, the balance between sensitivity and specificity bias suggests that prioritizing sensitivity is more crucial in this context.
The rapid dissemination of the P.1 variant from Amazonas in the north to the southern regions and throughout Brazil was concurrent with a sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases and fatalities, resulting in the overwhelming of the national healthcare system. However, attributing the exact contribution of this variant to the rise in COVID-19 mortality in Brazil in 2021 proves challenging due to limited data availability, particularly during periods of heightened viral transmission. A similar challenge exists in assessing the efficacy of anti-COVID-19 vaccines, although a notable decline in mortality rates since mid-April coincided with a high first-dose coverage (approximately 90%) among individuals aged 60 and above. Nevertheless, the second-dose coverage has only recently surpassed 10%, representing a significant obstacle in the vaccination of elderly Brazilians. Without prompt actions to enhance vaccine uptake and implement non-pharmaceutical protective measures, the persistently high COVID-19 mortality rates are likely to endure.
In conclusion, the coverage of anti-COVID-19 vaccinations with two doses in Brazil was insufficient to adequately protect the elderly population from increasing mortality rates between January and mid-April 2021. During this timeframe, the highest mortality rates per 100,000 individuals were observed among those aged 80 years and older, followed by the age groups of 70-79 and 60-69 years. Immediate actions are imperative to enhance vaccine uptake and promote adherence to non-pharmacological protective measures.
