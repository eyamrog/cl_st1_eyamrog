The global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted over 1,300,000 individuals worldwide. This virus operates by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Notably, COVID-19 is frequently associated with cardiovascular comorbidities, with myocarditis developing in approximately 10% of cases (rising to 22% among critical patients). The ongoing debate surrounds the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, crucial medications for managing hypertension and heart failure in COVID-19 patients, necessitating further investigation. Encouragingly, intensive research efforts are underway to enhance the treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been classified as a global pandemic, with infected patients reported in 167 countries worldwide as of March 28, 2020, totaling over 1,300,000 cases and approximately 69,780 deaths. The outbreak initially emerged in China, but the number of cases outside China has now surpassed those within the country, steadily rising as of the aforementioned date. Notably, Italy has recorded a death toll exceeding three times the total number in China. COVID-19's impact on the cardiovascular system is significant, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality by inducing myocardial dysfunction in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities.
COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents the seventh known human coronavirus, characterized by a single-chain envelope structure. Distinguishing itself from its predecessors, such as the zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a genetic makeup that shares 89% to 96% nucleotide similarity with bat coronaviruses, suggesting a likely origin from bats, akin to other coronaviruses. Similar to the transmission patterns observed in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have the ability to jump from bats to an intermediary host, potentially a Malayan pangolin with a 91% nucleotide identity, before infecting humans.
SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Figure 1) following activation of the spike protein by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). ACE2 is predominantly expressed in the lung, specifically in type II alveolar cells, making it the primary entry point for the virus. In cases of heightened renin-angiotensin system activity, such as in hypertension (HT), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atherosclerosis, ACE2 is also significantly present in the heart. Furthermore, ACE2 is found in various other tissues including the lung, intestinal epithelium, vascular endothelium, and kidneys, contributing to the development of multiple organ failure in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mounting evidence linking COVID-19 with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) underscores the importance of understanding these interactions. This review aims to provide current insights into the rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic, particularly focusing on its implications for cardiovascular health.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was a prevalent comorbidity in SARS and MERS infections prior to the emergence of COVID-19. In SARS, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and CVD was reported at 11% and 8%, respectively, with the coexistence of both conditions associated with a twelve-fold increase in the risk of mortality. Similarly, DM and hypertension (HT) were common in around 50% of MERS cases. The significance of cardiovascular comorbidities extends to COVID-19, particularly in more severe cases. In Wuhan, 30% of infected patients (48% of survivors) had HT, 19% had DM (31% of survivors), and 8% had CVD (13% of survivors). A study involving 138 COVID-19 patients revealed a high prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities (46% overall, 72% in intensive care patients), with 31% having HT (58% in intensive care patients), 15% with CVD (25% in intensive care patients), and 10% with DM (22% in intensive care patients).
In a cohort analysis of 1,099 outpatients and inpatients, it was found that 24% had some form of comorbidity, with the highest prevalence (58%) observed among those who required intubation or succumbed to the illness. Additionally, 15% had hypertension (with 36% among those who required intubation or died), 7.4% had diabetes mellitus (with 27% among those who required intubation or died), and 2.5% had kidney, vascular, or heart diseases (with 9% among those who required intubation or died). The Chinese National Health Commission reported that 35% of COVID-19 patients had hypertension, while 17% had coronary heart disease. A meta-analysis in China, involving 46,248 infected individuals, highlighted hypertension as the most prevalent comorbidity. These associations are believed to be more common in individuals of advanced age, with compromised immune systems, elevated ACE2 levels, or a predisposition to cardiovascular diseases. Another study in China revealed that the most common comorbidity among COVID-19 fatalities was cardiovascular disease, accounting for 10.5% of deaths (see Figure 2).
Myocardial damage, characterized by elevated cardiac biomarkers, was one of the initial manifestations observed in China. A study involving 138 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan revealed that cardiac injury, as indicated by high sensitivity Troponin I (hs-cTnI) levels and ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities, was present in 7.2% of all patients and in 22% of those requiring intensive care. The Chinese national health report highlighted that around 12% of patients without pre-existing cardiovascular disease exhibited elevated troponin levels or experienced cardiac events during hospitalization. Notably, hs-cTnI levels surpassed the 99th percentile upper reference limit in 46% of survivors.
Preliminary findings indicate the presence of two distinct myocardial damage patterns associated with COVID-19. A study revealed that survivors exhibited a median hs-cTnI level of 8.8 pg/mL on the fourth day post-symptom onset, whereas those who succumbed to the disease had a significantly lower level of 2.5 pg/mL. Throughout the follow-up period, the mean hs-cTnI levels among survivors remained relatively stable, ranging from 2.5 to 4.4 pg/mL. However, a notable increase was observed on subsequent days: 24.7 pg/mL on the seventh day, 55.7 pg/mL on the 13th day, 134.5 pg/mL on the 19th day, and 290.6 pg/mL on the 22nd day. Notably, the average duration from symptom onset to mortality was recorded at 18.5 days (with an interquartile range of 15 to 20 days).
The elevated hs-cTnI level correlated with other inflammatory biomarkers such as D-dimer, ferritin, interleukin-6 (ILâ€‘6), and lactate dehydrogenase, contributing to the cytokine storm or secondary hemophagocytosis. Cases of viral myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy are frequently observed in individuals presenting with cardiac symptoms. A recent case highlighted a patient experiencing chest pain with ST-segment elevation on ECG but normal coronaries. This patient exhibited a reduced ejection fraction (27%), increased left ventricular diameters, and elevated cardiac biomarkers (troponin T > 10 ng/mL, NT-proBNP > 21,000 pg/mL). Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids resulted in improved cardiac function within three weeks.
In a separate study conducted in China, a 63-year-old male devoid of any prior cardiac issues exhibited severe respiratory symptoms, an enlarged left ventricle (LVEDD 6.1 cm), and fulminant myocarditis accompanied by a diminished EF. Elevated levels of troponin-I (> 11 ng/mL) and NT-proBNP (> 22,000 pg/ml) were observed in this individual. Given the critical cardiogenic shock scenario, the patient underwent treatment involving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and antiviral medications. Remarkably, there was a significant improvement in ventricular function noted within a span of 2 weeks.
Glucocorticoid therapy is not recommended by the World Health Organization due to the uncertain effects of this treatment. China's national report has indicated that symptoms such as palpitations and chest pain are rare. Limited data suggests a lower incidence of fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock, but the recovery rate and treatment approach have not reached a systematic level.
The precise mechanism of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 remains a subject of ongoing investigation. One potential pathway is the direct myocardial involvement mediated by ACE2. Studies have shown that ACE2-mediated myocardial infection was observed in a murine model following SARS-CoV pulmonary infection. In the context of the Toronto SARS epidemic, viral RNA of SARS-CoV was detected in 35% of autopsies. Other potential mechanisms of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 include a cytokine storm triggered by an imbalanced response between T helper cell subtypes, as well as excess intracellular calcium leading to hypoxic cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
ACE2, an ACE homolog, functions by converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, thereby reducing vasoconstriction mediated by the renin-angiotensin system. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is prevalent in cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus (DM). Studies present conflicting data regarding the impact of these drugs on ACE2 levels. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 relies on ACE2 for cell entry, despite ACE2 playing a protective role against acute lung injury.
In a murine model, the binding of the SARS-CoV spike protein to ACE2 leads to ACE2 downregulation, elevated angiotensin II levels, increased pulmonary vascular permeability, pulmonary edema, and compromised lung function. Nevertheless, treatment with recombinant ACE2 and losartan has shown promise in mitigating lung injury. Ongoing studies are investigating the potential of losartan in reducing lung damage in COVID-19 patients. As of now, there are no definitive recommendations regarding the use or cessation of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or other renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists. Given the current lack of evidence on the adverse effects of RAAS antagonists, RAAS therapy is being maintained in COVID-19 cases.
In their study, Peng et al. (30) found that individuals with COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease (CVD) faced an elevated risk of mortality. Notably, critical patients exhibited decreased lymphocyte counts and elevated body mass index (BMI). The use of ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) did not show a significant impact on morbidity or mortality among COVID-19 patients with CVD. Factors exacerbating mortality included intense inflammation, lactic acid buildup, and thrombotic incidents.
The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted significant harm on both the health and economy of China, leading to a pressing need to address aortic diseases within this context. Urgent challenges include the swift and accurate diagnosis of these conditions, ensuring safe and effective transportation of patients, implementing interventional procedures, safeguarding the vascular surgery team, managing postoperative care, and conducting follow-up assessments. Further research is essential to mitigate complications in vascular diseases, address critical emergencies in vascular surgery, and effectively manage routine vascular conditions amidst the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Additional studies are warranted to enhance the overall care and outcomes for patients facing aortic diseases during this challenging period.
Ribavirin and remdesivir are two agents that bind to the active site on RNA-dependent RNA polymerases on SARS-CoV-2. However, lopinavir/ritonavir inhibits the replication of the RNA virus and has shown a synergistic effect with ribavirin. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating the efficacy of ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19, with these antivirals having been utilized as components of hepatitis C and HIV treatment for an extended period.
Ribavirin is not typically associated with direct cardiovascular toxicity, whereas lopinavir/ritonavir has been linked to QT prolongation in individuals with long QT syndrome. Both ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir have the capacity to influence anticoagulant dosing, with ribavirin impacting warfarin doses and caution advised when using CYP3A-mediated drugs like rivaroxaban and apixaban alongside lopinavir/ritonavir treatment.
Lopinavir/ritonavir has the potential to impact the efficacy of P2P12 inhibitors by inhibiting CYP3A4, resulting in reduced serum levels of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites while elevating ticagrelor concentrations. In both the United States and Canada, caution is advised against co-administering these medications with ticagrelor due to the heightened risk of bleeding, as indicated by recommendations.
Clopidogrel, in contrast, may not consistently offer sufficient platelet inhibition when administered concurrently with lopinavir/ritonavir. Prasugrel could be a more favorable choice among P2Y12 inhibitors in the context of lopinavir/ritonavir therapy, although it is contraindicated in scenarios such as a history of stroke or TIA, low BMI, or active pathological bleeding. A test-guided strategy involving alternative antiplatelet agents could be contemplated. The process of switching P2Y12 inhibitors has already been delineated. Cangrelor's metabolism operates independently of hepatic function, thereby minimizing the likelihood of drug interactions. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) also possess the potential to interact with the lopinavir/ritonavir combination, potentially leading to myopathy due to elevated statin levels. Lovastatin and simvastatin are not recommended for co-administration with lopinavir/ritonavir due to the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Other statins, such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, should be administered at the lowest effective dose and should not surpass the maximum recommended dose when used alongside lopinavir/ritonavir.
Remdesivir, a research drug previously assessed during the Ebola epidemic and currently under investigation in COVID-19 patients, has not shown significant cardiovascular toxicities or drug interactions thus far. However, a preliminary evaluation of this drug during the Ebola outbreak did report a case of hypotension leading to cardiac arrest in one patient out of a total of 175 individuals studied.
In addition to antiviral drugs, a plethora of immunomodulators and secondary medications are currently under investigation for their potential in preventing complications arising from COVID-19. Chloroquine, traditionally employed as an antimalarial agent, exhibits the ability to impede virus infection by elevating the endosomal pH necessary for virus/cell fusion, thereby halting SARS-CoV2 activity in vitro. However, it is crucial to note that both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can pose a risk of toxicity to cardiac myocytes. Factors contributing to this risk include prolonged exposure exceeding three months, higher weight-based dosages, pre-existing heart conditions, and kidney failure. The cardiac toxicity associated with chloroquine manifests as either restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy, or conduction abnormalities, believed to stem from the intracellular inhibition of lysosomal enzymes within myocytes.
Moreover, the impact of chloroquine on CYP2D6 inhibition necessitates vigilance when administering beta-blockers like metoprolol, carvedilol, propranolol, or labetalol, which are metabolized through CYP2D6. This interaction can lead to heightened drug concentrations, underscoring the importance of closely monitoring changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Additionally, both chloroquine and beta-blockers carry a potential risk of torsade de pointes in patients with electrolyte imbalances or when used alongside QT-prolonging agents. However, the short-term use of these medications in the context of COVID-19 treatment is associated with a reduced likelihood of experiencing these dose-related adverse effects.
In the management of COVID-19 cases complicated by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), methylprednisolone is currently utilized. However, this steroid is associated with adverse effects such as fluid retention, electrolyte imbalances, and hypertension, as well as potential interactions with warfarin, the mechanism of which remains unclear. Clinicians recommend close monitoring for these drug interactions. Furthermore, the severe manifestation of COVID-19 can complicate the administration of standard cardiovascular medications, potentially exacerbating conditions like ischemic heart disease or heart failure in at-risk patients.
Recent studies have offered encouraging insights into the treatment and monitoring of COVID-19. Diaz et al. (51) demonstrated that ACEi and ARB therapy led to an elevation in the number of ACE2 receptors in experimental animals. These receptors act as attachment points for SARS-CoV-2 virions within the lungs, potentially exacerbating disease severity. COVID-19 has been linked to the suppression of cardiac functions and the induction of myocardial damage. Notably, a history of CAD and elevated levels of cTnI are identified as significant independent markers that influence the clinical progression of individuals with COVID-19 (52).
In hypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus (DM), drugs that enhance ACE2 present a potential risk for severe COVID-19 infection, necessitating close monitoring of ACEi and ARB therapy. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs), which have not demonstrated an impact on ACE2 expression or activity, could serve as a viable alternative treatment for COVID-19 patients. Factors such as age, the presence of underlying conditions, secondary infections, and elevated inflammatory markers in the bloodstream play crucial roles in determining mortality rates in COVID-19 cases. Mortality in COVID-19 cases can be attributed to the development of a virus-triggered "cytokine storm syndrome" or fulminant myocarditis.
The cardiovascular metabolic history of individuals may exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 and significantly impact the prognosis of the disease. Concurrently, a notable increase in myocardial damage has been observed in COVID-19 patients. Recent research has highlighted the potential benefits of chloroquine, an antimalarial medication, in treating individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Given previous successful experiments with chloroquine in antiviral research, the scientific community is increasingly focused on its therapeutic potential for COVID-19. It has been noted that COVID-19 patients with comorbidities tend to experience poorer clinical outcomes compared to those without underlying health conditions. The presence of multiple comorbidities is consistently linked to more adverse clinical results in cases of COVID-19.
Recognizing acute myocarditis as a complication associated with COVID-19 is crucial for the close monitoring of affected patients and enhancing the understanding of public health officials regarding this complication. Clinical surveillance and laboratory tests, particularly monitoring troponin levels, play a vital role in accurately identifying COVID-19 and minimizing transmission. Further research is necessary to ascertain the efficacy of corticosteroids in mitigating the myocardial inflammatory response. It is evident that antiviral medications or chloroquine may play a role in the recovery of COVID-19 patients.
Myocardial injury in the context of COVID-19 carries significant implications, with patients who have a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) but no myocardial damage exhibiting a comparatively more favorable prognosis. The onset of myocardial damage can precipitate cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias, with inflammation emerging as a potential instigator of such injury. Given the heightened risk of myocardial injury, patients necessitate vigilant monitoring and the consideration of diverse treatment approaches. Notably, cardiac damage is prevalent among COVID-19 hospitalized individuals and is intricately linked to in-hospital mortality rates. Further investigation is imperative to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying cardiac injury, emphasizing the importance of meticulous monitoring for complications in the management of COVID-19.
Chen et al. (61) noted that elderly individuals, male patients, and those with diseases associated with high ACE2 expression exhibited a poorer prognosis upon exposure to COVID-19. Based on preclinical evidence, it was suggested that blocking the renin-angiotensin system could potentially mitigate the effects of COVID-19. However, further multicenter studies are required to validate this hypothesis before any recommendations can be made regarding the use of potentially crucial medications (62).
The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, leading to COVID-19, has become a significant issue worldwide. Kidney vascular hypertension (KVH) appears to be more prevalent among COVID-19 patients, contributing to higher morbidity and mortality rates within this population. The question of whether cardiovascular disease (CVD) poses an independent risk factor or if its impact is influenced by other variables such as age remains unresolved. Notably, myocardial damage has been observed in over a quarter of critical cases. Current evidence suggests that clinical administration of ACEi and ARB medications does not pose significant concerns. Ongoing research shows promise in terms of advancing treatment options for COVID-19 patients.
