Presently, doctors and healthcare professionals are grappling with a formidable pandemic stemming from a novel strain known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). The clinical spectrum of human infection with COVID-19 remains incompletely characterized, and the precise understanding of its lethality, mortality, infectivity, and transmissibility is yet to be fully elucidated. Notably, there is currently no specific vaccine or targeted medication available for this viral infection, necessitating a reliance on supportive and nonspecific treatment measures. In Brazil, akin to global trends, the surge in COVID-19 cases has been alarming, resulting in a notable uptick in hospitalizations and mortality rates. Presently, the states with the highest caseloads include São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Distrito Federal, and Ceará. The primary aim of this study is to provide guidance to surgeons on the optimal surgical management of airways in patients suspected or confirmed to have contracted COVID-19.
Doctors and healthcare professionals are currently grappling with a formidable pandemic triggered by a novel strain known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). The clinical spectrum of human infection by COVID-19 remains incompletely characterized, with uncertainties surrounding its lethality, mortality, infectivity, and transmissibility. Notably, there is a lack of a specific vaccine or medication for this virus, necessitating supportive and nonspecific treatment measures. The global incidence of COVID-19 cases has surged significantly, leading to a rise in hospitalizations and mortality rates.
Healthcare professionals working in emergency rooms or with acute care patients must modify their protocols to minimize potential contamination and prevent the spread of diseases. By early March, China had documented over 3,300 cases of infected health workers, resulting in at least 22 fatalities. Adhering to protective measures during invasive procedures is crucial for emergency personnel and surgeons during this period.
Given the direct correlation between establishing a definitive airway and aerosol generation, particularly evident with high-speed flow, it is imperative to prioritize safety measures to mitigate disease transmission risks. Instances of positive pressure ventilation during non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or when utilizing face masks or supraglottic devices are identified as high-risk scenarios for aerosol generation due to inadequate sealing, a factor notably inferior to the effectiveness of a definitive airway with an inflated cuff within the trachea.
Laryngoscopy, tracheal intubation, and bronchoscopy are only likely to increase aerosol production in the presence of a cough stimulus or when other aerosol-generating procedures, such as aspiration, are being carried out. The occurrence of these events that may lead to aerosol production can be mitigated through the use of appropriate neuromuscular blockade and by avoiding the simultaneous performance of multiple procedures.
The aim of this paper is to provide comprehensive guidelines to assist surgeons in the surgical management of airways in patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection.
In the current pandemic scenario, it is imperative that all individuals admitted to emergency departments are regarded as potential carriers of COVID-19 until proven otherwise. Additionally, individuals presenting with respiratory symptoms must be managed as infected individuals until a definitive diagnosis is established, given the absence of a rapid diagnostic test for this context at present.
Airway management in general must adhere to the principles of SAF: Safety, Accuracy, and Swiftness. It should prioritize the safety of both healthcare professionals and patients, ensuring that procedures are carried out with precision and reliability, avoiding the use of untested or repeated techniques. Efficiency is also crucial, with a focus on minimizing delays not only in determining the need for intervention but also in executing the necessary procedures (Figure 1).
One potential avenue for addressing airway obstruction is the use of bronchodilators. These medications work by relaxing the muscles around the airways, allowing for easier breathing. Another approach is the use of corticosteroids, which can help reduce inflammation in the airways. Additionally, mucolytic agents can be employed to thin mucus secretions, making it easier to clear the airways. In severe cases, mechanical interventions such as intubation or tracheostomy may be necessary to maintain a patent airway. It is crucial for healthcare providers to consider these various alternatives when managing patients with airway obstruction to ensure optimal outcomes.
Tracheal intubation (TI) is typically the preferred initial approach, with surgical airway intervention being reserved for situations where TI is not feasible. It is crucial to adhere to established guidelines for managing a challenging airway, prioritizing the use of TI before considering more invasive procedures.
It is recommended to refrain from administering high-flow oxygen.
The physician tasked with conducting airway management should ideally possess a wealth of experience to enhance the likelihood of a successful first tracheal intubation (TI) attempt.
In situations involving a suspected difficult airway, it is advisable to seek the assistance of a skilled professional who has expertise in performing surgical airway procedures.
To optimize patient care, it is advised to limit the number of individuals present at the bedside. The suggested team composition includes three key professionals: the physician, a supporting staff member such as a nurse, and a designated individual responsible for medication administration and monitoring, such as a nurse technician. This streamlined approach aims to enhance efficiency and communication among the healthcare team while ensuring focused and coordinated care delivery to the patient.
In cases where surgical cricothyroidotomy is deemed necessary, it is considered a more effective and safer option compared to needle cricothyroidotomy due to its ability to minimize the dispersion of aerosols. The puncture technique, on the other hand, is typically reserved for rare and extreme emergency situations.
An effort is undertaken to locate and palpate the cricothyroid membrane, presenting two potential scenarios as illustrated in Table 1.
The optimal duration for which a patient can safely remain on tracheal intubation (TI) without the potential for tracheal injury remains a subject of debate. However, various studies have demonstrated the advantages of conducting an early tracheostomy tube placement (TQT), with differing criteria suggesting that this procedure can be carried out within 2, 7, or 10 days following the initiation of mechanical ventilation.
Given that a tracheostomy is an elective procedure, it is advisable to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 beforehand and ensure the patient's clinical stability. This precaution is crucial as tracheostomy is considered a high-risk procedure due to its potential to generate aerosols.
It is imperative to carefully determine and accurately assess the appropriateness of the procedure's indication to mitigate the potential risks associated with disease transmission.
If the COVID-19 test results come back negative, it is advisable to adhere to the standard operating procedure, which includes wearing a liquid-resistant surgical mask, a surgical gown, gloves, and eye protection.
The standard operating procedure for performing a tracheostomy in a patient who is COVID-19 positive or of unknown status is crucial in ensuring the safety of healthcare providers and the patient. This procedure requires meticulous attention to detail and adherence to strict infection control protocols to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus. It is imperative that healthcare professionals involved in performing tracheostomies in such patients are well-trained and equipped with the necessary personal protective equipment to prevent exposure. By following established guidelines and protocols, the risk of complications and potential spread of the virus can be significantly reduced, ultimately leading to better outcomes for both the patient and the healthcare team.
Specialists responsible for administering anesthesia and conducting surgical procedures must prioritize safety, accuracy, and efficiency (SAF) in their practices.
Minimize the team size to include only the necessary professionals.
Preparation and attire are crucial aspects to consider when conducting research. Researchers must ensure they are adequately prepared for their work, which includes having a clear research plan, necessary materials, and a well-defined methodology. Additionally, researchers should dress appropriately for the setting in which they will be conducting their research. This not only reflects professionalism but also helps establish credibility with participants and other stakeholders. Proper attire can also contribute to the overall success of the research project by creating a positive first impression and fostering a conducive environment for data collection. Therefore, researchers should pay careful attention to their preparation and attire to ensure the smooth and effective execution of their research endeavors.
Utilize the FFP3/N95 mask for optimal protection against airborne particles.
When engaging in tracheostomy care tasks (TCT) or replacing a tracheostomy tube, it is imperative to utilize eye and face protection as a precaution against potential exposure to respiratory secretions or bodily fluids. Opting for appropriate protective gear is crucial in minimizing the risk of transmission of infectious agents during these procedures.
A surgical mask with an integrated visor combines the protective benefits of a standard surgical mask with the added advantage of a built-in visor. This innovative design offers increased protection for healthcare workers by shielding their eyes, nose, and mouth from potential contaminants. The integrated visor reduces the need for additional protective gear and simplifies the process of donning and doffing personal protective equipment. This all-in-one solution not only enhances safety but also improves overall comfort and convenience for medical professionals during procedures that may involve splashes or sprays. The integration of a visor into the surgical mask design represents a significant advancement in infection control measures within healthcare settings.
Certainly! Here is the improved passage:

b. Full-face shields or visors provide comprehensive protection for the face, offering a barrier against potential hazards. These shields are designed to cover the entire face, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, ensuring a high level of safety for the wearer. By using a full-face shield or visor, individuals can minimize the risk of exposure to various contaminants or injuries, making them a crucial piece of personal protective equipment in many industries and settings.
Wear disposable gowns that are resistant to liquids and fluids, ensuring they are waterproof. If a permeable gown is utilized, it is essential to wear a disposable plastic gown underneath for added protection. The gown should be sterilized, featuring long sleeves, mesh or elastic cuffs, and a rear opening. Furthermore, it should be constructed from high-quality, non-allergenic, and durable material, providing an effective antimicrobial barrier. It should also allow for comfortable movement during activities and be available in a range of sizes.
Gloves should be comfortable to facilitate precise movements, and the use of "two gloves" should be considered. In certain regions, gloves containing biogel are available, which can help to externalize and indicate a perforation.
Utilize a traditional tracheostomy tube instead of opting for fenestrated models.
Every effort must be exerted to avoid damaging the cuff of the endotracheal tube during tracheostomy care techniques (TCT).
To minimize aerosol dispersion, it is recommended to first advance the endotracheal tube before initiating the tracheostomy tube change (TCT) procedure.
If feasible, cease ventilation during the tracheal incision procedure and ensure that the cuff is adequately inflated before resuming ventilation.
Ventilation should cease prior to the tracheostomy tube insertion, followed by a swift and precise placement of the tube with immediate cuff inflation.
Ensure proper placement, preferably using capnography if it is accessible.
Ensure that there are no leaks and that the tracheostomy tube is securely in place.
An HME type filter (Heat and moisture exchanger) should be positioned on the tracheostome to minimize virus exposure in the event of disconnection. An alternative approach recommended for both elective and emergency procedures involves utilizing an extension obstructed by a syringe plunger, followed by immediate obstruction using forceps, removal of the plunger, and connection to the mechanical ventilation system (see figure 2).
After undergoing a tracheostomy procedure, patients require meticulous post-operative care to prevent complications and promote healing. This care involves monitoring the stoma site for signs of infection, ensuring proper positioning of the tracheostomy tube, and maintaining a clean and dry environment around the stoma. Suctioning should be performed as needed to clear secretions and prevent blockages, while regular dressing changes help prevent infection. Additionally, patients should be closely monitored for signs of respiratory distress, such as increased respiratory rate or difficulty breathing. Education on tracheostomy care should be provided to both patients and caregivers to ensure proper management at home. By adhering to these post-tracheostomy care guidelines, healthcare providers can optimize patient outcomes and minimize the risk of complications.
The Royal College of Anaesthetists recommends avoiding the use of humidified circuits due to the theoretical reduction in the risk of room contamination in the event of an unexpected disconnection from the circuit.
It is recommended to refrain from changing the tracheostomy tube until the patient has tested negative for COVID-19.
Ensure that the inflated cuff is thoroughly checked for any potential leaks.
Make every effort to avoid disconnecting the circuit;
Closed-circuit suction is the recommended method for use in this context.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) constitutes just one component of a comprehensive system aimed at preventing the contamination of healthcare professionals. Alongside the utilization of protective gear, critical procedures including the decontamination of surfaces and equipment, the minimization of unnecessary contact with both patients and surfaces, and meticulous waste management practices are imperative in mitigating risks.
The virus can remain viable in the air for an extended period and on non-absorbent surfaces for many hours, and in some cases, even days. The clearance of infectious particles following an aerosol generating procedure is contingent upon the mechanical or natural ventilation systems in place, as well as the air change rate per hour within the room. It is estimated that a single air change can eliminate approximately 63% of airborne contaminants. Consequently, the minimum duration recommended for cleaning the environment after aerosol release is typically set at 20 minutes.
Currently, airway procedures are classified based on their risk level, with the ranking presented in descending order.
Tracheal intubation is a common medical procedure used to establish and maintain an open airway in patients who are unable to breathe adequately on their own. This technique involves the insertion of a tube into the trachea through the mouth or nose, allowing for the delivery of oxygen and the removal of carbon dioxide. Tracheal intubation is typically performed in emergency situations, such as during surgery, trauma, or respiratory failure, to ensure proper ventilation and oxygenation. It is a critical intervention that requires skill and precision to avoid complications such as injury to the vocal cords, aspiration of gastric contents, or dislodgement of the tube. Proper training and experience are essential for healthcare providers who perform tracheal intubation to ensure the safety and well-being of the patient.
Tracheostomy and cricothyroidotomy are both surgical procedures involving the airway. Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that involves creating an opening in the trachea to help with breathing. This procedure is typically performed in cases where a patient is unable to breathe on their own due to an obstruction or other respiratory issues. On the other hand, cricothyroidotomy is a more invasive procedure that involves making an incision in the cricothyroid membrane to establish an airway. This procedure is usually performed in emergency situations where a patient's airway is severely compromised and traditional methods of intubation are not feasible. Both tracheostomy and cricothyroidotomy are important procedures that can be life-saving in certain medical situations.
Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a widely used technique in the management of respiratory failure, particularly in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). NIV involves the delivery of ventilatory support without the need for an artificial airway, such as an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy. This method is preferred over invasive mechanical ventilation due to its lower risk of complications, reduced need for sedation, and potential to improve patient comfort and outcomes. NIV can effectively improve oxygenation, reduce work of breathing, and alleviate respiratory distress by providing positive pressure support through a mask or nasal prongs. It is crucial for healthcare providers to carefully monitor patients receiving NIV to ensure proper ventilation and oxygenation, as well as to promptly identify and address any signs of treatment failure. Despite its benefits, NIV is not suitable for all patients and may be contraindicated in certain conditions, such as hemodynamic instability, inability to protect the airway, or severe facial trauma. Overall, NIV plays a vital role in the management of respiratory failure and should be considered as a first-line treatment in appropriate clinical scenarios.
The use of ventilation masks has become increasingly prevalent in various settings, particularly in healthcare facilities and public spaces, as a means of reducing the transmission of respiratory infections. These masks are designed to filter out airborne particles, including bacteria and viruses, thereby protecting both the wearer and those around them. Proper ventilation mask usage involves ensuring a snug fit over the nose and mouth, as well as regular replacement to maintain effectiveness. While the efficacy of ventilation masks in preventing the spread of respiratory illnesses has been widely acknowledged, there are ongoing debates regarding their overall effectiveness, particularly in non-medical settings. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of ventilation masks on public health and disease transmission.
Health professionals are on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, facing increased risks of infection. It is crucial to prioritize the provision of personal protective equipment and ensure that it is coupled with procedures tailored to deliver effective care, including surgical interventions, to minimize the risk of transmission. Special attention should be given to procedures involving exposure to patient aerosols, like cricothyroidotomy and tracheostomy, which necessitate tailored approaches and the proper training of emergency physicians and surgeons. In the current scenario, health professionals stand as the most invaluable assets in combating the pandemic.
