Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, managing patients with cardiovascular risk factors or existing conditions poses significant challenges. The cardiovascular complications observed in COVID-19 patients stem from various mechanisms, including direct viral damage and complications arising from inflammatory and thrombotic responses to the infection. Providing optimal care for individuals with COVID-19 necessitates a focused approach towards the cardiovascular system to enhance patient outcomes.
The world is currently grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus disease that first emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The initial cases were characterized by pneumonia that quickly escalated to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
The novel virus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents the seventh identified coronavirus and distinguishes itself from other coronaviruses responsible for common cold and mild pneumonia (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1). SARS-CoV-2 shares similarities with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks in China in 2002-2003 and in the Middle East in 2012, respectively. Despite phylogenetic resemblances to the zoonotic coronaviruses behind SARS and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a significantly higher spread rate, leading to a tenfold faster infection dissemination compared to SARS-CoV. The basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 stands at 2.78, indicating that, on average, each infected individual can transmit the disease to three others. A recent study published in Science utilized a mathematical model to reveal that 85% of COVID-19 transmissions stem from asymptomatic carriers.
The rapid spread of COVID-19 led to its classification as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Currently, the virus has impacted over 181 countries, with the number of cases continuing to rise exponentially. As of April 2, 2020, there were 1,015,403 confirmed cases and 53,030 deaths globally, resulting in a mortality rate of 5.2%. In Brazil, there were 8,044 confirmed cases and 324 deaths by the same date, with a mortality rate of 4%. Initial data from Brazil indicated that 90% of the fatalities were individuals over 60 years old, with 84% having at least one comorbidity, notably 51% with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 37.7% with diabetes.
The analysis of 44,672 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan has revealed an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%. However, among individuals with preexisting comorbidities, the case-fatality rate was notably higher: 10.5% for cardiovascular disease (CVD), 7.3% for diabetes, and 6% for hypertension. Furthermore, COVID-19 has been associated with cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury (20% of cases), arrhythmias (16%), myocarditis (10%), and heart failure (HF) and shock (up to 5% of cases), as reported in various studies.
This review is intended to assist healthcare professionals, including clinicians, emergency physicians, cardiologists, and intensivists, who are responsible for the care of patients with COVID-19. The review proposes an algorithm for cardiovascular assessment to facilitate early detection of complications and recommends specific protocols for the treatment of cardiovascular issues in these patients.
Recent data on the COVID-19 pandemic indicate that the virus can impact the cardiovascular system through various manifestations, including myocardial injury, heart failure, Takotsubo syndrome (TS), arrhythmias, myocarditis, and shock. The damage inflicted by COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is likely multifactorial, stemming from an imbalance between high metabolic demand and low cardiac reserve, systemic inflammation, thrombogenesis, and direct cardiac injury caused by the virus. This cardiovascular damage primarily affects individuals with cardiovascular risk factors such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, or preexisting cardiovascular disease. Illustrated in Figure 1 is the inflammatory response triggered by the viral infection, leading to damage in both the cardiovascular system and lungs. This response is characterized by elevated levels of d-dimer, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, troponin, and NT-proBNP, ultimately resulting in cardiovascular complications and mortality.
The systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by elevated concentrations of cytokines associated with cardiovascular system damage. Troponin levels rise alongside other inflammatory markers like d-dimer, ferritin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and leukocyte count. Zhou et al. demonstrated increased levels of d-dimer, IL-6, ferritin, and LDH, along with lymphopenia, in deceased patients, suggesting prognostic implications for these inflammatory markers. A d-dimer level exceeding 1Âµg/mL upon admission independently predicted mortality in this cohort. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients exhibit heightened BNP or NT-proBNP levels, indicative of myocardial dysfunction. Those with myocardial injury display elevated NT-proBNP levels, showing a positive linear correlation and emphasizing their susceptibility to cardiac function impairment.
A meta-analysis comprising four studies, involving 341 COVID-19 patients, revealed significantly elevated troponin I levels in individuals with severe disease compared to those with non-severe disease. Patients with myocardial injury were more frequently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (22.2% vs. 2.0%), exhibited a higher prevalence of heart failure (52% vs. 12%), and experienced a higher mortality rate (59% vs. 1%). Shi et al., in their assessment of 416 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, found that myocardial injury, defined as troponin levels exceeding the 99th percentile upper reference limit, was a common complication (19.7%) associated with increased mortality and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Their multivariate analysis identified myocardial injury and ARDS as independent predictors of mortality (HR 4.26 and 7.89, respectively). In a recent study, Guo et al. reported elevated troponin levels in 27.8% of 187 COVID-19 patients. Among those without cardiovascular disease (CVD) and normal troponin levels, mortality stood at 7.6%; for patients with CVD and normal troponin levels, mortality was 13.3%; individuals without CVD but with elevated troponin levels had a mortality rate of 37.5%; and those with CVD and elevated troponin levels had a mortality rate of 69.4%. A strong correlation was observed between high troponin levels and increased C-reactive protein and NT-proBNP levels. Patients with elevated troponin levels exhibited a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and an increased need for mechanical ventilation.
Cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, shock, and arrhythmias, are commonly observed in patients with myocardial injury. Within a cohort of 150 patients, 7% experienced irreversible myocardial damage and heart failure, which correlated with significant increases in troponin levels. Malignant arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia progressing to ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamic instability, were more prevalent in individuals with elevated troponin levels (11.5% vs 5.2%). Patients with severe COVID-19 can swiftly progress to significant cardiovascular dysfunction, shock, and multi-organ failure. In two separate Chinese cohorts of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, up to 20% developed the severe form of the disease accompanied by shock.
Myocarditis has been identified as a potential factor contributing to acute heart failure in individuals with COVID-19. Instances of COVID-19-associated myocarditis have been documented, showcasing characteristics such as fulminant myocarditis, rapid deterioration, and notable ventricular impairment accompanied by widespread myocardial edema. These patients exhibited alterations in their electrocardiograms and elevated troponin levels. While Takotsubo syndrome (TS) has not been definitively linked to COVID-19, there have been reported cases of ventricular dysfunction in COVID-19 patients that could potentially be attributed to this syndrome. TS is a common complication in individuals experiencing an exacerbated systemic inflammatory response, where the stress and severity of the viral infection can trigger the onset of TS.
Some research studies have proposed a potential association between the cardiovascular system damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which plays a crucial role in the immune system and is found in significant levels in the lungs and heart. ACE2 functions by down-regulating the angiotensin-renin system through the inactivation of angiotensin-2, potentially offering a protective mechanism against the onset and progression of respiratory failure. The SARS-CoV-2 virus comprises four primary structural proteins: spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins. Specifically, the spike protein of the coronavirus binds to the ACE2 receptor, facilitating viral entry into the host cell (as illustrated in Figure 2), leading to ACE2 inactivation and subsequent pulmonary damage. Given the elevated concentrations of ACE2 in the heart, there is a risk of significant cardiovascular system impairment.
Patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) exhibit elevated serum levels of ACE2, potentially contributing to the more severe outcomes observed in this demographic. Additionally, individuals with hypertension may experience increased ACE2 expression due to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), potentially heightening susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, current human studies are constrained by limitations such as the evaluation of a limited number of individuals on these medications and the advanced age of a significant portion of the patients studied. This advanced age factor is particularly crucial as it not only raises susceptibility to infection but also serves as a significant confounding variable impacting prognosis.
It is important to highlight that despite the significant structural similarity between ACE2 and ACE, their enzyme active sites are distinct. Consequently, ACE inhibitors currently used in clinical practice do not directly impact ACE2 activity. ACE2 is well-known for its role in promoting the recovery of ventricular function in patients with myocardial injury by inhibiting angiotensin II activity. Conversely, angiotensin II has been implicated in the cardiac damage caused by the coronavirus, and the administration of recombinant ACE2 has been proposed to normalize angiotensin II levels. Ongoing studies are investigating the effects of recombinant ACE2 and losartan in this context.
The current recommendation advises that ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be maintained in patients who regularly use these medications due to the proven benefits of blood pressure control and reduced mortality rates in individuals with heart failure, as demonstrated in randomized studies. In cases of severe COVID-19, it is crucial to evaluate hemodynamic stability and renal function on a case-by-case basis before determining whether to continue or discontinue the use of these drugs.
Individuals with cardiovascular risk factors such as advanced age, hypertension, and diabetes, along with those already diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, and cerebrovascular disease, are at a heightened risk for developing severe forms of COVID-19 and experiencing related cardiovascular complications, thus falling into a high-risk category. It has been observed that around 80% of patients with severe COVID-19 also have underlying comorbidities. A compilation of significant studies outlining the clinical comorbidities prevalent in COVID-19 patients is presented in Table 1, referencing key research sources.
A recent meta-analysis comprising eight studies from China, involving 46,248 infected individuals, revealed that the most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (17 Â± 7%), diabetes mellitus (8 Â± 6%), and CVD (5 Â± 4%). Wang et al., focusing solely on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, reported a higher prevalence of hypertension (31.2%), CVD (19.6%), and diabetes (10.1%), underscoring that individuals with these comorbidities tend to experience a more severe form of COVID-19, often necessitating hospitalization. These patients frequently exhibited hypoxemia and required ICU admission. Similarly, advanced age was associated with a more severe disease presentation. Across these studies, the median age ranged from 42 to 64 years, with a higher median age observed in severely ill patients (64 vs 51.5). Furthermore, older patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU and experience hypoxemia.
Cardiovascular complications were prevalent among patients in the at-risk group, with individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD) exhibiting troponin elevation and increased occurrences of shock and arrhythmias. In a study by Guo et al., which involved 187 patients, it was noted that those with myocardial injury had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension (63% vs 28%), diabetes (30.8% vs 8.9%), coronary artery disease (32.7% vs 3%), and heart failure (15.4% vs 0%) compared to those without such injuries. Additionally, this group tended to be older, with a median age of 71.4 years.
In a cohort of 191 patients, Zhou et al. assessed the characteristics of deceased individuals in comparison to those who were discharged. Among the deceased patients, there was a higher prevalence of hypertension (48%), diabetes (31%), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (24%). Advanced age emerged as an independent predictor of mortality, with mortality rates escalating with age: 1.3% for patients aged 50-59 years, 3.6% for those aged 60-69 years, 8% for individuals aged 70-79 years, and 14.8% for those aged 80 years and above. Population studies have indicated an overall mortality rate of 6% in patients with hypertension, 7.3% in patients with diabetes, and 10.5% in patients with CVD.
Patients with cancer are at an elevated risk for contracting COVID-19 due to their compromised immune systems and the potential side effects of their cancer treatment. In China, the prevalence of cancer among confirmed COVID-19 cases has been reported to range from 1% to 7%, surpassing the general incidence of cancer in the country, which stands at 0.2% to 201.7 per 100,000 individuals. Furthermore, individuals with cancer are more likely to experience severe forms of COVID-19 compared to those without cancer, with statistics showing a 39% versus 8% ratio. Specifically, patients who have undergone recent chemotherapy or surgery are at an even higher risk, with 75% developing severe disease in contrast to 43% of those who have not undergone recent treatment.
Cardiovascular assessment of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection is recommended in various scenarios, including preexisting cardiovascular disease or risk factors, the presence of cardiovascular signs and symptoms like dyspnea, shock, chest pain, electrocardiographic abnormalities, or an increased cardiac area, abnormalities in biomarkers such as d-dimer, troponin, NT-proBNP, and ferritin, as well as the necessity for hospitalization. Individuals with cardiovascular disease are particularly susceptible to myocardial injury following SARS-CoV-2 infection and face an elevated risk of mortality. Therefore, it is crucial for cardiologists to be actively involved in the care of critically ill patients, contributing to clinical discussions and treatment decisions.
The initial cardiovascular assessment should include a thorough clinical history, physical examination, troponin levels, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). Elevated troponin levels exceeding the 99th percentile upper reference limit and acute changes on the ECG can aid in identifying patients at increased cardiovascular risk, potentially influencing decisions regarding hospital admission and case management. Figure 3 illustrates the flowchart for cardiovascular assessment in COVID-19 cases.
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is capable of detecting malignant cardiac arrhythmias, which are characterized by sustained ventricular tachycardia leading to hemodynamic instability or ventricular fibrillation. Changes in repolarization indicative of acute ischemia have also been documented, particularly in individuals diagnosed with myocarditis.
The electrocardiogram (ECG) assumes a critical role in monitoring the QTc interval in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin, both of which have been associated with QT interval prolongation. Given the potential for QTc interval abnormalities arising from the combined use of these medications and the likelihood of fluid and electrolyte imbalances in individuals with COVID-19, regular monitoring is imperative. Hospitalized patients should undergo ECG assessment 2-3 hours post the second HCQ dose and subsequently on a daily basis. Should the QTc interval increase by more than 60ms or if the absolute QTc exceeds 500ms (or surpasses 530-550ms with a QRS duration exceeding 120ms), discontinuation of azithromycin or reduction of the HCQ dosage is recommended, with daily ECG evaluations. If ECG alterations persist, a reassessment of the medication's risk-to-benefit ratio is warranted. For outpatients, who may face a lower risk of complications from QT interval prolongation, an initial ECG should be obtained 2-3 hours after HCQ initiation and on the third day of therapy. Consideration should be given to discontinuing therapy if the QTc interval increases by more than 30-60ms or if the absolute QTc surpasses 500ms (or exceeds 530-550ms with a QRS duration exceeding 120ms).
Transthoracic echocardiography is recommended as the primary modality for evaluating cardiac function in patients, ideally conducted in the emergency department using point-of-care or dynamic techniques. This imaging method can reveal both systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction, offering valuable hemodynamic insights crucial for patient management and aiding in the identification of pericardial alterations. It is advisable for all risk categories or individuals necessitating hospitalization. Patients with ventricular impairment are at higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation and experiencing a poorer prognosis. For critically ill patients, regular echocardiographic monitoring, along with meticulous evaluation of hemodynamic parameters and biventricular function, is essential. The identification of ventricular dysfunction warrants invasive hemodynamic monitoring to inform the administration of inotropic agents or circulatory support. In severe cases, dynamic echocardiography should be performed daily and in response to any hemodynamic fluctuations.
Magnetic resonance imaging should be considered in stable patients to aid in the differential diagnosis of ventricular dysfunction etiology, which may be attributed to myocarditis or stress-induced systolic dysfunction. The diagnosis of myocarditis adheres to established criteria validated for various viral etiologies, with observable features such as myocardial edema and non-ischemic myocardial late enhancement.
The initial approach and intensive support in managing COVID-19 patients are crucial. The average time from symptom onset is typically 4-5 days, with 97.5% of those infected developing symptoms within 11.5 days post-exposure. The majority of patients (81%) experience mild symptoms, with fever (88%) and cough (67.7%) being the most common. Less frequent symptoms include diarrhea, myalgia, headache, and runny nose. Around 20% of COVID-19 patients will progress to a severe form characterized by dyspnea, tachypnea, oxygen saturation â¤93%, and pulmonary infiltrate, while 5% will deteriorate to the critical form, exhibiting signs of shock and respiratory failure. Hospitalization is typically unnecessary for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients who are clinically stable, but it is imperative for those with severe symptoms and an unfavorable prognosis.
The initial assessment of patients with COVID-19 should encompass a range of diagnostic tests including ECG, arterial blood gas analysis with lactate level, d-dimer, complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, clotting factors, troponin, creatine phosphokinase, ferritin, LDH, IL-6, and electrolytes (sodium, magnesium, potassium, and calcium). Chest radiography is recommended, with chest computed tomography (CT) being considered in specific cases. CT scans reveal abnormalities in 85% of patients, with 75% exhibiting bilateral pulmonary involvement, typically characterized by ground-glass opacifications and subpleural and peripheral consolidations. Those requiring hospitalization should undergo echocardiography either in the emergency department or within the initial hours of hospital admission.
The clinical course of COVID-19 exhibits variability and potential severity, with 3.4% of patients progressing to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a figure that escalates to 19.6% among hospitalized individuals and 58.5% in those with myocardial injury. ARDS is characterized by acute pulmonary damage, bilateral opacities on chest radiography, and pulmonary edema, as per the Berlin criteria. Severity in ARDS is determined by the relationship between the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), measured under positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of â¥ 5 cm H2O. ARDS is classified as severe when the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is <100.
Mechanical ventilation is advised when hypoxemia persists despite oxygen supplementation. It is crucial to employ protective mechanical ventilation techniques, including a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, maintaining plateau pressure below 30 cm H2O, and adjusting PEEP based on FiO2 levels. Despite severe hypoxemia, patients typically exhibit good pulmonary compliance. In cases of ARDS with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 150 or less, the prone position should be contemplated, and if substantial patient-ventilator dyssynchrony is present, neuromuscular blockade may be warranted.
Hemodynamic monitoring is essential for all ICU patients displaying signs of shock. It is advisable to consider minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring and continuous cardiac output monitoring in conjunction with dynamic echocardiography and the analysis of tissue hypoperfusion markers, including clinical parameters, arterial lactate levels, deltaPCO2, and base excess. In cases of shock, norepinephrine is the preferred drug, with the addition of vasopressin recommended if escalating doses of noradrenaline are required for optimal hemodynamic management. If cardiac dysfunction manifests, dobutamine should be included in the treatment regimen. Norepinephrine should be promptly initiated, even through peripheral access, to prevent prolonged hypotension, which is associated with high mortality rates.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be essential for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure that is unresponsive to initial interventions. Initially, venovenous ECMO is recommended for the restoration of pulmonary function. In cases where there is notable cardiovascular compromise, such as severe ventricular dysfunction or cardiogenic shock, venoarterial ECMO could be a viable option. It is crucial to commence ECMO before the onset of multi-organ failure to maximize its effectiveness.
Currently, the treatment of critically ill patients primarily relies on supportive measures to address organic dysfunctions. Amid the ongoing pandemic, the quest for an effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19 has been paramount. In countries like China and Italy, drugs such as chloroquine (CQ) or HCQ, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir have been administered in severe cases, tailored to individual institutions' protocols. Remdesivir and favipiravir, both broad-spectrum antiviral agents, are undergoing evaluation in randomized clinical trials to ascertain their efficacy and safety in managing COVID-19 patients. Notably, a recent randomized controlled study has revealed the inefficacy of the lopinavir/ritonavir combination, typically used in treating HIV infections, against SARS-CoV-2.
Chloroquine diphosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate are well-established medications used for treating malaria and autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Experimental research indicates that both drugs exhibit activity against SARS-CoV-2 by disrupting ACE2 glycosylation, thereby impeding the binding efficiency between host cell ACE2 and the coronavirus surface protein. Furthermore, they elevate the pH levels within endosomes and lysosomes, preventing viral-cell fusion and subsequent replication. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine hinders the presentation of viral antigens to T cells, suppresses the transcription of proinflammatory genes, and mitigates cytokine release, thereby impeding viral entry, replication, and dampening the inflammatory response. A study in China demonstrated a higher rate of clinical and virological recovery with chloroquine, leading to its adoption for COVID-19 treatment in that region. Another small study reported a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in respiratory samples with hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, although clinical outcomes were not assessed in that study.
The primary adverse effects associated with Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) include gastrointestinal intolerance such as nausea and vomiting, as well as potential long-term complications like retinopathy, maculopathy, and cardiomyopathy. Additionally, common side effects of these medications encompass total atrioventricular block, bundle-branch block, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, torsades de pointes, T-wave inversion, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia, which may become more prevalent with extended usage and in individuals with liver and kidney impairments. A systematic review published by the Journal of Critical Care on March 10, 2020, examined the efficacy and safety of CQ in treating COVID-19, encompassing various sources such as a narrative letter, expert consensus paper, editorial, in-vitro study, national guideline documents, and descriptions of ongoing clinical trials in China. Despite the urging of the United States President on March 21, 2020, for the FDA to expedite the approval of CQ and HCQ for COVID-19 treatment, the FDA currently advocates for compassionate drug use until substantial scientific evidence on the effectiveness of CQ, HCQ, and azithromycin in combating COVID-19 becomes available.
On March 23, 2020, two studies conducted in Brazil received approval from the Brazilian Committee on Ethics in Research (CONEP). The first study, a phase IIb trial, aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CQ diphosphate in treating hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2. This double-blind, randomized clinical trial is a multicenter study involving 440 patients, initiated by the Teaching and Research Board of Fiocruz Amazonas, with 50 patients currently enrolled. The second study focuses on assessing the safety and clinical efficacy of HCQ in combination with azithromycin for patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. This multicenter study, proposed by the Brazilian Israeli Beneficent Society Albert Einstein, involves 400 patients and is awaiting the commencement of recruitment.
Since March 25, 2020, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has sanctioned the use of this drug as an adjuvant solely for treating severe cases of COVID-19, alongside other supportive measures. This decision stems from the absence of any other proven specific treatment currently available, with the understanding that this recommendation remains subject to change based on emerging evidence. A preprint study released on March 31, 2020, by a Chinese research group highlighted the potential efficacy of HCQ in managing mild pneumonia, based on an assessment of 62 patients (including a control group). However, the need for further research with a larger sample size and more rigorous methodology is evident to validate these findings. Additionally, ongoing investigations are exploring the effectiveness of other medications such as glucocorticoids, immunoglobulins, interferon, and tocilizumab.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the context of COVID-19 requires particular caution due to the increased risk of healthcare workers being exposed to aerosolized particles during airway management. It is crucial for all healthcare providers attending to COVID-19 patients to adhere strictly to local and national guidelines on infection control and the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), ensuring that such equipment is easily accessible at all times. This is essential to safeguard the well-being of both patients and healthcare workers in the face of the ongoing pandemic.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who are at risk of acute deterioration or cardiac arrest should be promptly identified, as well as those for whom a 'do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation' directive is applicable, in accordance with local guidelines (Reference 58).
Hypoxia emerges as the primary culprit behind cardiorespiratory arrest in COVID-19 patients, although other potential triggers like hypoglycemia, acidosis, and coronary thrombosis must not be overlooked. Adherence to established algorithms, distinguishing between shockable and non-shockable rhythms, is crucial. Airway management demands the expertise of proficient practitioners. Healthcare providers attending to COVID-19 patients, encompassing physicians, nurses, and physical therapists, face elevated infection risks. Procedures generating aerosols, such as non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula therapy, and bag-valve-mask or bag-tracheal-tube ventilation, present notably heightened hazards.
Bag-valve-mask or bag-tracheal-tube ventilation should be avoided due to the heightened risk of aerosolization and team contamination, and it has not demonstrated superiority over mechanical ventilation. When bag-valve-mask ventilation is necessary, it is crucial for the mask to be properly sealed, a task that necessitates the involvement of multiple professionals. Furthermore, the use of filters between the mask and the bag is essential. For patients requiring such interventions, the prioritization and execution of advanced airway establishment should be entrusted to proficient individuals. In cases where intubation proves unsuccessful or unfeasible, alternative devices like the laryngeal tube or mask should be employed to facilitate closed-circuit mechanical ventilation until definitive airway access is achieved through tracheal intubation or cricothyroidostomy.
In the event of cardiorespiratory arrest in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, it is recommended to keep the patient connected to the ventilator within a closed-circuit system to minimize aerosol contamination during cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures and ventilation. This involves maintaining the FiO2 at 100%, utilizing an asynchronous mode, and setting the respiratory rate between 10-12 breaths per minute, as illustrated in Figure 4 (Reference 56).
The literature suggests that the heightened systemic inflammatory response seen in COVID-19 leads to endothelial dysfunction and increased procoagulant activity, potentially contributing to coronary plaque instability or thrombus formation on a ruptured coronary plaque, thereby increasing plaque vulnerability. It is crucial to differentiate obstructive coronary artery disease from type II myocardial infarction in COVID-19 patients. These individuals may present with acute coronary syndrome due to a mismatch in myocardial oxygen supply and demand, resulting in a diagnosis of type II myocardial infarction. Each case should be carefully assessed, as a significant portion may require conservative management, especially considering that 7% of COVID-19 patients with acute coronary syndrome may have type II myocardial infarction or myocarditis.
When managing acute coronary syndrome in patients with COVID-19, it is crucial to take into account the local resources available, including structured catheterization laboratories, coronary care units, ICU beds, and the adequacy of the environment in terms of protective measures against SARS-CoV-2. A report from China has proposed thrombolysis as the preferred therapy for COVID-19 patients, a recommendation that has sparked controversy, particularly in settings where primary angioplasty can be safely conducted while adhering to all necessary safety protocols to safeguard healthcare workers and maintain a hygienic hospital environment, such as the use of personal protective equipment, negative pressure rooms, and thorough cleaning procedures.
The management of cardiovascular complications necessitates adherence to the recommended therapies outlined in the guidelines, emphasizing the importance of ideal and cautious utilization. Treatment involving ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents, and statins should strictly adhere to the guidelines, taking into consideration contraindications associated with hemodynamic stability and the presence of other organic dysfunctions.
Patients with COVID-19 face an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism due to prolonged physical inactivity and abnormal coagulation parameters. Non-pharmacological prophylaxis strategies are advised for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while pharmacological interventions like unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin should be considered, with careful attention to contraindications and the patient's creatinine clearance. Clinical suspicion of venous thromboembolism should be raised in cases of persistent high d-dimer levels, unresponsive hypoxemia, or the presence of echocardiographic indications of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction.
Due to the rapid and widespread transmission of viruses, social distancing has been identified as a crucial measure in mitigating the rate of spread by minimizing direct interpersonal interactions. In response to environmental challenges or biological threats, the utilization of information technology has become imperative. Telehealth services play a vital role in facilitating remote triage, aiding in disease diagnosis, and maintaining essential access to regular healthcare services in the event of an infectious disease outbreak.
In 2019, the Brazilian Medical Board issued a decree that defined telemedicine as the technology-mediated practice of medicine with a focus on healthcare, education, research, disease and injury prevention, and health promotion, thereby regulating this practice. The Brazilian Society of Cardiology has also released guidelines on telemedicine specifically applied to cardiology, known as telecardiology. Telecardiology, through its involvement in health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation, has a significant impact on improving quality of life and can be seen as a crucial ally to the health system, whether public, supplementary, or private, in delivering comprehensive healthcare. The integration of telecardiology is vital for both primary and specialized healthcare. In the field of cardiology, telemedicine plays a crucial role in managing risk factors like blood pressure and diabetes mellitus, enhancing lipid profiles, weight reduction, and increasing the success rates of smoking cessation programs.
In the current phase of pandemic management, telemedicine has emerged as a valuable resource, particularly for high-risk patients, effectively minimizing exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and aiding in the management of comorbidities. A significant development occurred on March 19, 2020, when the Brazilian Medical Board, aligning with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, acknowledged the ethical viability of telemedicine for teleguidance, teleconsultation, and telemonitoring services.
In terms of general recommendations, it is suggested that further research be conducted to explore the implications of the findings in a broader context. Additionally, it is advised that future studies consider a more diverse sample population to enhance the generalizability of the results. Furthermore, researchers are encouraged to utilize more rigorous research methodologies to strengthen the validity and reliability of the study findings. Lastly, it is recommended that researchers provide clear and concise explanations of their research methods and results to facilitate better understanding and interpretation by the academic community.
Enhance the level of care and preventive measures aimed at combating the novel coronavirus infection within the population affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD) should be effectively managed in accordance with the latest guidelines to ensure optimal treatment for their chronic condition.
Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) must adhere rigorously to a balanced diet, consistent sleep patterns, and regular physical activity while abstaining from tobacco and alcohol consumption.
It is imperative to regularly update vaccines, such as the pneumococcal vaccine, due to the heightened susceptibility to bacterial infections following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Additionally, the influenza vaccine is recommended for individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD) to mitigate the risk of complications associated with influenza infection.
Outpatient appointments, elective tests, and procedures should be deferred if deemed non-essential by clinical judgment, provided that their postponement does not heighten the risk of adverse events or impede the clinical oversight of an underlying cardiovascular disease. Telemedicine can serve as a valuable tool for patient follow-up in such cases.
The participation of healthcare professionals in ward rounds for patients ought to be minimized, with the integration of online discussions.
COVID-19 presents a significant threat due to its potential severity and rapid transmission rate. The existing data primarily stem from retrospective studies, necessitating a careful and nuanced interpretation. Nevertheless, the current body of evidence underscores the critical importance of prioritizing individuals at heightened risk and emphasizing the effective management of cardiovascular complications. Swift identification and the prompt initiation of appropriate treatment strategies are paramount in addressing these concerns.
