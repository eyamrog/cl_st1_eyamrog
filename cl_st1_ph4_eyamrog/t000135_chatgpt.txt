Objective: This study aims to delineate the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on Primary Health Care in Brazil.
Methods: This retrospective ecological study utilized Brazilian municipality data sourced from the National Public Health System's information systems. The study focused on medical appointments, prenatal procedures, and diabetes care as the outcomes of interest. The exposure variable was defined as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, marked by the first reported case in Brazil. To analyze the relationship between the number of procedures per 10,000 inhabitants and COVID-19, multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial regression was employed.
Results: The study encompassed data from 5,564 Brazilian municipalities. Notably, the most substantial decrease in medical appointments due to the pandemic was observed in May, with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.27 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [0.24 – 0.30]. Similarly, prenatal procedures experienced a 65% reduction in May, with an IRR of 0.35 and a 95% CI of [0.32 – 0.38]. Diabetes care exhibited the most pronounced declines in April 2020 (IRR = 0.24, CI 95% [0.11 – 0.53]) and May 2020 (IRR = 0.19, CI 95% [0.09 – 0.43]). Throughout the period from February to December 2020, the pandemic significantly impacted the total number of procedures under evaluation.
In conclusion, the study revealed a decrease in prenatal procedures, diabetes management, and medical consultations conducted within Brazil's Primary Health Care system following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since 2019, the coronavirus pandemic has significantly altered the global landscape and the structure of healthcare services. The initial case of COVID-19 in Brazil was documented in February, and from that point until December 2020, nearly 200 thousand lives were tragically lost, with almost 8 million cases reported. The challenges concerning the healthcare systems' ability to manage the repercussions of the pandemic on a global scale have been extensively discussed in literature, with limitations extending beyond merely addressing cases of the disease. These issues also encompass the ability to meet the additional healthcare needs of the population.
The Unified Health System in Brazil (SUS) encompasses nearly 75% of the Brazilian population, with the supplementary health care system serving the remaining 25%. Amid the pandemic, the System is anticipated to be prepared to offer support for the escalating cases of COVID-19 while also addressing other acute and chronic conditions. Regrettably, shortcomings in Brazil's healthcare networks, which remain fragmented and insufficient, coupled with the absence of coordination among health care hierarchies and underfunding, have been further highlighted during the pandemic.
Primary Health Care (PHC) has been pivotal during the pandemic, showcasing effective care coordination. PHC assumes responsibility for upholding preventive measures, catering to priority demographics, and addressing emergency situations linked to chronic illnesses. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in containing the spread and overseeing mild or asymptomatic cases in home isolation, while actively engaging with the community. The repercussions of the pandemic on PHC and healthcare services in Brazil, particularly concerning certain aspects of care, remain uncertain. Therefore, this article aims to delineate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on Primary Health Care, specifically focusing on medical consultations, diabetes management, and prenatal procedures within the National Health System of Brazil.
This ecological, retrospective, observational study utilized secondary data from multiple public databases, encompassing all 5,564 Brazilian municipalities and drawing information from the National Public System (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS), covering 99.9% of Brazil's total 5,570 municipalities. The study variables were derived from publicly available secondary databases, obviating the need for approval from the Research Ethics Committee. Data collection was conducted by a sole researcher in February 2021.
The study's outcomes focused on the rate of medical procedures, sourced from the Outpatient Information System (SIA-SUS; http://sia.datasus.gov.br/principal/index.php). These procedures were classified into three main groups: a) Medical appointments (including home visits, primary health care appointments); b) Prenatal procedures (partner's prenatal visits, prenatal care, postpartum appointments, rapid HIV testing for expectant parents, rapid pregnancy testing, rapid syphilis testing for expectant parents); c) Diabetes care (diabetes management, diabetic foot exams, urine glucose testing). The total number of procedures across these categories was also computed. Subsequently, the monthly absolute count of procedures per 10,000 residents was determined for each group from February to December in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Population estimates for 2019 were derived from data provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE; http://www.ibge.gov.br).
The exposure variable in this study pertains to the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic and aims to assess the impact of Sars-Cov-19 on the Public Health System in Brazil. To gauge this impact, the rate of procedures during the current pandemic period (February to December 2020) was analyzed on a monthly basis and contrasted with the rates of procedures during the corresponding months in 2019 and 2018 (pre-pandemic) to mitigate seasonal variations. It is presumed that the initial confirmed case of Sars-Covid-19 in Brazil emerged in February 2020.
The confounding variable assessed in this study was the population size of municipalities, sourced from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and categorized as follows: a) ≤ 20,000 inhabitants; b) 20,001 to 50,000 inhabitants; c) 50,001 to 150,000 inhabitants; d) > 150,000 inhabitants. Data concerning the coverage by the Family Health Strategy and Oral Health Teams were gathered monthly (Proportion -%) at the municipal level, retrieved from primary care databases, and classified as: a) absent (0%); b) incipient (< 30%); c) intermediate (30 - 70%); and d) consolidated (≥ 70%). Municipalities with an HDI below 0.55 were labeled as low HDI, between 0.55 and 0.699 as average HDI, between 0.70 and 0.799 as high HDI, and with an HDI of 0.80 or higher as very high. The Gini index, obtained from the United Nations Development Program databases, was utilized continuously in the model. Brazil is geographically divided into five regions: Southeast, South, Midwest, North, and Northeast. The proportion of physicians and nurses per 10,000 inhabitants for 2020 was sourced from the National Register of Health Establishments (CNES), human resources section. Furthermore, the rate of basic health units per 10,000 inhabitants was calculated.
The analysis was conducted using STATA 16.0 software (https://www.stata.com). Descriptive analysis entailed the calculation of mean rates, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median values of the variables. To investigate the association between the procedures and the impact of COVID-19 from February 2018 to December 2020, multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial regression was employed. A stepwise backward procedure was utilized to select variables for the adjusted model, with only those presenting a p-value < 0.250 being retained in the final model. Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated in the regressions.
Of the 5,570 municipalities in Brazil, 99.9% were included in the current sample. Table 1 presents the rates of procedures and the corresponding characteristics of the co-variables. The average rate of medical appointment procedures per 10 thousand inhabitants per month before the pandemic was 424.1 (SD 5,626.2) procedures, while during the pandemic period, it was 232.7 (SD 1,471.3). Prior to the pandemic, the rate of prenatal procedures was 23.6 (SD 759.8), which decreased to 13.2 (SD 650.6) during the pandemic period.
Table 2 presents the incidence rate ratio of the monthly investigated procedures during the pandemic period compared to the corresponding months in 2018 and 2019. An evident decline in the total rate of procedures was noted in February (IRR = 0.60, CI 95% [0.55 – 0.64]), with a more pronounced decrease in March (IRR = 0.48, CI 95% [0.45 – 0.52]) and April (IRR = 0.27, CI 95% [0.25 – 0.29]). This reduction persisted significantly throughout the assessment period.
A consistent pattern emerged in the data regarding medical appointments, showing a 36% decrease in February (IRR = 0.64, CI 95% [0.57 – 0.72]), with the most substantial decline noted in May (IRR = 0.27, CI 95% [0.24 – 0.30]), which remained significant until December. Similarly, a gradual decrease was observed in prenatal procedures, starting with a 36% reduction in February, with less pronounced decreases in June (IRR = 0.63, CI 95% [0.59 – 0.66]) and September (IRR = 0.61, CI 95% [0.58 – 0.65]). Conversely, the number of diabetes treatment procedures did not exhibit significant declines in February (IRR = 1.51, CI 95% [0.88 – 2.61]) or March (IRR = 0.58, CI 95% [0.33 – 1.01]), but experienced substantial reductions in April (IRR = 0.24, CI 95% [0.11 – 0.53]) and May (IRR = 0.19, CI 95% [0.09 – 0.43]) of 2020. Following this period, significant reductions were only observed in August (IRR = 0.61, CI 95% [0.38 – 0.99]) and December (IRR = 0.29, CI 95% [0.16 – 0.54]).
The study revealed a notable decline in the availability of medical appointments and the execution of procedures related to prenatal and diabetes care when comparing different time periods. Across all months, ranging from February to December, there was a consistent decrease in the rate of procedures conducted. This trend could be attributed to the substantial redeployment of healthcare professionals to address the ongoing pandemic, coupled with the heightened susceptibility of these professionals to contracting Sars-Covid-19, rendering them unable to fulfill their duties. Moreover, the public's apprehension regarding potential exposure to the virus has led to a reduced utilization of healthcare services, particularly in urgent situations, resulting in the postponement of elective treatments. Notably, there has been a lack of coordinated efforts by Primary Healthcare (PHC) services at the national level in Brazil to combat Covid-19, with inadequate monitoring and support for individuals with chronic health conditions requiring continuous care. These factors likely contribute to the findings observed in this study.
Emerging countries such as Brazil continue to grapple with an evolving epidemiological landscape characterized by an aging population and a triple burden of diseases, encompassing acute health conditions (such as infectious diseases), external causes, and chronic health conditions necessitating ongoing care. The country's primary healthcare (PHC) services, while robustly structured, predominantly prioritize the management of acute illnesses, often falling short in effectively addressing the needs of patients requiring sustained medical attention.
The notable decline in Primary Health Care (PHC) during the pandemic period being analyzed could potentially exacerbate the health status of the population. Prenatal care, a form of continuous care during pregnancy, has been identified as a protective element for maternal and child health, but has been adversely impacted throughout the entirety of the 2020 pandemic. Adverse outcomes such as increased neonatal, postnatal, and premature birth mortality have been linked to the scope of PHC. Additionally, hospital admissions for conditions falling under the purview of PHC have been regarded as indicators of the effectiveness of these services. These encompass a wide range of conditions, including chronic diseases and their associated complications. Notably in Brazil, there has been a significant decrease in hospitalizations due to care-sensitive conditions in recent years. Nevertheless, a slowdown in the rate of these advancements, coupled with challenges in managing chronic diseases, has emerged as a significant concern for PHC in the country.
Among the health conditions necessitating continuous care at the primary healthcare (PHC) level, prenatal care, diabetes, and hypertension stand out prominently. In December 2019, the Ministry of Health initiated a reform of the Brazilian PHC with the aim of enhancing access and efficiency within the sector. A set of indicators, tied to performance-based payment systems, was introduced to monitor these conditions. However, due to an initial transitional rule between payment models and subsequently, the declaration of a nationwide pandemic, resources allocated to the Performance Pay Program (P4P) remained intact, relieving PHC facilities from presenting indicator results. These circumstances underscore the significant challenges faced by the Brazilian PHC model in delivering quality services. The data outlined in this study further validate the struggles in achieving improved outcomes, with the pandemic exacerbating this existing challenge.
Controlled detachment raises significant concerns globally due to the potential unintended consequences it poses for the interruption, partial functioning, or shift in focus of Primary Health Care (PHC) services. The World Health Organization has noted a 75% decrease in services for non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension, with this reduction being more pronounced in lower-income countries. These statistics underscore worries about a delayed treatment and monitoring schedule for patients living in circumstances necessitating ongoing healthcare. Specifically, concerning the conditions under investigation in this study (diabetes and prenatal care), this delayed schedule could lead to heightened mortality rates, infant mortality, and disability in the year 2021.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted that the root causes of disruptions to non-communicable disease services differ among income groups, with issues such as transportation disruptions, inadequate personal protective equipment, insufficient staffing, lack of essential drugs and services affecting low- and middle-income countries more significantly. The proposed solutions by the authors involve implementing patient screening models, utilizing appropriate electronic health records, enhancing access to medical consultations through telemedicine systems, and establishing specific protocols for managing non-communicable diseases during the pandemic. These solutions are underpinned by the core principles of primary health care (PHC), emphasizing access, continuity of care, comprehensiveness, and care coordination.
Regarding the limitations of this study, it is important to note that we utilized public secondary data sourced from the Ministry of Health. During a pandemic, there may be a relaxation in the commitment of professionals to communicate and update data, potentially leading to gaps in crucial information related to the topic, such as hypertension. Furthermore, the data provided by the Ministry of Health at the municipal level only encompassed the number of procedures, leaving out other pertinent details. While ecological studies offer insights into potential issues within Primary Health Care (PHC) services, they do not directly measure quality or access to care. Additionally, these designs may introduce systematic differences in the measurement or recording of variables across different areas. It is crucial to highlight that the estimates derived from this study do not imply a causal effect, and it is not possible to draw individual-level inferences from aggregate data, as this is not a causal interference study.
This study represents the first instance, as far as the authors are aware, of a documented decrease in prenatal procedures, diabetes management, and medical consultations within middle-income countries. Such findings hold significant implications for raising awareness within the scientific community and among healthcare managers regarding the forthcoming agenda for 2021. Research endeavors incorporating primary data or data capable of elucidating potential impacts on mortality rates, infant mortality, immunization rates, and the emergence of disabilities are crucial for elucidating this observed gap. While the documentation of reduced procedures aimed at chronic and prenatal conditions suggests a decline in healthcare interventions, the formalization of novel approaches like Teleconsultation in Primary Care could potentially facilitate the restructuring of Primary Health Care (PHC) services within the Unified Health System (SUS). This, in turn, may aid in addressing pent-up demand and mitigating a potential post-pandemic surge resulting from interrupted healthcare services. It is imperative to not only monitor the impact of the pandemic on PHC practices but also to track shifts in morbidity and mortality patterns within hospital settings attributable to preventable causes originating in PHC. Such monitoring efforts are essential for guiding the adaptation and reorganization of healthcare practices, even amidst ongoing restrictive measures aimed at combating COVID-19.
