ABSTRACT – (A new species of Vriesea Lindl. (Bromeliaceae) from the Atlantic Rainforest of São Paulo State, Brazil). A new species of Vriesea Lindl. is described and illustrated. Vriesea altobocainensis is only known for the Atlantic Forest of Serra da Bocaina. It is a robust epiphyte, characterized by a reddish inflorescence, and floral and primary bracts with an orbicular and broadly ovate shape; morphologically, it is close to Vriesea altodaserrae L.B.Sm. and Vriesea sceptrum Mez. However, the new species can be distinguished from these others mainly for the color, dimensions and shape of floral and primary bracts, number of inflorescence branches and number of flowers per branch. Keywords: epiphyte, serra da Bocaina, taxonomy, Tillandsioidae

Introduction Vriesea Lindl. is included in the subfamily Tillandsioideae, which, based on phylogenetic and morphological studies, has gone through segregation, with the establishment of new genera (Barfuss et al. 2016). In this new circumscription, Vriesea is characterized mainly for the presence of a stigma of the convolute blade II type (with lobes ± fused, spreading, strongly broadened, infundibuliform to umbrella-shaped), petals usually bearing basal appendages (Barfuss et al. 2016). They are epiphytic plants, terrestrial or rupiculous, and are mainly distributed throughout South America, with one of the main diversity centres being the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Costa et al. 2007). According to Forzza et al. (2015), Vriesea is the richest genus of Bromeliaceae in Brazil with almost 230 species (Gouda et al. cont. updated). It is also among the most diverse genera (ca. 170 spp.) within the Atlantic Rainforest domain (BFG 2018, Flora do Brasil 2020 under construction). Serra da Bocaina is part of the Serra do Mar mountain range and is located along the boundaries of the States of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, in Southeastern Brazil. Serra da Bocaina is formed by large extensions of well-preserved Atlantic Rainforest, including several physiognomical formations like lowland forests, nebular forests and altitude fields. The diversity of physical attributes, such as the great topographical variation (rising from sea level to 2,088 m) with marked steep slopes and mountainous highlands, and the high pluvial rates (annual average of ca. 1,700 mm), have likely formed distinct niches and refuges, rendering high levels of biological diversity and endemism (IBAMA 2002, Freitas 2010). During our collecting expeditions in Serra da Bocaina, a new species of Vriesea was identified. Here, we describe and illustrate this new species.

Material and Methods The species description was based on herbarium and fresh material, which were collected during the field expeditions to Serra da Bocaina, in areas surrounding the Parque Nacional da Serra da Bocaina (Serra da Bocaina National Park), and deposited at SP Herbarium. In order to complement the information and evaluate the morphological characters, samples of the new species and the two species morphologically closest to it were carefully analysed. The measurement of the floral bracts was done in the structures of the middle of the inflorescence and additional information was obtained from specialized literature (Smith & Downs 1977, Reitz 1983, Costa et al. 2007, Rosa 2011, Flora do Brasil 2020 under construction), as well as the Brazilian virtual herbarium Herbário Virtual REFLORA (Reflora cont. updated) and speciesLink network.

Wanderley (SP). Vriesea altobocainensis is a remarkable species from the Atlantic Forest of Serra da Bocaina. It is characterized by the robust habit, infundibuliform rosettes, inflorescences branches patent, with the apical portion of the branches ascending to slightly sigmoid [as documented in some species of Alcantarea (E. Morren ex Mez) Harms], red primary and floral bracts, and distichous flowers. Although this species is tipically an epiphyte, it can be found growing on the soil when falling from the forest canopy.

According to Costa et al. (2015), through the analysis of morphological characters, Vriesea sceptrum Mez and Vriesea altodaserrae L.B. Sm. belong to the same clade, along with basal lineages of Vriesea species. These species can be characterized by the compound inflorescences, with bracts longer than the peduncle of the branches, erect and linear to narrowly-oblong petals with apressed apices, and included stamens as detailed below. Vriesea altobocainensis is morphologically similar to V. sceptrum, a species from the highlands of Serra da Mantiqueira, in the States of São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. Both present a robust habit, inflorescences with patent branches, dense and distichous flowers, short internodes (0.7- 1.5 cm long), and red primary bracts. Vriesea altobocainensis can be distinguished by a greater number of inflorescence branches (10-21) and flowers in the branches [(8-)10-20], orbicular to broadly-ovate upper primary bracts, 6-8 cm wide, red rachillas, orbicular to broadly-ovate floral bracts, 2-3 cm wide, obtuse at the apex, and yellow sepals. Vriesea sceptrum has a lower number of inflorescence branches (13-15) and flowers in the branches [5-9(-12)], triangular to ovate upper primary bracts, 2-5 cm wide, greenish-orange to orange rachillas, ovate floral bracts, 1.5-2.2 cm wide, acute to obtuse at the apex, and orange sepals (figure 3). Vriesea altobocainensis can also related to Vriesea altodaserrae, a species that inhabits the Serra do Mar mountain range, from sea level to the highest lands of Paraná, Santa Catarina and São Paulo, occuring also in Serra da Bocaina. Both species co-occur, with Vriesea altodaserrae being very common in the region. Vriesea altobocainensis is rarer, with the individuals inhabiting, in general, the forest canopy, which makes it of more difficult visualization, and therefore, harder to estimate population sizes. The two species share similar general morphology, especially in terms of the shape and size of the rosettes, the predominant red color of the primary bracts, and the distichous flowers with yellow sepals and petals. However, Vriesea altobocainensis presents more robust inflorescence branches, lower in number (10-21), thicker red rachillas, densely aggregated flowers, and internodes with 0.8-1.1 cm long. In addition, the primary bracts of the upper portion of the rachis are orbicular SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/2236-8906-102/2020 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)

to broadly-ovate, 6-8 cm wide; floral bracts are red or, when at the apex of the branch, red and yellow at the apex, orbicular to broadly-ovate, 2-2.8 cm wide. Vriesea altodaserrae has more delicate inflorescence branches, more numerous (20-30), thinner green to greenish-yellow rachillas, and internodes 1.5-2 cm long. The primary bracts of the upper portion of the rachis are broadly-ovate, 3- 6 cm long; floral bracts are yellow, ovate, 1.4-2 cm wide (figure 3). Vriesea altobocainensis is restricted to the montains of Serra da Bocaina, in the Atlantic Rainforest, growing preferably as an epiphyte. The specific epithet we propose refers to the locality where the species occurs, the highlands of Serra da Bocaina.
