We derive formulae for the regularized determinant of the twisted Laplacians on forms over odd-dimensional real projective spaces. This research extends the previous formula for this specific space type, demonstrating equivalence in typical scenarios. This extension yields intriguing, albeit straightforward, identities that incorporate special values of Bernoulli polynomials and the Riemann zeta function. As an application, we compute the Analytic Torsion of these spaces concerning all unitary representations of their fundamental group.
The concept of regularized determinant emerges from the examination of spectral zeta functions and finds practical applications in fields like analytic number theory, global analysis, and physics.
The spectral zeta functions, introduced by Minakshisundaram and Pleijel [10], are specialized Dirichlet series formulated based on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator acting on functions defined on compact differentiable Riemannian manifolds. Recognizing their utility across various applications, these functions have been suitably extended to multiple contexts.
This research was conducted while I, the author, was a Ph.D. student at Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Carlos (UFSCar). The course advisor, Professor L. R. Hartmann, and his advisor, M. Spreafico, provided technical support throughout the research process that culminated in this article by sharing valuable references.
This project was developed in conjunction with reference [6]. The authors of reference [6] provided me with a preliminary/unfinished version and requested that I complete it with a similar level of generality found in this manuscript and [13]. However, I found their reasoning unclear at the time, prompting me to start afresh with a different approach. Throughout the course of this research, Professor Hartmann was in Germany, Professor Spreafico was in Italy, and I was in Brazil, working independently. Upon Professor Hartmann's return to Brazil after completing his studies in Germany, he decided to finalize and submit [6] with M. Spreafico, allowing me to submit my text separately. While I had not explicitly expressed a desire to publish my thesis alone, I was pleased with his decision, acknowledging their assistance and recognizing that I was not truly working in isolation. In gratitude for their support, I endeavored to assist them as much as possible with [6].
