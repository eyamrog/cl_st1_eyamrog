Most triatomine bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) are hematophagous, with the exception of Belminus species, which can sustain themselves by feeding on cockroach hemolymph throughout their life cycle. This study delves into the fixed action pattern (FAP) utilized by B. ferroae to detect, approach, and feed on a live cockroach. The FAP outlined here comprises a series of stereotyped behaviors: initial visual and/or olfactory detection of the cockroach, followed by reaching, cautious approach, antennal exploration, proboscis extension, piercing for sedation, walking away and waiting (post-sedation behavior), a second cautious approach, and ultimately proboscis extension for hemolymph feeding. To pinpoint potential chemical cues triggering this FAP, we investigated the responses of B. corredori, B. ferroae, and B. herreri to cockroach odor, fresh cockroach feces, and fresh rodent wastes. The latter two sources were tested under the assumption that chemicals abundant near host refuges could act as orientation cues for the bugs. Notably, B. herreri exhibited significant attraction towards cockroach odor in a still air olfactometer setup. While all three Belminus species approached the captive cockroach within an hour, they refrained from climbing the box. Cockroach feces odors enticed B. corredori and B. ferroae in a Y-olfactometer setting. The observed FAP sequence implies that Belminus bugs, unlike other reduviids, are not predators but rather kleptophagous ectoparasites, as they do not kill their prey but instead extract hemolymph from invertebrate hosts. The enduring cohabitation of triatomines and their hosts in shared refuges over millennia has likely facilitated the recognition of similar odors in both invertebrate and vertebrate habitats, including human dwellings, potentially explaining the bugs' adaptability to domestic environments.
The Triatominae, also known as kissing bugs, are insect vectors of American trypanosomiasis, commonly referred to as Chagas disease. It is estimated that over 18 million individuals are currently infected, with approximately 120 million people living at risk of contracting the disease (Añez et al., 2004). Despite these alarming figures, a publication in The Lancet (Anonymous, 2006) has highlighted Chagas disease as the most neglected among neglected human illnesses.
Triatomine bugs, as highlighted by Guerin et al. (2000), exhibit a distinctive lifestyle as nest-living ectoparasites and serve as vectors for Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. These insects typically reside in close proximity to their hosts, sharing shelters and consistently feeding from the same source throughout their lifespan. In their natural habitat, most triatomine species feed on humans and other vertebrate hosts during the night while they are at rest. The transmission of the zoonosis occurs when these blood-feeding bugs bite an infected vertebrate host, such as opossums, armadillos, or bats, among others. Within the bug, the parasite transitions into the infectious epimastigote stage in the rectum, ultimately developing into metacyclic trypomastigotes (Schofield et al. 1987). Triatomines transmit the parasites by defecating during or after feeding, allowing the trypomastigotes in the feces to swim into the host's cells using flagella. The entry of T. cruzi into the human host can occur through a bite wound or mucous membranes. While the parasite can thrive in the gut of all triatomines, certain bug species prove to be more effective vectors due to factors like triatomine density, host preference (Gütler et al. 2009), and defecation index, which refers to the time lapse between feeding and defecation (Aldana and Lizano 2004).
Triatomines, a coherent taxonomic group within reduviids, are classified into 5 tribes and 15 genera, encompassing approximately 150 described species primarily found in America. Distinguished by their behavioral and morphological traits, triatomines stand out among Reduviidae due to their structural adaptation to hematophagy, although not all species are strict blood-suckers. Reduviids, an unusual family within the Hemiptera order, are predominantly terrestrial predators of arthropods, contrasting with most other predatory Hemiptera that are aquatic. The evolutionary origins of triatomines from primitive zoophagous reduviids remain a topic of debate, with conflicting hypotheses suggesting a monophyletic or polyphyletic evolution. Schaefer (2005) emphasizes the importance of understanding phylogenetic relationships to comprehend the subfamily Triatominae, noting the consistency in behavioral, physiological, and morphological features that could classify them as a monophyletic or paraphyletic group. While taxonomists have traditionally focused on morphological traits, behavioral patterns may offer valuable insights for distinguishing taxonomic groups, as suggested by Imanishi (2011). Ethological studies, despite the challenges of heritability, can provide crucial information on instincts and behaviors that define the triatomine phenotype. By departing from traditional ethological premises, this study aims to explore the subfamily Triatominae through behavioral characters as indicators of phylogenetic relationships, with a specific focus on identifying unique ethological features within the genus Belminus as a model for understanding phylogenetic relationships.
The genus Belminus (Bolboderini) comprises a group of triatomines that are relatively understudied, including the species Belminus corredori Galvão & Angulo, 2006; Belminus costaricensis Herrer, Lent & Wygodzinsky, 1954; Belminus ferroae Sandoval, Pabón, Jurberg & Galvão, 2007; Belminus herreri Lent & Wygodzinsky, 1979; Belminus laportei Lent, Jurberg & Carcavallo, 1995; Belminus peruvianus Herrer, Lent & Wygodzinsky, 1954; Belminus pittieri Osuna & Ayala, 1993; and Belminus rugulosus Stål, 1859. The distribution of these relatively small triatomines is discontinuous and limited to Central America, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, and northern Brazil, with reports of B. peruvianus, B. herreri, and B. ferroae acting as vectors for T. cruzi in human dwellings in Peru and Colombia (Sandoval et al., 2010). The genus Belminus remains poorly understood, partly due to difficulties in maintaining these species in captivity. Recent research has revealed that Belminus bugs primarily feed on invertebrate hemolymph to complete their life cycle, functioning as facultative bloodsuckers that can survive solely on fluids from other arthropods. Studies by Sandoval et al. (2004, 2010) on B. herreri and B. ferroae suggest that cockroaches (Blattodea: Blaberidae) are the main hosts in human habitats, with occasional feeding on humans. These researchers found that >86% of the intestinal contents of B. herreri and B. ferroae reacted with Periplaneta americana antiserum, indicating a preference for cockroach blood over human blood. Further investigations by Sandoval et al. (2013) demonstrated that B. ferroae exhibited higher fitness when feeding on Blaberus cockroaches compared to mice, highlighting their adaptation to invertebrate hosts.
In this study, departing from an ethological approach, we aim to taxonomically characterize the Belminus genus by identifying and observing behavioral patterns elicited by sensory cues from the cockroach host. Given that Belminus are synanthropes and play a role in the life cycle of T. cruzi, their eco-epidemiological relevance is undeniable. However, there are phylogenetic concerns regarding Belminus as members of Triatominae, not being strict bloodsuckers. Belminus species can complete their life cycle by exclusively feeding on arthropod hemolymph, making hemolymph their primary food source when residing in human adobes. This challenges the notion of hematophagy as an autapomorphy within Triatominae, casting doubt on the monophyly of this subfamily. The feeding behavior distinguishing Belminus appears to be a primitive habit among Reduviidae, suggesting a closer phylogenetic relationship to their primitive reduviid relatives, the assassin bugs, rather than bloodsucking triatomines. However, this evidence, along with previous findings, as noted by Schaefer (2005), presents a complex picture that does not conclusively prove anything. In this study, our focus shifts from the quality of meals (blood or hemolymph) consumed by triatomines to the natural history of their feeding behavior, seeking a behavioral pattern that could serve as an autopomorphy shared by Belminus and all triatomine species.
When a kissing bug approaches to bite a host, it executes a highly stereotyped behavioral sequence known as a fixed action pattern (FAP), which remains relatively consistent within Triatominae and Heteroptera. Páez-Rondón et al. (2018) have highlighted that various stimuli, including temperature, chemical, visual, and olfactory cues, are adequate to trigger the FAP linked to triatomine feeding. The behavioral sequence outlined by these researchers commences with object orientation, followed by visualization, antennal exploration, leg touching, proboscis extension, and liquid ingestion. Building upon the findings of Páez-Rondón et al. (2018), this study delineates the FAP utilized by B. ferroae to detect, approach, and feed on a living cockroach. The "orientation" strategy employed by these authors and in the present investigation, as per Roeder (1998), falls somewhere between behaviorism and ethology. In light of Crist's (1998) critique of the semantic approach of ethology's founders and drawing inspiration from the stylistic elements of animal behavioral observation pioneers (Darwin and Wallace 1858, Darwin 1983, Humboldt 1991), we sought to identify the inherent traits that could aid in placing Belminus species phylogenetically. The central ethological query was how Belminus species approach their prey in comparison to ancestral assassin bugs. Previous research on triatomine orientation behavior has predominantly concentrated on odors emitted by the host's skin and breath (Otálora-Luna et al. 2004, Guerenstein and Lazzari 2009, Aldana et al. 2008, Ortiz et al. 2011), which stem from the host-associated microflora and vertebrate metabolism.
For many vertebrates, chemicals found in feces and urine serve as crucial signals for marking territory, with sylvatic hosts like opossums, armadillos, and bats, along with synantrophic hosts such as chickens, dogs, cats, and rodents accumulating excretory products in or near their nesting sites. Ectoparasites like triatomines utilize emanations from such host waste to locate resources, a phenomenon observed in both rural and urban endemic areas where humans have captured triatomine bugs in various locations like bathrooms, latrines, sewers, and trashcans. Research by Aldana and Otálora-Luna (2019) highlighted the attraction of Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma infestans, and Panstrongylus geniculatus to amines present in vertebrate waste, suggesting a novel perspective on host feces as a source of kairomones, indicating a potential food source for triatomine bugs. Building on this, Otálora-Luna and Guerin (2014) proposed a close association between triatomines and their hosts, leading to the selection of odor sources based on previous ectoparasite hypotheses and experimental models. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the chemical stimuli triggering the feeding instinct of Belminus by assessing the orientation responses of B. corredori, B. ferroae, and B. herreri to volatiles from cockroaches, host wastes, and rodent wastes, drawing on insights from previous studies (Otálora-Luna and Guerin 2014; Páez-Rondón et al. 2018).
In this study, the primary objectives were to delineate the feeding-associated behavior patterns (FAP) in Belminus, ascertain whether host volatiles alone trigger the FAP or chemotaxis in Belminus, and posit the FAP as a distinguishing characteristic separating Belminus and all triatomines from other reduviids.
The fifth-instar individuals of Belminus species utilized in this study were sourced from laboratory colonies housing insects collected from various domiciles across Colombia (Sandoval et al., 2004; Galvão and Angulo, 2006; Sandoval et al., 2010). The bugs were gathered from specific Colombian locations: B. ferroae specimens were obtained from Santa Catalina (07°07′26″N, 72°11′24″) and San Alberto (17°12′40″N, 72°19′12″) in the municipality of Toledo, Northern Santander; B. herreri specimens were collected around a residence in El Carmen, Santander (6°39′30″N, 73°38′56″) and in dwellings in San Martin, Cesar (07°58′47″N, 73°32′26″); while B. corredori specimens were captured in a house in San Gil, Santander (6°33′18″N, 73°04′00″). The laboratory colonies were initiated in the subsequent years: B. herreri in 2000, B. corredori in 2002, and B. ferroae in 2005. The bugs were nourished with cockroaches under controlled laboratory conditions following the protocol outlined by Sandoval et al. (2013). The Belminus colony has been housed at the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research (Mérida, Venezuela) for five years. The insects were maintained at 23 ± 2°C, 82 ± 7% RH (relative humidity) under a 12/12-hour light-dark cycle and were starved for 8–12 days post-emergence before experiments. They were fed 5th nymphs of Blaberus giganteus cockroaches (Blaberidae), which were themselves fed a diet formulated for canines and corn seeds. Belminus bugs and cockroaches shared the same enclosure from hatching for a period of 5 months. Each bug was utilized only once to prevent any bias from learning (Aldana et al., 2008).
Three distinct arenas were utilized to investigate the behavior of Belminus species. The bioassays were carried out under controlled conditions at 24 °C and 68% relative humidity, with illumination provided by fluorescent ceiling lights set at a brightness of 2000 lux and a color temperature of 4000 K, unless stated otherwise. All experimental procedures were executed in Merida, Venezuela, situated at elevations ranging between 1700 and 1860 meters above sea level.
In Arena 1, the ethological responses of B. ferroae were investigated within a 10 cm glass Petri dish, housing a 3-cm living B. giganteus nymph alongside a B. ferroae bug (Fig 1Ai). Phase I involved confining the cockroach within a 5.8 cm plate positioned centrally in the arena using a low odor thermoplastic adhesive (tec bond 341, HotMelt) to prevent odor dispersion. This setup allowed only visual interaction between the cockroach and the bug, with their positions and behaviors monitored for 10 minutes. Subsequently, in Phase II, the cockroach was released to enable physical interaction between the two individuals for an additional 10 minutes. Control experiments were conducted, involving two additional bioassays where either the cockroach or the bug was absent. Each experiment was replicated 10 times for robustness.
In a square glass arena measuring 29 x 29 cm, the orientation responses of B. corredori, B. ferroae, and B. herreri to an odorous still air were investigated. A living fifth instar B. giganteus was enclosed in an opaque-black cardboard box (6.5 cm in length, 8 cm in width, and 2.5 cm in height) positioned at the center of one side, with 12 holes (2 mm in diameter) on the side facing the arena's center. An identical empty box served as a control at the opposite end. Each bug was placed within a central 3 cm circle, initially covered by a circular Petri dish (2.8 cm), and released after a 2-minute adaptation period. The bug's preference for a specific half of the arena was recorded over a 5-minute interval, with attraction to cockroach volatiles indicated by the bug's preference for the half containing the cockroach. Subsequently, bug positions were noted after one hour, with attraction defined as being within 3 cm of the box containing the cockroach. Insects that remained within the circle after five minutes were excluded due to potential reluctance to move. To account for any asymmetries in the setup, Belminus bugs were also observed in an odorless control trial with two empty boxes. Each experiment was repeated 20 times, with stimuli positions alternated every two insects and the arena cleaned between changes.
In Arena 3, the responses of triatomines to an odorous air current were examined using a Y-tube dual choice olfactometer constructed from glass (Fig 1C). The three Belminus species were individually tested against volatiles emitted from living cockroaches, cockroach feces, and mouse feces. A single triatomine bug was permitted to walk upwind in the stem (dimensions: length 22 cm, inner diameter 2.370 cm, outer diameter 2.804 cm) and upon reaching the junction, had to select between the two arms (length 13 cm) of the Y-olfactometer, with their orientation being quantified based on their choice. All insects initiated their journey from the base of the Y olfactometer and made a decision. A preliminary spatial control experiment was conducted using two clean arms to assess any potential asymmetries, with no significant differences being detected. A pump was utilized to draw charcoal-filtered air (via a stimulus controller, CS-55, Syntech) from the two arms, with an airspeed of 10 ± 2 cm/s as measured by a hot-wire anemometer (model 2440, Kurtz, accuracy ± 0.01 m/s). One arm was connected to a 500 ml glass gas-wash bottle containing the odor source, while the other held a similar clean (control) bottle. Both air streams reached the 'Y' stem at 23± 2 °C and 70% RH as measured by a thermo-hygrometer (model EA80, Extech Instruments, accuracy ± 3% RH and ± 1 °C). The tubes, fittings, and valves were constructed from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, International Polymer Solutions Inc). Headspace odors, i.e., volatiles emanating from the vapor phase above the sample in a vial, were evaluated by placing the odorous samples in 500 ml glass gas-wash bottles. Prior to blowing volatiles, the bottles were allowed to equilibrate for at least 10 minutes, with an additional 15-minute interval between experiments to ensure sufficient emission of volatiles from cockroaches and wastes. Controls for cockroach feces and mouse wastes involved air blown over filter paper and rice hulls dampened with 5 ml of water, respectively. The control for cockroaches comprised a clean gas-wash bottle with a similar wet filter paper. Water was added to maintain humidity levels consistent with those produced by organic samples (Otálora-Luna and Guerin 2014). The air-stream passing through the bottles was injected at a rate of 150 ml/min. Bugs walking on the Y-olfactometer were stimulated until a response was observed, within a timeframe of less than 30 minutes. The positions of the flasks were alternated for each insect, and the Y-olfactometer was cleaned before changing positions. To assess any asymmetries in the experimental setup, Belminus bugs were observed in an odorless control trial using two empty bottles. To eliminate odors from the laboratory, the experimental setup was positioned near an exhaust hood capable of exchanging the air in the room 15 times per hour. B. herreri was not subjected to testing with mouse waste due to the insufficient size of the colony to provide an adequate number of naïve individuals.
Cockroach odors were emitted from three living B. giganteus 5th nymphs. A total of 20 grams of cockroach feces were gathered and carefully isolated from any additional materials such as deceased insects, exuviae, oothecae, and food waste found at the base of the containers utilized for the mass-rearing of B. giganteus. The mouse waste, weighing 30 grams, comprised rice hulls saturated with the feces and urine of albino mice from the NMRI strain. Each sample was individually placed in 500 ml glass gas-wash bottles for further analysis.
To examine the behavioral intricacies of Arenas 1-3, frontal and top perspectives of the experimental arenas were captured in full-screen using a video CMOS camera (EOS Rebel T7i, Canon) equipped with a zoom lens (EF-S 15-55 mm f, IS, Canon) and a macro lens (close-up +10, 58 mm, Commander) to achieve a field view of 40 mm (diagonally) - facilitated by a pivoting base for comprehensive coverage. These experiments were conducted in a dimly lit environment. Arena 1 and 2 were illuminated by a LED lamp (2850K, 570 lumens, Reveal, General Electric), while Arena 3 was lit by a LED infrared lamp (840 nm, Cmvision) - the camera's infrared sensitivity enabled observation in darkness. Subsequently, the recordings were scrutinized using video software on a computer (version 9.1.2.7, Wondershare Filmora9) for playback, tracking, and editing. The ethological terminology employed to delineate triatomine behaviors adhered to the recommendations of Kogon (1941) and Crist (1998).
Behavioral responses observed in arena 1 were compared using a one-tailed binomial test, while comparisons for each species in arenas 2 and 3 were conducted using a two-tailed binomial test. To explore the relationship between Belminus species and orientation responses in arenas 2 and 3, a chi-square test of independence was employed. In cases where the dependence was found to be insignificant, the Belminus species were treated as a single group, or genus, for a two-tailed binomial test. Conversely, when dependence was significant, multiple chi-square pairwise comparisons were carried out among species, followed by post hoc Holm-Bonferroni correction (Ruxton and Beauchamp, 2008). All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.5.3, Vienna, Austria; Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996).
In Phase I, B. ferroae nymphs exhibited positive thigmotaxis as they walked along the border of the 10-cm dish, with minimal interaction with the 5-cm dish containing a cockroach. The bugs displayed a back-and-forth movement pattern along the dish's perimeter, occasionally changing directions in a circuit of approximately 180°, interspersed with brief stops accounting for 20% of the time. Despite the proximity, there were no evident signs of interaction between the triatomine bugs and the cockroach. Moving on to Phase II, upon release, the cockroach displayed active movement and positive thigmotaxis, interrupted by brief stops. The bug then exhibited a behavior termed as reaching, lifting its body and antennae towards the cockroach. Subsequently, the bug cautiously approached the cockroach, bending down and touching it with its antennae before extending its proboscis to briefly pierce the cockroach's abdomen. This action induced spasms and disorientation in the cockroach, leading to slow, erratic movements. The bug repeated the process of piercing and sucking hemolymph multiple times, causing its abdomen to visibly swell. The observed behaviors were categorized as visual and olfactory detection, reaching, cautious approach, antennal exploration, proboscis extension, sedation through piercing, post-sedation behavior, and hemolymph feeding. The cockroach did not perish during these interactions.
Controls: In the control experiments, where only one of the two insects was present, both the triatomine bug and the cockroach exhibited behaviors similar to those observed in phase I of the study.
The Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) described in phase II was not observed in phase I or in the two control conditions (P<0.001).
During the initial 5 minutes, B. herreri predominantly oriented their walks towards the cockroach (78%, P=0.012), whereas B. corredori (65%, P=0.169) and B. ferroae (58%, P=0.193) did not exhibit a significant departure from random orientation (Fig 2). The chi-square test of independence indicated no significant behavioral differences among the three species (P=0.501). Consequently, when considering the three species as a collective group (n=56), the Belminus genus displayed a tendency to orient their walks towards the cockroach (68%, P=0.0029).
After one hour, all individuals from the three species approached the box, with a statistical significance of 100% (P<0.001), maintaining a proximity of 0.5-3 cm. However, the presence of odors or vibrations emitted by the captive cockroach deterred the bugs from making direct contact with the box. Instead, they engaged in exploratory behaviors such as touching the box with their antennae and taking brief walks around it, ultimately refraining from climbing onto it. Notably, behaviors like the Fixed Action Pattern (FAP) or proboscis extension were not exhibited in this context; only chemotaxis responses were observed.
Controls: In the odorless control experiments, which involved testing two empty boxes on B. corredori (n=20), the orientation did not show a significant difference from random (left: 9, right: 11, P=0.160).
The Y-olfactometer did not elicit FAP or proboscis extension responses; rather, chemotaxis was observed in specific instances. Notably, when one arm of the Y-olfactometer contained the headscape of living cockroaches while the other arm had clean air, B. corredori (P=0.005), B. ferroae (P=0.04), and B. herreri (P=0.014) exhibited avoidance of the odorous air current, as depicted in Figure 3. The chi-square test of independence indicated no significant correlation between species and their behavioral reactions (P=0.347); however, the Belminus genus (n=52) demonstrated a strong aversion to volatiles emitted by cockroaches (79%, P=0.000013).
In the same vein, B. corredori (P=0.001) and B. ferroae (P=0.008) exhibited avoidance behavior towards the extreme of the Y-olfactometer when exposed to the headscape of mouse wastes, as illustrated in Figure 3. The chi-square test of independence indicated that there was no statistically significant relationship between species and their behavioral responses (P=0.477). Within the Belminus genus (n=48), a substantial majority (79%, P=0.000023) displayed avoidance tendencies towards the volatiles emitted from mouse wastes.
Volatile compounds released from cockroach feces were found to attract B. corredori (P=0.019) and B. ferroae (P=0.003), with B. herreri displaying neither attraction nor avoidance behaviors (P=0.0541). The chi-square test of independence indicated a significant relationship between species and their behavioral responses (P=0.0208). Further pairwise comparisons revealed that there was no significant difference in behavioral responses between B. corredori and B. ferroae (P=0.766), between B. corredori and B. herreri (P=0.0683), but a significant difference was observed between B. ferroae and B. herreri (P=0.0392) (Fig 3).
Controls: In the odorless control experiments, consisting of testing two empty flasks on B. corredori (n=22), the orientation exhibited by the subjects did not show a significant deviation from randomness (left: 12, right: 10, P=0.154).
In a study conducted by Páez-Rondón et al. (2018), R. prolixus, T. infestans, and P. geniculatus were subjected to stimuli including a drop of water, a plastic dummy, and a piece of guava fruit, leading to the observation that all these objects triggered the Fixed Action Pattern (FAP) associated with feeding. This research marks the initial documentation of such a behavioral response in Belminus, offering a unique perspective from an ethological standpoint and highlighting the originality of our investigation.
Furthermore, Tinbergen (1963) posited that an ethologist aims to identify elements of an animal's behavior. Our study demonstrated that kleptophagy is a phenomenon specific to the Belminus genus and other triatomines, as per Portmann (1967), Kleisner (2008, 2015), and Aldana and Otálora-Luna (2019). The approach of Belminus bugs towards the cockroach, characterized by a highly stereotyped sequence culminating in proboscis lifting and sucking, without causing immediate death to the host, delineates its phylogenetic position within Triatominae.
The bite of Belminus was found to be not toxic to the cockroach but rather analgesic. In our laboratory rearing of Belminus triatomines, it was observed that a single cockroach could survive after being bitten by dozens of these bugs for many months (data not shown). Most predator reduviids possess highly toxic venoms that result in immediate prey death (Walker et al. 2018). While triatomine saliva is not as toxic, it can inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels, potentially explaining the anesthetic effect (Walker et al. 2016). Based on physiological studies and ethological observations, it can be inferred that Belminus may not kill their prey but rather parasitize their host. The terminology of parasite and host may be subject to debate since triatomines do not live directly on the host like ticks, lice, or fleas. However, they closely share their lives with their hosts in the same refuge, leading Guerin et al. (2000) to classify them as ectoparasites. Alternatively, triatomines could also be referred to as carnivores (Cobben 1979, Livingstone et al. 1998), zoophagous (Boyd et al. 2002), or micropredators (Poulin and Randhawa 2013, Wilson et al. 2017). These classifications are less definitive; for instance, unlike mosquitoes categorized as micropredators, triatomines live in close association with their host. The primary aim here is to behaviorally and phylogenetically differentiate triatomines from other reduviids. The parasitic strategy (kleptophagy) outlined in this study is unique to the Triatominae taxon and not observed in any other outgroup reduviid taxa (Reduviidae subfamilies).
Another aspect to consider is the unique form of the proboscis in triatomines, which sets them apart from other reduviids as noted by Lent and Wygodzinsky (1979). While reduviids typically have a hook-shaped proboscis that points downwards when extended, the proboscis of triatomines is straight and features membranous joints, a distinguishing characteristic used by Lent and Wygodzinsky (1979) to differentiate the Triatominae subfamily. This morphological trait is closely linked to the hematophagous and kleptophagous feeding habits that define triatomines. Belminus bugs, for instance, utilize the flexibility of their proboscis to pierce their prey from below, a behavior not observed in predator reduviids with hook-shaped proboscises designed for piercing from above. Cobben (1979) classifies triatomines as an "advanced" subfamily within Reduviidae based on this unique mouthpart structure and function. This coupling of morphology and behavior, as discussed by Varela (1988), highlights a structural adaptation, as suggested by Croizat (1962), Greham (1984), Otálora-Luna et al. (2017), and warrants special attention as it potentially sheds light on the evolutionary trajectory of kleptophagy in these insects, as proposed by Aldana et al. (2019).
Belminus possesses the ability to detect thermal cues while feeding on humans and other homoeothermic vertebrates, yet they exhibit a preference for poikilothermic arthropods as hosts (Sandoval et al., 2013), whose temperature seldom surpasses that of warm-blooded vertebrates. Wigglesworth and Gillett (1934a, b) proposed that triatomines are primarily attracted to their host by warmth. Vinauger et al. (2013) asserted that "heat serves as the sole necessary and sufficient signal to initiate the PER" or proboscis extension response (Flores and Lazzari, 1996). Haridass and Ananthakrishnan (1980) noted that "unlike predatory reduviids, in the hematophagous T. rubrofasciata, feeding behavior is triggered solely by a temperature gradient from their vertebrate hosts, as is also observed in other blood-feeding insects." Contrary to these assertions, we propose that feeding behavior in all Triatomine subspecies is not exclusively driven by heat. Consistent with prior research, visual, olfactory, and tactile stimuli can also activate the FAP (Páez-Rondón et al., 2018). Our study confirms that non-thermal stimuli from poikilothermic insects can induce positive taxis and the FAP in Belminus species. This flexibility in eliciting stimuli for triggering orientation behaviors and the FAP played a crucial role in the behavioral shift that allowed primitive predateous reduviids to transition to kleptophagy, thereby propelling the evolution of Triatominae. Presumably, early triatomines initially fed on abundant soft invertebrates in the nests and burrows of vertebrates, eventually encountering defenseless newborn offspring, tasting them, extending their proboscis, puncturing, and penetrating their skin (Otálora-Luna et al., 2015). The unique form and adaptability of the triatomine proboscis emerged, their saliva became less toxic and more analgesic, and their FAP acquired a kleptophagous aspect (sensu Portmann, 1967), positioning triatomines as an advanced group within Reduviidae. Ultimately, this flexibility in elicitation also facilitated the domestication process of several sylvatic species, such as Belminus sp.
The feeding Fixed Action Pattern (FAP) observed in this study is believed to have originated from an ancestral pattern seen in hemipterans. Similar sequential feeding behaviors were described by Hatfield et al. (1983) in the phytophagous bug Lygus lineolaris (Hemiptera: Miridae). Haridass et al. (1987) categorized reduviids based on their approaching behaviors during feeding into types such as 'blood feeding', 'sticky-trap', 'raptorial', 'wait and grab', 'pin and jab', and 'chase and pounce'. Reduviid predators employ an "assessing" and "ambush" strategy (Edwards 1962, Ables 1978), differing from the FAP observed in Belminus in terms of victim handling. Members of the Harpactocorinae subfamily typically wait for prey, then jab it upon arrival (Haridass et al. 1988, Ambrose 1999). Edwards (1962) detailed the feeding FAP for Rhinocoris carmelita and Platymeris rhadamanthus, including arousal, orientation, fixation, approach, pounce, rostrum extension, grasping, apprehension, stylet insertion, and saliva injection. Srikumar et al. (2014) outlined the feeding FAP for harpactorine reduviid predators as arousal, approach, capture, rostral thrust, paralyzing, sucking, and post-predatory behaviors. Similar behavioral sequences have been noted by other authors in Reduviidae (Ables 1978, Haridass and Ananthakrishnan 1980). Ables (1978) observed that smaller, more mobile prey are typically ambushed, while larger, less mobile prey are stalked, with the predator becoming motionless upon prey detection. Initial contact usually involves antennation followed by proboscis insertion. Srikumar et al. (2014) mentioned that after pinning and jabbing prey, reduviids paralyze them with toxic saliva, sometimes transporting them to a safe spot before feeding. In some cases, they hold the prey with their legs until it succumbs (Edwards 1962).
The predatory behaviors such as ambushing, grasping, dragging, apprehension, and paralyzing, commonly observed in assassin bugs, were notably absent in Belminus bugs. Unlike assassin bugs that induce a paralyzing (lethal) effect, Belminus bugs cause a sedation effect as they do not actively seek to kill but rather act as ectoparasites. Triatomines, including Belminus bugs, have evolved to coexist with their hosts. It is important to highlight that cockroaches can recover from lethargy post-sucking and survive for subsequent feedings. Therefore, Belminus species do not exhibit predatory traits typical of other reduviids. They are not assassin bugs but rather ectoparasites that opportunistically steal fluids from their hosts, much like thieves rather than hunters.
This suggests that kleptophagy is an ethological characteristic of Belminus and Triatominae, encompassing taxonomic, phylogenetic, and evolutionary aspects. Given that Belminus are not exclusively hematophagous, this trait may warrant taxonomic reassessment. We advocate for the inclusion of kleptophagy as a defining attribute that unites triatomines. Kleptophagy, being a non-aggressive behavior, stands in stark contrast to the aggressive predatory behaviors typically associated with ancestral reduviids.
Immelmann (1983) emphasizes that while appetitive behavior may incorporate taxis components along with FAP, not all taxis lead to FAP. The FAP necessitates an external stimulus for activation, although different modalities alone could suffice. In arena 1, phase 1, visual cues, if perceivable by Belminus bugs, failed to trigger the FAP or host-mediated taxis, possibly due to the bug's inability to see the cockroach through the glass. However, previous observations indicate that a visual cue, such as a plastic dummy resembling a drop of water, can effectively elicit the FAP (Páez-Rondón et al. 2018). Determining the cues that triggered the FAP when the glass barrier was removed in phase 2 is challenging, but it is evident that the presence of the host, and likely visual cues, played a significant role. The extension of the fixed bug's proboscis towards the cockroach and subsequent sucking observed in arena 1 could be classified as reflexes (Páez-Rondón et al. 2018). The bug's approach to the cockroach in arena 1, to the black box housing the cockroach in arena 2, and the positive choices made in the Y-tube in arena 3 can be categorized as taxis. Taxis, proboscis extension, and sucking are clearly integral to the FAP, with a convergence of these elements at certain points (Tinbergen 1951, Lorenz 1977, Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1979). While olfaction was necessary in arenas 2 and 3 to induce taxis behavior, it alone was insufficient to trigger the FAP.
In future studies, it is recommended to individually test olfaction and visual cues, either by utilizing a cockroach dummy or by presenting multimodal stimuli on the servosphere, in order to determine if olfaction alone is adequate or essential for triggering the Fixed Action Pattern (FAP). Additionally, combining various stimuli is advised to elucidate the mechanisms of convergence between visual cues, such as different light treatments, and olfactory cues as demonstrated in previous research (Reisenman et al., 2000; Otálora-Luna and Dickens, 2011).
Only B. herreri exhibited a significant attraction towards the black box containing the confined cockroach within the initial 5-minute period in the still-air olfactometer, indicating its ability to detect the cockroach under still air conditions at a distance of 10 cm (78%, arena 2). Intriguingly, all three species displayed attraction towards the cockroach odors after one hour. It is plausible that B. corredori and B. ferroae stumbled upon the box housing the cockroach through trial-and-error after the hour mark, yet it is noteworthy that all tested bugs continued to linger near the box, suggesting a short-range attraction effect despite the absence of proboscis extension. While attempts to climb the box were made, the cockroach's movements and potentially pungent odors deterred the triatomine bugs, indicating a form of avoidance behavior by Belminus that warrants further ethological and physiological investigation. The shift from initial attraction to sustained interest after an hour may imply that cockroaches are not the preferred host, hinting at a delayed response to cues emitted by cockroaches. It is plausible that these Belminus species have distinct hosts in their natural habitat, underscoring the limited understanding of Belminus' sylvatic life. For future research, enhancing the experimental arenas to isolate olfaction from visual cues could elucidate the role of olfaction in eliciting the Fixed Action Pattern (FAP). Additionally, studying Belminus bugs in their natural environment poses a significant challenge but promises valuable insights for further exploration.
Belminus species, including B. corredori, B. ferroae, and B. herreri, surprisingly showed no attraction to volatiles emitted by cockroaches in the Y-olfactometer, with the latter three species actively avoiding this odor. This unexpected outcome is particularly intriguing considering that these Belminus bugs have historically subsisted solely on cockroach hemolymph. The observed stress response in the cockroaches within the olfactometer flask, characterized by compulsive movements, may have been induced by the negative pressure generated by the airflow, potentially prompting the production of allomones as a defensive mechanism during the experiments, as suggested by Schal (1992). Notably, both B. corredori and B. ferroae exhibited avoidance towards mouse feces, a behavior that could be attributed to the risk of predation by these vertebrates. However, these same species displayed an attraction to volatiles emanating from cockroach feces. Previous studies by Sandoval et al. (2004, 2010, 2013) have highlighted the strong adaptation of Belminus species to cockroaches over mice, with domestic Belminus species frequently found cohabiting with and feeding on cockroaches in human dwellings. In natural settings, sylvatic Belminus likely associate with insect hosts residing under rocks, tree barks, or within vertebrate refuges like caves, burrows, or nests. Our findings align with the hypothesis proposed by Otálora-Luna and Guerin (2014), suggesting that volatiles from host wastes, such as cockroach feces, emanating from host refuges, stimulate triatomines' search behavior.
Which volatiles are emitted by cockroach feces remains a pertinent question. Apart from specific pheromones as highlighted by Schal (1992), nitrogenous compounds like ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine (Sakuma and Fukami 1990), along with carboxylic acids such as acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, and valeric acid (McFarlane and Alli 1985), constitute significant components of cockroach excreta. These compounds have been observed to trigger searching behaviors in various triatomine species, as evidenced by studies conducted by Guerenstein and Lazzari (2009), Ortiz et al. (2011), and Otálora-Luna and Guerin (2014). Notably, ammonia, a potent attractant for triatomines, is abundantly emitted from both vertebrate feces (Otálora-Luna and Guerin 2014) and cockroach feces (Mullins and Cochrand 1972). The responses of Belminus species to different types of waste suggest their ability to discern specific and general volatiles, including ammonia, CO2, carboxylic acids, and aromatics, released by their hosts. The effects of odors from vertebrate and invertebrate hosts are complex, influenced by factors like concentration, molecular combinations, sensory modalities, and the insect's physiological state. For instance, isobutyric acid and ammonia exhibit varying behavioral responses in triatomines based on dosage, inducing repellency and escape reactions at high concentrations but attraction at lower levels (Schofield 1975, Guerenstein and Guerin 2001, Otálora-Luna and Guerin 2014). This phenomenon of a single chemical triggering diverse behaviors is a common occurrence in arthropods (Blum 1996), potentially explaining why the presence of a cockroach in certain settings elicited a Fixed Action Pattern (FAP) while in others, such as the box or bottle, it did not, suggesting that visual or tactile cues may have been necessary in addition to volatile cues.
The utilization of waste odors for resource location is a prevalent structural adaptation in triatomines, as these volatile organic compounds stem from common metabolites of vertebrate and invertebrate gut flora metabolism, exhibiting minimal variation across hosts (Otálora-Luna and Guerin, 2014). These compounds potentially facilitate house invasion by triatomines, as previously suggested (Otálora-Luna and Guerin, 2014). Belminus species might leverage the same chemical cues utilized to locate wild hosts for exploiting synanthropic invertebrates like cockroaches, given the presence of similar odors among invertebrates and vertebrates, offering a plausible explanation for the ease with which these small triatomines transition to domestic environments (Otálora-Luna and Guerin, 2014; Otálora-Luna et al., 2016).
The behavior of strict blood-feeding has traditionally been considered a defining characteristic of the Triatominae group (Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979). However, the genus Belminus does not strictly rely on blood for sustenance, necessitating a reevaluation of this taxonomic trait. Despite this inconsistency, the systematic identification of the group remains intact. It is imperative to include Belminus within the behavioral category of triatomines, considering that kleptophagy, a sophisticated and uncommon behavior in Hemiptera and even within Reduviidae, is exhibited. This suggests that Triatominae is a cohesive evolutionary unit that likely originated only once, indicating its monophyletic nature (as per Schaefer 2005). Throughout their evolutionary history, Belminus bugs have selectively adopted and adapted behavioral patterns that align with a) their ancestral lineage (Triatominae), b) their carnivorous dietary requirements, and c) the ecological contexts they inhabit (such as ectoparasitism). It is reasonable to infer that the kleptophagic behaviors observed in Belminus species have played a significant role in their successful adaptation to the synanthropic niche. The presence of cockroaches in human dwellings provides an ideal environment for Belminus species, as both cockroaches and humans serve as potential hosts, facilitating their acclimatization to human habitats.
An enhanced ethological understanding of the Triatominae, encompassing behavioral, systematic, and evolutionary perspectives, is crucial for the advancement of innovative control strategies. Specifically, investigating the instinctive behaviors of Belminus and other triatomine species is vital for designing experiments that aim to enhance control technologies.
