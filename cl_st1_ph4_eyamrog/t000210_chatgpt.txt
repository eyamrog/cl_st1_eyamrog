An 82-year-old man presented with cough and weakness and was admitted to our clinic. Upon examination, his body temperature was 38.0°C, heart rate 93 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 86% (with an oxygen mask at 5 L/min). Laboratory results indicated elevated levels of blood leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, D-dimer, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin at 8.56 x 10^3/µL, 7.4 x 10^3/µL, 0.62 x 10^3/µL, 2304 ng/mL, 638 mg/dL, 183 mg/L, 720 ng/mL, and 0.2 ng/mL, respectively. A computed tomography scan of the thorax suggested a diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (see Figure 1). Treatment was initiated with antiviral (Favipavir 2 x 1600 mg loading, 2 x 600 mg maintenance) and antibacterial (levofloxacin 500 mg/day) therapies. The patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid in an oronasopharyngeal swab specimen. On the third day of treatment, the patient experienced weakness and loss of muscle tone in the left arm.
Brain diffusion magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple advanced-stage infarctions (Figure 2). Enoxaparin at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours and acetylsalicylic acid at a dose of 100 mg once daily were incorporated into the treatment regimen. Subsequent monitoring of laboratory parameters indicated improvement. Ultimately, the patient was discharged on the 20th day following admission.
COVID-19 has been associated with an increased risk of cerebral infarction and mortality in elderly individuals. Anticoagulants have shown efficacy in managing high D-dimer levels in this population, potentially reducing the risk of coagulation dysfunction and subsequent cerebral infarction. It is crucial to consider thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients, particularly those with identifiable risk factors and abnormal laboratory results.
