(Zingiberales Griseb. in the Núcleo Curucutu, Parque Estadual Serra do Mar, São Paulo State, Brazil). This work consists in a taxonomic survey. Identification key, morphological descriptions, illustrations, geographic distribution and phenology are presented. The order is represented in the study area by four species divided into three families: Goeppertia monophylla (Vell.) Borchs. & S.Suárez (Marantaceae), Heliconia farinosa Raddi (Heliconiaceae), Hedychium coccineum Buch.-Ham. ex Sm. and Renealmia petasites Gagnep. (Zingiberaceae).
Zingiberales is an order of tropical plants within monocotyledons formed by eight families: Cannaceae Juss., represented by one genus and 10 species; Costaceae Nakai, which has six genera and 143 species; Heliconiaceae Nakai, one genus and 200 species; Lowiaceae Ridl., one genus and 20 species; Marantaceae R. Br., 31 genera and 550 species; Musaceae Juss., three genera and 91 species, Strelitziaceae Hutch., three genera and seven species; and Zingiberaceae Martinov, 56 genera and 1.600 species, totaling 102 genera and 2.621 species (Stevens 2017).
In terms of occurrence, seven of these families have already been identified in Brazil, one of which was introduced (Musaceae); 31 genera and 319 species, being 131 of them endemic. In São Paulo, there are seven families, 20 genera and 65 species (André 2020a, b, c, Almeida & Antar 2020, Braga 2020, Ferreira 2020, Saka et al. 2020)
These plants can size from a few centimeters up to 10 meters in height. Some of the characteristics of this groups sort from a rhizomatous stem, that usually stores starch; presence of pseudostem, rarely true stem; parallel-pinned leaf venation; terminal or basal inflorescences, generally surrounded by colored bracts; complete and bisexual flowers, only Musaceae presents unisexual flowers, 1-6 fertile stamens, 1-5 sterile stamens that can look like petals (staminodes); inferior ovary with three locules, each one may have one or more ovules; fleshy or dried fruits; seeds with aryl in general (Costa et al. 2011).
From an economic point of view, it is possible to find in the order many species of food interest, such as Musa paradisiaca L. (banana tree), which produces edible parthenocarpic fruits (Souza & Lorenzi 2005) and Zingiber officinale Roscoe (ginger), used in drinks and confectionery production (Elpo & Negrelle 2004); also species of ornamental interest, such as Goeppertia ornata (Lem.) Borchs. & Suárez (pin-stripe calathea) for having attractive leaves (Vieira et al. 2012), Heliconia bihai (L.) L. (firebird), Canna indica L. (canna lily) and Strelitzia reginae Banks (bird-of- paradise flower) (Lorenzi & Souza 2001, Souza & Lorenzi 2005, Castro et al. 2011) known for producing striking inflorescences; and at last, kinds of popular medicinal interest, like Curcuma longa L. (turmeric), used in treatments for respiratory diseases (Santiago et al. 2015).
The present work is part of the Flora study of the Núcleo Curucutu, important region, but little- known, even though being a part of São Paulo City (Garcia & Pirani 2005), carried out in partnership with the Universidade Santo Amaro and the Herbarium PMSP. For monocots, works with Iridaceae (Takeuchi et al. 2008) and Orchidaceae (Rosa & Affonso 2009) were also developed in the area.
With the main purpose of developing the taxonomic study of Zingiberales in the Núcleo Curucutu, collections, identifications, descriptions, identification key, illustrations and data on the geographic and phenological distribution of the species found were carried out, thus contributing to the knowledge of the local flora, the State of São Paulo and the Atlantic Forest.
The Núcleo Curucutu located at the coordinates 23°59'09.7"S and 46°44'32.5"W was created in 1977, concomitantly to the Parque Estadual Serra do Mar, covering the municipalities of São Paulo, Itanhaém, Mongaguá and Juquitiba, having its origins in the Fazenda Curucutu, a coal producer, acquired by the State in 1958 and transformed into a Forest Reserve (Bellato & Mendes 2002, PESM 2021a).
The vegetation consists predominantly of fields and high-altitude forests. It has a total area of 37.512 hectares, altitude reaching 870 meters, temperate climate, with hot and rainy summers and winter with milder temperatures (Bellato & Mendes 2002, Garcia & Pirani 2003, Infraestrutura e Meio Ambiente 2021).
From the beginning, one of its objectives was the preservation of springs and water sources in the metropolitan region of São Paulo through the Capivari and Embu Guaçu rivers, and in Itanhaém, the Mambu/Rio Branco system. In relation to ecosystem services, the Núcleo contributes in several aspects, such as regulation of air and climate quality, in the protection of hills, slopes and soils, in the preservation of biodiversity, among other attributions (PESM 2021a, b).
The specimens used in this work comes from the plateau sector. They are deposited in the scientific collection of the Universidade Santo Amaro and in the Herbarium PMSP. Field collects have been done during February of 2018 and November of 2020, period of development of this work. Herborization followed the methodology described by Fidalgo & Bononi (1989).
For the analysis and identification of the samples, specialized literature was consulted (Maas 1977, Santos 1978, Forzza & Wanderley 1999, Catharino 2002, Kamer & Maas 2003, Souza et al. 2007, Wongsuwan & Picheansoonthon 2011, Vieira et al. 2012, Saka 2016) as such as the Zingiberales collections of the PMSP, SPF and SPSF, in addition to the virtual herbariums: BHCB, CEPEC, E, FURB, HUFU, IBGE, ICN, JBRJ, K, MBM, NY, P/PC, R, RB, UPCB and S (acronyms according to Thiers, continuously updated).
The flowering and fruiting data were obtained through the analysis of the exsiccates, field observations and literature. The morphological terms followed those described in Gonçalves & Lorenzi (2011). The illustrations were free hand made with the aid of a stereomicroscope and finished by illustrator Klei Rodrigo de Sousa.
In the Núcleo Curucutu, four species of the Zingiberales order, belonging to three different families, were found, Goeppertia monophylla (Vell.) Borchs. & S.Suárez (Marantaceae), Heliconia farinosa Raddi (Heliconiaceae), Hedychium coccineum Buch.-Ham. ex Sm. and Renealmia petasites Gagnep. (Zingiberaceae).

Goeppertia monophylla is endemic in Brazil, found in the Atlantic Forest in the States of Bahia, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (Saka et al. 2020). In the Núcleo Curucutu, it is mainly observed in humid, shaded environments close to watercourses.
In the study area it blooms from December to March and bears fruit in February. According to Forzza & Wanderley (1999), outside the Núcleo Curucutu the species blooms practically all year, although fruiting data have not been recorded.
The species showed few fruiting records throughout this research, the fruits of G. monophylla were seen only once, being present in a few individuals. The absence of fruiting records may be due to a failure in the collection, since the fruits develop inside the bracts that are usually going through a blackening process, which are very hard to visualize.
The materials from Rio de Janeiro (according to: J.M.A. Braga 7416 and F.A. Silva 103) registered flowering in February and fruiting from February to March, a period in which we also recorded these occurrences in the study area. It is possible that the hottest the period of the year, the more intensified the processes for this species are.
Goeppertia monophylla has the capacity to form large populations, exceeding 30 individuals (Saka 2016). In the Núcleo Curucutu it was possible to observe this phenomenom. According to Saka (2016), the species may have purple, grayish-white and pale-yellow flowers, the last two observed in this study of interest.
The species in both vegetative and reproductive states, when placed in 70º alcohol or herborized, gets blackened, an important process that enables the collection of descriptive data about the color of the plant in the field.
Goeppertia monophylla and G. fatimae (H.Kenn. & J.M.A.Braga) Borchs. & S.Suárez are very similar to each other, with few morphological differences, such as the distribution of hair on the peduncle, while G. monophylla has a minimally pubescent peduncle, G. fatimae has a hirsute one (Saka 2016).
It can be differentiated from all species of the order Zingiberales found in the Núcleo Curucutu by its pulvinus, the green color of its inflorescence and the presence of flowers with grayish-white or pale-yellow colors.
In comparison with the other native species in this work, G. monophylla is the only one that has never appeared on the list of threatened species, the species has a “Least Concerned” conservation status (CNCFlora 2012a).
Robust herb 2-3 m tall. Leaves distichous, glabrous 4-6 per pseudostem; absent ligule; petiole 1.13-1.36 m long; absent pulvinus; blade 47.5-67.5 x 18-27 cm, apex acute to acuminate, base obtuse, mostly lacerated, asymmetric, with prominent central vein in the abaxial surface and canaliculated in the adaxial surface, green in both surfaces. Terminal inflorescence, erect 22.4-34 cm long; red rachis, thyrsoid cincinnate, glabrous, with apparent internode 1-4 cm long; bracts 6-10, distichous, internally green, yellow and red, externally red, getting yellowish and slightly greenish in the apex, showy, boat-shaped, persistent, apex acuminate, slightly auriculate base being the lower ones generally more foliose, fertile or sterile, the first fertile basal 12-16 x 2-3 cm in the base, narrowing towards the apex. Flowers in a fascicle in the internal base of bracts, with only part of the perianth apparent, pedicellate, 6-16 in the lower fascicle, decreasing in number toward the apex; white bracteoles, slightly greenish or reddish, oval-lanceolate, glabrous, with median vein marked 2-2.3 x 1-1.5 cm in the base; glabrous pedicels 0.8-1 cm long, bigger in the fruits; bent perianth 4-4.5 cm long, boat-shaped sepals, glabrous, the upper free up to the base, the lower connate, green-yellowish or yellow; absent labellum; staminode lanceolate 0.8-1.2 x 0.1-0.2 cm in the base, apex acuminate; stamen with partially exserted anther when mature 1.1-1.4 cm long, cream when are new; filament 2.8-3.5 cm long, white; style 3.5- 4.5 cm long, angulose, cream; stigma 0.1 x 0.1 cm; ovary ca. 1 x 0.5 cm, glabrous, white-greenish; one ovule per locule. Drupe 1.5-2 x 1-1.3 cm, slightly triangular, glabrous, dark blue when mature. Seeds 3, 0.8-1 x 0.4-0.8 cm, brown-greenish; absent aril.
Endemic species in Brazil, found in the ombrophilous regions of the Atlantic Forest in the States of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (Braga 2020). The collected specimens were found in an isolated population, in humid soil, close to the watercourse and covered by tree vegetation.
In the Núcleo Curucutu, H. farinosa blooms from December to February and bears fruit from January to March. The species blooms between April and December and bears fruit between May and August (Catharino 2002). There are also flowering records in January and fruiting in September (according to: Andersson 1530 and H.V.M. Gomes 23).
The specimens of the Núcleo Curucutu present tricolor bracts (red, yellow and green). The presence of three colors in bracts is rarely mentioned, both in literature and in the exsiccates descriptions. We noticed that in many cases there was only the predominant color, red, recorded, even when a second color was present in study.
According to Simão & Scatena (2004), the bracts of the material collected from the Núcleo Picinguaba and the have red-orange coloration both internally and externally, differentiating from the material of this work even though both share the same origin. These records lead us to consider that the species must present bicolor and tricolor bracts, the last one less frequently.
Among the species of Heliconia that occur in the State of São Paulo, H. farinosa is similar to H. subulata Ruiz & Pav., being differentiated by the presence of an elliptical or oblong blade, fertile basal bract and elliptical bracteole, while H. farinosa has only elliptical blades, foliate, fertile or sterile basal bract and oval-lanceolate bracteole (Braga 2020). This species can be differentiated from other Zingiberales of the Núcleo Curucutu due to its boat-shaped bracts and leaves, mostly lacerated.
The species is currently in a “Least Concern” situation (CNCFlora 2012b), but as its occurrence becomes rare outside protected areas, your registration in the Núcleo Curucutu brings hope for the species to survive (Braga 2008).

Leaves with sheaths, bladeless sheaths 2-3; ligule oblong 1.3-2.5 x 0.9-1.5 cm, apex obtuse to shallowly bilobed or acute, green with brownish margin; absent petiole; absent pulvinus; blade oblong 33-47 x 2.5-4.5 cm, apex acuminate, base cuneate, upper surface glabrous, lower surface pubescent. Terminal inflorescence, erect 10-21 cm long, hairy; peduncle 10- 15 cm long, hairy; bracts lax 2.5-3.9 x 0.7-1.7 cm, folded, oblong, apex obtuse-acute, hairy, green, each subtending a cincinnus of 3-6 flowers; tubular bracteoles; first bracteole ca. 1.6 x 1 cm, apex acute, hairy, greenish; second bracteole ca. 1.2 x 0.5 cm, apex acute, membranous, hairy, greenish; third bracteole ca. 1 x 0.4 cm, membranous, hairy, greenish.

Unobserved fruits.
Hedychium coccineum is the only species of Zingiberales found in the Núcleo Curucutu that is cultivated in Brazil, it has its original distribution in Asian countries such as Bhutan, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand (Wongsuwan & Picheansoonthon 2011). In Brazil the species is found in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and possible occurrence in Pernambuco (André 2020c). Its occurrence in Distrito Federal and Rio Grande do Sul was also recorded (according to: Pereira B.A.S. 163 and Baptista L. 673).
In the study area, flowers could be seen in the species from February to March, and although being monitored for two years, there was no occurrence of fruiting during this period.
In Brazil, flowering occurrences were recorded in the Distrito Federal and Paraná in January (according to: Pereira B.A.S. 163 and Griep I. 51), Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina in December (according to: Baptista L. 673 and Funez L.A. 5940) and in Rio de Janeiro it blooms and bears fruit between January and February (according to: IRC/RCC 696 and L.C. Giordano 31). According to Wongsuwan & Picheansoonthon (2011), in native regions, the species blooms between June and August and fruiting occurs between July and September.
The fruits are rare in Brazilian and foreign herbariums. In Brazil, only two materials were found, both from the Herbarium RB; and in relation to the foreign ones, only exsiccates from the P/PC and E herbariums presented fruits.
Gao et al. (2012), pointed out that H. coccineum is pollinated by three species of Lepidoptera (Butterflies), which do not occur in Brazil; in addition, spontaneous self-pollination also was not observed, despite being a self-compatible species.
Hedychium coccineum can be confused with H. gardnerianum Sheph. ex Ker Gawl. when herborized, both present yellowish to brownish flowers. Nevertheless, it can be differentiated by the width of the blade, 2.5-4.5 cm wide for H. coccineum and 4-12 cm wide for H. gardnerianum, such and the shape of the labellum, deeply divided and apex division, respectively (according to: P. Feliz 178, Souza V.C. 2145 and S.L. Marçon 43).
Hedychium coccineum can be distinguished from the Zingiberales in the study area by sessile leaves, 2-3 sheaths without blades and by the orange terminal inflorescence. It is found in an isolated population within high solar incidence.
Pseudostem 1-2 m tall. Leaves with striated sheaths; ligule truncated 0.1-0.25 cm long, brown; subsessile leaves; absent pulvinus; blade narrowly elliptic 13-54.4 x 3.5-12.5 cm; apex acuminate, base cuneate, glabrous on both sides. Basal raceme inflorescence in aphyllous scapes 3- 7.2 x 3.5-8.5 cm; scape 8.5-37.4 cm long, pink. Flowers with pink pedicel 0.5-1.5 cm long; bracts narrowly elliptic-obovate 1.5-8 x 1-2.5 cm, pink; bracteole 1.5-2.3 x 1-1.5 cm; calyx 1-2 x 1-1.9 cm, pinkish-red; corolla tube 0.6-1.4 cm, lobes narrowly elliptic 0.8-1.1 cm long, 3-lobed, white; labellum 3-lobed, slightly pink target, pubescent base 0.6-1.2 cm long, lateral lobes involut, rounded, middle lobe entire or bilobulate 1-1.5 cm long; linear lateral staminodes ca. 0.3 cm long; claw ca. 0.1 cm long; anther 0.6-0.8 x 0.3-0.4 cm; filament ca. 0.2 cm long; style 1.7-2 cm long, red; stigma 0.2-0.3 cm wide, cordiform, puberulous, red; nectaries ca. 0.3 x 0.3 cm; ovary 1-1.3 x 0.5-0.7 cm, glabrous, red; multiple ovules per locule. Capsule 1-2 x 1.2-2 cm, dark red, becoming black when mature. Seeds 0.3-0.5 cm long, bright brown; orange aril.
Renealmia petasites is endemic in Brazil, with occurrences in the Atlantic Forest, distributed in the States of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná and Santa Catarina (André 2020c). Its occurrence in Bahia was also recorded (according to: L.A. Mattos Silva 3673, M.M.M. Lopes 312 and D. Cardoso 1668).
In the Núcleo Curucutu, flowers were present in the species between August and May and bears fruit between March and September. Outside the study area, flowering records from August to December and fruiting from October to February. Kamer & Maas (2003) cite flowering throughout the year.
The fruits of R. petasites were observed in the field and laboratory, and its seeds released in a state of extreme maturity, beginning the opening at the base until arriving the apex.
Renealmia petasites is very similar to R. chrysotricha Petersen, presenting minimal differences, differentiating by the leaf blade wider 4-13 cm wide, shorter calyx 1-2 cm long, bigger pedicel 0.5-1.5 cm long, white labellum slightly pink and approximately 50 seeds per fruit, while R. chrysotricha presents 4.5-9.5 cm wide leaf blade, longest calyx 1.8-2.5 cm long, smaller pedicel 0.2- 0.6 cm long, completely white labellum and up to 25 seeds per fruit (Maas 1977, Lima et al. 2018)
Maas (1977) pointed out that R. petasites is a relatively variable species, which may present a great difference in the size of the inflorescences according to the collection site. This variation can be observed when comparing the specimens in the study area with other locations. The specimens in the study area showed scapes with 8.5-37.4 cm long and inflorescences of 3-7.2 cm long, which are small structures compared to specimens from other locations, reaching 50 cm long of scape and 30 cm long of inflorescence (according to: H. Mosén 2966, Reitz & Klein 4027 and L.A Mattos Silva 3673).
Another characteristic observed was that the specimens of the Núcleo Curucutu have a more compact and globular inflorescence, while those analyzed from other locations have a more lax inflorescence, as in the case of the specimens analyzed from Bahia (according to: L.A. Mattos Silva 3673), Rio de Janeiro (according to: R. Mello-Silva 1230) and Santa Catarina (according to: Reitz & Klein 4027).
Renealmia petasites differs from other Zingiberales species in the Núcleo Curucutu because it is the only one that presents subsessile leaves and tiny staminodes. Only four adult specimens were found, therefore, is the species with the least number of individuals along the explored trails.
The species was considered extinct in Minas Gerais due to the absence of collections for 30 years, leaving the list in 2008 (Diário do Executivo 1997, Diário do Executivo 2008). In 2012 it was classified as “Least Concern” (CNCFlora 2012c).
For São Paulo the species did not reach a critical situation as pointed out for Minas Gerais, but being part of a species found in a Conservation Unit in the State, a "Least Concern" status is regularly maintained.
We thank the team of the Núcleo Curucutu, for their support in the collections; the Instituto Florestal, for authorizing the occurrence of this project; the curators of the visited herbariums, Ricardo José Francischetti Garcia (PMSP), João Batista Baitello (SPSF) and Renato de Mello-Silva in memoriam (SPF); Pedro Resende (UnB), for the English review and the Universidade Santo Amaro, for all the assistance.
