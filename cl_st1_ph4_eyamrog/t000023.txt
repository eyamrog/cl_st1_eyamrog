ABSTRACT – (Periphytic algal flora of the low Doce river, Espírito Santo State, Brazil, after ore 
tailings flow, 1: smooth cell walled Cosmarium Corda (Zygnematophyceae, Desmidiaceae). Study 
aimed at identifying and recording smooth or finely punctate cell walled Cosmarium Corda species 
of the low Doce river region, Espírito Santo State, Brazil. Periphytic material was collected monthly 
during the period October 2018 to February 2020, except for October 2019. We identified 22 taxa 
and analyzed the environmental conditions (trophic state, pH and total iron) in which each taxon 
occurred. Our study recorded 21 new records of smooth cell walled Cosmarium for Espírito Santo 
State and one (Cosmarium trilobulatum var. tumidum Willi Krieger & Gerloff) for Brazil.

Introduction 
 
Originally described by Ralfs in 1848, genus Cosmarium Corda gathers over 1,500 taxa and 
consists in the most numerous and one of the oldest genera of family Desmidiaceae. Genus is 
composed by usually free-living single cells with a median constriction that vary from a deep closed 
depression to a widely open and shallow one, that divides the cell into two symmetrical semicells and 
vary in shape and size depending on the species (Bicudo & Menezes 2017). Taxonomy of Cosmarium 
is primarily based on the cell outline and cell wall ornamentation. For practical purposes, however, 
taxonomists tend to divide it into two artificial groups: one with ornamented cell walls (ornamentation 
varying from small granules to scrobiculations and tiny spines) and the other one with smooth or 
finely punctate cell wall.

Genus Cosmarium is worldwide recorded in many taxonomic surveys. From classical 19th 
century literature (e.g., Brébisson 1856, Lundell 1871, Nordstedt & Wittrock 1876, Ralfs 1848, West 
& G.S. West 1895) to the more recent papers, the genus was recorded for many countries, including 
Nigeria (Biswas & Nweze 1990), Colombia (Duque & Donato 1996), Canada (Elster et al. 1997), 
Bangladesh (Islam & Irfanullah 2006), India (Dhande & Jawale 2009, Bansod & Patil 2019), Czech 
Republic (Šťastný 2009), South Korea (Lee 2015) and many others. Over 600 Cosmarium taxa were 
recorded for Brazil (Biolo & Bicudo 2018), and the genus was more intensively studied in the south 
region where numerous taxonomic studies revealed its presence in both phytoplankton and periphyton 
of reservoirs and rivers. Recent floristic studies recording the presence of Cosmarium in Brazil 
include States such as Paraná (Silva & Cecy 2004, Bortolini et al. 2010, Felisberto & Rodrigues 2010, 
Biolo et al. 2013, Menezes et al. 2011, Carvalho et al. 2015, Moresco et al. 2015, Aquino et al. 2016, 
Osório et al. 2018, Rodrigues & Moresco 2021), São Paulo (Bicudo et al. 2019, Felisberto & 
Rodrigues 2010), Bahia (Oliveira et al. 2010, Oliveira et al. 2011, Oliveira et al. 2016, Ramos et al. 
2018, Ramos et al. 2021), Goiás (Felisberto & Rodrigues 2004), Distrito Federal (Estrela et al. 2011), 
Amazonas (Saturnino et al. 2020), Sergipe (Burle et al. 2020), Mato Grosso and Rio de Janeiro 
(Kanetsuna 2004). Furthermore, in the last 10 years five new species of Cosmarium were described 
based on Brazilian material: Cosmarium bahianum G.J.P.Ramos, C.E.M.Bicudo & C.W.N.Moura, 
Cosmarium bromelicola G.J.P.Ramos, C.E.M.Bicudo & C.W.N.Moura, Cosmarium diamantinum 
G.J.P.Ramos & C.W.N.Moura, Cosmarium imperiale G.J.P.Ramos & C.W.N.Moura and Cosmarium 
oliveirae G.J.P.Ramos, C.E.M.Bicudo & C.W.N.Moura, in addition to a few taxonomic varieties. 
Despite having one of the most important coastal lake systems of Brazil (Barroso et al. 2012), Espírito 
Santo State has been widely neglected concerning its algal flora studies. Delazari-Barroso et al. 
(2007) is the only floristic study of the State recording the presence of the genus by four Cosmarium 
taxa (Cosmarium asphaerosporum var. strigosum Nordstedt, Cosmarium cf. capitulum J.Roy & 
Bisset, Cosmarium pseudobroomei Wolle and Cosmarium pseudoconnatum Nordstedt). 
The Low Doce River region is undergoing severe urban and rural anthropogenic interference 
mainly represented by livestock, agriculture and the increasing industrialization (Barroso et al. 2012) 
even before the Fundão dam failure in 2015. Dam rupture released downstream about 43 million m³ 
(Carmo et al. 2017) of mining tailings, causing several changes on the fluvial system, such as erosion, 
degradation, and iron (Fe) enrichment to potentially impactful levels (Hatje et al. 2017). Lack of 
floristic studies in the region and the fact that mine tailing inputs have previously caused taxonomic 
and functional changes in several communities, such as the benthic fauna (Burd 2002), marine 
macroalgal flora (Correa et al. 1999), planktonic algae (Salonen et al. 2006), and benthic algal

communities (Lavoie et al. 2012), highlights the importance of periphyton biodiversity studies in the 
region. 
Present study aimed at performing a taxonomic survey of the smooth cell walled Cosmarium 
species of the Low Doce River region three years after the input of iron ore tailings, also focusing on 
species autecology, thus contributing to the knowledge of freshwater algal diversity of Espírito Santo 
State. 
 
Materials and Methods 
 
The study was carried out in three cities in Espírito Santo State: Baixo Guandu, Colatina and 
Linhares. Detailed information on study area and sampling design are available in Zorzal-Almeida et 
al. (2021). For taxonomic and ecological analysis, a minimum of five non-permanent slides were 
prepared for each sample. Material was observed and photographed, respectively, with a Motic 
Panthera L digital binocular upright Olympus microscope and a Moticam 3.0 MP camera. The 
following taxonomic features were observed for identification and description of the material at the 
microscope: cell shape, number and position of chloroplasts and pyrenoids, cell wall structure, and 
metric data such as cell length and width, and isthmus width. Cell length (L), cell width (W) and 
isthmus width (I) were measured using Motic Image Plus 3.0 software. Identification was based on 
classic literature (e.g. Ralfs 1848, West & West 1895, 1902, Croasdale 1956, Scott & Grönblad 1957, 
Krieger 1932) and recent papers (e.g. Coesel & Meesters 2007, Oliveira et al. 2016, Bicudo et al. 
2019, etc.). 
Environmental conditions were described according to ecosystem type (rivers, lagoons and 
lakes), trophic state index (TSI), and pH (method specifications in Zorzal-Almeida et al. 2021), 
classified as acid (< 6.5), alkaline (> 7.5) and circumneutral (6.5-7.5) (Šťastný 2010). Occurrence 
frequency of each taxon was calculated according to Zorzal-Almeida et al. (2021). To highlight the 
first citations for Espírito Santo State, taxa are marked with [*] and the first citations for Brazil with 
[**]. Samples studied during the present inventory are deposited at the Herbarium VIES/UFES. 
 
 
Results and discussion 
 
Twenty-two smooth cell walled Cosmarium Corda taxa were presently identified, from which 
21 were recorded for the first time for Espírito Santo State and one for Brazil. List of taxa and their 
occurrence frequency are listed in Table1.

Figure 1 
Cell 1.1-1.2 times longer than broad, sometimes c. 1.1 times broader than long; median constriction 
deep, sinus linear, slightly open at the extremity; semicells trapezoidal, apex truncate, angles rounded, 
lateral margins convex to slightly straight; cell wall smooth, chloroplast 1, pyrenoid 1 per semicell; 
cell apical view elliptical, semicell lateral view circular. L: 6.8-14.1 µm; W: 6.3-11.3 µm; I: 1-4.3 
µm. 
Note: This variety showed a considerable morphological plasticity, mainly in their length:width ratio 
and lateral margins shape. Bicudo (1988) discussed the polymorphism in Cosmarium abbreviatum 
var. minus and its consequences for the taxonomic identification of such small desmids, suggesting 
the great probability of many taxa, among which Cosmarium succisum G.S.West var. jaoi Willi 
Krieger & Gerloff and C. abbreviatum var. minus, might just be morphological expressions of the 
one same species. Present material displayed the same morphological variation described in the 
above-cited literature. 
Present material occurred in all lentic and lotic environments studied, under oligotrophic to 
hypertrophic, and acidic to alkaline conditions.

Cell c. 1.8 times longer than broad, median constriction deep, sinus closed near the isthmus, open at 
the extremity; semicells quadratic, apical and basal angles rounded, apex truncate, a refractive 
thickening in the center; cell wall smooth, with 3 horizontal rows of punctations on each semicell, 
chloroplast 1, pyrenoid 1 per semicell. L: 19.4-30.7 µm; W: 10.8-17.9 µm; I: 3.5-3.7 µm. 
Note: The present species has a feature not usually observed in Cosmarium difficile Lütkemüller, i.e., 
a refractive thickening at the apex of the semicells. The only representative of C. difficile having such 
apical thickening is C. difficile f. laeve Scott & Prescott, however, this forma does not have the typical 
pore rows of the species. Thus, it was decided that the current material would be best identified as C. 
difficile, mainly due to the typical punctuation rows despite of the originally non-described feature. 
The possibility of the present material be representative of a new variety of C. difficile is also an open 
question to be considered in the future, until further studies be made towards its best delimitation at 
intraspecific level. 
Present material was collected from lentic systems, under oligotrophic to eutrophic and circumneutral 
to alkaline conditions.

Note: Cosmarium galeritum var. subtumidum differs from the nominate variety in having more 
rounded semicells (Borge 1903). Present specimen showed rounded to slightly truncate apex, a 
variation similar to that in Borge’s (1903) illustration, a fact that led us to its current identification.

Final remarks 
 
Cosmarium abbreviatum var. minus was the only species occurring in all kinds of 
environments studied, present in lakes, lagoons and rivers. Most species occurred in lentic 
environments, only seven in lotic systems, and Cosmarium impressulum was the only species that 
showed preference for the latter kind of habitat. The most frequent species was Cosmarium granatum 
var. granatum, followed by C. abbreviatum var. minus. Among the environments studied, Limão lake 
and Monsarás lagoon presented the greatest diversity, the first with 14 and the last one with 12 out of 
the 22 species identified during the present inventory. Concerning pH preference, differing from the 
idea that genus Cosmarium inhabit most preferably clean and acid waters (Bicudo & Menezes 2017), 
only four taxa occurred in acidic conditions, most species living in circumneutral and alkaline 
conditions. Most species exhibited a wide distribution in terms of trophic state, with 10 species 
occurring up to mesotrophic conditions and 12 above eutrophic conditions. Values of total iron varied 
from 0.1 to 7.1 mg L-1 in studied systems, the values for each sampling station are detailed in Zorzal-
Almeida et al. (2021). The great majority of the species occurred in conditions bellow 4.5 mg L-1, 
and almost half of them bellow 1.5 mg L-1. Two species occurred under conditions of high levels of 
total iron when compared to the others, which were Cosmarium norimbergense var. depressum (5.7 
mg L-1) and Cosmarium granatum var. granatum (7.1 mg L-1). Finally, current study contributed with
