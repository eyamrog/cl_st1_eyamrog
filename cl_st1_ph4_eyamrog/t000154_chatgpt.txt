Scholarly journals should carefully consider the attitudes of their respective communities before implementing any of the seven characteristics associated with open peer review. It is crucial to acknowledge that survey results from the Global North may not necessarily be applicable to the Global South, where double-blind peer review remains prevalent, even within fields such as natural sciences and medicine. This study presents the outcomes of a survey conducted on the perceptions of open peer review among four key stakeholder groups associated with a medical journal in Brazil: society members, journal readers, authors, and reviewers. In comparison to a previous survey predominantly involving researchers in the natural sciences from Europe, this current survey revealed a similar level of overall support for open peer review and its various attributes. However, a notable exception was the concept of open identities, which was viewed unfavorably by a majority of participants, particularly in this survey compared to the previous one. Interestingly, participants displayed a more nuanced perspective on open identities when considering specific outcomes associated with this practice. Given the rising popularity of preprints, which are incompatible with double-blind review, future investigations should explore the potential impact of transitioning from double-blind to open identities, particularly in relation to gender bias. In the interim, scholarly journals employing double-blind review may opt to initially adopt other aspects of open review or introduce open identities as an optional feature.
Peer review emerged as a fundamental component of journal publishing during the latter half of the 20th century, coinciding with significant shifts in scholarly communication (Baldwin, 2018; Tennant et al., 2017; Zuckerman; Merton, 1971). In this conventional form of peer review, editors solicit evaluations from chosen reviewers to enhance authors' manuscripts and guide editorial decisions, all while maintaining confidentiality from the public. Typically, peer review follows a double-blind process, where the identities of both authors and reviewers are kept confidential. However, in journals predominantly from the Global North focusing on natural sciences and medicine, single-blind peer review is more common, allowing reviewers to be aware of authors' identities (Pontille; Torny, 2014).
While peer review is generally trusted and deemed advantageous (Jubb, 2016; Mulligan et al., 2013), empirical evidence supporting its benefits is limited (Jefferson et al., 2007; Smith, 2006; 2010), with traditional peer review facing substantial criticism and demands for reform throughout history (Csiszar, 2016; Ross-Hellauer, 2017; Tennant et al., 2017). Notably, former medical editor Richard Smith (2006; 2010) vehemently criticized traditional peer review for its inconsistency, bias, susceptibility to abuse, inefficiency, resistance to innovative research, and failure to catch most errors. His former journal was among the pioneers in peer review reform (Schroter et al., 2020), catalyzing what is now referred to as a "peer review revolution" (Tennant et al., 2017).
"Open peer review" serves as an overarching term encompassing peer review advancements aligned with the principles of open science (Ross-Hellauer, 2017; Tennant et al., 2017; Wolfram et al., 2020). Ross-Hellauer (2017) identified 122 definitions of open peer review, delineating seven key "traits": open identities, where authors and reviewers are aware of each other's identities; open reports, where review reports are published alongside the relevant article; open participation, enabling the broader community to contribute to the review process; open interaction, fostering direct reciprocal discussions among authors, reviewers, and/or between reviewers; open pre-review manuscripts, making manuscripts immediately available (e.g., through pre-print servers like arXiv) before formal peer review procedures; open final version commenting, allowing review or comments on the final 'version of record' publications; and open platforms ("decoupled review"), where review is facilitated by an entity separate from the publication venue. Open identities and open reports are commonly regarded as "core traits" in most definitions of open peer review (Ross-Hellauer, 2017). For an in-depth analysis of how each trait addresses traditional peer review shortcomings and aligns with various schools of open science, refer to Ross-Hellauer (2017). Additionally, reviews of the evidence base for different traits of open peer review can be found in Ross-Hellauer (2017), Tennant et al. (2017), and Bruce et al. (2016). Notably, in the Global North, the adoption of open peer review is prominent in "born open" journals within natural sciences or medicine (Tennant et al., 2017; Wolfram et al., 2020), while in the Global South, organizations like the SciELO Network play a significant role in driving the uptake of open peer review.
Implementing open peer review presents challenges due to the varying editorial goals associated with different traits of this model, with acceptability differing across scholarly communities (Ross-Hellauer; Görögh, 2019). For instance, communities traditionally utilizing single-blind peer review, such as those in medicine and natural sciences in the Global North (Pontille; Torny, 2014), are also more inclined towards open identities (Wolfram et al., 2020), indicating that the advantages of open peer review may be less apparent for communities employing double-blind peer review. Moreover, open participation appears to be more prevalent in the social sciences and humanities compared to the natural sciences, technology, and medicine (Ross-Hellauer, 2017).
One proposed strategy is for editors to survey their communities' attitudes towards open peer review (Ross-Hellauer & Görögh, 2019). Previous surveys have indicated that open identities are perceived by scholars as less likely to enhance peer review (Ross-Hellauer et al., 2017), with double-blind peer review being favored over single-blind or open identities (Mulligan et al., 2013; Bernal & Román-Molina, 2018). To our knowledge, no survey focusing on open peer review has specifically targeted a scholarly community in the Global South as of yet.
This study presents findings from an online survey that investigated attitudes towards open peer review within the context of a non-profit, scholar-led medical journal based in Brazil, namely the Revista Brasileira de Medicina de Família e Comunidade (RBMFC; ISSN 2179-7994).
The electronic survey was conducted online from April 6 to May 10, 2020, utilizing formr 0.18.3 (Arslan & Tata, 2018), an open-source survey framework (Arslan et al., 2019). The complete formr "run" (comprising questionnaires and their interconnections) employed in this survey can be accessed openly on the Open Science Framework (Fontenelle & Sarti, 2020a). The participants were categorized into four groups of RBMFC stakeholders.
SBMFC members were physicians, not medical students, holding an active membership in the Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina de Família e Comunidade (SBMFC), the scholarly society that sponsors and publishes the journal.
The readership of this study encompassed individuals who had perused one or more articles published in RBMFC within the preceding twelve months.
The authors eligible for participation in this study were individuals who had published an article in RBMFC within the past five years.
Reviewers were individuals who had peer-reviewed a submission for RBMFC within the past five years.
The survey, bearing the approval of the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Vila Velha (CAAE nº 28912719.0.0000.5064, report nº 3.846.811), mandated participants to furnish informed consent prior to engaging with the questionnaire items. The information disseminated to potential participants delineated the study objectives in a neutral fashion ("We would like to hear the opinion of readers, authors, and reviewers of RBMFC and members of SBMFC about some ways RBMFC might conduct peer review differently") to circumvent any predisposition towards a more positive or negative stance on the current system or open peer review. Participants were also briefed on the survey's anonymity, anticipated duration ("only 15 minutes", which concurrently served as a disclosure regarding potential harms or risks), benefits ("Results will inform the editorial policies of RBMFC and other scholarly journals in general"), authorship, ethical endorsement, and avenues for communication. Engagement in the survey was entirely voluntary, signifying that it was not obligatory for individuals to sustain interactions with RBMFC or SBMFC in any capacity, and no direct incentives were proffered to potential participants. Due to the stringent anonymity measures in place, there existed no mechanism to prevent individuals from partaking in the survey multiple times.
Participants were recruited through four distinct avenues. SBMFC extended invitations to its eligible members on April 7 and May 8, 2020, while RBMFC reached out to its registered users, including readers, authors, reviewers, and others, on April 12 and May 5, 2020. Additionally, one of the survey authors shared the announcement with SBMFC's email discussion list on May 6, 2020. Throughout the survey duration, RBMFC prominently displayed an announcement in the rightmost lateral column above the fold, ensuring visibility without the need for scrolling on screens larger than smartphones. The advertisements, mirroring the language of the informed consent page, neutrally outlined the survey's objectives and eligibility criteria. Given the potential overlap among stakeholder groups, all advertisements directed participants to a common landing page. This landing page, accessible without the need for a username or password, was only reachable via its specific URL (uniform resource locator).
The questionnaire utilized in this study was modified from Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017) to suit the specific research context and was subsequently translated into Portuguese and Spanish by the authors of this survey. Given that the questionnaire clearly delineates its fundamental concepts (traditional peer review and various aspects of open peer review) and had previously undergone pilot testing and implementation by Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017), our approach involved solely pilot testing the translated questionnaire for its accuracy and functionality. This entailed personally reviewing and completing the questionnaire, in addition to soliciting feedback from a select group of colleagues for their input.
The questionnaire consisted of a total of five pages. Following a landing page for language selection (Portuguese, Spanish, English) and another page for informed consent, the main body of the questionnaire comprised two pages with a total of 45 items. The final page, the fifth, expressed gratitude to participants and provided the URL where eventual results would be accessible at https://osf.io/u9p4n/. The initial main page contained 18 items, encompassing participant characteristics such as age, gender, schooling, geographic region, stakeholder groups, satisfaction with peer review in RBMFC, and personal experience with peer review. Additionally, it included items gauging opinions on traits that could enhance peer review, as well as attitudes towards scholarly communication and open science practices. The second main page, with 27 items, focused on experiences as an author and/or reviewer with open identities, reports, and participation, along with statements regarding the seven traits of open peer review. Responses were structured on an ordinal scale with five levels, including a "don't know" option. Participants were required to complete all items on each page before advancing, with no option to revise answers. Notably, the questionnaire items were not randomized, with the sole adaptive feature being the language selection.
The survey results were presented for each stakeholder group using absolute and relative frequencies. Attitudes towards open peer review, satisfaction with the current system, and views on open access and open data were assessed by combining the frequencies of responses indicating agreement or satisfaction. To compare stakeholder groups while accounting for their overlap, attitudes were analyzed using proportional odds logistic regression with multi-membership. This analysis was conducted using the brms and rstan packages in the R environment for statistical computing. The model considered the possibility of authors and reviewers having different attitudes compared to other participants. Estimates and their 95% uncertainty intervals were calculated with weakly informative prior distributions, detailed in the analytic code and preregistered. Responses of "don't know" were treated as missing data and excluded from estimation. Participants who did not complete the second main page of the questionnaire were still included in the analysis of the first main page items, without imputing their missing responses. Survey participants were not weighted, except for those not affiliated with any stakeholder group. Atypical timestamps did not require special handling. The analysis plan and final analytical code, as well as the open data, are available for reference. There were no significant deviations from the analysis plan, except for correcting a misnamed variable.
The survey's landing page was accessed by 402 individuals, with 191 (48%) consenting to participate, 151 (38%) completing the initial of two primary pages, and 134 (33%) finishing the entire questionnaire. Commencing times for the survey were evenly spread throughout the study period, with a median of 2020-04-17 and an interquartile range (IQR) of 2020-04-12 to 2020-05-03. The survey had a median completion time of 9.4 minutes (IQR, 6.8 to 14.9). Among the 151 participants who completed the first main page, there were 86 (5%) of 1774 eligible SBMFC members, 82 readers (out of approximately 200 thousand annual visits), 42 authors (from 290 articles with 992 unique authors), and 50 (22%) of 226 eligible reviewers.
Table 1 outlines the demographic characteristics of the 151 survey participants who completed the initial section of the questionnaire. The majority fell within the 35-44 age bracket (38%) and identified as male (55%), with a significant portion hailing from Brazil (97%) and holding undergraduate or medical degrees as their highest level of education (40%). Notably, all participants were affiliated with at least one stakeholder group, with 57% being SBMFC members, 54% readers, 28% authors, and 33% reviewers. A large proportion of respondents lacked prior exposure to open identity (83%), open reports (81%), or open participation (90%) as authors or reviewers, despite 39% reporting experience with open peer review in general. Additionally, around two-thirds expressed satisfaction with the peer review process in RBMFC.
Half of the study participants expressed agreement with the effectiveness of the current scholarly communication system, as indicated in Table 2. The majority of respondents also concurred that it is essential for research publications and data to be accessible through open access channels. However, slightly over half of the participants supported the idea of open peer review becoming a standard practice in scholarly circles.
One core trait, open identities, garnered the least support among all traits, as indicated in Table 3, with a minority of participants expressing belief in its potential to enhance peer review. However, nearly half of the participants acknowledged that open identities could enhance the quality of reviewer reports, suggesting that both reviewers and authors should have the choice to disclose their identities, as highlighted in Table 4. Concerns were raised by many participants regarding the potential for open identities to deter reviewers from accepting review requests, although fewer believed it would discourage authors from submitting their work. Additionally, a small number of participants agreed that open identities represented a fairer approach compared to traditional peer review methods.
The second core trait, open reports, garnered more support closely aligning with the concept of open peer review overall. This was evident in stakeholders' beliefs that it could enhance peer review (Table 3) and their agreement that it would offer valuable insights to readers and enhance the quality of reviewer reports (Table 4). Conversely, a comparable number of participants expressed concerns that open reports might deter reviewers from offering robust criticism or agreeing to review manuscripts.
Open interaction emerged as the most favored trait among participants, with a majority expressing confidence in its ability to enhance peer review (Table 3) and concurring that it would lead to superior publications (Table 4). While a comparable number of participants believed that open final-version commenting could also enhance peer review (Table 3), only a few were in agreement with post-publication peer review through blog articles, online journal clubs, and social media (Table 4). The level of endorsement for open participation, open pre-review manuscripts, and open platforms was somewhat lower than that for open peer review in general, yet notably higher than the support for open identities (Table 3, Table 4).
Support for open peer review varied among different stakeholder groups. Readers and SBMFC members exhibited higher levels of support compared to authors and reviewers, both in general (as shown in Table 2) and when examining individual traits (as depicted in Table 3). This trend was also evident when analyzing more specific statements, as illustrated in Table 4.
An online survey was conducted among four stakeholder groups of RBMFC, a scholarly journal from Brazil, to gauge their attitudes towards open peer review. Despite limited participation from eligible stakeholders, the neutral tone of the advertisements suggests that participants and non-participants likely share similar attitudes. One potential difference between participants and non-participants could be their level of engagement with peer review in RBMFC, evident in a higher proportion of reviewers participating compared to SBMFC members, and in participants (including readers and SBMFC members) being more likely to possess a master’s or PhD degree than family and community physicians in general (Fontenelle et al., 2020). Although the small sample size hinders precise estimates, as indicated by the uncertainty intervals, the survey closely followed the methodology of Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017). Consequently, confidence in the survey's findings is bolstered by their similarity to previous research, while differences between the surveys suggest potential contextual influences.
The participants in this survey exhibited less familiarity with open peer review compared to those in Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017) and tended to be younger. Additionally, the survey respondents belonged to a small medical specialty in a middle-income Latin American country, where they were accustomed to open access journals and double-blind peer review. In contrast, the participants in Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017) primarily hailed from the natural sciences in Europe and were more likely to have experience with single-blind peer review. It is likely that there were few to no participants from the publishing industry in this survey, although this information was not collected to maintain anonymity.
Considering these differences, it is noteworthy that both groups exhibited similarly positive attitudes towards the existing system of scholarly communication, encompassing open access, open data, and open peer review. Although their attitudes towards most specific aspects of open peer review were comparable, the concept of open identities warrants additional investigation.
Stakeholders of RBMFC expressed even less support for open identities compared to participants in the study by Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017), with this trait being the least favored in their survey despite being recognized as a fundamental aspect of open peer review according to Ross-Hellauer (2017). Surprisingly, a majority of RBMFC stakeholders believed that revealing identities would have a negative impact on peer review, as indicated in Supplemental Table 2 of Fontenelle (2020b. Interestingly, when presented with scenarios outlining the implications of open identities, respondents in both surveys displayed a more nuanced perspective. RBMFC stakeholders, including reviewers, were less inclined than participants in Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017) to believe that disclosing reviewers' identities would deter them from accepting an invitation, and only about a third of RBMFC stakeholders agreed that revealing authors' identities would discourage them from submitting. Notably, the latter statement was not included in the other survey, possibly due to the fact that authors' identities are already disclosed in single-blind peer review systems.
Authors and reviewers of RBMFC exhibited a higher tendency towards disagreement rather than agreement regarding the fairness of open identities for authors, as evidenced in Supplemental Table 2 of Fontenelle (2020b), contrasting with the participants of Ross-Hellauer (2017) who showed an equal likelihood of agreement and disagreement. This discrepancy is likely attributed to RBMFC's adoption of double-blind review, a format consistently favored in researcher surveys (Mulligan et al., 2013; Pontille; Torny, 2014; Tennant et al., 2017; Bernal; Román-Molina, 2018;). Transitioning a natural science journal from single-blind to double-blind review has been shown to reduce bias against female authors and potentially benefit other author demographics as well (Pontille; Torny, 2014; Tennant et al., 2017). However, blinding reviewers to authors' identities does not eliminate bias in cases where blinding is ineffective, nor does it address bias towards the manuscript's content, including its conclusions or theoretical framework (Pontille; Torny, 2014; Tennant et al., 2017). Notably, there is a lack of evidence regarding the impact of open identities on bias in peer review.
According to Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017), the majority of RBMFC readers, authors, and reviewers were not in favor of manuscripts being freely accessible before undergoing peer review, and most authors and reviewers expressed skepticism regarding the potential of preprints to enhance the peer review process. This lack of enthusiasm stands in stark contrast to the increasing number of preprint servers that have emerged in recent times, including bioRxiv, medRxiv, OSF Preprints, SciELO Preprints, and EmeRI (Emerging Research Information). Interestingly, when RBMFC began explicitly accepting manuscripts that were already available as preprints in December 2018, there was no significant opposition from the community. One plausible explanation for this discrepancy could be that while authors themselves may not be inclined to share their own work on preprint servers, they may not necessarily object to other authors choosing to do so.
Regrettably, the concept of double-blind review faces significant challenges when it comes to preprints, particularly those initiated by journals, as these publications are commonly shared on preprint servers like SciELO Preprints or EmeRI. This issue is particularly evident with EmeRI, which actively encourages preprint readers to volunteer for manuscript reviews for associated journals, promoting an open participation model. However, certain aspects of open peer review can coexist with double-blind review practices: for instance, open reports do not necessarily require signatures, platforms like OJS 3 can anonymize open interactions, decoupled peer review can still maintain anonymity, and open commenting on final versions can supplement rather than replace traditional peer review processes.
Stakeholders of RBMFC, a medical specialty journal in Brazil, exhibited a high level of support for open peer review, mirroring the sentiments of participants in a comprehensive survey that predominantly featured researchers from the Global North and the natural sciences. These findings imply that the outcomes of the initial survey can be extrapolated to different contexts, advocating for further studies in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, which were inadequately represented in the original survey and were excluded from the current investigation.
To our knowledge, this survey represents the initial attempt to actively engage and distinctly delineate the perspectives of a journal's readers or members of its learned society. It was observed that both sets of stakeholders exhibited a higher level of endorsement towards open peer review compared to the journal's authors and reviewers, thereby offering editors of society journals a degree of confidence to explore open peer review practices. It is plausible that stakeholders associated with scholarly journals affiliated with university departments may demonstrate a more consistent stance in their attitudes.
SciELO Brazil, known for its commitment to open science, mandates that its journals incorporate some variant of "open peer review," which may involve revealing identities, reports, or acknowledging associate editors. Drawing from this survey and existing literature, it is imperative for journal editors to exercise prudence when contemplating the implementation of open identities, given that a majority of researchers perceive it as potentially detrimental. Should journals opt for open identities, a gradual approach is recommended, with the initial phase offering it as an optional feature while closely monitoring its uptake and impact.
The growing prevalence of preprints could potentially make double-blind review impractical and necessitate the adoption of open identities. Regrettably, there has been no experimental investigation conducted thus far to assess the implications of shifting from double-blind to open identities. It is imperative that academic journals currently employing double-blind peer review consider engaging in randomized trials to evaluate the impact of this transition on the integrity and impartiality of the peer review process.
