The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the current COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing the human membrane protein ACE2 as a key entry point for infecting host cells. Through a comparative genomic analysis of 70 ACE2 orthologues in placental mammals, we aimed to uncover variations shedding light on the evolutionary dynamics driving this successful adaptation to human infection. Our findings indicate that 4% of ACE2 sites are subject to positive selection, predominantly within the catalytic domain, hinting at potential taxon-specific adaptations linked to ACE2 functions like cardiovascular physiology. Focusing on 30 variable sites crucial for ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-like viruses, we observed significant diversity across placental mammal species but no polymorphism within human populations at these specific sites. This suggests a scenario where natural selection favored the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a specialist coronavirus for human hosts. Disparities in infection rates and mortality may be influenced by factors including innate immune responses, unidentified genetic elements, and non-biological variables.
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCOV, is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family. Estimates of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the four coronavirus genera within this family vary widely, ranging from 10,000 to millions of years (Wertheim et al., 2013). Currently, the most widely discussed member of the Coronaviridae family is SARS-CoV-2, which has a notably recent origin. Through analysis of genome sequences from various SARS-CoV-2 strains and considering a yearly mutation rate of 1.24 x 10-3 per site, Li et al. (2020a) calculated that the virus originated on November 24, 2019.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since rapidly spread globally, resulting in a significant number of infections and fatalities between December 2019 and April 2020, with these figures continuing to rise. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, marking the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 induces a severe respiratory illness in humans and is believed to be transmitted through various routes, including fomites, airborne particles, or fecal-oral transmission, originating from animal-to-human and human-to-human interactions, akin to previous coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Genetic studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 shares approximately 70% genetic similarity with SARS-CoV and is classified as a Beta coronavirus subgenus Sarbecovirus. Investigations have suggested bats as the likely original host of SARS-CoV-2, with potential intermediate hosts including snakes, turtles, pangolins, and minks. Recent metagenomic research has pointed towards pangolins as the most probable intermediate host, indicating potential recombination events between pangolin coronaviruses, bat coronaviruses, and human SARS-CoV-2. Despite uncertainties surrounding the exact origins and intermediate hosts, genetic mutations and recombination events among coronaviruses may have facilitated cross-species transmission.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to bind and infect cells (Li et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005a; Li et al., 2005b; Chen et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a; Li et al., 2020b; Luan et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). The ACE2 gene is located on chromosome X, and its product, ACE2, a zinc metallopeptidase protein, consists of 805 amino acids with a single catalytic domain. ACE2 is predominantly expressed in vascular endothelium, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and intestines (Turner et al., 2004; McKinney et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2020). Functioning as a strict carboxypeptidase, ACE2 hydrolyzes its substrate by removing a single amino acid from their respective C-terminal. This enzyme plays a crucial role in cleaving Angiotensin I and II into peptides Angiotensin 1-9 and Angiotensin 1-7, respectively, both of which are pivotal in cardiovascular physiology, regulation of vascular tonus, blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and water intake (Millan et al., 1990; Donoghue et al., 2000; Oudit et al., 2009; McKinney et al., 2014).
ACE2, a cell-surface non-raft protein primarily located extracellularly, undergoes internalization upon binding with coronaviruses, thereby down-regulating its activity at the cell surface (Hamming et al., 2007). The interaction between SARS-CoV-like viruses and ACE2 triggers a series of molecular cascade signal events facilitating the entry of the coronavirus into the host cell, showcasing an effective evolutionary infection strategy (Simmons et al., 2013). Research by Kuba et al. (2005) has demonstrated that the down regulation of ACE2 mediated by SARS-CoV plays a significant role in the development of acute lung injury, a critical clinical implication in human respiratory diseases caused by coronaviruses.
The process of zoonotic spillover, which involves the transmission of a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to a human, is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by various cultural, ecological, and climatic factors, as well as characteristics of viruses and hosts (Olival et al., 2017). A critical aspect in this process is the efficiency in recognizing the host binding receptor, which ultimately determines the virus's preference for a specific species, tissue, or cell type. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, specifically through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), is optimized for binding to human ACE2 domains, as highlighted in studies by Andersen et al. (2020), Hoffman et al. (2020), and Walls et al. (2020). Recent research suggests that five amino acid changes in key binding sites (L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501) within the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein are associated with natural selection and are responsible for its high tropism with human ACE2 (Andersen et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020). Additionally, the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a cleavage site for furin proteases at the junction of subunits S1 and S2, a crucial step during viral infection where the S glycoprotein is cleaved by host-cell proteases into S1 (containing RBD) and S2 subunits, facilitating fusion of viral and host-cell membranes (Yan et al., 2020). The presence of furin proteases in abundance in the respiratory tract is considered essential for the successful infection of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells (Lam et al., 2020). In contrast, closely related bat and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses lack the furin cleavage site, potentially acting as a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus spillover. Notably, other human-infecting coronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, and HKU1 are also cleaved at an S1/S2 cleavage site by furin proteases (Coutard et al., 2020). While furin-mediated cleavage of the S glycoprotein does not naturally occur in SARS-CoV, the introduction of a functional furin cleavage site in the S1/S2 junction of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein has been shown to significantly enhance cell-cell fusion (Follis and Nunberg, 2004; Simmons et al., 2004).
Changes in critical amino acids crucial for the efficient interaction between the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-like viruses and ACE2 play a pivotal role in cross-species infections, multi-host transmissions, and variations in disease susceptibility and symptoms among different animal species. This evolutionary process offers insights into the underlying mechanisms of these occurrences. To enhance our comprehension of this intricate mechanism, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis encompassing 70 ACE2 orthologues from various placental mammal species, such as pangolins, civets, bats, minks, and five New World monkey species belonging to the Parvorder Platyrrhini. Additionally, we elucidate the genetic diversity of crucial binding sites within human populations. Our primary objective is to uncover taxon-specific variations in the ACE2 amino acid sequence, their potential impact on cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2, potential host species, and other pertinent subjects, particularly in light of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic.
Coding sequences for the ACE2 gene from 70 placental mammal species were obtained through BLAST searches on GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, accessed on 20/02/2020). The analysis included sixteen domestic and fifty-four wild species, encompassing representatives from the orders Carnivora (N = 9), Ungulata (N = 11), Chiroptera (N = 10), Primates (N = 22), Rodentia (N = 9), and other orders as detailed in Table S1. The sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm (Edgar, 2004) within the AliView software (Larsson, 2014).
To explore the diversity within Homo sapiens, we utilized the Ensembl database (www.ensembl.org; Hunt et al., 2018) and the UNIPROT database (www.uniprot.org, The Uniprot Consortium, 2019), both of which draw upon information from the 1000 Genome Project.
The consensus phylogeny of species, based on neutral molecular markers, was obtained from the Timetree server (www.timetree.org; Kumar et al., 2017), serving as a reference in specialized literature following Meredith et al. (2011). To delve into the evolutionary patterns influencing ACE2, we conducted a Site Model (NsSite) test using the Codeml package within PAML 4.9 software (Yang, 2007). This test facilitates inter-specific phylogenetic comparison of substitution rates in protein-coding genes, allowing for ω variation (where ω = dN/dS, with dN representing the rate of non-synonymous substitutions and dS the rate of synonymous substitutions) across sites. It accommodates neutral (ω≅1), selective constraint (ω< 1), or positive selection (ω>1) models to explain observed variation levels. To ascertain the most suitable evolutionary model for the data, Likelihood Ratio Tests were performed by comparing the neutral model (M1) against the positive selection model (M2a) with df = 2 (Yang, 2007). Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis was employed to identify sites with a high likelihood of being under positive selection (Yang et al., 2005). Additionally, we categorized amino acid variations in placental mammals' ACE2 coding sequences into four classes of chemical similarity based on Grantham scores (Grantham, 1974): conservative (GS = ≤50), moderately conservative (GS = 51–100), moderately radical (GS = 101–150), and radical (≥151).
Our findings demonstrate that the M2 model (NsSite; ω > 1) significantly outperforms the neutral model in fitting the placental mammal ACE2 data (ω2 = 2.58680, p < 0.001; Table S2). Under the M2 model, 4% of ACE2 sites exhibit positive selection, indicating a non-neutral molecular evolution for the gene in placental mammals as a whole. It is important to note, however, that this evolutionary pattern varies across different domains of the ACE2 protein. Through a parallel analysis using Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB), we identified 22 sites (24, 34, 91, 93, 212, 228, 231, 251, 255, 286, 301, 387, 559, 568, 607, 653, 657, 658, 671, 675, 689, and 732) (Table S3; Figure 1) with a high probability (> 95%) of positive selection, all located in the active sites within the extracellular portion of the protein (residues 18-740), where the ACE2 catalytic domain resides. Among the remaining ACE2 sites, 69% are under functional constraint due to negative selection (ω0 = 0.10125), while 27% exhibit selective relaxation (ω1 = 1). Notably, regions such as the signal peptide (1-17), transmembrane domain (741-761), and cytoplasmic domain (761-805; see ω3 column of Table S4) are highly conserved with minimal variation across species, lacking any positive selection signals (Tables S2 and S4). ACE2 plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure, cardiovascular health, and other functions, suggesting that the amino acid changes showing significant positive selection signals may be taxon-specific, potentially linked to adaptive phenotypes in diverse placental mammals.
Following the initial evolutionary analysis, we scrutinized all variable sites identified among the 70 orthologues. Subsequently, we specifically selected 30 variable sites based on their functional relevance and involvement in the host-ACE2 interaction with SARS-CoV-like viruses, as supported by previous studies (Towler et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005a, 2020; Luan et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020). The amino acids (AAs) observed at these 30 chosen variable sites across the ACE2 orthologues of the 70 placental mammal species are depicted in Figure 2. Notably, three of these sites (24, 34, and 559) are identified as target sites for positive selection, as indicated by the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis (refer to Table S3). The phylogenetic relationships among the major taxonomic groups under investigation are illustrated in Figure 2. For instance, Homo sapiens and other great apes (family Hominoidea) exhibit identical amino acids at the 30 positions, with only one divergence from Cercopithecidae species at the positively selected site 559 (resulting in a conservative AA change, R559K; GS = 26) (Figure 2).
It is important to clarify that our intention is not to document every variation identified in the 70 orthologues (refer to Figure 2), but rather to highlight specific findings that are pertinent to the discussion and ultimate conclusion of this study. To facilitate this, we have constructed Figure S1, a condensed representation of the data presented in Figure 2, focusing solely on the sites and species discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.
Position 24, identified as one of the three sites exhibiting a high likelihood of positive selection, displays eight distinct amino acids segregating across taxa (Figures 2 and S1). Li et al. (2005b) demonstrated that the amino acid transition from Glutamine to Lysine at position 24 (Q24K), coupled with a change from Lysine to Glutamate at position 26 (K26E), marginally hinders interactions with the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Rattus norvegicus showcases this specific combination (24K and 26E), while mouse species (Mus musculus, Mus caroli, and Mus pahari) exhibit an Asparagine (N) at position 24. Furthermore, Rattus norvegicus ACE2 also presents a combination of Asparagine (N), Phenylalanine (F), and Serine (S) at positions 82-84, which, as per Li et al. (2005b), impedes the ACE2-SARS-CoV S glycoprotein interaction in rats. Additionally, a Histidine (H) at position 353 of ACE2 in murine species may impede or diminish the efficiency of this interaction, as suggested by Wan et al. (2020). Our investigation reveals that murine ACE2 species exhibit only 56% identity with human ACE2 concerning these 30 binding sites, underscoring their inability to naturally bind to the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, the presence of Glutamine (Q) and Lysine (K) at positions 24 and 26 of ACE2 is consistent in humans, all primates, and Cavia porcellus (Guinea-pig), a rodent commonly used in experiments. Nevertheless, disparities in other crucial binding sites result in Guinea-pig ACE2 sharing just 70% identity with human ACE2 across these 30 binding sites.
The domestic cat (Felis catus) and dog (Canis lupus familiars) are of particular interest due to their close association with humans. Their ACE2 orthologues exhibit 77% and 73% identity with human ACE2, respectively, when considering the 30 variable sites. Both species share similarities with other members of the Carnivora order, such as Leucine (L) at position 24. However, they also display differences from each other at positions 25, 34, 427, and 559, with positions 34 and 559 being targets for positive selection (as shown in Table S3). Essentially, half of the distinctions between the ACE2 binding sites of cats and dogs consist of taxon-specific variants that could be linked to distinct functions of the ACE2 protein in these two domesticated species.
The five NWm and Prossimian species exhibit distinct patterns compared to other primates at positions 82-84, displaying a moderately conserved change at position 82 (M82T; GS = 81), indicating a shift in polarity. The prevalence of Threonine at this position across numerous species suggests Threonine as the likely ancestral allele, with a non-synonymous mutation leading to the Threonine (T) > Methionine (M) alteration in the ancestral branches of the Catarrhini clade. Conversely, the Platyrrhini ancestor retained the ancestral allele T. Position 41 also reveals a shared amino acid among NWm and Prossimian species, with the Y41H (GS = 83) modification indicating a charge alteration, given Histidine's acidic nature. Another mutation at this site (Y41A; GS = 112) signifies a radical change in polarity, potentially affecting viral interactions, particularly with SARS-CoV as suggested by Li et al. (2005b). The distribution of amino acids at position 41 of ACE2 suggests a shared derived allele (H) between NWm and Prossimian clades, reminiscent of bat genera Hipposideros and Myotis, as well as Equus, hinting at molecular convergence.
NWm ACE2 in non-human primates exhibits distinct features compared to other primate species, primarily characterized by alterations in glycosylation sites at positions 432 and 546, where Arginine (N) is substituted with Serine (S) (Luan et al., 2020). The presence of electron density at all Arginine-linked sites in the ACE2 N-terminal domain, including 432 and 546, suggests glycosylation, with the absence of these sites potentially carrying functional implications (Towler et al., 2004). Research involving MERS-CoV and its host-cell entry receptor, DPP4, has shown that mutations disrupting glycosylation sites in mouse DPP4 impede binding with MERS-CoV RBD (Peck et al., 2017). The authors of these studies concluded that glycosylation at DPP4 orthologue sites serves as a significant barrier to MERS-CoV infection, especially when coupled with taxon-specific modifications (Peck et al., 2017).
At the positively selected site 559, we noted the presence of a Serine (S) which has been shown to diminish or impede the interaction between the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and ACE2 (Li et al., 2005b). This Serine residue is not exclusive to rodents but is also found in certain carnivorous species that have been previously considered as potential original or intermediate hosts, such as the pangolin (Manis javanica). The ACE2 receptor in pangolins shares approximately 85% similarity with the human ACE2 receptor (Lam et al., 2020), although this similarity decreases to 66% when focusing solely on the 30 sites examined in this study. Furthermore, the presence of a Serine at position 559 is also evident in two species belonging to the Mustelidae family, namely the ferret (Mustela putorius) and the sea otter (Enhydra lutris).
Finally, we utilized the intra-specific variation of the ACE2 gene by analyzing data from human populations sourced from the 1000 Genomes Project, accessed through Ensembl and UNIPROT platforms. This dataset unveiled 660 missense variants (all with a minor allele frequency of 0.005 or less), 260 synonymous variants, 14,352 intron variants, 67 5’UTR variants, and 268 3’UTR variants within the ACE2 gene in humans. Many of these variants have been scrutinized in case-control or genome-wide association studies for cardiovascular diseases and other related conditions (as exemplified by Ji et al., 2017). Among the 30 ACE2 binding sites selected for this study (depicted in Figure 2), only one site, positioned at 26, exhibits two segregating alleles (K and R; Minor Allele Frequency or MAF = 0.002; rs4646116). While population data for the other species under investigation is lacking, we noted a lack of significant polymorphism across the 30 sites crucial for the interaction between host-ACE2 and SARS-CoV-like viruses in the extensively studied Homo sapiens. This discovery underscores the notion that the amino acids (AAs) illustrated in Figure 2 are taxon-specific, characteristic of a particular species or taxonomic group, where intra-specific variation is minimal or nonexistent. Furthermore, the conservation of AAs within Homo sapiens at these 30 sites suggests an intriguing evolutionary constraint that warrants further investigation. Examination of the Neanderthal genome (Homo neanderthalensis) and the Denisova specimen reveals that both share the same AAs as Homo sapiens at these 30 sites.
Species within the Coronaviridae family have the ability to infect a diverse range of animals and humans, leading to severe respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases (Weiss and Leibowitz, 2011). In humans, coronaviruses have historically been associated with respiratory tract infections and were initially perceived as having limited clinical and epidemiological significance until the emergence of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks (Kuiken et al., 2003; Zaki et al., 2012). Presently, SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, has triggered a global pandemic that has posed significant challenges to governments and populations worldwide. The death toll from COVID-19 has surpassed the combined fatalities caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, underscoring the critical public health implications of this disease (WHO; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).
SARS-CoV-like viruses utilize ACE2 as their entry point into host cells. Illustrated in Figure 2 is the diversity of 70 ACE2 orthologues, encompassing 30 potential binding sites to the S glycoproteins of these viruses. This diversity presents a broad spectrum of opportunities for this particular coronavirus, known for its rapid evolution driven by high mutation and recombination rates (Li et al., 2020a). These evolutionary mechanisms, common in RNA viruses, contribute to their ability to switch hosts frequently and traverse between distantly related species more readily than other pathogens (Woolhouse et al., 2005a, 2005b; Davies and Pedersen, 2008; Longdon et al., 2014). Such characteristics could elucidate the probable origins of SARS-CoV-2 from hosts that are phylogenetically distant, potentially involving bats and pangolins (Guo et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020c; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).
Specific pathogen mutations are often necessary to enhance a pathogen's fitness in a new host, as highlighted by Longdon et al. (2014). This phenomenon is exemplified in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, where recent investigations indicate that the cross-species transmission leading to its presence in humans was primarily driven by five amino acid alterations in crucial S glycoprotein binding sites (Wan et al., 2020; Andersen et al., 2020). Furthermore, the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 features a furin protease cleavage site at the S1 and S2 subunit junction, akin to other human coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, and HKU1), but distinct from bat and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses and SARS-CoV (Coutard et al., 2020). These modifications are linked to the virus's strong affinity and effective tropism for human ACE2 (Andersen et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020).
In contrast to the notable distinctions observed among the 70 orthologues in mammals, no significant polymorphisms were detected within the 30 ACE2 binding sites when considering human populations. This implies that Homo sapiens can be viewed as a relatively "homogeneous" primate species, particularly with respect to these crucial ACE2 binding sites. Furthermore, Homo sapiens boasts a substantial population size (approximately 7.5 billion individuals) spread across nearly all habitable regions on Earth, including areas with notably high population densities. These findings suggest that the heightened and effective tropism exhibited by the virus extends uniformly across all human populations, with demographic and cultural factors specific to certain human groups potentially facilitating the contagion and spread of this opportunistic coronavirus.
Hosts and pathogens engage in a perpetual evolutionary arms race, as evidenced by various studies highlighting the adaptation of coronaviruses to recognize diverse host-receptors and the corresponding defensive strategies employed by hosts. For instance, Peng et al. (2017) demonstrated that infection with a hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) spurred the evolution of a mouse receptor (mCEACAM1a). This evolutionary response was triggered by the intense selective pressure exerted by the lethal infection, where MHV utilizes mCEACAM1a as its host-receptor. Subsequent changes in crucial amino acid residues resulted in the emergence of a derived-allele (mCEACAM1b) that significantly impairs MHV receptor function (Peng et al., 2017). Consequently, mice homozygous for this derived-allele exhibit heightened resistance to MHV-induced mortality (Peng et al., 2017).
The initial scientific documentation of ACE2 serving as a gateway for coronavirus entry into host cells was with SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003). Whether this phenomenon had occurred previously, involving ACE2 as an entry point for coronaviruses in humans or other species, remains unknown. Given the historical context of SARS-CoV, the timeframe for any potential evolutionary response from hosts with longer life cycles, particularly in relation to human ACE2, seems limited. Consequently, the expectations regarding human ACE2, concerning both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, differ from the findings reported by Peng et al. (2017) concerning the mouse receptor and MHV. The recent evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, acquiring a furin protease cleavage site, combined with the uniformity of critical ACE2 binding sites across human populations and other demographic and cultural factors previously discussed, has provided SARS-CoV-2 with a significant advantage in the evolutionary competition, resulting in its heightened infectivity and pathogenicity in humans.
Following cell entry, pathogens can be impeded by neutralizing host antibodies, a phenomenon observed in SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans (Conti et al., 2020). The World Health Organization notes that despite sharing the same amino acids in the ACE2 binding sites, most individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. Previous research has elucidated the mechanisms by which antibodies neutralize coronavirus infections (Hofmann et al., 2004; Reguera et al., 2012; Li et al., 2020a), highlighting the crucial role of an agile and efficient host immune system, particularly in young individuals or those without an immunological over-response, in combating opportunistic coronaviruses. Variability in other genetic systems within the population may also contribute to the heterogeneity of COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes. It is important to consider that the ACE2 gene contains numerous polymorphisms beyond the key binding sites, as discussed in the results section. Therefore, it is plausible that some of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could influence susceptibility to infection and account for the variations in symptoms and outcomes observed among different human populations.
The variations in the 30 crucial ACE2 binding sites across species and taxonomic groups are notably distinct, potentially influencing SARS-CoV-2's ability to interact with ACE2 in certain species. Recent predictions regarding SARS-CoV-2's infectivity in 42 mammalian species were made based on variances at positions 31, 35, 38, 82, and 353 in ACE2 orthologues compared to human ACE2 (Luan et al., 2020). These findings suggested that approximately 76% of the examined mammal species, including pets such as dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and cats (Felis catus), as well as horses (Equus caballus), cattle (Bos taurus), and sheep (Ovis aries), could potentially bind to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The concept of a "generalist" coronavirus, with the ability to infect various mammalian species like pigs, ferrets, cats, orangutans, and monkeys, has also been proposed by other researchers, despite disparities in their respective ACE2 orthologues (Wan et al., 2020).
In this study, we have extended the comparative analysis to encompass a broader range of species and interaction sites between ACE2 orthologues and SARS-CoV-like viruses. Our findings reveal that ACE2 murine species exhibit only 56% identity with human ACE2 and display several critical taxon-specific alterations that elucidate the resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, for the other species and taxon under investigation, the ability to either impede or facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection through this receptor remains challenging to predict. Initial results suggest that a macaque (Macaca mulatta) infected with SARS-CoV-2 mirrors the moderate respiratory illness observed in the majority of human cases (Munster et al., 2020). Notably, Macaca mulatta, akin to other members of the Cercopithecidae family, exhibits only one alteration (R559K) compared to humans and other Hominidae species (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla; Figure 2). Furthermore, we identified a series of amino acid changes in the ACE2 of New World monkey species, potentially conferring distinct binding patterns to SARS-CoV-2 and rendering them less susceptible to infection compared to humans and great apes. While a previous in vivo study (Greenough et al., 2005) illustrated the outcome of SARS-CoV infection in Callithrix sp., the replication pattern of the virus and the natural infection risk for this and other New World monkey species remain unexplored. Consequently, although Callithrix sp. serves as a suitable model for MERS-CoV infection (McAuliffe et al., 2004; Van Doremalen and Munster, 2015), it has not been validated as an animal model for SARS-CoV infection. It is worth noting that MERS-CoV utilizes a different host-cell entry receptor, DPP4, instead of ACE2.
When more in vitro and in vivo functional studies are conducted, the minimum amino acid combination necessary in the ACE2 binding sites and other critical regions of the receptor for an active connection with the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein will be determined. Currently, these predictions remain speculative but can provide valuable insights for future research and strategies aimed at containing the infection and its detrimental effects. It is proposed that the limited number of ACE2 orthologues with tropism for SARS-CoV-2 is due to the virus's evolutionary adaptation to efficiently utilize Homo sapiens ACE2 as a gateway to host cells. To date, only one preliminary in vivo study has been conducted to assess the susceptibility of animals to SARS-CoV-2 (Shi et al., 2020). In this study, ferrets, cats, dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, with subsequent euthanasia a few days post-inoculation. The findings indicated high susceptibility in ferrets and cats, low susceptibility in dogs, and no susceptibility in livestock such as pigs, chickens, and ducks. Notably, there have been no documented cases of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals residing in anthropogenic environments, apart from sporadic reports of infected cats, tigers, and lions at the Bronx Zoo in New York City. This observation challenges earlier predictions suggesting a broad range of susceptible species (Luan et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020). The absence of a veterinary epidemiological crisis during the current human COVID-19 pandemic, particularly concerning pets, also questions the high susceptibility of cats to SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by Shi et al. (2020). If susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection does exist in these and other animals, it appears to be significantly more limited compared to humans.
Viruses exploiting receptors with conserved amino acid sequences are known to possess a wide host range (Woolhouse et al., 2012). It is pertinent to note that ACE2 retains a conserved amino acid sequence in essential binding sites within Homo sapiens, although this conservation is not observed across the placental mammal species examined in this study. Essentially, the rapid mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 may offer avenues to infect various species, but when a strong tropism with the host cell is established, it can be inferred that the binding region exhibits minimal (if any) variation within the target species.
Our findings also indicate that a significant portion of the taxon-specific ACE2 diversity can be attributed to positive natural selection, given its role as a membrane protein involved in water intake, blood pressure regulation, and other cardiovascular functions. Additionally, a common consequence of adapting to new hosts is a decrease in performance on the original host (Longdon et al., 2014). Essentially, SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus highly adept at infecting Homo sapiens individuals across populations, demonstrates limited efficiency in infecting other species or in jumping back to the original or intermediate phylogenetically distant hosts (such as bats and/or pangolins). Through new mutations or recombination events, SARS-CoV-2 could potentially evolve into a derived coronavirus capable of overcoming species barriers once more, perpetuating the ongoing evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen.
Closely related species may exhibit similar levels of susceptibility to pathogens, irrespective of their proximity to the pathogen's natural host (Longdon et al., 2014). In this context, the homology observed in ACE2 orthologues of great apes with human ACE2, specifically concerning the 30 binding sites under investigation, suggests that perhaps only these species are naturally predisposed to developing symptoms of COVID-19. This concern has already been highlighted by experts within the "Great Ape Health Consortium" (Gillespie and Leendertz, 2020).
Our comparative analysis of the ACE2 coding region across 70 placental mammal species revealed numerous variable sites, from which we identified 30 sites with documented relevance for interacting with SARS-CoV-like S glycoproteins. Among these, three sites exhibited a significant signal of positive selection driven by Darwinian forces. Notably, we observed remarkable conservation within Homo sapiens contrasted with relatively high variation among placental mammal species. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 possesses a similar potential to infect any human population, a notion supported by the pandemic nature of COVID-19. Discrepancies in infection rates and mortality associated with this pathogen are likely influenced by various factors such as comorbidities in infected individuals, cultural practices, population density, healthcare system capabilities, implementation of control measures, as well as differences in SARS-CoV-2 strains and the efficacy of innate immune responses. While the involvement of other genetic pathways beyond ACE2 and the immune system cannot be discounted, further research is necessary to elucidate their potential roles in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates a high degree of specialization for infecting humans across various populations, making it a "human-population generalist coronavirus," particularly evident in its utilization of ACE2 as a gateway to the cell. However, in contrast to being a generalist virus capable of infecting a wide range of species, including pets, SARS-CoV-2 does not exhibit this broad infectivity.
