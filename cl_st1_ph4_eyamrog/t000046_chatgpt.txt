The study aimed to examine the conceptualization of health and its connection to physical education as perceived by teachers and administrators at a public school in the state of São Paulo. This descriptive research employed a qualitative methodology, with eleven teachers and two coordinators participating as volunteers. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews, and analysis was conducted using non-aprioristic categories. The findings revealed that health was predominantly viewed through the lens of well-being, with the practice of physical activities serving as a bridge between physical education and health within the school environment. Consequently, physical education emerges as a promising avenue for embracing critical pedagogies in addressing health concerns, particularly in promoting an active lifestyle.
Bracht (2013) and Rufino and Darido (2013) suggest that Physical Education (PE) has historically been associated with promoting health. Prior to the 1980s, PE focused on physical fitness and movement, employing gymnastic techniques and sports activities to impact students' health from an instrumental standpoint (PAIVA et al., 2017). In our research, we viewed this approach as representative of a traditional PE model.
This perspective has positioned Physical Education (PE) as a tool for promoting health and preventing diseases, emphasizing the concept of an "active body" that has been widely promoted. PE aligns with the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of health, which encompasses physical, mental, and social well-being. Consequently, the focus in PE tends to prioritize the biophysical aspects of individuals, reflecting a somewhat limited understanding of health.
Bracht (2013) posits that Physical Education (PE) is perceived as an extension of the medical establishment, functioning through physical exercises. Rigo, Pardo, and Silveira (2007) argue that this viewpoint led to a societal and educational division between healthy and ill individuals, as well as between more and less skilled individuals, ultimately fostering the exclusion of students. This understanding of PE underwent modifications and adaptations with the advancement of knowledge in human and social sciences, particularly in the realm of health, as its narrow conception was found to be lacking in comprehensiveness, considering the various influencing factors (PAIVA et al., 2017).
The incorporation of an extended notion of health, as seen in the Brazilian context following the VIII National Health Conference (BRASIL, 1986), introduced fresh insights. This revised concept viewed health as an outcome of individuals' living circumstances, encompassing factors such as nutrition, shelter, income, surroundings, employment, transportation, recreation, autonomy, land ownership, and healthcare access as determinants. According to Palma, Estevão, and Bagrichevsky (2003), health is perceived as an individual's interaction with society.
The concept was integrated into the National Curriculum Parameters (PCN) (BRASIL, 1998; 2000) and more recently, into the National Common Curriculum Base (BNCC) (BRASIL, 2017). A key focus in these and similar documents is the idea that health should be the central concern of all school stakeholders. Nevertheless, upon examining normative suggestions through the lens of public health (WESTPHAL, 2013), it becomes evident that they predominantly follow a behavioral approach, closely tied to the natural sciences, emphasizing the promotion of healthy lifestyles.
In the realm of Physical Education (PE), Devide (2002, p.78) emphasizes its crucial role by asserting that for interventions to yield success, teachers must provide elements that unequivocally enhance the well-being of their recipients. Gouvêa and Silva (2019) further argue that PE should transcend mere promotion of physical activities; it must also engage critically and reflectively with matters concerning access to recreational facilities and fundamental healthcare, fostering dialogue on the advantages of cultivating such habits.
Oliveira, Martins, and Bracht (2015a) highlight the significance of framing physical activity discourse as a pathway to an active and healthy lifestyle. This not only reinforces the idea that structured bodily movement serves a specific purpose but also bolsters the market's promotion of health, whether overtly or subtly. Similarly, contemporary society's emphasis on cultivating consumer relationships underscores a shift towards prioritizing market-driven interactions. Westphal (2013) further underscores the prevalence of societal induction, where media influences steer individuals towards making choices aligned with market principles, potentially leading to the imposition of healthy living standards.
Oliveira, Martins, and Bracht (2015a) highlight challenges in implementing an expanded conception of health within a school setting, notably the resistance of teaching staff towards adopting new practices. The authors argue that embracing a pedagogical approach to health promotion necessitates the active involvement and commitment of all school stakeholders, particularly teachers and the broader school community.
In examining health initiatives, Oliveira, Martins, and Bracht (2015a) as well as Lopes, Nogueira, and Rocha (2018) identified the necessity for targeted training programs and specialized education for school personnel to effectively address this subject. Bagnara and Fensterseifer (2019) highlight that Physical Education (PE) instructors often engage in teaching without a comprehensive understanding of the curricular objectives, underscoring the importance of further research in this area to promote a broader understanding and awareness of health-related issues.
Our study sought to examine the comprehension of health and its correlation with Physical Education (PE) as perceived by teachers and administrators at a public school within the State Education System of São Paulo (REESP).
This manuscript presents findings from a Master's Thesis defended in 2020, focusing on the exploration of health perspectives within Physical Education (PE) classes. In light of space constraints inherent to this article, we have condensed the content to a more concise scope.
This study is classified as descriptive research, as defined by Thomas, Nelson, and Silverman (2012, p.293) as a study of status. It follows the qualitative approach outlined by Minayo (1994), focusing on specific questions and addressing a level of reality that is not easily quantifiable.
This study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of Unifesp (CAAE n. 97895018.0.0000.5505), and all participants provided written informed consent.
The study involved 13 volunteers who met specific inclusion criteria, including being full-time professionals at the REESP for a minimum of one year and having worked at the surveyed school unit for at least one year. No participants were excluded due to insufficient data for analysis. To ensure a diverse range of perspectives on the research topic, efforts were made to include at least one teacher from each area of knowledge, along with the physical education teacher and school manager.
The selection of volunteers was facilitated by the pedagogical coordinator during the collective pedagogical planning. Professionals were individually approached to ensure minimal disruption to school activities. The selected school unit is situated in the municipality of Santos/SP, offering education for middle school students (6th to 9th year). As per the latest Basic Education Census, elementary and middle schools in Brazil account for 62.6% of registered teachers, with the public system being the most extensive, encompassing around 77% of Brazilian schools (BRASIL, 2020).
For data collection, semi-structured interviews were conducted, a method endorsed by Triviños (2008) as a primary approach for gathering data, emphasizing the researcher's presence and granting participants the freedom to articulate their thoughts, thereby enhancing the research with detailed insights. The interview protocol centered on exploring the concept of health and its correlation with Physical Education. Data collection took place between March and May 2019, involving 10 visits to the school unit. The interviews were held in secluded areas within the school premises, such as management rooms, pedagogical coordination offices, or the teachers' lounge, with only the researcher and the teacher present. Following the teachers' approval, the interviews were recorded and subsequently transcribed into electronic files for analysis.
The data analysis in this study was conducted through content analysis of the interviewees' statements, following the phases outlined by Campos (2004, p.614). These phases include pre-exploration, where the researchers apprehended crucial aspects of the material through thorough reading; selection of units of analysis involved clipping sentences or transcribing paragraphs relevant to the study's objectives, and; categorization, which entailed creating broad statements covering various themes that align with the study's goals. The researchers employed a non-aprioristic categorization approach, which was developed through direct engagement with the analyzed material.
Chart 1 illustrates the profile of the interviewed teachers, indicating that, with the exception of Pedro, all other participants can be classified as experienced in both the REESP and within the school unit.
Maldonado and Silva (2018) conducted an analysis of the REESP curricula concerning Physical Education (PE) and identified various perspectives over time. In 1978, the focus was on fitness and motor skill development; by 1991, a psychomotor approach emerged with connections to critical discussions influenced by human sciences. In 1996, the psychomotor approach persisted but now incorporated elements from the developmental line. Moving forward to 2008, the emphasis shifted towards critical approaches in PE, particularly the critic-overcoming and critic-emancipatory approaches. Chart 1 illustrates that 12 out of 13 teachers had experienced at least two phases of the PE curriculum at REESP. This indicates that the data regarding the understanding of health and its relationship with PE are embedded in a transition of approaches, moving from instrumental to critical perspectives.
Umemura and Rosa (2020, p.81) highlight the prevailing notion that teachers are often viewed as mere executors and managers as overseers of policies dictated by central public administration bodies. This perspective echoes findings by Fernandes (2012), who, through a bibliographic survey, identified the role of coordinating teachers in disseminating government initiatives, crafting projects, and ensuring performance levels in external assessments.
In light of the information presented and in alignment with the notion of school as a sociocultural environment (Dayrell, 1996), characterized by diverse educational and life perspectives, as well as a space for social interactions, as described by Gusmão (2003) as a realm of encounters, discrepancies, quests, revelations, and concealments, we posit that our research outcomes reflect the proliferation of varied viewpoints on Physical Education (PE) within the educational setting.
When we inquired with the volunteers regarding their comprehension of health, we received unanimous responses emphasizing the significance of the topic. Nevertheless, not all participants provided direct answers to the question; some opted to illustrate their points with everyday examples in order to align with the prescribed agenda.
"Health is paramount, representing overall well-being in daily life, encompassing physical, mental, and emotional aspects. As articulated by Clara, a manager, it is a fundamental aspect that influences every facet of our existence. This underscores the significance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and prioritizing one's health in all aspects of life."
"Health encompasses being well-nourished. Specifically focusing on the physical aspect, it involves maintaining a state of equilibrium and harmony within the body. Therefore, health is synonymous with understanding boundaries, adhering to guidelines, and recognizing limitations, as articulated by Sofia, a manager."
"Health comprises a multitude of elements. Particularly for young individuals, it is essential to divert their attention from excessive cell phone and headset usage and encourage engagement in physical activities such as sports. Through exercise, they can combat illnesses, including those affecting mental well-being, thereby enhancing their overall perception of health. This holistic view of health emphasizes the importance of a sound mind and a healthy body, as aptly expressed by Nara, a Portuguese language teacher."
Health has always been a stringent priority in my household, particularly due to the medical background of my husband and children. From a young age, we have instilled strict health practices, such as storing pacifiers in the fridge. Vaccination, as emphasized by my husband, is a crucial aspect of our health regimen. At 60 years old, I maintain good health without any issues, which I strive to impart to my students through emphasis on diet and physical exercise. Drawing from my background in classical ballet, having practiced for a decade and even owning a dance academy, I advocate for the importance of physical activity, particularly through the art of dance. I firmly believe that this subject should never be overlooked in educational curricula.
"Health encompasses a multitude of factors, including prevention, nutrition, physical activity, and the cultivation of good habits, as articulated by Carlos, a physical education teacher. In his perspective, health is a comprehensive concept that encapsulates various elements essential for overall well-being."
According to Fabiana, a physical education teacher, feeling good, engaging in activities you enjoy, and showing respect towards others collectively constitute health. This holistic view of health emphasizes not only physical well-being but also mental and social aspects. By maintaining a healthy lifestyle and prioritizing overall well-being, individuals can achieve a state of perfect health.
"I believe that in this universe, health encompasses the well-being of both the mind and body," stated Marta, an English language teacher.
According to Marcos, a math teacher, overall well-being encompasses not only physical health but also emotional wellness. He emphasizes the importance of being in good physical condition to achieve a state of calmness and freedom from illness.
"Health encompasses overall well-being and involves the active maintenance and care of one's body. It is a fundamental aspect of personal welfare. Roberto, a mathematics teacher, emphasizes that health is synonymous with self-care and the preservation of one's physical and mental state. By prioritizing good health, individuals are essentially looking after themselves and ensuring their own well-being."
"Health is intricately linked to happiness and overall well-being, contingent upon feeling good within one's body. Ideal circumstances are rarely achieved, particularly among teenagers whose bodies are still developing; some may struggle with being overweight while others may be excessively thin. I recall a specific boy, whose name escapes me, discussing his interest in anabolic steroids to test their efficacy. In today's world, where adolescents have unfettered access to various media platforms, there is a pervasive pursuit of perfection. Ultimately, health is the equilibrium unique to each individual," remarked Larissa, a teacher in the field of Sciences.
"It is essential to create a solution that performs effectively," as stated by Juliana, a Geography teacher.
"Health, as articulated by Bruna, a geography teacher, is defined by the absence of conditions such as high blood pressure and obesity, and the freedom from reliance on medications. Bruna's perspective highlights the burden of managing multiple health issues through medication, including hypertension, depression, and cardiac arrhythmia. In her view, true health transcends the need for such pharmaceutical interventions, suggesting a state of well-being that is not contingent on medical treatment."
"We must possess both mental and physical attributes," stated Pedro, a history teacher.
This series of responses enabled us to delineate five distinct categories for analysis:
The well-being of individuals, including Clara, Fabiana, Marta, Marcos, Roberto, Larissa, and Juliana, is a crucial aspect that requires attention and consideration.
The absence of diseases was investigated by Nara, Daniela, Marcos, and Bruno.
The concept of balance, as explored by Sofia, Larissa, and Pedro, is a crucial aspect in various contexts. Their research delves into the intricate interplay between different elements to achieve equilibrium and stability. By examining the relationships between these elements, they aim to uncover the mechanisms that contribute to a state of balance. Through their investigation, they shed light on the significance of maintaining equilibrium in systems, whether it be in ecological environments, social structures, or economic systems. Sofia, Larissa, and Pedro's work highlights the importance of understanding and preserving balance to ensure the sustainability and functionality of various systems.
Sofia and Roberto emphasized the importance of self-care.
Carlos emphasizes the importance of cultivating good habits in order to achieve success. He argues that consistent and disciplined behavior is key to reaching one's goals and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By establishing routines and sticking to them, individuals can improve their productivity, focus, and overall well-being. Carlos suggests that small, daily actions can have a significant impact over time, leading to long-term benefits. He encourages readers to identify areas where they can make positive changes and commit to implementing new habits gradually. Ultimately, Carlos believes that developing good habits is essential for personal growth and fulfillment.
The category of "well-being," which boasts the highest number of volunteers, pertains to health as viewed through the lens of A, who associates health with intellectual, creative, and social capabilities. Consequently, teachers' contributions appear to surpass the narrow understanding of health, expanding it beyond mere biological well-being to encompass the individual's interaction with the social milieu, thereby shaping their overall health status.
This comprehension is echoed in the BNCC, which emphasizes that students should independently utilize physical activities to increase engagement in recreational settings, broaden social networks, and promote health (BRASIL, 2017, p.223). Nevertheless, it is imperative to shift this understanding from a behavioral standpoint (focusing on lifestyle modifications) to a socio-environmental outlook, as proposed by Westphal (2013). Westphal argues that this shift involves embracing collective approaches to empower populations, foster healthy environments, and cultivate competencies, knowledge, and attitudes.
In the category of "Absence of diseases," health is predominantly viewed through a strictly biological lens. According to Rigo, Pardo, and Silveira (2007), this perspective creates a clear division within society between those deemed healthy and those considered sick. This conceptualization has not only shaped a significant body of knowledge but has also influenced the development of intervention strategies in school physical education for an extended period, a trend that continues to persist as highlighted by Oliveira, Gomes, and Bracht (2014).
In the category of "Balance," health is perceived as a physical manifestation, aligning with a Cartesian perspective of the individual and emphasizing bodily actions, thus supporting a limited understanding. Silva, Silva, and Lüdorf (2015) found that the body, as a focal point in physical education classes, has not been consistently addressed, with discussions occasionally touching on health practices and habits.
According to Silva, Silva, and Lüdorf (2015), body valorization is increasingly prevalent in contemporary society, primarily driven by concerns related to health and aesthetics, often influenced by media exposure. Teacher Larissa's discourse highlights the potential risks associated with this trinity of factors. Building on this perspective, Silva et al. (2017) suggest that media impact can significantly shape individuals' behaviors and social interactions, with potential positive or negative consequences, particularly among young people. Consequently, there is a possibility to promote a broader understanding of health that can influence individual behaviors, potentially leading to health-related issues among certain individuals.
In the realm of "Self-care," a notable emphasis is placed on the individual's ability to set boundaries and navigate towards better health. This notion aligns with Bracht's (2019) assertion that care can manifest in two distinct ways: the first being a response to external pressures or oppression, compelling the individual to engage in self-care; the second involves a conscious and deliberate choice to prioritize self-care as a means of fostering personal freedom and a holistic way of life, where the body becomes a supportive partner in this journey towards well-being.
In the category of "Good habits," teacher Carlos highlights the risk behaviors prevalent among students and proposes an alternative approach through engaging in physical activities. This assertion is further exemplified in teacher Daniela's personal narrative, where she discusses her own habits and their adoption by her entire family. This correlation can be linked to Devide's work (1996; 2002) on the dissemination of habits, although it is essential to acknowledge the potential influence of other variables, including socioeconomic factors, in shaping these behaviors.
Teachers and coordinators exhibited a range of understandings regarding health, spanning from a comprehensive to a narrow viewpoint, indicating the diverse interpretations of the concept. The broader perspective encompasses social determinants and extends beyond mere disease manifestation. Conversely, the narrower viewpoint confines health to the physical realm or simply being free from illness or medication dependency, aligning closely with the World Health Organization's definition of holistic well-being encompassing physical, psychological, and social dimensions.
When examining the relationship between physical education (PE) and health, we elicited the following responses:
Clara, the manager, expressed her difficulty in answering the question due to being unprepared, highlighting the complexity of the topic. She emphasized that Physical Education (PE) should not be limited to an undergraduate course but should also be considered as part of the health sector. Clara mentioned an interesting statement made by a philosophy teacher regarding the idea of reintroducing the practice of administering vaccines to students within schools, rather than relying solely on parents to do so. She questioned why health departments do not take a more active role in providing such services within schools, drawing a parallel to the dental department's initiatives in promoting oral health. Clara suggested that integrating health services into schools could be a feasible approach to improving overall health outcomes among students.
In promoting health, physical education (PE) plays a crucial role. PE encompasses activities that involve both mental and physical well-being, fostering a connection between the two. Through engaging in playful games like "queimada," soccer, or traditional games such as "cotia," children are not only exercising and developing their physical abilities but also nurturing their mental health. This holistic approach to health and well-being is emphasized by Sofia, a manager, who recognizes the importance of integrating physical and mental aspects through playful activities in her classes.
"I believe it is crucial as it serves as a means to engage young individuals with sports, a significant aspect that they appreciate," stated Nara, a Portuguese language teacher.
"It is essential to consider not only how students should dress for physical education classes to ensure their comfort, safety, and injury prevention but also to educate them on maintaining hygiene, cleanliness, and organization. This education extends beyond their bodies to include their environment, encouraging responsible waste disposal, proper paper disposal, and appropriate behavior. These aspects collectively contribute to overall health. It is not limited to physical well-being or the study of the human body but encompasses the holistic education of the student within their environment, as emphasized by Daniela, an art teacher."
"In my case, I focus on movement, which I consider essential," stated Carlos, a physical education teacher.
According to Fabiana, a physical education teacher, it is crucial for students to grasp the essence of movement through the lens provided by teachers. This understanding is pivotal in comprehending the significance of physical education in promoting health. Physical education serves as a platform to educate students about body movement and the advantages it offers for their overall well-being. By engaging in physical education, students are guided to comprehend the intricacies of the human body and its functions, thereby enhancing their awareness of bodily mechanisms and the importance of physical activity in their lives.
"I believe that Physical Education (PE) will help students become more cognizant of their own potential and their physical capabilities, fostering an understanding of what their bodies can or cannot achieve. Additionally, it has the potential to promote physical activity not only during PE classes but also within the broader school community," expressed Marta, an English language teacher.
"It is imperative to motivate students to engage in physical activity and avoid leading a sedentary lifestyle. In contemporary society, this holds significant importance as a sedentary way of living often paves the way for various health complications and diseases, as highlighted by Marcos, a mathematics teacher."
Roberto, a mathematics teacher, posited a strong correlation between physical education (PE) and overall health, emphasizing the intrinsic link between movement and well-being. He argued that PE, by engaging individuals in physical activities, facilitates the necessary movements essential for maintaining good health. Roberto contended that the human body thrives on motion rather than stagnation, and PE plays a pivotal role in guiding individuals towards this fundamental objective.
In my second year of teaching, I focus on cytology and the chemical composition of living organisms, emphasizing the importance of health in my curriculum. I am aware that the Physical Education (PE) teacher also touches upon these topics to some extent. I believe that PE plays a crucial role in mental health as it provides a platform for fostering social interactions and coexistence. Our student body is diverse, with individuals coming from varied backgrounds and circumstances. While some students receive ample support and supervision at home, others lack the necessary attention and guidance. I find PE particularly intriguing due to its potential to address these dual aspects, bridging the gap between nutrition, physical development, social interaction, and overall well-being within the student community. (Larissa - Science teacher)
"It is crucial for Physical Education (PE) to play a significant role in addressing health concerns, yet it appears to be falling short in fulfilling this purpose, as per my perspective," stated Juliana, a Geography teacher. She highlighted the issue of students being passive observers while others engage in physical activities like soccer, indicating a failure of PE to effectively combat health problems. Bruna, another Geography teacher, emphasized the importance of physical activity for health, noting the historical shift towards sedentary lifestyles. She pointed out the ease with which modern society accesses food compared to earlier times when physical exertion was necessary for sustenance, leading to a rise in obesity rates. Bruna underscored the necessity of exercise for maintaining good health in contemporary times.
"Physical education is essential as it not only engages the mind but also nurtures the body, ultimately contributing to the overall well-being of an individual. As aptly stated by Pedro, a history teacher, a person with a healthy body and a healthy mind embodies the essence of a healthy citizen. Through physical education, individuals are able to develop both physically and mentally, leading to a holistic approach to health and wellness."
Based on the statements provided, we have identified five distinct categories.
Body practices were observed in a group consisting of Sofia, Nara, Daniela, Carlos, Fabiana, Marta, Marcos, Roberto, Juliana, Bruna, and Pedro.
The body of this research comprises the collaborative efforts of Daniela, Fabiana, Marta, and Larissa.
In the realm of environmental studies, Daniela's research focuses on the intricate relationship between human activities and the natural world. Through her work, she delves into the impact of various factors such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change on ecosystems and biodiversity. By examining these complex interactions, Daniela aims to contribute valuable insights that can inform sustainable practices and policies for the preservation of our planet's delicate balance. Her research underscores the urgency of addressing environmental issues and highlights the importance of collective action in safeguarding the environment for future generations.
Mental health, as explored by Larissa, is a complex and multifaceted aspect of overall well-being. Larissa delves into the intricate interplay between psychological, emotional, and social factors that contribute to an individual's mental health status. Through her research, she sheds light on the importance of addressing mental health issues with sensitivity and understanding, emphasizing the need for comprehensive support systems and interventions. Larissa's work underscores the significance of promoting mental health awareness and destigmatizing mental health disorders in society.
Health is a multifaceted concept that encompasses physical, mental, and social well-being. Clara, a key figure in the field of public health, has extensively researched the various determinants of health and their impact on individuals and communities. Through her work, Clara has highlighted the importance of preventive measures, access to healthcare services, and the social determinants of health in promoting overall well-being. Her contributions have significantly influenced public health policies and interventions aimed at improving population health outcomes. Clara's research underscores the interconnected nature of health and the need for a holistic approach to address the complex factors that influence individual and community health.
In the category of "Body practices," the impact of traditional physical education is evident. This category implies that health is attained through a pedagogical approach centered on physical exercise, whether through structured routines or through recreational sports activities (including games), as previously noted by Devide (1996). This discourse, supported by the development of biological factors and motor skills acquisition, often links physical fitness to the attainment of a health standard, sometimes implicitly. This viewpoint has historically influenced and continues to influence many physical education teachers' pedagogical methods (BRACHT, 2013; OLIVEIRA; MARTINS; BRACHT, 2015a).
we argue that health should not be limited to physical education alone. Instead, it should be integrated across various subjects and aspects of school life. This holistic approach to health education can better address the complex needs of students and promote overall well-being. By incorporating health education into different subjects, schools can provide a more comprehensive and effective curriculum that equips students with the knowledge and skills necessary to lead healthy lives. This shift in perspective can lead to a more inclusive and impactful health education program that benefits students in the long term.
The commitment to physical activities extends beyond physical education classes. Consequently, fostering these skills within the school setting does not necessarily ensure a sustained health education that promotes consistent and appropriate health behaviors (Oliveira, Gomes, & Bracht, 2014, p.74).
In the present context, it is imperative to underscore that both the PCN - cross-sectional health theme (BRASIL, 2000) and the BNCC (BRASIL, 2017) highlight that health is unequivocally recognized as a subject of study that ought to be integrated across various curricular domains and throughout all tiers of elementary education, taking into account the student's developmental stage through a gradual introduction of content.
Furthermore, the statements from participants in this category reveal two distinct understandings regarding the theme. One perspective aligns with the body culture of movement, as articulated by Oliveira, Martins, and Bracht (2015a), which supports the views of coordinator Sofia, encompassing games, sports, and playfulness. On the other hand, there is a more limited approach to sport, as highlighted by Nara, a Portuguese language teacher. These contrasting perspectives, along with other contributing factors, shed light on the intricate relationship between physical education and health within the school setting. This relationship can either uphold traditional pedagogical practices or pave the way for a more inclusive and critical pedagogical approach.
In a study involving nine physical education teachers from the largest municipal school unit in Fortaleza, Brazil, Ferreira, Oliveira, and Sampaio (2013) identified physical exercise as a significant contributor to well-being. The teachers' discourse highlighted a perception of causality, indicating that they viewed physical activity and health acquisition as interchangeable concepts, reinforcing the importance of physical exercise in promoting overall well-being.
In a separate study examining the notion of health and healthy behaviors among students in Goiás, Brazil, Silva et al. (2017, p.808) asserted that
The practice of physical activities effectively achieves its intended goals when conducted in conducive environments with appropriate physical conditions, promoting healthy interactions and fostering initiatives that enhance both physical and mental well-being. These conditions are essential for facilitating the individual's developmental processes and overall growth.
In the study by Doña, Jiménez, and Gálvez (2014), the authors examined the official contents of Physical Education (PE) in Chile, aiming to establish a critical practice akin to the movements observed in Brazil post-1980s, which aimed at addressing and combating social inequalities. Despite this, the researchers found that teaching methods could enhance the quality of these movements, emerging as a dominant aspect of the curricular component. This tension between traditional and critical perspectives potentially shifts the focus of school physical education away from a health-oriented approach.
In the category of "Body," our research reveals that it serves as the mediator in the relationship between physical education (PE) and health. The body, as perceived by the volunteers, acts as a medium for actions, where understanding its functioning is crucial for mastery and ultimately, the attainment of good health. Additionally, our observations indicate a cause-and-effect dynamic within this context.
According to Ferreira, Oliveira, and Sampaio (2013), physical education classes ought to focus on engaging with the body not merely for physical training purposes, but rather for the purpose of overcoming societal barriers and promoting health. In this context, the body should not be perceived as a mere tool or instrument, but rather as a manifestation of an individual's very existence.
In the "Environment" category, Physical Education (PE) was observed to play a crucial role in promoting a holistic understanding of health among students, utilizing everyday situations as avenues for intervention. This highlights a PE approach that transcends individual focus, delving into the dynamics between individuals and their social contexts. Nonetheless, Becalli and Gomes' (2011) research raises concerns about lingering traces of a hygienist perspective within the discipline. Our own study corroborates this observation, as evidenced by teacher Daniela's emphasis on hygiene, cleanliness, and organization during her discourse.
In the realm of "Mental health," teacher Larissa observes a correlation between Physical Education (PE) and health, emphasizing the development of coexistence within a diverse group. This perspective not only embraces diversity but also underscores PE's role as a socializing component in the curriculum, a limitation highlighted by Bracht et al. (2003). Larissa also touches upon the social realities of students, noting their exposure to risky behaviors. Similarly, Zappe and Dell'anglio (2016) have noted that negative perceptions of relationships within the school and family, coupled with poor academic performance, demotivation, and dissatisfaction with school, can lead to behavioral changes and stressors that may impact students' mental well-being. Larissa underscores the diverse profiles of students within the school unit, particularly emphasizing the subgroup with higher exposure and susceptibility to engaging in risky behaviors.
Zappe and Dell’Aglio (2016) highlight the experimental phase, encompassing inappropriate eating habits, sports practices, antisocial behavior, substance use including alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs, risky sexual behavior, suicidal tendencies, and violence, underscoring a potential correlation with inadequate parental support. Consequently, schools are urged to remain vigilant towards these circumstances and foster a supportive environment.
Actions such as the School Health Program (PSE) (BRASIL, 2007) not only facilitate pedagogical interventions focused on health but also, as highlighted by Oliveira, Martins, and Bracht (2015b), enable collaborative efforts across networks, enhancing the identification and management of risky behaviors. Carneiro and Coutinho (2015) further emphasize the substantial identification and subsequent referral of students by schools to mental health facilities, underscoring a commendable commitment to student mental well-being. This exemplifies a promising intersectoral initiative with potential far-reaching benefits.
In the "Health" category, the concept of health is perceived as integral to the school curriculum, extending beyond physical education classes. While this represents a broadened perspective, the preventive measures highlighted by coordinator Clara, such as vaccination and dental hygiene practices, are commendable for their intersectoral approach. Nevertheless, these initiatives are primarily integrated as crosscutting themes within the curriculum components, particularly within the realm of physical education.
In examining the intersection of health and education, it becomes evident that there are isolated actions lacking continuity between these two areas, underscoring the significance of the Health-Promoting School Environment (PSE) as highlighted by BRASIL (2007). Oliveira, Martins, and Bracht (2015b) emphasize the potential for broadening health knowledge and acknowledge the challenges inherent in such initiatives, emphasizing the necessity of collaborative efforts among various stakeholders to foster enhanced synergy and coordination.
In essence, our agreement with Bracht (2013) centers on pedagogical practices focused on listening and fostering connections that enable students to be exposed to an ideal of happiness, thereby illuminating a pathway grounded in physical activities, where well-being becomes a consequence of deliberate choices and behaviors. This perspective aligns with Carmo Júnior's (2011, p.365) assertion that "[...] the body and the world constitute a unified structure; however, this unity can only be made visible through the integration of our senses, necessitating a shift in perspective to perceive the universe from alternative angles and forms." Consequently, we posit that students attend school to engage in pedagogical interventions, with the expectation of significant learning outcomes, particularly in the context of our research, which emphasizes the promotion of health.
Teachers and administrators within a State School System unit conceptualized health through the lens of well-being, expanding beyond traditional natural science-centric views. Despite this broader perspective, their understanding appears to remain largely confined to the individual well-being of students. Furthermore, the research revealed that the prevailing discourse surrounding body practices continues to emphasize the connection between physical education and health within the school environment.
Despite having transcended a rigid physical fitness paradigm, Physical Education (PE) continues to be recognized as a fundamental component of basic education. In terms of health, PE necessitates endeavors to incorporate critical pedagogies. It is our belief that the critical assimilation of the BNCC within this domain, as evidenced by numerous studies on the subject, will ultimately pave the way for a PE program that is in harmony with the cultural development of individuals. Consequently, discussions on health can be elevated to a collective level, focusing on its determinants, with body culture—embodied in activities such as games, gymnastics, sports, dance, and martial arts—serving as the foundation for a pedagogical approach in PE that is dedicated to societal change. In essence, this is a practice that challenges the pressures of the modern world, rejecting the simplistic notion that "Physical activity equals health."
For this purpose, health cannot be considered in isolation, neither within the realm of physical education nor solely within the school environment. It necessitates a comprehensive approach that involves collaboration with various community stakeholders, including parents or guardians, community leaders, local health facilities, social services, and other relevant parties.
In this context, it is both fitting and logical to consider one of Paulo Freire's teachings: educators must maintain a stance of being patiently impatient (CECCIM, 2007). Our research aligns with this notion by emphasizing the urgent need for a shift from a sedentary lifestyle to one focused on self-care, highlighting the significant correlation between physical education and overall health.
