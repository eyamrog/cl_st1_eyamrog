The COVID-19 pandemic presents a significant risk to individuals with autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). These patients typically receive treatment with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications, which can potentially compromise their immune response to infections. As of now, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal management strategies for individuals with MS and NMOSD in the context of the ongoing pandemic.
Objective: This study aims to explore effective strategies for managing patients in clinical settings.
Methods: This study focuses on strategies to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection, encompassing practices such as social distancing, telemedicine utilization, and extending the interval between laboratory tests and imaging procedures. Additionally, it delves into the management of relapses by advocating for the avoidance of treatment for mild relapses and the use of oral steroids when necessary. The research also addresses the management of disease-modifying therapies, emphasizing a preference for medications linked to lower infection risks, such as interferons, glatiramer, teriflunomide, and natalizumab, as well as advocating for extended-interval dosing of natalizumab when deemed safe. Furthermore, the study explores the individualization of MS induction therapy, considering options like anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, alemtuzumab, and cladribine. It also delves into the management of NMOSD preventive therapies, including the selection of initial therapy and the maintenance of current treatments. Lastly, the research addresses the management of MS/NMOSD patients who contract COVID-19, providing insights into appropriate care strategies for this specific patient population.
Conclusions: Future real-world case series involving MS/NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19 will be instrumental in defining optimal management strategies. Presently, our reliance is on expert experience and guidance to navigate the complexities of these conditions.
The COVID-19 pandemic, identified in December 2019, represents a significant global health threat, characterized by its rapid spread and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) potential. With a high transmission rate where each infected individual typically spreads the virus to two others, this novel coronavirus poses substantial challenges to both public health and clinical practice. Projections suggest that the pandemic may persist for a minimum of 18 months, during which managing chronic autoimmune conditions will present a formidable obstacle.
The coronavirus family exhibits potential neurotropism, which can lead to various neurological disorders including inflammatory polyneuropathy, encephalopathy, ischemic stroke, and demyelinating diseases. Neurotropism is believed to occur through the trans-lamina cribrosa, with SARS-CoV-2 potentially entering the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory tract. The interaction with human cells likely initiates with the binding of the S1 portion of the virus S protein to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) type 2 receptors, which are widely distributed throughout the human body and the CNS, including in endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells. Endothelial dysfunction and subsequent disruption of the blood-brain barrier could serve as a gateway for infected leukocytes to enter the CNS. This scenario may result in direct viral damage to the parenchyma, akin to observations with other viruses, or trigger clinical events linked to CNS autoimmune disorders.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It stands as the most prevalent demyelinating disease and a primary contributor to neurological disability among young adults subsequent to trauma. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a condition often considered in the differential diagnosis of MS, encompasses a cluster of recurrent autoimmune CNS diseases that typically impact the optic nerves and spinal cord. This disorder is notably linked to the presence of antibodies targeting the aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG) water channel, detected in over 70% of cases. AQP4-IgG seronegative NMOSD encompasses a diverse array of both monophasic and relapsing inflammatory CNS disorders, including those associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (MOG IgG), post-infectious inflammation, and other conditions stemming from unidentified antibodies. In Latin America, NMOSD accounts for roughly 20% of all CNS demyelinating diseases.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) necessitate ongoing preventive therapy to prevent disability and enhance quality of life. While there is no definitive cure for either condition, the long-term outlook for patients with these diseases has significantly improved in recent years, largely due to the introduction of a highly potent immunotherapeutic approach. This treatment regimen encompasses disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) that modulate or suppress the immune system, potentially disrupting the body's normal response to infections. The management of patients with demyelinating disorders is intricate, involving regular clinical evaluations, routine central nervous system (CNS) imaging, and laboratory monitoring, all of which can pose challenges, particularly in the context of a pandemic.
Currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding the management of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) during the ongoing pandemic. Expert recommendations have been provided by the Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (BCTRIMS), the Latin American Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (LACTRIMS), and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) on their respective websites. In the subsequent sections, we will delve into the management strategies implemented at two prominent MS/NMOSD care centers in São Paulo, Brazil, focusing on practical approaches designed to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection while ensuring clinical stability and patient safety.
In light of the current recommendation for social distancing to prevent COVID-19 infection, there is a pressing need to explore alternative strategies for effectively managing patients with chronic autoimmune disorders while also prioritizing disease prevention. Telemedicine has emerged as a viable clinical management tool, bolstered by legal backing in our country through Law no. 13,989 enacted on April 15, 2020. The adoption of remote care has proven to be a secure method for monitoring patients amidst the ongoing pandemic, ensuring continuity of care while minimizing the risk of exposure to the virus.
The recent review of literature on telemedicine and MS has underscored its various benefits in MS care, including cost-effectiveness and improved satisfaction among both patients and providers. Endorsed by the Brazilian Academy of Neurology, telemedicine has gained traction, with guidelines now available for conducting remote neurological examinations. Simple assessments like the timed 25-foot walk are deemed practical for evaluating MS patients, while more intricate evaluations like fundoscopic examinations can be facilitated with adequate technological support. Nonetheless, challenges persist, notably in terms of treatment compliance over prolonged periods and technological obstacles.
Amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo and Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Santa Casa de São Paulo have established communication with the majority of their patients through phone calls and/or emails. This mode of contact facilitates direct engagement between patients and caregivers, enabling the rescheduling of future appointments, reviewing laboratory test and imaging results, addressing patient concerns, managing drug monitoring, and offering information related to the pandemic.
Relapse, defined as a demyelinating event of the CNS lasting at least 24 hours without fever or infection, necessitates the exclusion of infection when encountering a deterioration in neurological symptoms of MS. Particularly during the ongoing pandemic, it is prudent to rule out COVID-19. Given the documented association of SARS-CoV-2 with demyelinating events in isolated case reports, COVID-19 screening is recommended for all patients experiencing relapses. To establish a comprehensive evaluation strategy, we propose assessing patients for common clinical manifestations such as cough, fever, respiratory issues, hyposmia/anosmia, and hypogeusia. If these symptoms are present, we advocate for conducting chest computed tomography, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, and/or immunological assays. It is important to note that the sensitivity of immunological assays may be compromised in MS patients with impaired humoral responses linked to specific disease-modifying drugs.
After excluding active infection, the subsequent management step involves categorizing the severity of relapse. In the case of most relapses, the agreed-upon treatment protocol entails a 1000 mg intravenous infusion of methylprednisolone over a period of 3 to 5 days. Nevertheless, in the context of optic neuritis (ON), this particular treatment regimen has demonstrated efficacy in hastening neurological recovery without influencing long-term disability. Consequently, we propose refraining from administering corticosteroids for the management of mild relapses. Our rationale stems from the belief that the accelerated amelioration of mild neurological symptoms does not justify the heightened risk of infection associated with steroid usage.
While intravenous steroids are typically the preferred treatment for MS relapses, recent studies have indicated that oral steroids can be just as effective. Given the current need for social distancing, we advocate for the consideration of oral corticosteroids as a viable treatment option during the ongoing pandemic. Our proposed approach involves the administration of custom-made oral methylprednisolone tablets at a dosage of 1000 mg per day for a duration of five days. In situations where oral tablets are not readily available, such as in Brazil, we suggest the use of intravenous methylprednisolone at a dosage of 1000 mg daily for five days, preferably in a day hospital setting. For individuals with contraindications to high-dose steroids, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin at a total dose of 2 g/kg over a period of 2 to 5 days is a reasonable alternative.
Greater caution is warranted in managing NMOSD relapses due to their typically heightened severity, resistance to steroids, and potential for increased disability compared to those seen in MS. It is recommended that NMOSD patients displaying symptoms indicative of relapses undergo prompt clinical evaluation, with standard treatment involving intravenous steroids and consideration of plasmapheresis. In cases where plasma exchange is unavailable, intravenous immunoglobulin could be a viable alternative for relapse management following an inadequate response to steroid therapy. It is crucial to recognize that not all relapses manifest in the same manner; for instance, ON and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) relapses tend to be more aggressive, with early plasma exchange correlating with a more favorable prognosis. Conversely, Area postrema syndrome (APS) relapses are typically milder, yet they can serve as a warning sign for subsequent inflammatory involvement of optic nerves or spinal cord. Approximately 80% of APS patients show improvement within the first 2 days of methylprednisolone treatment, with less than 20% necessitating plasmapheresis. Early intervention for APS attacks is advised not only to mitigate clinical severity but also to potentially prevent the onset of disabling ON or TM attacks.
Certain acute demyelinating events may not meet the diagnostic criteria for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD). These events encompass acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), idiopathic isolated optic neuritis (ON), and idiopathic isolated transverse myelitis (TM). Our recommendation is to manage these events with intravenous steroids, immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange, following the standard protocols utilized in non-pandemic situations. Typically, these conditions do not necessitate prolonged immunotherapy.
MOG IgG-associated optic neuritis, encephalitis, and myelitis (MONEM) can manifest as either a monophasic or recurrent condition. Relapses in MOG IgG disease typically exhibit a positive response to steroid treatment. In cases of recurrence, sustained seropositivity for MOG IgG over the long term is linked to the need for personalized consideration of immunosuppressive therapy.
The optimal initial treatment approach for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), whether induction therapy or escalation therapy, remains a topic of ongoing debate within the medical community. Induction therapy involves the use of high-efficacy treatments that result in a more rapid control of disease activity. In contrast, traditional escalation therapy involves the initial prescription of safer, low-efficacy drugs that can be switched to more effective alternatives if there is clinical or radiological evidence of disease progression. A recent observational study has suggested that the induction therapy approach may potentially lead to reduced long-term disability, providing strong support for this method. However, it is important to note that these findings require validation through experimental trials, such as those currently underway in the TREAT-MS and DELIVER-MS trials.
Escalation therapy may be considered for the majority of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, as over 80% of them do not exhibit aggressive forms of the disease. Certain disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) utilized in this strategy, such as beta-interferons, glatiramer acetate, and teriflunomide, are not linked to an elevated risk of infections. The association of dimethyl fumarate with an increased infection risk has been a topic of controversy. Hence, these DMDs should be prioritized for MS patients, particularly during the ongoing pandemic.
However, approximately 10% of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients exhibit highly active disease, for whom these medications may not suffice as initial therapy. Furthermore, the specific impact of each disease-modifying drug (DMD) on the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains undetermined. Individuals with a substantial disease burden might necessitate high-efficacy treatments. In such cases, both we and the ECTRIMS/Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF) advocate for the selection of therapies that do not induce lymphopenia, such as natalizumab. The use of fingolimod, cladribine, alemtuzumab, and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies has been linked to lymphopenia, posing a significant infection risk based on real-world data. Therefore, we recommend conducting an individualized risk/benefit assessment before prescribing these medications. Additionally, recent pharmacovigilance data indicate that ocrelizumab is not associated with a more severe course of COVID-19. Consequently, ocrelizumab could be considered as a treatment option for patients with aggressive MS.
It is not advisable to discontinue Disease Modifying Drugs (DMDs) for patients currently receiving treatment. Ceasing the use of fingolimod and natalizumab has been linked to rebound effects, which can result in increased disability, hospitalization, and the need for additional immunosuppressive treatments such as intravenous methylprednisolone. This places patients at a heightened risk of severe COVID-19 infection.
At present, there exists a lack of specific guidance concerning the treatment of pregnant women, children, and elderly individuals (aged over 60 years) with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that geriatric and pregnant populations are at a heightened susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, coupled with findings from a recent meta-analysis indicating suboptimal responses to MS therapies among older patients, we propose the implementation of personalized risk evaluations when considering Disease Modifying Drugs (DMDs) for pregnant and elderly MS patients.
When left untreated, around 50% of patients with Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) will experience severe disability, including becoming wheelchair-bound and blind, with a third succumbing to the disease within five years of their initial attack. Therefore, it is strongly advised not to discontinue immunosuppressive preventive treatment in NMOSD cases. The primary first-line treatment options for NMOSD are azathioprine and rituximab. Given the current pandemic situation, we recommend rituximab as the preferred initial therapy due to its efficacy and safety profile.
Both drugs pose comparable risks of infection.
Rituximab has been demonstrated to be more effective than azathioprine in reducing relapses, as supported by existing research.
Rituximab necessitates less frequent laboratory monitoring compared to other treatments.
In patients exhibiting persistent MOG IgG positivity alongside NMOSD clinical phenotype, we advocate for a unified management approach, suggesting rituximab as the primary treatment option, particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario. It is crucial to note that individuals with MONEM may not necessarily respond to rituximab in the same manner as those who are AQP4-positive.
Most disease-modifying drugs for multiple sclerosis necessitate consistent clinical, laboratory, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance to evaluate disease progression and potential adverse reactions. Notably, lymphopenia, a common side effect associated with medications like fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, is a significant worry due to its potential correlation with an increased susceptibility to infectious illnesses.
In patients using fingolimod, both upper and lower respiratory tract infections are more prevalent, as noted in this DMD. The pivotal trial highlighted the frequent occurrence of lymphopenia, prompting monthly lymphocyte count monitoring during the initial trimester and subsequently every three months. Despite fingolimod-related lymphopenia, there hasn't been a notable increase in infection rates. It's crucial to understand that lymphocyte counts aren't direct indicators of immunosuppression but rather signify cell redistribution, particularly lymphocyte retention in lymph nodes. In light of the current pandemic, we advocate for minimal laboratory testing to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. Our recommendation is to conduct a complete blood count (CBC) three months post-treatment initiation and then every six months, with the goal of maintaining lymphocyte levels above 200 cells.
Teriflunomide is linked to lymphopenia, yet in a combined analysis of TEMSO, TOWER, TOPIC, and TENERE trials, low-grade lymphopenia (Grade 1 or Grade 2) was rare, with no instances of high-grade lymphopenia (Grade 3 or Grade 4) reported. Additionally, infection rates among teriflunomide-treated patients were comparable in groups with and without low-grade lymphopenia. It is advised to conduct a complete blood count (CBC) three months post-treatment initiation and subsequently every six months.
Persistent lymphopenia, defined as having fewer than 500 lymphocytes for over 6 months, has been linked to the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate. Given that the original trials utilized an 800 lymphocyte-count threshold to signify significant lymphopenia and considering our concerns regarding the increased risk of severe respiratory infections alongside PML, we have decided to utilize this same threshold for reassessing the choice of dimethyl fumarate as a disease-modifying drug. To ensure proper monitoring and follow-up, we recommend employing the same monitoring interval and telemedicine follow-up protocols that have been established for fingolimod and teriflunomide.
Natalizumab is linked to a higher infection risk compared to beta-interferons and glatiramer acetate but shows a lower risk than other potent therapies like fingolimod and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Despite its well-established safety and efficacy profile, there is a concern regarding the 0.7% incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) cases in real-life series, a rare and fatal demyelinating disease caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV). PML associated with natalizumab use remains a constant worry. The implementation of extended-interval dosing has been shown, through observational data, to mitigate the risk of PML while maintaining treatment effectiveness. This approach involves dosing natalizumab at intervals of 5–8 weeks instead of the standard 4-week interval dosing. Particularly relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this strategy reduces exposure to viral contamination. Our current protocol includes a 6-week interval dosing for patients previously on the standard interval regimen and, in certain instances, an 8-week interval dosing for those previously on a 6-week interval.
Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, such as ocrelizumab and the off-label use of rituximab, are commonly employed in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). These antibodies have been previously linked to an elevated risk of severe viral infections, a significant concern amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The causal mechanisms behind this association include neutropenia, lymphopenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Consequently, we advocate for regular monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) and immunoglobulin levels (total serum IgA, IgM, IgG) every six months or in cases of recurrent infections when these antibodies are prescribed. Administering immunoglobulin replacement to patients with hypogammaglobulinemia has been shown to reduce the risk of infections associated with rituximab use. This recommendation holds particular significance in the context of a viral pandemic. Monitoring CD19 levels could serve as a viable strategy to tailor treatment decisions regarding dosage and reinfusion intervals for B-cell depleting therapies. Notably, recent data indicates that ocrelizumab has not been linked to severe cases of COVID-19. Therefore, this treatment option appears reasonable for aggressive MS patients who test positive for the JC virus.
Cladribine, an immunosuppressive agent utilized for induction therapy in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), exhibits a preferential depletion of lymphocytes, reaching its lowest point approximately one month post the final administered dose, with further intensification following the second cycle. During this period, an anticipated 60% reduction in CD4 count and a 40% decrease in CD8 count are observed, with a subsequent stabilization over the course of a year. It is noteworthy that the extent of lymphopenia does not appear to correlate with MS relapse occurrences. Nevertheless, more pronounced levels of lymphopenia, specifically below 500 lymphocytes/mm3, have been associated with a twofold increase in the occurrence of Herpes-Zoster in the pivotal trial.
Alemtuzumab functions as an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody induction therapy. Following a cycle of this medication, there is a depletion exceeding 90% in both CD4 and CD8 cells within the initial month, gradually recuperating to approximately 70% of the baseline levels by the end of the first year, just prior to the administration of the second cycle.
Cladribine and alemtuzumab have been found to significantly weaken immune defenses against infections. Several studies suggest that for alemtuzumab, skipping the second dose may still effectively control the disease. However, further data is required to conclusively determine whether this omission will not impact the therapy's long-term efficacy.
Acknowledging the necessity for a more aggressive approach for highly active MS patients, particularly in the context of increased infection risk during a pandemic, is crucial. Patients who exhibit older age at symptom onset (>35 years), display pyramidal signs, and demonstrate higher disability levels (EDSS score ≥3.0) within the first year after symptom onset are at a heightened risk of developing aggressive disease. This subset of patients, constituting approximately 10% of MS patients, necessitates a personalized and collaborative treatment strategy. Considering the circumstances, induction therapy could be a viable option for this specific patient population.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) serves as an induction therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS), with the primary goal of halting MS-related damage through cell depletion followed by immune system repopulation. This treatment exerts a prolonged impact on the immune system. Individuals who have undergone HSCT recently are advised to prolong their isolation period amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients deemed suitable candidates for HSCT are encouraged to engage in discussions with their neurologists and contemplate delaying the procedure. Table 2 provides a comprehensive overview of factors to consider regarding disease-modifying drug (DMD) utilization for MS in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.
It is advisable to conduct annual CNS imaging (MRI) through telemedicine for the majority of stable MS patients. However, there is an exception for Natalizumab-treated patients with a heightened risk of developing PML, which includes those with a double or triple risk factor (such as a history of immunosuppression, JCV index exceeding 0.9, or having received more than 24 infusions). For these individuals, it is crucial to undergo MRI monitoring every 3 to 6 months to screen for asymptomatic PML.
Rituximab is commonly utilized in the treatment of NMOSD, albeit posing an increased risk of severe viral infections through various mechanisms. To mitigate this risk, immunoglobulin monitoring and replacement, when deemed necessary, could serve as a viable strategy. When considering B-cell monitoring in NMOSD, targeting CD27+ memory B-cells rather than CD19+ B-cells may offer a more accurate assessment of rituximab's effectiveness. A study revealed that over half of NMOSD relapses occurred when CD19+ B-cell counts were below 0.01 × 109/L but still above the therapeutic threshold for CD27+ memory B-cells. Given the unavailability of CD27 markers in clinical settings and the potential fatality of NMOSD relapses, it is recommended to maintain rituximab dosing at regular 6-month intervals.
Chronic steroid use is frequently employed as a transitional therapy for NMOSD until immunosuppressants take effect. The risk of infection is directly proportional to the dosage of steroids used. Therefore, it is advisable to gradually reduce the steroid dosage, ensuring safety. To facilitate this process, we have integrated telemedicine as a tool to assist in guiding patients through the tapering schedule.
Azathioprine, a frequently utilized treatment for NMOSD in Brazil, has been associated with a higher incidence of myelosuppression within the initial year of therapy based on adverse-event data from other autoimmune conditions, with an average onset time of 8 months. In light of this, we suggest extending the hematological monitoring interval for patients who have been on azathioprine for over a year to mitigate the risk of coronavirus exposure. As a precautionary measure during the pandemic, we advocate for regular laboratory assessments every 6 months for individuals maintaining stable azathioprine therapy.
Mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated efficacy in preventing NMOSD relapses, operating through immunosuppression by exerting cytostatic effects on T and B cells. Adverse effect data primarily stem from transplant recipients and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient trials, revealing cytopenia and heightened susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections among these cohorts. To mitigate risks, we advocate for regular monitoring of complete blood counts (CBC) and liver enzymes on a weekly basis during the initial 4–6 weeks of treatment, followed by assessments every 3 months thereafter.
Methotrexate, an immunosuppressive agent, is sometimes utilized in the treatment of NMOSD. When administered at low doses ranging from 7.5 to 25 mg, instances of myelosuppression are rare, and most patients do not exhibit a susceptibility to opportunistic infections unless they are concurrently using high-dose corticosteroids. Nevertheless, hepatotoxicity is a prevalent concern. Pancytopenia may manifest with varying therapy intervals, with predisposing factors commonly found in the majority of affected patients, notably impaired renal function. Therefore, we propose that patients on stable methotrexate doses without recent adverse events undergo CBC and liver enzyme monitoring every six months during the pandemic. For individuals who have been on methotrexate for less than six months or have a history of prior adverse events, we recommend more frequent monitoring, such as every 2-3 months. Table 3 provides a summary of considerations regarding the use of DMD for NMOSD amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the coming months, it is anticipated that a significant portion of the general population will contract COVID-19. The majority of individuals are likely to either remain asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms. In Brazil, the Ministry of Health has identified specific groups at a higher risk of developing severe complications from the virus. These high-risk groups include individuals aged 60 and above, those with severe cardiac or lung conditions, kidney diseases, diabetes, individuals under immunosuppressive treatment, and pregnant women.
Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) are considered a special population at higher risk of severe infection, as indicated by the Brazilian government. However, current evidence does not definitively establish that individuals with MS/NMOSD who contract SARS-CoV-2 are at an increased risk of developing life-threatening complications. To address this uncertainty, the Brazilian Academy of Neurology is in the process of establishing a national database specifically focused on MS patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to assess the associated risks within our country. A case series from Italy involving 232 MS patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the vast majority (96%) experienced mild symptoms. Among these patients, only five individuals (2%) succumbed to the infection, with four of them having significant comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular, and cardiac diseases. The average age of these deceased patients was 66.8 years, ranging from 54 to 82 years.
In addition to practicing social distancing, we propose that certain measures could contribute to infection prevention. It is recommended that vaccination be administered to reduce the risk of infection in immunosuppressed or immunomodulated patients whenever feasible. Previous publications have outlined vaccination schedules for patients with demyelinating diseases. Generally, similar principles applied to patients with systemic autoimmune diseases are followed, including the avoidance of live virus or bacterial vaccines. It is important to note that the efficacy of vaccines may be diminished in patients undergoing specific disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as fingolimod, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and cladribine.
During the ongoing pandemic, it is crucial for patients with demyelinating diseases to receive influenza vaccination, as this respiratory virus can co-infect patients and result in severe clinical manifestations. Given that the response to the pneumococcal vaccine is significantly compromised when combined with the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, it is advisable for all patients to undergo pneumococcal vaccination 2–3 weeks before initiating therapy in a sequential manner (specifically, PCV13 prime followed by PPSV23 boost), with a minimum interval of 8 weeks between the two vaccinations. For individuals undergoing anti-CD20 therapies, vaccination should commence at least 2–3 weeks prior to treatment initiation or 5–7 months following the last infusion.
Patients with severe COVID-19 are at risk of developing various neurological complications, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, seizures, encephalopathy, and skeletal muscle injury. These complications often manifest following respiratory symptoms and could be linked to an exacerbated immunological response. The immune damage and prothrombotic states induced by the cytokine storm in COVID-19 may account for some of these neurological manifestations, potentially activating glial cells and leading to demyelination. Additionally, isolated cases of central nervous system demyelinating events post-SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported. The association between SARS-CoV-2 and post-infectious inflammatory demyelinating events remains a topic of ongoing debate.
Immunosuppressive therapies are under investigation as cytokine storm inhibitors for severe cases of COVID-19 infection, such as fingolimod (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferons, known as MS disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), possess antiviral properties and are a subject of interest in the current pandemic (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04343768, NCT04350671). Additionally, medications used for treating neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are being assessed in confirmed COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia and SARS, including tocilizumab (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04317092), eculizumab (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04288713), and intravenous methylprednisolone (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: ChiCTR2000029386). Nevertheless, the potential protective effects of MS/NMOSD DMDs against COVID-19 infections require further validation. Pending additional data, it is recommended to discontinue DMDs during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. For moderate and mild cases, the decision to halt DMDs should be personalized based on drug safety profiles, patient age, and other underlying conditions. Presently, any medication that could impede the immune response cannot be deemed entirely safe for a symptomatic patient.
Patients with MS/NMOSD who contract SARS-CoV-2 should receive treatment in accordance with the latest COVID-19 protocols. Presently, the approach to managing COVID-19 primarily involves supportive care. Given the lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of antiviral treatments such as chloroquine derivatives or remdesivir, and the absence of data on their interactions with DMDs, we advise against their utilization in this patient population.
If a patient discontinues a Disease Modifying Drug (DMD) during a COVID-19 infection, the reintroduction of the medication should be meticulously planned based on factors such as the activity of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)/Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), the patient's age, and previous drug regimens. Additionally, the severity of the COVID-19 infection should be closely monitored as it correlates with the duration of viremia. Existing literature indicates that in mild cases, 90% of previously positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results become negative after 10 days of symptom onset, while more severe cases tend to remain positive. Furthermore, immunosuppression can potentially extend the viremic period. Delaying the reintroduction of DMDs may heighten the risk of relapses or rebound effects, particularly in individuals previously treated with natalizumab or fingolimod. Therefore, we suggest reintroducing DMDs between 4 to 8 weeks post-SARS-CoV-2 infection and advise neurologists to collaborate with infectious disease specialists to confirm viral clearance before initiating immunosuppressive therapy.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is posing challenges to the conventional approaches in treating and monitoring patients with CNS demyelinating diseases. Presently, there is no indication that individuals with MS or NMOSD who contract the virus are at a heightened risk of experiencing severe COVID-19 symptoms. However, it is imperative to exercise caution and remain vigilant due to the frequent immunosuppression in these patients. Furthermore, adjustments in their management are essential during this crisis to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection while ensuring the safety and effectiveness of their treatment protocols.
Several strategies have been proposed for the management of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) during the ongoing pandemic.
Social distancing measures, along with the utilization of telemedicine, have become crucial strategies in combating the spread of infectious diseases, particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. By maintaining physical distance from others and opting for remote medical consultations, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of exposure to pathogens while still accessing necessary healthcare services. These practices not only protect individuals from potential infection but also contribute to the overall public health effort by minimizing the burden on healthcare systems and preventing the further transmission of diseases. As such, the integration of social distancing and telemedicine into healthcare protocols has emerged as a vital component in ensuring the safety and well-being of both patients and healthcare providers in the face of contagious illnesses.
To optimize the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses, it is suggested to refrain from treating mild relapses and instead consider utilizing equivalent doses of oral steroids. This approach aims to balance the need for effective treatment while minimizing unnecessary interventions for less severe relapses. By reserving more aggressive treatments for moderate to severe relapses, healthcare providers can potentially reduce the overall burden of treatment on patients while still addressing the most impactful symptoms. Additionally, using oral steroids at equivalent doses may offer a more convenient and cost-effective alternative to intravenous treatments, potentially improving patient adherence and outcomes. This strategy aligns with the goal of personalized medicine in MS care, tailoring treatment approaches to the individual needs and severity of each relapse. Further research and clinical guidelines are warranted to establish the efficacy and safety of this approach in managing MS relapses.
Preference should be given to drugs that are associated with a lower risk of infection, such as interferons, glatiramer, teriflunomide, and natalizumab. Additionally, extended-interval dosing of natalizumab should be considered when it is deemed safe to do so.
Delaying the initiation of induction therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) is a topic of interest in current research.
Ensuring the continuity of preventive treatment for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is crucial for managing the condition effectively. Adherence to prescribed medications and therapies is essential in preventing relapses and minimizing disease progression. Patients with NMOSD should work closely with their healthcare providers to establish a treatment plan that suits their individual needs and lifestyle. Regular monitoring and follow-up appointments are necessary to assess the efficacy of the preventive measures and make any necessary adjustments. Education and support for patients and their caregivers are also vital in promoting treatment adherence and overall well-being. By prioritizing the maintenance of NMOSD preventive treatment, individuals can better manage their condition and improve their quality of life.
Consider extending the time gap between conducting laboratory tests or imaging procedures and utilizing telemedicine for result review, as long as it is deemed appropriate and feasible.
In the future, case series involving patients with MS/NMOSD who have contracted COVID-19 will assist in delineating optimal management strategies. Presently, we depend on expert insights and guidance. Emulating the practices of other institutions, we present our existing patient care protocols during the pandemic, with the aspiration that they may offer assistance to healthcare providers in our region.
We extend our gratitude to Professor Dr. Gavin Giovannoni, a globally recognized expert in Multiple Sclerosis, for generously granting us permission to adapt a table featured on his website "MS Selfie" for Table 1 (accessible at: https://sites.google.com/giovannoni.net/clinicspeak-dmt/home).
