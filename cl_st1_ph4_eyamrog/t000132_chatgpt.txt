The emergence of Planetary Health in the global North highlights concerns regarding the impact of degraded natural systems on human health, emphasizing the need for urgent and transformative actions. Despite its recent recognition, the concept itself is not new, representing a colonial approach that overlooks alternative knowledge systems rooted in sustainable and holistic lifestyles developed over millennia. This approach perpetuates the one-sided narrative of modernity, failing to acknowledge that the very threats to "planetary health" stem from its own framework. By imposing its solutions on political, epistemological, and ontological peripheries shaped by coloniality, it reinforces existing power dynamics. The Latin American decolonial movement offers a different perspective, advocating for a transformative action that addresses not just political and economic crises but also the fundamental crisis of civilization. By deconstructing the notion of a dual world where the global North dictates epistemologies, while the rest passively receive and apply them, decolonial movements pave the way for a more inclusive and diverse approach. The concept of One Health of Peripheries embodies this shift, focusing on the health of multispecies collectives and their environment within marginalized symbolic and geographic spaces. This article explores how the decolonial promotion of One Health of Peripheries can foster decentralized and pluralistic practices to address local realities effectively. The proposed seven actions aim to advance this promotion and encourage a more inclusive and sustainable approach to planetary health.
Modernity, a widely embraced concept, often denotes progress, advocating for positive and essential changes to pave the way for a brighter future. However, less acknowledged is the critical understanding of the modernity/coloniality cultural complex. This lack of recognition is not coincidental; modernity serves as a narrative constructed by Western civilization to showcase its accomplishments such as rationality, science, and technology while obscuring its darker aspects like genocide, expropriation, forced displacement, and exploitation. This obscured facet of modernity is coloniality, which can be defined as the fundamental logic underlying the establishment and evolution of Western civilization from the Renaissance to the present, with historical colonialisms being a significant yet often overlooked component. Colonialism, on the other hand, refers to the political, social, and cultural dominance in territories occupied by Europeans, a characteristic feature of the colonization period in America. Contrary to the notion of the discovery of America, this era, as Dussel aptly put it, was more accurately the discovery of an invasion and is framed as the very genesis of modernity.
The concept of the global South serves as a metaphor encompassing the realm of epistemic challenges aimed at rectifying the repercussions and historical ramifications stemming from capitalism's colonial interactions with the world. This notion extends to include regions typically classified as part of the global North. By embracing Southern epistemologies, critiques of modernity transcend their traditional confines within the global North, shedding light on the colonial underpinnings of contemporary rhetoric. These epistemologies unveil a profound crisis of civilization spanning over five centuries, with profound implications for public health. In Latin America, philanthropic interventions have played a role in alleviating some of the health-related consequences of this enduring crisis, redistributing a fraction of the wealth held by affluent philanthropists to the most impoverished segments of society. Remarkably, this redistribution has not disrupted the consumption and accumulation patterns of the wealthy elite, facilitating significant improvements in the material circumstances of the less privileged. However, this philanthropic approach has also served to legitimize the elite class, deflecting accountability for the poverty they perpetuate and the exploitative mechanisms fueling their wealth accumulation. Notably, the Rockefeller Foundation has been a key player in philanthropic endeavors since the early 20th century, employing strategic initiatives to influence the development of health professions and the structuring of public health services.
However, these strategies have also given rise to decolonial health responses, exemplified by Collective Health (9,11), Critical Epidemiology (12), and South-South International Health (13). Despite their efforts, these responses have, to some extent, perpetuated colonial anthropocentrism by predominantly viewing health as a human-centric phenomenon, relegating other beings to mere vectors, reservoirs, or determinants of human health. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the advancements made by the Ecuadorian school in discussing the social determination of animal health (14) and animal production management (15). In contrast, The Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on Planetary Health report portrays nonhuman beings as entities within terrestrial systems valued solely for their instrumental role in human health (16). This perspective, akin to previous Foundation initiatives, can be interpreted as a means to uphold the capitalist order in response to the perceived necessity of averting environmental degradation and its repercussions on human health.
One Health of Peripheries represents a decolonial approach aimed at enhancing the well-being of marginalized multispecies collectives (Baquero, 17). Baquero delves into the biopolitics, social determinants, and practical applications of One Health of the Peripheries, emphasizing the symbolic significance of peripheries while subtly alluding to its decolonial underpinnings (17). A key element underscoring this foundation is the rejection of animalization, a mechanism that marginalizes nonhuman animals and disadvantaged human communities within colonial power structures that shape epidemiological patterns.
The excessive risks inherent in peripheral epidemiological profiles underscore the importance of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies aimed at (1) preventing, (2) early detecting and treating, and (3) mitigating the impacts of diseases or poor health. However, the preventive approach is confined to a negative view of health, focusing on the absence of diseases or poor health. In contrast, health promotion operates from a positive perspective, viewing health as a valuable asset and the ability to lead a fulfilling life. While prevention and promotion share common ground, with prevention encompassing promotion (for instance, environmental sanitation prevents diseases and being disease-free enhances resources for a good life), the mere absence of diseases or poor health is insufficient for promotion as it does not fully capture the potential for a better quality of life. Promotion goes beyond addressing risk factors or specific issues; it also emphasizes enhancing resources and capabilities.
The concept of One Health of Peripheries is fundamentally oriented towards prevention, as the field of practice inherently deals with the generation of excess risks and disease burdens. Peripheries, however, should not be solely viewed as mere repositories of risks and injuries; they also possess structurally oppressed resources and capabilities that can be harnessed through an ecology of knowledge within a multispecies health framework. The promotion of a decolonial approach to One Health of Peripheries is aimed at unlocking and utilizing these resources and capabilities for the betterment of health outcomes in marginalized regions.
In the subsequent sections, we introduce the concept of modernity as a myth, followed by an exploration of the colonial influences evident in the philanthropic endeavors of the Rockefeller Foundation and the coloniality embedded within The Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on Planetary Health report. Transitioning from this decolonial perspective, we delve into the ecology of knowledge to provide a framework for our proposition advocating for the decolonial advancement of One Health in marginalized regions.
Modernity, a political, social, and cultural European process that emerged in the 15th century, facilitated the rise of capitalism and its subsequent evolution into a global economic system. Central to modernity is the notion of limitless progress, with economic and social transformations driven by scientific and technological advancements promising a brighter future. However, the Eurocentric and colonial nature of modernity has come under scrutiny, particularly through the lens of the Latin American decolonial perspective. Dussel delineated two interpretations of modernity: a primary, positive view that sees it as a pathway to rational liberation and a new historical trajectory for humanity, and a secondary, negative perspective where modernity rationalizes irrational violence. From this standpoint, the only perceived path to civilization for "barbarian" societies appears to be their gradual assimilation into the modern, Eurocentric framework, heavily reliant on the epistemological authority and purported ontological superiority (be it racial, ethnic, or geopolitical) of the global North. This process of incorporation, termed modernization, has not been a meeting of equals but rather a forceful imposition.
The myth of modernity, imbued with notions of heroism and redemption, is encapsulated by Dussel in seven key elements. Firstly, modern European civilization perceives itself as the pinnacle of development and superiority. This belief in superiority compels it, almost as a moral imperative, to "develop" or civilize the supposedly more primitive, barbaric, and underdeveloped civilizations. The trajectory of this development is envisioned to mirror Europe's own historical progression from antiquity and the Middle Ages. When faced with resistance from the barbaric or primitive, modernity resorts to violence as a last resort to eliminate obstacles to modernization. This violence, resulting in various forms of victimization, assumes a quasi-ritualistic nature, with the civilizing hero casting their victims (be it the colonized, the enslaved, women, or the environment) as participants in a redemptive sacrificial process. Modernity frames the barbarian or primitive as inherently guilty, particularly for impeding the civilizing mission, thereby positioning itself as both blameless and as a liberating force that will absolve or redeem its victims from their perceived guilt. In light of this civilizing and redemptive narrative, the suffering and sacrifices endured by "immature" peoples, enslaved races, the marginalized gender, and others are deemed not only inevitable but also essential for the process of modernization (1).
The suffering and sacrifice that accompany the process become less apparent when viewed through the lens of seduction, which transforms modernity into an aspiration rather than enforcing it through systematic repression. Colonizers not only imposed their own knowledge and meaning systems but also presented them as unattainable to the dominated initially, later selectively teaching them to co-opt some individuals into their power structures. European culture was made alluring by granting access to power, positioning it as a universal model to aspire to for material benefits and authority. However, not everyone achieves this aspiration, as the myth of modernity's ontological superiority restricts access to benefits and power based on racial, ethnic, and geocultural attributes, either frustrating or facilitating the aspiration depending on their configuration.
The configurations of these attributes delineate the locus of hegemonic production of health epistemologies and, significantly, their manifestation in health outcomes. In the context of modernity, epistemologies are predominantly generated in the global North. Conversely, the global South is constrained in its ability to partake in knowledge exchange or contribute to epistemological frameworks shaped by modernity. As elucidated further, the health discourses of the global North are attuned to the agendas of dominant factions in powerful nations, often disregarding the needs of marginalized groups, thereby engendering distinct epidemiological patterns.
Capitalism, facilitated by coloniality, gives rise to statistics such as the recent findings by Coffey and colleagues (25): in 2019, a mere 2,153 individuals classified as the world's billionaires amassed more wealth than 4.6 billion people. To put this into perspective, within a global population of 7.7 billion, the wealth held by a mere 0.000028% of the population exceeded that of 59.7%. These staggering numbers, when viewed through the lens of the Law of diminishing marginal utility, allow for the redistribution of minute portions of wealth from the affluent to the impoverished without significantly impacting the former's consumption and accumulation habits, while potentially catalyzing substantial improvements in the material circumstances of the latter. This phenomenon can be interpreted as both philanthropic achievements and as a tactic employed by the elite to validate their status and evade accountability for the poverty they perpetuate and the exploitation that fuels the expansion of their fortunes. The interplay between these contrasting perspectives perpetuates disparities and shapes the parameters within which alternative solutions can be conceived.
The aforementioned transfers have the potential to enhance the symbolic and cultural capital of elites, subsequently bolstering their economic capital. Additionally, legitimization strategies serve as economic investments, with a key approach being the exertion of influence on the educational system to perpetuate the dominance of certain classes by shaping individuals to assume high-ranking positions within the state bureaucracy and power structures. This strategic manipulation was not coincidental; during the early 20th century, the industrialization of the United States facilitated the amassing of substantial wealth and the establishment of influential universities, many of which bear partial resemblance to their founders who were magnates. For instance, John D. Rockefeller, the world's first billionaire and the proprietor of the Standard Oil Company, played a pivotal role in the establishment of the University of Chicago.
According to Vieria-da-Silva (9), philanthropists at the beginning of the 20th century foresaw an inevitable social reform and invested in scientific approaches to social issues that did not challenge the capitalist order. The Rockefeller Sanitary Commission, established in 1909 (following the creation of The Rockefeller Institute in 1901 and The Rockefeller Foundation in 1913), aimed at industrializing the agrarian South and aligning it with the capitalist interests of the North (9).
The Rockefeller Foundation maintained its commitment to investing in and influencing the field of medicine. In 1947, Fred Soper, an official of the Foundation, assumed the role of director at Opas, an institution aligned with United States health policies and under its official direction until 1958. It was only post-World War II, with the establishment of the WHO, that Opas transitioned into a Regional Office of the global health organization. Throughout the Cold War era, the United States' foreign policy, aimed at safeguarding free trade and foreign investments, sought to cultivate a positive perception. As noted by Tota, Nelson Rockefeller, serving as the Coordinator of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, actively engaged in a deliberate initiative to enhance the image of the United States.
In the debate surrounding the monopoly of legitimate healthcare practices in Latin America, the Rockefeller Foundation aimed to supplant the French model. During the 1950s, Opas played a pivotal role in advancing this objective by promoting Preventive Medicine, an ideological movement designed to safeguard the dominance of Private Medicine. This initiative was a response to two pressing issues: the escalating costs of Medical Care in the United States and the looming threat of State intervention. These concerns had already begun to trouble the American medical college associations, as evidenced by Arouca's reference to Fishbein and Bierring. The latter emphasized the necessity for the medical profession to devise a mechanism that would make the full potential of modern medicine in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and disease prevention accessible to all individuals. They argued that this responsibility should rest with the medical profession rather than any form of State Medicine.
The report from the Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on Planetary Health upholds the Foundation's longstanding focus on addressing inequality, improving the health of marginalized populations, and safeguarding the environment. This emphasis can be viewed as a continuation of colonial-era strategies aimed at sustaining the capitalist system amidst growing concerns about environmental degradation and its detrimental effects on human well-being.
While the previous section delved into Rockefeller Foundation colonial precedents, it is crucial to acknowledge that the Planetary Health concept also draws from other historical roots not highlighted in the report. Integrative medicine, holistic medicine, and various scholars have emphasized the importance of a healthy planet over the past fifty years, even coining the term "planetary health." Therefore, our discussion builds upon prior insights that transcend the Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission report's limited perspective. Disappointingly, the report adopts a colonial stance by disregarding a wide array of worldviews that view humans and nature as interconnected, recognizing that environmental degradation directly impacts human health and well-being. These perspectives, rooted in ancient traditions, have long understood the intrinsic link between health, well-being, and nature, a connection that is only now gaining recognition as Earth's systems deteriorate.
The current trajectory of humanity raises questions about progress when considering the prevalence of genocide, dispossession, forced displacement, and exploitation. It prompts an inquiry into which version of humanity is actually advancing amidst these atrocities. The prevailing notion of progress is often tied to a colonizing and modern perspective that tends to prioritize a singular civilization, typically Western, despite the coexistence of multiple civilizations. As articulated in the quote, "Put simply, planetary health is the health of human civilization and the state of the natural systems on which it depends" (16), this perspective underscores the interconnectedness between human civilization and the natural world, highlighting the need for a more holistic understanding of progress and development.
The notion of visionary healers does not pertain to the humanity of backward and irrational peoples but rather to rational humanity with visionaries originating from the global North. For instance, Tony McMichael, as highlighted in the book "Planetary Overload" over two decades ago, foresaw and addressed numerous issues that are currently challenging the world.
The prior decolonial interpretation of the report does not necessitate its complete dismissal. The issues highlighted by the Commission require resolution, and it is essential to assess the efforts made towards this end, as suggested by the Commission, with the aid of quantitative indicators. However, it is crucial to utilize these indicators while acknowledging their diverse implications.
Two examples from the report illustrate the situation. Between 1990 and 2012, the percentage of stunted children decreased from 50% to 30%, marking a significant relative improvement. However, in absolute terms, this reduction equated to an increase of 14 million children, a figure surpassing the total population of 7 European Union member states in 2011. In 2012, a total of 58 million children, primarily from the global South, were stunted, a number only exceeded by the population of 4 European Union member states in 2011. Therefore, both the absolute and relative versions of the numerical indicator convey distinct narratives that necessitate critical and integrated analysis. In the global South, the presence of millions of additional stunted children signifies no progress, especially when wealth concentration in the global North persists. Furthermore, relative indicators promote a discourse of hope, suggesting the potential for limitless "progress" and downplaying increasingly smaller proportional damages.
The reduction in the percentage of individuals living in extreme poverty over the past two centuries signifies a significant advancement in the well-being of those transitioning out of extreme poverty. However, the delineation of extreme poverty at USD$1.9/day raises questions about individuals surviving on USD$2/day, who are not classified as being in extreme poverty. This prompts an inquiry into the criteria used to determine that living on USD$2/day (or even on USD$50/day, amidst the constant struggle to meet artificially created consumer demands) does not constitute extreme poverty. By examining these thresholds in conjunction with the underlying distribution, a comprehensive comparison of all individuals within the population can be achieved. Merely highlighting reductions in the proportion or count of individuals falling into unfavorable categories may obscure the fact that changes are occurring in ranges significantly distant from thresholds that decision-makers in the global North would deem acceptable for themselves.
Thresholds play a crucial role in delineating the points beyond which damages become irreversible, as highlighted in the statement, "Action has to be taken before irreversible changes in key Earth systems occur, which will require decision-making under uncertainty about the critical thresholds or rates of deterioration of these systems." This underscores the necessity of proactive measures to avert catastrophic outcomes. While thresholds serve as a warning mechanism for potential disasters, they also serve as a tool to heighten awareness and instigate transformative actions. Nevertheless, there is a caveat to this approach, as it may inadvertently lead to the establishment of policies that merely aim to prevent irreversible changes without fostering the overall flourishing of multiple species.
Policies establishing acceptable minimums reflect a crisis that often results in barely meeting or not meeting these minimum standards. This crisis, when persistent, transitions from being a mere occurrence to becoming the explanation itself. Consequently, the previous level of causality that maintained the status quo is lost. This phenomenon is clearly illustrated in the report through its fragmented descriptions of the threats to Planetary Health. For instance, it portrays changes in land use as a human action impacting the "environment" and health negatively, without delving into the underlying causes. From the perspective of One Health of Peripheries, the core issue lies in the exploitation of land leading to the forced displacement of millions of people and animals, a decline in biodiversity, and exacerbation of the climate crisis.
The report highlights various factors contributing to health deterioration, a point with which we concur. However, our critique centers on the oversight of prior causal layers. Additionally, we align with the report on several fronts: the limitations of GDP as a progress metric, the insufficiency of technological advancements in curbing environmental impact due to potential consumption stimulation (rebound effect), and the imperative need for governance reforms. While we largely agree with the report's key messages and conclusions, our dissent stems from a decolonial perspective, challenging the interpretation of these messages and the underlying premises of the conclusions. From our analysis, the report's recommendations appear geared towards maintaining the existing status quo detrimental to the planet's health.
The report advocates for the maintenance of price stability and the effective management of malnutrition as strategies to combat hunger, yet it does not explicitly address the concepts of food sovereignty and security. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring the stability of food prices and safeguarding vulnerable populations from the fluctuations that may arise, while also highlighting the need to address malnutrition as a critical issue.
In the context of addressing hunger, the suggestion is to enhance the access of impoverished individuals to technology as a means of diminishing inequalities, without delving into the regulation of technology or technological standards. This approach inadvertently aids technology market oligopolies in expanding their customer base. As stated in the research, "If these modern technologies are to effectively contribute to the alleviation of global hunger, they must prioritize environmental protection and be readily available to farmers in low-income regions; otherwise, disparities will endure and potentially worsen" (16).
In contemporary colonial discourse, the preservation of epistemological hegemony is deemed crucial. Those who do not actively wield this hegemony are required to endorse and uphold it in order to reap its advantages: "However, for these grassroots movements to truly make a difference and alter the course of global health, they must possess coherence, structure, and alignment with the scientific and healthcare sectors" (16).
Individuals who engage in physical activity possess a voice that can wield significant influence, particularly when bolstered by the backing of those who lack a platform for expression. As articulated by the authors, the scientific and health sectors stand to achieve greater success in swaying policymakers who are under pressure to enact reforms when they receive support from the broader civil society. This collaborative effort underscores the importance of unity and collective action in effecting meaningful change within decision-making circles.
During the medical care cost crisis, Private Medicine was unequivocal in its aim to uphold its dominance and prevent State Medicine from involvement. This stance is evident in the Rockefeller Commission's commitment to a top-down approach, where those with economic and scientific capital assert their authority to determine relevance. As highlighted in the previous section, research funders and the academic community play a pivotal role in shaping the questions posed by scientists and guiding the development of innovative approaches to address significant knowledge gaps, enhance scientific awareness, and focus on academic pursuits.
The prevailing modern logic, established over centuries, asserts that, given current trajectories and even under optimistic scenarios, the elimination of poverty (defined as an income of USD$5/day per person) would require 200 years, or 100 years if the poverty line is set at USD$1.25/day. Consequently, little can be anticipated from contemporary trends. Addressing the crisis of civilization necessitates tackling the initial challenge pinpointed in the report: "conceptual and empathy failures (imagination challenges)."
The previous decolonial analysis of the report, which highlights its potentials, limitations, and challenges, urges us in the global South to delve into deeper causal layers and reshape the existing nexus between nature, health, and society. One critical possibility, rather than just an alternative, is the concept of the "ecology of knowledge" as advocated by Santos, situated within what he terms "epistemologies of the South." This notion underscores the demand from the global South for "novel processes of knowledge production, the appreciation of both scientific and non-scientific valid knowledge, and the cultivation of fresh relationships among diverse forms of knowledge, grounded in the experiences of classes and social groups that have endured systematic destruction, oppression, and discrimination due to capitalism, colonialism, and the normalization of inequality" (33).
Santos argues that hegemonic modern Western thought has historically marginalized non-Western forms of thought, characterizing this treatment as abyssal. This abyssal perspective creates visible and invisible distinctions that divide social reality into two distinct universes: one inhabited by modern Western societies and the other by colonial societies. Within the realm of modern knowledge, a visible line separates science from philosophy and theology, with science being deemed superior based on scientific criteria rather than reason or faith. An invisible line further separates these forms of knowledge from indigenous, popular, and other types of knowledge, effectively rendering the universe beyond the line as non-existent and irrelevant. This exclusion is a result of the accepted conception of inclusion defining its Other. In colonial societies, appropriation and violence perpetuate the segregation of multispecies collectives, including subjects, nature, bodies, and knowledge, leading to the establishment of permanent hierarchies.
Western modernity operates by excluding any realities that fall outside its established boundaries. Anything that cannot be neatly categorized as true or false, legal or illegal, is relegated to what can be described as colonial zones. These abyssal lines, as described by Santos (33), are fundamental to shaping the political and cultural dynamics between the West and the rest of the world within the modern global system. Consequently, the systematic disqualification of non-modern forms of knowledge on a global scale perpetuates social and cognitive injustices.
In integrating these components into the discourse surrounding Planetary Health and One Health as potential frameworks for comprehending and reshaping the existing dynamic between nature, health, and society, the concept of the ecology of knowledge or post-abyssal thinking prompts us to contemplate and inquire, among various considerations: in light of the historical roles of appropriation and violence in shaping colonial societies, how can we presently approach these benevolent initiatives with a focus on equality and justice rather than adherence to modernization mandates? What steps can be taken to progress towards a genuine post-abyssal mode of thinking?
Post-abyssal thinking adopts a perspective that delves into the unexplored realms beyond the conventional boundaries, acknowledging that these territories have long been disregarded or deemed inconceivable within the context of Western modernity. This approach involves drawing insights from the epistemologies prevalent in the Global South, which challenge the dominance of a singular scientific worldview and instead emphasize the diversity of knowledge systems. By positioning science as just one component within a spectrum of varied knowledge frameworks, post-abyssal thinking paves the way for the emergence of alternative scientific paradigms that can actively support marginalized communities and diverse species in their struggles to break free from the margins of society.
What is at stake is not merely an abstract cognitive justice, but rather the ecology of knowledge which emphasizes the tangible impacts of various forms of knowledge (33). Within this framework, knowledge hierarchies are contingent on context and lack universality. The ecology of knowledge calls for the creation of an "alternative of alternatives" rooted in ongoing epistemological vigilance and cross-cultural communication. This alternative is crucial to prevent approaches like Planetary Health or One Health from perpetuating abyssal thinking or inadvertently reinforcing colonial legacies. By embracing the ecology of knowledge, we can challenge marginalizing systems that perpetuate peripheries, unjust epidemiological patterns, and the exclusive validation of health epistemologies originating from the global North.
There exist health-promoting indigenous lifestyles that can serve as a model for promoting health in non-indigenous settings. However, the transfer of indigenous knowledge and practices to non-indigenous contexts results in the emergence of different approaches. Failing to acknowledge this shift can inadvertently perpetuate colonial tendencies that hinder efforts towards health promotion. The process of globalization implicates all communities in sustaining colonial structures to some extent. Consequently, any resistance to decolonization also contains elements of colonialism, however subtle. In light of this reality, a key objective in advancing the decolonial agenda of One Health in peripheral regions involves dismantling the marginalizing mechanisms that underlie health disparities experienced by various species. These critical issues are the focal point of this section.
In the context of One Health of Peripheries, the peripheries represent a symbolic category reflected in epidemiologic profiles (17). The global South, situated within this category, is a diverse geopolitical periphery. Its health aspect has been conceptualized and reshaped by Latin American Social Medicine since the 1970s, evolving into Critical Epidemiology, Collective Health, and South-South International Health. On a larger scale, this periphery, the global South, has advocated for perspectives and ways of life that are now commonly described as sustainable, health-conscious, and embodiments of well-being in contemporary discourse (34).
Indigenous worldviews and lifestyles, along with the initiatives derived from them to challenge the institutional structures of modernity, serve as a foundation for promoting One Health of Peripheries. For instance, the concept of good living (buen vivir) drawn from Aimará suma qamaña and Quechua sumak kawsay, enshrined in the constitutions of Bolivia and Ecuador, exemplifies this approach. While a detailed exploration of good living is beyond the scope of this manuscript, it is crucial to highlight its holistic nature, emphasizing self-care within a diverse collective where local communities are not marginalized but central. Conversely, Planetary Health perpetuates the control of natural systems and perpetuates the subordination of the global South. This framework restricts aspirations to solely benefit from epistemological, scientific, and technological advancements originating in the global North.
In institutional terms, the concept of good living has undergone significant transformation. Ecuador and Bolivia enshrined this idea in their constitutions in 2008 and 2009, respectively, symbolically recognizing indigenous peoples. However, Solón argues that in reality, the acknowledged rights to nature and Mother Earth took a backseat to extractivist interests. The discourse of good living started to coexist with income redistribution policies that favored capitalist interests, facilitated the rise of oligopolies, and fostered alliances with certain indigenous groups. Interestingly, even under indigenous leadership, there was a shift towards accepting modernization, a departure from centuries of rejection, leading to a decrease in the self-identification of indigenous people from 62% to 41% between 1990 and 2013. This institutionalization of good living demonstrates that despite the stark differences between projects rooted in decolonial and colonial ideologies, discrepancies between rhetoric and actions impact both ends of the spectrum. The blending of these opposing poles gives rise to a complex middle ground within the spectrum.
The promotion of One Health of Peripheries needs to acknowledge and anticipate the gap between discourses and practices, as well as the interplay between decolonial and colonial influences. It is crucial to delve into the historical-social processes that shape social organization levels and their corresponding epidemiological profiles. According to Samaja (35), individuals occupy the lower social organization level, while the world-system resides in the upper level, with various intermediary levels in between (such as family, community, political-administrative divisions, and institutions). The upper levels maintain their colonial structure by regulating the lower levels, yet these lower levels can instigate partial changes in the upper ones (35). The colonial structure is perpetuated through this regulation, but decolonial practices at lower levels can bring about partial changes. This dynamic, known as social determination, underpins collective health epistemology and extends to the multispecies dimensions of One Health of Peripheries (17). The promotion of One Health of Peripheries must navigate this dialectical movement, recognizing that partial decolonial changes also entail partial reproduction of coloniality. This contradiction between decolonial and colonial forces impacts One Health of Peripheries, necessitating proposals for promotion that account for this tension to align discourses with material realities effectively.
The practices enacted from a specific standpoint exhibit both decolonial and colonial characteristics rather than being exclusively decolonial or colonial. Consequently, indigenous concepts of good living and neoliberal ideologies of good living diverge in their inclination and degree of alignment with the decolonial and colonial spectrums. Likewise, community health education initiatives share similarities with colonial higher education and Preventive Medicine in their colonial roots, with the extent of disparity contingent on their proximity to the opposing ends of the spectrum.
The conditions that enable peripheral cartography also shape the decolonial advancement of One Health in peripheral regions. Advocating for this advancement both within and outside of the cartography challenges the traditional center-periphery divide through social movements driven by determination. This approach represents a utopian and dialectical form of promotion that, while focusing on peripheries, paradoxically strengthens the existing distinction and gives rise to new peripheral areas. It embodies a glocal movement that navigates between localization and globalization.
The rationale behind incorporating "One" into "Health of Peripheries" may not be immediately apparent. It could be argued that "Planetary Health of Peripheries" better captures the interconnectedness between the global (planetary) and the local (peripheries), emphasizing a glocal movement. While One Health and Planetary Health both advocate for universal health, the former, in practice, perpetuates the myth of modernity. Notably, One World One Health™, a registered trademark, originated from a conference held by the Wildlife Conservation Society at Rockefeller University in 2004. Despite the seemingly isolated nature of the event, it is crucial to acknowledge the colonial context. For instance, during the establishment of Rockefeller institutions, the Bronx Zoo exhibited Ota Benga, a young Mbuti from what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Wildlife Conservation Society only issued a public apology in 2020 for its role in the exhibition and the problematic views of its founders, Madison Grant and Henry Fairfield Osborn, who were associated with the American Eugenics Society and supported defendants in the Nuremberg trials. Regrettably, the apology fell short of fully addressing the colonial legacy of exhibiting both human and nonhuman animals. The failure to recognize the harm in past practices, such as the exhibition of Ota Benga, raises concerns about the organization's commitment to ethical wildlife conservation. It is hoped that such practices will be abolished sooner rather than later, without the need for another century to pass.
In considering the colonial origins of One Health, which extend beyond our previous overview (40), a decolonial approach rooted in the One Health framework may initially appear paradoxical. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that One Health from the Peripheries offers alternative interpretations of the concept (17) and navigates contradictions by emphasizing social context and the diversity of knowledge systems. By decolonizing One Health, Latin American health movements gain additional perspectives, enhancing their capacity for resistance against colonial legacies and bolstering their resilience.
In the realm of One Health, the concept of health transcends the human sphere and encompasses three interconnected domains: human health, animal health, and environmental health (41). This stands in contrast to the perspective of Planetary Health, where health is primarily viewed through the lens of human well-being and natural systems are valued for their role as determinants of health (16). Animals are considered instrumental in Planetary Health to the extent that they contribute to maintaining natural systems that benefit human health. In One Health frameworks, animals are also seen as instrumental to human health, yet they are recognized as more than mere tools for human well-being (41). Here, animals are acknowledged as carriers of health, and the health of animals plays a crucial role in a broader understanding of health that extends beyond the human species.
Biomedicine acknowledges the presence of physiopathological processes in animals, just as epidemiology recognizes the transmission dynamics between animals and between animals and humans. Humans, like any other species, share both similarities and differences in individual and population biological processes related to health and disease when compared to other species.
The attribution of lower moral status to nonhuman animals solely due to their non-membership in the human species, known as speciesism, is as arbitrary as devaluing certain humans based on their race or gender, a phenomenon referred to as racism and sexism (42). Arguments attempting to rationalize the inferior status of animals often hinge on the premise of humans possessing greater cognitive capacities.
Many animals exhibit cognitive abilities that surpass severely disabled humans, prompting arguments for moral differentiation where not all humans are considered equally valuable, with some deemed less valuable than many animals (42). The moral justifications for entirely segregating humans from other animals based on varying cognitive capacities are also contentious, exposing what Agamben terms the anthropological machine - a mechanism of inclusion and exclusion designed to distinguish humans from other animals. This apparatus, as it is continually refined in efforts to resolve inconsistencies, increasingly exposes its arbitrary and contradictory nature (43).
The distinction between humans and nonhumans serves as a marginalizing tool for domination, representing a fundamental dichotomy of modernity. This dichotomy perpetuates dehumanization and animalization, with the degree of marginalization increasing as beings move further away from the Western heterosexual male norm. This epistemic violence not only marginalizes humans but also denies the subjectivity of other animals, portraying animality as synonymous with characteristics such as being black, indigenous, female, or non-heterosexual. This violence extends beyond just humans, affecting victims of multiple species. Animals are subjected to animalization when they are placed within the framework of colonial domination. Furthermore, the animalizing apparatus is reinforced through colonial health practices, which not only justify domination but also present it as a benevolent endeavor.
In his examination of 19th-century slave farms in Cuba, Camacho discusses how Chateusalins, in his Vademecum of Cuban landowners, advised masters of female slaves to refrain from harsh treatment, provide improved food, and offer indulgences and concessions to encourage them to care for their offspring (45). Chateusalins sought to persuade the masters by asserting that farms characterized by kindness, sweetness, and attentiveness towards the enslaved population witnessed contented individuals, as evidenced by their joyful demeanor and singing. He further supported his argument by referencing profit and loss records, noting that farms where blacks were treated well experienced an increase in productivity ranging from 4.5% to 5.5%, contrasting with the anticipated 5.5% loss typically associated with such operations (45).
The relationship between production and health was examined through an epidemiological-zootechnical perspective aimed at controlling slaves. This approach involved segregating facilities, categorizing populations based on productivity and reproductive factors, monitoring morbidity and mortality rates, preventing the spread of diseases, implementing reproductive selection for genetic enhancement, and implementing practices such as hygiene, nutrition, and socialization to minimize losses in biological capital. Detailed analyses of these practices can be found in the works of Smithers and Camacho (45,46).
The discourse underlying this approach, emphasizing statistics, efficiency, and evidence, primarily aimed at enhancing productivity and increasing the value of dehumanized commodities. Slaves were viewed as subjects of knowledge and professional practices such as medicine, statistics, and anthropology, generating "truths" crucial for the plantation's political and economic structure. Despite the facade of truth and rationality, prejudice and contradictions were prevalent. For instance, Camacho's examination of Dumont's medical anthropology revealed descriptions portraying the black race as disease-prone and inherently lazy, polygamous, and fetishistic according to anthropological accounts. While there were calls for kindness and attention to slaves' "human" needs, these conflicted with the prevailing animalization. Concerns for slave health were primarily driven by the need to maintain their bodies' profitability and prevent disease transmission to masters, whose health held intrinsic value. The coexistence of epidemiology and zootechnics with torture practices aimed at ensuring docility underscored the disregard for slaves' well-being, viewing them merely as tools for productivity and reproduction. State-sanctioned advertisements for slaves with specific phenotypic traits and government-approved drugs against slave diseases further normalized and justified animalization through institutional, media, and epistemic authorities. Essentially, the discourse surrounding slaves' epidemiology and zootechnics mirrors contemporary discussions in animal production epidemiology and animal science. Similarly, narratives of benevolence within animal welfare science serve to legitimize livestock exploitation and enhance the value of living commodities. In both contexts, oppressive dynamics are normalized, with improved productivity and sanitary standards serving as misleading indicators of well-being enhancements.
By dismantling marginalizing systems and fostering multispecies communities where the Other is not objectified but rather their subjectivity is nurtured and honored, the potential for advancement shifts from mere degrees within a confined peripheral realm to distinct kinds. Consequently, the eradication of slavery represents a significant leap in advancement, enabling lifestyles—processes, capabilities, and health conditions—that were previously unattainable under the constraints of slavery's peripheral health practices. Given that health is inherently influenced by subjective value judgments, it is imperative to critically examine and challenge these judgments to dismantle the boundaries that hinder the advancement of a holistic approach to health in marginalized communities. The Ottawa Charter outlined five key strategies for health promotion: 1. establishing healthy public policies; 2. creating supportive environments; 3. empowering community initiatives; 4. enhancing personal skills; and 5. reorienting health services. By redefining and supplementing these strategies with two additional ones, namely: 1. deconstructing marginalizing systems; and 2. enriching the knowledge ecology, we can further advance the concept of holistic health in marginalized communities. While the deconstruction of marginalizing systems intersects with the other strategies, its explicit acknowledgment reinforces its significance. These seven strategies collectively address the Lancet Commission on Planetary Health's primary challenge of "conceptual and empathy failures (imagination challenges)," particularly challenging within the context of colonialism. However, they also contribute to a decolonial shift that necessitates imagination and empathy across species, potentially transitioning from the Capitalocene to the Chthulocene as discussed by Haraway in her exploration of the Anthropocene, Capitalocene, and Chthulocene.
Despite the challenges in advancing the One Health approach in peripheral regions, there exist precedents for each of its seven key actions. The first action involves dismantling marginalization from a health standpoint and draws support from various disciplines such as more-than-human sociology, anthropology, biopolitics, critical studies, social work, theories of justice, and moral philosophy. The second action emphasizes the importance of incorporating indigenous and non-indigenous epistemologies from the global South, recognizing the existence of indigenous sustainable practices and highlighting the colonial nature of animalization. Public policies supporting living cities, biodiversity, and indigenous territories already exist, albeit needing further reinforcement. The third and fourth actions can be strengthened by integrating more-than-human labor theories, food sovereignty, sustainable agriculture, disaster response, and degrowth perspectives. Participatory policies, community practices, and environmental activism in the global South provide a practical foundation for the fifth action, focusing on multispecies intersectionality. The capabilities approach, as articulated by Nussbaum, offers a robust theoretical framework for the sixth action, extending considerations of justice to peripheral subjects of different species. Precedents for the seventh action can be found in initiatives like Brazil's Unified Health System, which includes units dedicated to zoonotic surveillance and animal welfare. While these precedents require reassessment and inclusive participation to avoid serving individual interests, they have nonetheless contributed to fracturing peripheries and challenging marginalization at a local level.
Coloniality persists beyond the era of colonialism, with the notion of modernity lying at the core of the current crisis of civilization. Philanthropy, while providing tangible benefits that enhance the lives of the impoverished, often serves to justify the immense wealth amassed by a select few philanthropists alongside the widespread deprivation experienced by billions. In 2019, the wealth controlled by a mere 0.000028% of the population exceeded that of 59.7%. Within the realm of health, philanthropy has been utilized as a tool to perpetuate colonial epistemology and advance the interests of the global North, determining the definition of health, the approach to addressing health issues, and the prescribed lifestyle choices to prevent them. The Rockefeller Foundation stands as a prominent example of philanthrocapitalism, exerting influence over Latin American health policies, education, and research. A recent initiative by the Foundation, known as Planetary Health, reflects a narrative shaped by the perspectives of the global North.
The ecology of knowledge, with its intercultural translation, serves as a response from the global South aimed at rectifying the impacts of coloniality. This concept encompasses indigenous and popular knowledge, Latin American health movements, and the counter-hegemonic utilization of science, while also demonstrating the potential for counter-hegemonic applications within Planetary Health and One Health frameworks. An illustrative instance of this approach is the One Health of Peripheries, which not only represents a reconfiguration of One Health and Latin American health movements but also vehemently opposes the animalization of colonial spaces that oppress both animals and peripheral human groups. Expanding on the Ottawa Charter proposal, the decolonial promotion of One Health of Peripheries involves seven key actions: deconstructing marginalization apparatuses, enriching the ecology of knowledge, establishing healthy public policies, creating supportive environments, empowering community actions, enhancing more-than-human individual capabilities, and reorienting health services.
