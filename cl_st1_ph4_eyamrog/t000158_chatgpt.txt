Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning biosafety measures, prevention, and control among healthcare professionals, specifically dental care providers, amidst the ongoing pandemic.
Methods: An online questionnaire comprising 42 questions was distributed to dental professionals (CDs) practicing in Brazil through social media platforms and also sent to the 27 Regional Councils of Dentistry in the country via email. Data collection took place between June 26 and July 2, 2020.
Results: A total of 751 dental professionals responded to the questionnaire. Among them, 54.9% had received training in preventing and controlling the spread of the virus, with scientific articles being the primary source of information for 44.5% of respondents. In terms of biosafety in dental care, 95.9% claimed to be familiar with ANVISA's regulations on the matter. However, there was a discrepancy between knowledge and actual adherence to recommended practices. The study found a significant association between professional training and adherence to biosafety protocols, indicating that those who had received training exhibited better knowledge and compliance with recommended practices.
Conclusion: While Brazilian healthcare professionals demonstrate a solid understanding of biosafety measures aimed at preventing COVID-19, there remains a notable gap in their adherence to fundamental attitudes and recommended practices.
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus outbreak emerged in Wuhan, located in the Hubei Province of China, swiftly spreading to an additional 24 countries. By January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially designated the virus as SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), pinpointing it as the causative agent of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019). As cases surged exponentially, the WHO escalated the situation to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, culminating in the formal declaration of a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Brazil reported its first case of the disease on February 26, 2020, with community transmission confirmed on March 20, 2020.
The novel coronavirus has the potential to induce severe respiratory illness, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and individuals with underlying chronic conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases. Despite its genetic similarities to previous strains, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits heightened transmissibility owing to its increased infectivity. Nevertheless, the fatality rate associated with this virus is relatively low, with global estimates hovering around 3.7% and 3.3% in Brazil. The worldwide mortality rate stands at approximately 9.6 cases per 100,000 individuals, while in Brazil, it escalates to 48.6 per 100,000 inhabitants, positioning the country as the second highest in confirmed cases (3,057,470) and deaths (101,752).
The primary mode of COVID-19 transmission involves direct contact with infected droplets from coughing or sneezing, as well as contact with the oral, nasal, and ocular mucosa of infected individuals. Dentists, due to their proximity to patients' faces and frequent exposure to saliva, blood, and other bodily fluids during clinical procedures, face a heightened risk of infection. Dentistry ranks as the top occupational category for risk of transmission during the pandemic.
Healthcare workers play a crucial role in pandemic control, yet they are also the most vulnerable to infection. Therefore, it is imperative to implement measures aimed at reducing the infection rate and spread among this group. This begins with identifying the risk factors that make healthcare workers more susceptible to contracting the virus, followed by taking appropriate actions to mitigate these risks.
At the onset of the pandemic, the Federal Council of Dentistry (CFO) recommended to the Ministry of Health (MS) the suspension of non-urgent dental services within the public health system. Private dental practices were advised to strictly adhere to stringent biosafety protocols, emphasizing thorough cleaning and disinfection of instruments, equipment, and surfaces. Additional measures were suggested to mitigate the risk of infection among dental health personnel.
On March 31, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), the Brazilian Association of Dentistry (ABO), and the Brazilian Association of Intensive Care Medicine (AMIB) jointly released a guideline (GVIMS/GGTES/ANVISA Nº 04/2020 Technical Note) outlining prevention and control measures for clinical procedures involving suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infected patients in clinics and hospitals. This document also categorizes emergency and urgent dental procedures and offers oral hygiene protocols specifically tailored for patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs).
Dentists face a heightened risk of contracting the novel coronavirus and potentially acting as asymptomatic carriers, underscoring the importance of adhering to stringent biosafety protocols. The comprehension of a disease significantly shapes healthcare professionals' conduct, with erroneous practices amplifying the likelihood of infection. Consequently, this research endeavors to evaluate dentists' proficiency in biosafety protocols, as well as the preventative measures implemented to curb the spread of the new coronavirus pandemic and their implications on routine clinical procedures.
This study employed a cross-sectional survey design, rendering ethics approval unnecessary. In accordance with Resolution 510/2016 of the National Health Council, such surveys gather participants' opinions on a particular subject at a specific moment using defined methodologies, with participant anonymity maintained throughout the process.
Data for this study was collected through an online questionnaire hosted on Google Forms (https://forms.gle/jg4VHtUFzGysgJ1UA). Prior to distribution, the questionnaire underwent validation by two dentists and a sanitarian to guarantee the accurate comprehension of its contents. The data collection period spanned from June 26 to July 2, 2020.
A sample size calculation was conducted to determine a representative sample of the country's registered dentists, utilizing the formula n = [EDFF*Np(1-p)]/ [(d2/Z21-α/2*(N-1)+p*(1-p)], with parameters set at a 50% prevalence of the outcome, a 99% confidence interval, a 5% absolute error, and a population size of 337,997 dentists as of June 2020. The calculated sample size of 663 individuals was then increased by 13% to accommodate potential losses, resulting in a final sample size of 750 dentists.
The online search link was disseminated to dentists via various social networks such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Telegram, as well as being forwarded to the 27 Regional Councils of Dentistry (CROs) with a request to distribute the link among their registered dentists. Among the CROs contacted, four responded to our outreach, with two hailing from the Northeast region, one from the North, and one from the Midwest. Participants were assured of their anonymity and informed that their involvement in the study was entirely voluntary.
The questionnaire comprised 42 items categorized into three sections. The initial section encompassed 8 items focusing on respondents' characteristics, including region of residence, years since graduation, highest level of education/degree attained, and current employment status. The second section, consisting of 11 items, delved into respondents' knowledge of biosafety recommendations for preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, with response options of "agree" and "disagree." The final section, comprising 23 items, explored biosafety actions and measures adopted during the pandemic, also with "agree" and "disagree" responses. Each correctly answered item was assigned a score of 1, while incorrect responses received a score of 0. Descriptive analysis was conducted to present the number and percentage of variables under study. Furthermore, a knowledge score and actions and measures score were computed by summing the scores of answered questions. Group mean scores were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis Test, with a significance level set at 5%. Data analysis was carried out using Stata software version 14.0.
A total of 751 dentists participated in the survey, with a majority being female (70.8%), aged between 25 and 34 years (58.6%), having graduated within the last 5 years (57.8%), and hailing from the Northeast region (79.9%). The highest education level attained by most respondents was a DDS degree (38.3%), with a significant portion employed in the public sector (26.0%) and earning a monthly income ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 reals (49.5%). A majority of dentists reported undergoing training in prevention and control measures against the novel coronavirus (54.9%), with a significant proportion doing so voluntarily (58.7%). Scientific articles emerged as the primary source of information regarding strategies to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus (refer to Table 1).
The vast majority of dentists (95.9%) indicated their awareness of ANVISA's biosafety protocols for dental practice. Nevertheless, a notable portion of respondents (14.5%) deemed the provision of alcohol gel and the requirement of mask usage in waiting rooms as excessive measures. Furthermore, 17.6% admitted uncertainty regarding the proper method for removing personal protective equipment, while 43.9% expressed the opinion that symptomatic patients should not undergo any form of dental treatment. Interestingly, 71.0% of participants felt adequately equipped to deliver educational and preventive initiatives concerning the novel coronavirus, as outlined in Table 2.
Some respondents failed to adhere to the biosafety protocols and guidelines for dental practice as recommended by health authorities. A significant portion, over half of the respondents, admitted to not utilizing rubber dam isolation during procedures involving high-speed motors. Furthermore, 41.4% neglected to request patients to rinse with hydrogen peroxide before treatment, 40.5% did not prioritize four-handed work with an assistant, and 34.4% did not adhere to the recommended procedure for saliva aspiration. Additionally, 46.6% did not opt for absorbable sutures when feasible, and 44.2% did not utilize extraoral mouth x-rays when appropriate. Alarmingly, 19.0% of respondents provided non-emergency dental treatment during the pandemic, while 61.3% engaged in educational activities related to COVID-19 prevention (refer to Table 3).
The average biosafety knowledge score among dentists was 9.41 (± SD = 1.28), ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 11 correct answers, with 50% of the participants scoring ≥10 (median = 10.0). A notable disparity was observed concerning employment type and participation in training programs on prevention and control measures. Dentists in alternative employment roles and public servants exhibited superior scores compared to other categories (p = 0.004). Furthermore, those who underwent training sessions achieved higher scores (p <0.001) as indicated in Table 4.
The mean score for biosafety measures concerning the prevention and control of the new coronavirus was 15.22 (±SD = 3.31), with a range from 4 to 20 and a median of 15.0. Significantly varied scores were evident across all assessed groups. Notably, higher scores were recorded for males (median = 16.0; p = 0.040), individuals aged 45 years or older (median = 18.0; p <0.001), those with over 10 years since graduation (median = 17.0; p <0.001), public servants and individuals categorized as "other" in terms of employment (median = 16 and 17.0, respectively; p <0.001), respondents with a postdoctoral fellowship as their highest educational attainment (median = 18.5; p <0.001), those with a monthly income exceeding R$ 5,000.00 (median = 17.0; p <0.001), and participants who had undergone training on COVID prevention and control measures (median = 16.0; p <0.001) (Table 5).
Based on the gathered data, the majority of Brazilian dentists actively sought current information regarding national biosafety standards for the novel coronavirus, engaging in training sessions and consulting scientific articles as primary sources of information. These proactive measures underscore the global urgency and unparalleled nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the heightened concern surrounding infection risks during the delivery of dental services. This heightened awareness has driven a concerted effort among dental professionals to seek out and adhere to preventive guidelines.
According to Ghai et al. (2020), understanding preventive measures for the novel coronavirus is crucial for dentists to implement appropriate actions in their practice. Despite the abundance of information on the pandemic, caution is necessary to ensure the reliability and authenticity of the sources to prevent the dissemination of misinformation. Therefore, it is advisable for workers to adhere to official guidelines.
Despite the widespread interest in information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, many dentists are neglecting essential steps to reduce the overall risk of contracting or transmitting the infection. These steps include the use of rubber dam isolation, adequate saliva aspiration, and the use of hydrogen peroxide-based mouthwash prior to treatment. These practices are aimed at minimizing the production of infected spills and aerosols, ultimately decreasing the risk of infection. Therefore, it is crucial that these practices are meticulously followed by dental professionals.
A significant number of respondents expressed the belief that symptomatic patients should not be provided with any form of treatment, contrary to the guidelines set forth by official healthcare bodies which stipulate that all emergency cases should be promptly addressed with the recommended care. A study carried out in a dental emergency department in Beijing highlighted a surge in dental and oral infections following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the importance of dentists exercising caution in their selection and timing of care, even for symptomatic respiratory patients, to prevent exacerbation of dental conditions and mitigate potential risks for the patient.
This study delves into the educational responsibilities of dentists in preventing COVID. While a majority of participants expressed confidence in their capacity to educate the public, 61.3% were not actively disseminating specific information. This reluctance may stem from uncertainty regarding their role as health advocates within the dental setting, a domain that extends beyond mere clinical duties. De Stefani et al. (2020) emphasize the pivotal role of all healthcare professionals in offering precise guidance, underscoring the significance of practices like social distancing to curb the virus's transmission.
Dentists within the public network and those who had undergone a training course exhibited a greater understanding of biosafety in dental care. Furthermore, elevated levels of biosafety actions and measures were linked to male dentists, individuals aged 45 and above, those with over a decade since graduation, possessing a post-doctoral degree, and earning a monthly income exceeding R$ 5,000.00. These findings indicate that professional experience coupled with higher levels of education positively influences the adoption of preventive measures against COVID-19. Moreover, the superior scores among public servants likely stem from the backing provided by national health authorities and professional councils to dentists within the public health system since the onset of the pandemic and the suspension of elective treatments. This support has facilitated increased time for training courses, allowed for more patient interaction and intervals between appointments, and ensured a fixed salary, all of which contribute to adherence to recommended biosafety protocols.
The interruption of elective treatments poses a significant financial challenge for private dentists. This situation goes beyond mere clinical biosafety and social indifference, prompting ethical and moral considerations. It is imperative for government regulations to be sustainable in the long run, with the primary goal of safeguarding private dentists. This entails enabling them to carry out their work with dignity and safety, while also preventing potential economic crises.
Given the elevated susceptibility to infection posed by COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses in the context of dental care, the implementation of stringent biosafety protocols is imperative to guarantee the safe delivery of dental treatments. Looking ahead, it is crucial to formulate comprehensive strategies and initiatives aimed at upholding biosafety standards within the workplace, thereby safeguarding the well-being of both dental personnel and patients.
In response to the pandemic, adjustments in data collection methods have become necessary. An efficient approach involves utilizing online surveys, a method that, similar to other research techniques, presents both advantages and limitations but can yield credible outcomes. In this particular study, precautions were implemented to mitigate selection bias, including distributing the questionnaire to all Regional Councils of Dentistry in Brazil. Nevertheless, the study encountered a low response rate from dentists in the South and Central West regions, thereby restricting the generalizability of the findings and necessitating a cautious interpretation of the results.
The findings of this study indicate that Brazilian dentists demonstrate a satisfactory level of knowledge regarding biosafety protocols for COVID-19; nevertheless, a significant portion failed to adhere to fundamental practices and recommended guidelines. It was observed that factors such as employment status and participation in relevant courses were linked to a higher level of knowledge and proper implementation of biosafety measures. To obtain more precise outcomes, future research endeavors should involve larger sample sizes.
