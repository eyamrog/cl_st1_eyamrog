27 ABSTRACT 28 Objective: To assess the impact and correlation of socioeconomic vulnerability on 29 COVID-19 outcomes and social distancing in Brazil. Methods: The Gini Coefficient 30 (GC), the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), epidemiological data on COVID-19 epidemic 31 in Brazil, and the Social Distancing Index (SDI) were retrieved from online databases and 32 assessed for each Brazilian state. Data was statistically analyzed through non-parametric 33 tests and multiple linear regressions. Results: The mean values for the GC and SVI were 34 0.495 and 0.261, respectively. A positive statistically significant correlation between the 35 socioeconomic indicators and the three variables related to the COVID-19 outbreak was 36 found. States with very low social vulnerability presented fewer deaths per 100 thousand 37 inhabitants due to COVID-19 than states with moderate social vulnerability. SVI was a 38 predictor of accumulated cases, confirmed deaths, and social distancing in Brazilian states 39 during COVID-19. Conclusions: The COVID-19 outcomes and SDI in Brazilian states 40 are correlated to the socioeconomic condition. The pandemic impacts are more severe in 41 less favored communities. 42 Keywords: COVID-19; Health Status Disparities; Social Determinants of Health; 43 Pandemic; Economic Status. 44

45 RESUMO 46 Objetivo: Avaliar o impacto e a correlação da vulnerabilidade socioeconômica nos 47 desfechos da COVID-19 e no distanciamento social no Brasil. Materiais e Métodos: O 48 Coeficiente de Gini (CG), o Índice de Vulnerabilidade Social (IVS), dados 49 epidemiológicos sobre a epidemia da COVID-19 no Brasil e o Índice de Distanciamento 50 Social (IDS) foram obtidos a partir de bases de dados online e avaliados para cada estado 51 brasileiro. Os dados foram analisados estatisticamente através de testes não-paramétricos 52 e de regressão logística linear. Resultados: Os valores médios para o CG e IVS foram 53 0.495 e 0.261, respectivamente. Uma correlação estatística positiva foi encontrada entre 54 os indicadores socioeconômicos e as três variáveis relacionadas à epidemia de COVID- 55 19. Os estados brasileiros com menores índices de vulnerabilidade social apresentaram 56 uma quantidade menor de mortes pela COVID-19, para cada cem mil habitantes, quando 57 comparados com estados com vulnerabilidade social moderada. O IVS foi um preditor 58 para o acumulado de casos, mortes confirmadas e distanciamento social nos estados 59 brasileiros durante a pandemia da COVID-19. Conclusão: Os desfechos da COVID-19 e 60 o IDS nos estados brasileiros estão correlacionados com a condição socioeconômica. Os 61 impactos da pandemia são mais severos nas localidades mais vulneráveis. 62 Palavras-Chave: COVID-19; Disparidades nos Níveis de Saúde; Determinantes Sociais 63 de Saúde; Pandemia; Status Socioeconômico.
64 INTRODUCTION 65 Less than four months after the first confirmed case of the 2019 novel coronavirus 66 disease (COVID-19) in Brazil, the country reaches the mark of more than one million 67 accumulated cases, and over 50.000 confirmed deaths ¹. These numbers are estimated to 68 be even greater, considering the likely occurrence of underreporting as the country is 69 testing only severe cases ². During the pandemic, the country has been facing a political 70 crisis, which has been misleading the efforts to mitigate COVID-19 spread and its 71 socioeconomic impacts ³. 72 Brazil is the largest and most populous Latin-American country; its continental 73 dimension favors to diversity in socioeconomic and geographical aspects 4. Each 74 Brazilian region is different, based on social behavior, genetics, and economic 75 backgrounds raising the need for different measures and health policies to direct medical 76 resources, and to manage social issues, respecting each area’s particularities ². 77 All regions in Brazil have confirmed cases of COVID-19 ¹. There is a 78 socioeconomic disparity among regions corroborating several issues related with 79 COVID-19 pandemic such as access and understanding of information about the disease, 80 availability of diagnostic tests, health human resources, and intensive care units, besides 81 the political decisions to control the pandemic 2,3. 82 Despite statements like “COVID-19 virus does not discriminate”, made by some 83 politicians and part of the media, COVID-19 is not a socially neutral disease 5. Special 84 attention must be paid to vulnerable populations, since recent reports indicate that 85 incidence and deaths are disproportionately affecting less favored communities 6,7,8. 86 Scientific evidence and broader surveillance are in urgent need to improve response and 87 planning, such as resources allocation, to tackle health inequities in the current COVID- 88 19 pandemic 9. Thus, the present study aims to assess the impact and correlation of 89 socioeconomic vulnerability on COVID-19 outcomes and social distancing in Brazil. 90 METHODS 91 The Gini Coefficient (GC) and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) were adopted 92 as socioeconomic indicators. The values scored in these indicators for each Brazilian state 93 were retrieved from the online database of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and 94 Statistics 10 and the Institute of Applied Economic Research 11, respectively. In addition 95 to socioeconomic indicators epidemiological data on COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and 96 the Social Distancing Index (SDI) were assessed for each Brazilian state. 97 The GC is a measure of statistical dispersion used in economics intended to 98 represent the income or wealth distribution among residents of a certain area and is the 99 most used measurement of inequality. This indicator has been applied in the health field 100 to measure disparities. The GC value ranges from 0 (perfect equality, where every 101 household earns the same income) to 1.0 (perfect inequality, where households earn a 102 diverse range of incomes) 12. 103 The SVI is an index that seeks to highlight different indicatives of exclusion and 104 social vulnerability in a perspective that goes further the comprehension of poverty only 105 as insufficient monetary resources. Thus, the SVI intends to signal the access, absence, 106 or insufficiency of some “assets” in areas of the Brazilian territory, which should be 107 available to every citizen, by virtue of State action. The three sub-indices that comprise it 108 are urban infrastructure, human capital, and income and labor. Those sub-indices 109 represent three large sets of assets, whose possession or deprivation determines the 110 conditions of well-being of populations in contemporary societies. The index value ranges 111 from 0 to 1, the closer to 1, the greater the social vulnerability of a region. Values between 112 0 and 0.200, indicate very low social vulnerability; between 0.201 and 0.300 indicate low 113 social vulnerability; between 0.301 and 0.400 indicate moderate social vulnerability; 114 between 0.401 and 0.500 indicate high social vulnerability; and between 0.501 and 1 115 indicate very high social vulnerability 13. 116 Epidemiological data concerning accumulated cases and confirmed deaths (per 100 117 thousand inhabitants) due to COVID-19 in each state were collected from the Brazilian 118 government Health Ministry database, available online ¹. The data used in this research 119 comprises information from February 25, 2020 (first case recorded in Brazil) to June 20, 120 2020. 121 The SDI was created to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, since its launch, it 122 has been improved with the sole objective of providing increasingly accurate data for 123 public authorities and research institutes. To achieve the index, highly accurate 124 geolocation data was treated with a distance algorithm. Polygons from all regions of the 125 IBGE were adopted to ensure a more accurate categorization and more reliable data 14. 126 Data is available on the Inloco website (https://mapabrasileirodacovid.inloco.com.br/pt/) 127 displayed as a map and chart. SDI values are represented in percentual of social 128 distancing, ranging from 0 to 100%. 129 Data were submitted to statistical analysis, all tests were applied considering an 130 error of 5% and the confidence interval of 95%, and the analyzes were carried out using 131 SPSS software version 23.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). As the hypothesis of normal 132 distribution of data was not confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the statistical 133 analysis was performed through the application of nonparametric tests. The strength of 134 the association between distinct measures was tested with Spearman rank correlation. 135 States in different groups according with SVI categorization were compared by Kruskal- 136 Wallis test and post-hoc Dunn test. Multiple linear regressions were performed to verify 137 whether GC or SVI were predictors of accumulated cases, confirmed deaths, and social 138 distancing index in Brazilian states during COVID-19 outbreak. 139 RESULTS 140 For the period evaluated, the mean of accumulated cases and confirmed deaths per 141 100 thousand inhabitants in the Brazilian states was approximately 697 and 24, 142 respectively. The states mean SDI score was 38.77%. Regarding the socioeconomic 143 indicators, the mean values for the GC and SVI were, respectively, 0.495 and 0.261, as 144 shown in table 1. The SVI values ranged from 0.134 to 0.374, thus none of the states 145 presented high or very high social vulnerability. 146 The comparison among states with different social vulnerability indices found 147 statistically significant differences in the number of deaths. States with very low social 148 vulnerability presented fewer deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants due to COVID-19 than 149 states with moderate social vulnerability, as shown in table 2. 150 The Spearman correlation test found a positive statistically significant correlation 151 between the socioeconomic indicators and the three variables related to the COVID-19 152 outbreak in Brazil, except for the correlation between the GC and confirmed deaths (table 153 3). 154 The analysis of multiple linear regressions resulted in statistically significant 155 models where the SVI was a predictor of accumulated cases, confirmed deaths, and social 156 distancing index in Brazil during COVID-19 epidemic. Higher SVI, indicative of greater 157 social vulnerability, was associated with higher accumulated cases (β = 0.409; t=2.243; 158 p=0.034), confirmed deaths (β = 0.498; t=2.874; p=0.008), and social distancing index (β 159 = 0.544; t=3.242; p=0.003). The values that describe these relationships are shown in 160 table 4. 161 DISCUSSION 162 Health inequities are a worldwide issue 5. The COVID-19 pandemic can affect the 163 whole of society, however, its repercussions will be experienced in different ways, 164 depending on the level of equity that exists in each social reality 15. The findings of the 165 present study support this statement since areas with different socioeconomic conditions 166 are not being proportionally affected in Brazil. 167 The number of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 presented a positive correlation 168 with GC and SVI (table 3). In addition, states with moderate social vulnerability presented 169 an average of 30 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants more than states with very low 170 social vulnerability (table 2). Furthermore, greater social vulnerability was a predictor of 171 increase in deaths (table 4). These findings demonstrate the impact of socioeconomic 172 vulnerability on COVID-19 mortality. Vulnerable communities are also 173 disproportionately affected by preexisting chronic conditions. Studies carried out in 174 Brazilian populations found that in areas with more marked poverty or inequality a higher 175 prevalence of hypertension 16, diabetes 17, cancer 18, asthma 19, and multiple 176 comorbidities20 were observed, those conditions represent an increased risk for severe 177 COVID-19 health outcomes 21, 22. In addition, the availability of resources such as 178 diagnostic tests, intensive care units, and health human resources are not equally 179 distributed in the Brazilian territory ². 180 Risk communication is an integral element of any public health emergency response 181 23, however, vulnerable populations may not have the necessary language and literacy 182 skills to understand and appropriately respond to pandemic messaging 15 because low 183 health literacy is more prevalent among vulnerable populations 24. This may be associated 184 with the difficulty to control the spread of COVID-19, particularly in regions of greater 185 social vulnerability. In addition, lower sanitary standards, and the inability to maintain 186 social distancing due to the need to leave home in search of work and income increase 187 the exposure risk of people in social vulnerability. In the present study income inequality 188 and social vulnerability showed a positive correlation with the cumulative cases of 189 COVID-19 (table 3). SVI was a predictor of increased cases per 100 thousand inhabitants 190 in Brazilian states (table 4). These findings support studies that alert to health inequalities 191 during COVID-19 pandemic 5, 25. 192 Social distancing measures to control the spread of COVID-19 are likely to have 193 large effects on health and health inequalities 26. Countries worldwide have implemented 194 rigorous isolation measures in response to the pandemic. The aim of social distancing is 195 to mitigate transmission by reducing close contact, however, the measures have profound 196 socioeconomic and health consequences 26. In Brazil, according to the present 197 investigation, the SDI is correlated to the socioeconomic status, as shown in table 3. In 198 addition, greater social vulnerability was predictor of increased SDI in Brazilian states. 199 Since socioeconomic disparities are an aggravating factor in the course of the health 200 crisis, it is expected that, in response to higher rates of cases and deaths, as shown by the 201 findings of the present study, more stricter measures of social distancing are implemented 202 in more vulnerable areas. 203 Social distancing has led to a reduced workforce in all economic sectors and has 204 caused job losses, resulting in income losses for workers unable to work and increased 205 long-term unemployment if companies fail 26, 27. Isolation measures should be 206 thoughtfully planned and executed, policymakers must consider its broader effects on 207 health and health equity, otherwise, the decrease in income will exacerbate the pre- 208 existing socioeconomic disparities, deepening the problems of local health inequity in 209 epidemic areas 9, 28. 210 Besides the immediate health effects for the vulnerable populations, the pandemic 211 will certainly have long-term socioeconomic impacts on less favored communities 9. The 212 public health policy responses must ensure that considerations of health equity and social 213 justice principles remain at the forefront of pandemic responses to ensure that the 214 COVID-19 pandemic does not increase health inequalities for future generations 5. 215 CONCLUSIONS 216 The COVID-19 outcomes and SDI in Brazilian states are correlated to the 217 socioeconomic condition. States with moderate social vulnerability presented more 218 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants than states with very low social vulnerability. SVI 219 was a predictor of accumulated cases, confirmed deaths, and social distancing index in 220 Brazilian states during COVID-19. Health authorities might apply these data on disease- 221 control efforts, guiding interventions and resource allocations to improve outcomes in 222 vulnerable communities. 223 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 224 The authors would like to thank the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível 225 Superior (CAPES) for scholarship granting.
