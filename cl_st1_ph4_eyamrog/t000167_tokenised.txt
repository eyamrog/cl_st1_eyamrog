The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of application of Bacillus cereus combined with the use of substrate and reduction in conventional fertilization on the growth of green dwarf coconut seedlings in Brazil, the Santa Isabel nursery in the state of Pará, Brazil. The experiment design was completely randomized with four treatments: soil+100% fertilizati+on; soil+ 50% fertilization + B. cereus; coconut fiber+100% of fertilization; and coconut fiber+33% of fertilization plus B. cereus, with 5 replications. Biochemical tests were performed with B. cereus and in the field where the following were evaluated: biometrics, hormonal and nutritional profile compared by t Test (P <0.05). Isolate B. cereus produced siderophores, IAA and phosphate solubilizer. In the field, the treatmwxent with inoculated coconut fiber and B. cereus stood out where nursery time was reduced by two months. Increments by 190% in IAA, 31% in GA3, and 17% in GA4 were found. This combination resulted in an increase by 98% in N, 42% in P, 82% in K, 103% in Ca, 68% in Mg, 84% in B, 41% in Fe, compared to control plants in coconut fiber+100% fertilization. Therefore, the use of B. cereus to obtain coconut seedlings is a technology that provides greater development in a shorter time in nursery and reduction in application of inputs.
The coconut tree culture has great economic and social importance due to the value generated and added to its production chain. According to FAO [1], Indonesia stands out as the world's largest coconut producer, followed by the Philippines, India and Sri Lanka. Brazil is ranked fifth among the coconut producing countries in the world. Its production occupies and area of 215,700 hectares, yielding approximately 1,937,484 million fruits [2], out of which 1,485,184 correspond to the production of green dwarf and hybrid (SINDCOCO, 2018).
In order to achieve vigorous coconut palm seedlings, it is essential to consider obtaining good quality genetic material, adequate phyto-sanitary management, and better use of synthetic fertilizer, as the slow germination and pre-formation of seedlings is irregular, lasting three months at this stage (RABELO et al., 2006). Another important factor is the choice of substrate, in which its physical, chemical and biological characteristics must be considered (YAMANISHI et al., 2004). The production of coconut seedlings has as its main limiting factor the duration of the cycle until transplanting to field, ranging from eight to 12 months, therefore, time, inputs and services are required. Fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, labor, are some of the costs to be considered for obtaining seedlings (VINODHINI; DESHMUKH, 2017). The use of low efficiency synthetic fertilizers is largely related to the loss of leaching and evaporation into the atmosphere (TILMAN, 1998; GYANESHWAR et al., 2002). Thus the efficient use of synthetic fertilizers is important for productivity, combined with less damage to the environment (PAUNGFOO-LONHIENNE et al., 2019).
The use of microorganisms in agriculture is considered a viable and sustainable management, especially in search for the best use of synthetic fertilizers. The use of rhizobacteria in plants can promote growth (GANGE; GADHAVE, 2018). Some genera have already been described as growth promoters in coconut seedlings such as Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. (George et al., 2018). Rhizobacteria have the ability to alter anatomical characteristics, and provide better photosynthetic, hormonal and nutritional performance (LUCY; REED; GLICK, 2004; LWIN et al., 2012; SAMANIEGO et al., 2016). Rhizobacterial species such as Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas sp. and Azuspirillum brasiliense has the ability to make nutrients available in other ways, such as producing siderophores, solubilizing phosphate and mineralizing organic matter (AZIZ et al., 2012; SASIREKHAA; SHIVAKUMARB, 2016; NUMOTO et al., 2019). They also stimulate the synthesis of phytohormones such as indole acetic acid (AIA) and gibberellins that promote growth of the roots and the aerial part (PAHARI; MISHRA, 2017).
Thus, the objective of this work was to promote the growth of coconut seedlings based on the inoculation with Bacillus cereus, combined with different substrates and reduced synthetic fertilization.
The field experiment was conducted on Reunidas Sococo commercial farm located in Santa Isabel do Pará-Brazil (1°13'26”S and 48°02'29” W).
Bacillus cereus isolate was obtained from rhizospheric soil samples taken from commercial coconut palm plantations through serial dilution according to Fillippi et al., (2011) and stored in the crop collection of the Plant Protection Laboratory- (LPP) at UFRA.
Isolate of B. cereus was cultured in Kado and Heskett (1970) culture medium 523 for 24 hours at 28°C. Microbial growth material was added to a micro-tube containing 567µL TE1x, followed by shaking. After that, 30µL of 10% SDS was added, followed by stirring. Then, 3 µl proteinase K was also added followed by shaking, and incubation for 60 minutes at 37°C. After this period, 100 µL 5 M NaCl was added, followed by stirring. Next, 80 µl CTAB/NaCl was added, followed by stirring and water bath at 65°C for 10 minutes. Finally, 780µL of isoamyl chloroform (24: 1) was added and stirred for 10 minutes and centrifuged for five minutes at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to micro-tubes and 960µL of ice-cold isopropanol was added. Subsequently the micro-tube was inverted until the DNA was visible and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 25 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and 1mL of 70% ethanol was added, and centrifuged for 3 minutes at 14,000 rpm. Then, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was dried for 20 minutes in a slide chamber. The DNA was re-suspended in 100 µL 0.1x TE and 6mg mL-1 ribonuclease, followed by incubation at 25°C for 12 hours (DOYLE; DOYLE, 1990). DNA was quantified through BioDrop µLite (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), resulting in a final concentration of 10 ngμL-1 and stored at -20°C.
The UFRA19 isolate was identified by using the 16S rDNA region gene with the aid of 27F (5'- AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3') and 1492R (5'ACCTTGTTACGACTT-3') primers (LANE, 1991). The PCR amplification reaction was composed of 1X Master Mix 2X (Promega) (0.05 U μL-1 Taq DNA polymerase, 4 Mm MgCl2 reaction buffer, 0.4 Mm of each DNTP); 10 µM of each primer and 50 ng DNA. Amplification of the 16S rDNA region was performed in a thermal cycler (Eppendorf MasterCycler Nexus Hamburg, Germany) with the following steps: initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 minutes; 25 cycles of 94°C for 1 minute, 55°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 1 minute; and final extension at 72°C for 7 minutes.
Reactions were purified using 5 μL PCR product plus 2 μL Exo-sap enzyme (Exonuclease / Alkaline Phosphatase). Samples were purified through thermal cycler, performed at 37°C for 4 minutes, followed by an incubation period at 80°C for 1 minute to irreversibly inactivate both enzymes. After the purification reaction, sequencing was carried out in an automated sequencer ABI3730 owned by the Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Biology of the Federal University of Pernambuco (LABBE- UFPE).
DNA sequence analysis and assembly of the UFRA19 isolate contigs was performed with the aid of the Staden Package (STADEN et al., 1998). The nucleotide sequence of the UFRA19 bacteria was compared to the isolate sequences available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database using the BLASTn software (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Afterwards, all sequences were aligned (MEGA). Bayesian Inference (IB) analysis was performed by means of Mr. Bayes v.3.2.6 (RONQUIST et al., 2012) implemented in CIPRES (https://www.phylo.org/portal2/home.action) using the best nucleotide replacement model selected according to Aikake's Information Criterion (AIC) through Mr. Modeltest 2.3 (Nylander 2004), using 1,000,000,000 generations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), with sampling every 1,000 and 10,000 generations. Subsequent probabilities were calculated after discarding the first 25% generations. All trees obtained from individual genes and concatenated through the IB method were visualized through Fig Tree 1.4.1 software. (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtre).
The B. cereus isolate was grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium under 100 rpm agitation and incubated at 28°C for 78 hours. After this period, 3 mL of the suspension was centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes at 4000 rpm (MOUSTAINE et al., 2017). Then 90 µL of supernatant and 60 µL of Salkowski reagent were added into another micro-tube, and then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes to determine the occurrence of a change in media color (GORDON; WEBER, 1951).
Isolate of B. cereus was inoculated into test tubes containing 10 mL TSL (1:10 diluted) medium (3 g in 1000 mL distilled water) and incubated at 28°C under agitation at 114 rpm for 24 hours. Subsequently, the tube containing the bacterial suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 12,000 rpm. Then 1 mL of the added supernatant was transferred into another tube containing 1 mL of blue chrome S (BCS) solution. Fifteen minutes after mixing, the isolate converts the dark blue color to yellow when the siderophore is produced (SCHWYN; NEILANDS, 1987).
Isolate of B. cereus was grown in NBRIP growth medium, according to Nautiyal (1999), containing 10 g glucose, 2.5 g Ca3 (PO4) 25 g MgCl2 W6H2O, 0.25 g MgSO4W7H2O, 0.2 g KCl, and 0.1g (NH4) 2SO4, pH = 7.0 and addition of 1.5% agar in triplicate. The plates were incubated for 14 days at 28°C, then the presence of halo was evaluated, which characterizes phosphate solubilization.
Seedlings of Brazilian green dwarf Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) at one month of age were used in a completely randomized design with four treatments: T1: soil and 100% of conventional fertilization; T2: soil + 50% of conventional fertilization and application of B. cereus; T3: coconut fiber + 100% of conventional fertilization; T4: coconut fiber + 33% of conventional fertilization + application of B. cereus, with 5 repetitions.
Conventional fertilization was applied to one Brazilian green dwarf coconut seedling over the eight-month cycle: 18 g Urea, 240 g SFS (18% P2O5), 60 g KCL (60% K2O), 30 g MgO (30 % Mg) and 3g Ulexite (10% B), the application of synthetic fertilization occurs in three plots at the first, third and fifth months according to Lins and Viegas (2008).
The seedlings were grown in a 40 x 40- polyethylene bag on soil substrate with the following chemical characterization: pH (CaCl2) 3.9; 0.012g Kg -1 Ca; 0.03 g Kg-1 Mg; 0.019 g Kg-1 K; 0.004 g Kg-1 P and 0.8% organic matter (OM). The chemical characterization of coconut fiber substrate (Golden- Mix type 4-amafribra) was, as it follows: 0.086 g Kg-1 N; 0.264 g Kg-1 P; 0.580 g Kg-1 K; 0.128 g Kg-1 Ca; 0.447 g Kg-1 Mg; 272.86mg S; 42.25mg Na; 0.703 g Kg-1 B; 0.12 g/kg Cu; 0.5mg Fe; 0.6mg Mn; 0.78mg Zn and 92.43% OM.
The bacterial suspension was adjusted in a 550 nm Spectrophotometer (Å550 = 0.1 corresponding to 108 CFU⋅mL-1) (FILIPPI et al., 2011), and the volume adjusted to 300 mL per pot. Two applications were performed per seedling.
The biometric evaluations of coconut seedlings were performed at two different periods. For seedlings grown on soil substrate, the evaluation was performed when they were eight months old and six months old for seedlings grown on coconut fiber substrate, due to root extravasation in coconut fiber treatment. The following were evaluated: plant height, stem diameter, fresh mass of the aerial part and roots and dry mass of the aerial part and roots.
Concentration of the hormones AIA, GA3, GA4 and ACC, phytohormone ethylene precursor, was determined following MUNNE´-BOSCH (2011). For the determination, 300 mg of fresh tissue from the second leaf of the plants was stored in liquid nitrogen, soon after, the material was lyophilized and macerated in liquid nitrogen. Then, 40 mg dry mass was weighed and 400 µL of extraction solvents (methanol: isopropyl alcohol: acetic acid 20: 79: 1) were added. Samples were vortexed 4 times for 20s (on ice), sonicated for 5 minutes, placed on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, 350 µL of supernatant was removed and transferred to another micro-tube. Approximately 300 µL of the extract obtained in flasks was added and from these, 5 µL were injected into the NuBioMol LC/MS system (Biomolecule Analysis Center - UFV, Brazil). A chromatography column (Agilent Eclipse) was used (RRHD, 1.8, lm, 2.1 9 50 mm) with a flow rate of 0.3 mLmin-1 coupled to a triple quadrupole QQQ mass spectrometer (Agilent). Mass spectra were alternately negative/positive operated according to retention time for each hormone standard and sample was scanned through Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) using the following mass transitions: JA 209> 59; SA 137> 93; ABA 263> 153; ACC 106> 56. The generated mass spectra were processed using MassHunter Software to obtain the extracted ion chromatograms (XIC) of each transition and area values, indicative of the abundance of each hormone. A curve pattern of each hormone over a concentration range from 0.1 to 300 ng mL-1 was used to convert the XIC area values into ng g-1 of plant tissue (MUNNE´-BOSCH, 2011). Molecular mass spectra analysis was obtained with the aid of Skyline software.
In order to determine the phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe) contents, the plant material was dried and ground and subsequently subjected to nitro-perchloric digestion. Boron (B) was analyzed after dry digestion of the samples by the Azometrinah method. For determination of nitrogen (N) contents, the plant material was submitted to sulfuric digestion (MALAVOLTA; VITTI; OLIVEIRA, 1997).
Differences among means of the treatments were evaluated by the t Test (p <0.01). All data were analyzed using R software version 3.5.1. (R, 2019).
The UFRA19 isolate sequence was compared in GenBrank by means of the BLASTn tool. The isolate showed 99.79% identity with the genus Bacillus (ATCC14579T). Based on the construction of the phylogenetic tree, it was possible to identify the species of the genus Bacillus, the isolate showed similarity to B. cereus species. The sequence was deposited in Genbank as UFRA19 with accession number MN393059 (Figure 1).
Phosphate solubilization was identified from B. cereus isolate in the evaluation of the in vitro test where halo formation occurred in the peripheral region of the rhizobacteria colonies. When the isolate was exposed to CAS solution, dark blue color was converted into yellow color, indicating that it is capable of producing siderophores. It was possible to identify that the isolate produces IAA from Salkowski's reagent reaction (Figure 2).
Coconut palm seedlings grown in soil and inoculated with B. cereus increased the seedling height by 27% compared to seedlings on the same substrate without inoculation. Brazilian green dwarf coconut seedlings grown in coconut fiber combined with inoculation of B. cereus provided positive increases by 26% in height, by 47% in biomass of the aerial part and root biomass by 28% (Figure 3).
The inoculation of B. cereus combined with the soil substrate provided green dwarf coconut seedlings an increase by 23% in nitrogen, 49% in boron and 12% in magnesium contents. The application of B. cereus in coconut fiber showed a significant increase in macronutrients: 98% in N, 42% in P, 82% in K, 68% in Mg and 163% in Ca. It also increased B micronutrients by 68% and Fe by 84% when compared to seedlings grown on coconut fiber substrate without B. cereus inoculation (Figure 4).
The use of B. cereus combined with the soil resulted in an increase in GA4 by 60% in Brazilian dwarf coconut palm seedlings compared to seedlings in soil without B. cereus inoculation. The inoculation of B. cereus in seedlings grown in coconut fiber provided increments by 190% in IAA, 31% in GA3 and 17% in GA4, when compared to the treatment of coconut fiber with no application of B. cereus (Figure 5).
Rhizobacteria inoculated in coconut fiber in reduced conventional fertilization treatment improve growth, change in hormonal and nutritional levels in Brazilian green dwarf coconut seedlings.
Based on the analysis of the 16S rDNA region, B. cereus isolate was identified in this study. Sequencing of 16S rDNA region has aided in the distinction between bacterial groups (PATWARDHAN et al., 2014) since it is a gene found in all bacteria. Sequences of 16S rDNA region of unknown bacteria can be compared with sequences of bacteria deposited in databases (CLARRIDGE, 2004; PATWARDHAN; RAY; ROY, 2014). The isolates of this genus are described as growth promoters in other studies (NIU et al., 2011; HASSAN et al., 2018).
The combination of coconut fiber and B. cereus inoculation resulted in an increase in the growth of coconut seedlings followed by hormonal changes and increased nutritional content, besides a 67% reduction in synthetic fertilizer dose. The higher growth in coconut fiber substrate compared to soil can be attributed to the characteristics of high porosity and moisture absorption, besides favoring the greater adaptation of B. cereus in coconut fiber. These factors allowed the coconut seedlings to a rapid root formation and subsequent increase in nutrient absorption efficiency (GLICK, 2012).
The greatest root growth of coconut seedlings inoculated with B. cereus and grown on coconut fiber substrate is the result of the positive interaction initiated from the release of root exudates that attract the bacteria to the root hairs where infection begins (SHARMA; KUMAWAT; KAUR, 2016; DOORNBOS; LOON; BAKKER, 2012). Inoculation with B. cereus in coconut fiber substrate promoted changes in root accumulation in seedlings resulting in an increase in volume and quantity of thin roots as can be seen in Figure 3. These results might be due to the increase in indoleacetic acid concentration (IAA) from B. cereus inoculation. Such phytohormone is responsible for modulating the differentiation and elongation of lateral roots, as well as increasing the number of root hairs, therefore promoting greater nutrient absorption (BHARDWAJ, 2014; TURAN et al., 2014). This enhanced growth resulting from B. cereus inoculation may demonstrate the ability of this isolate to “manage” the activity of enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1- carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase, which regulates ethylene synthesis by cleaving its acid precursor, 1- aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) (BELIMOV et al., 2009; SIDDIKEE et al., 2011), thus decreasing the negative effects on plant growth and allowing plants to develop a better root system (GLICK et al., 1999).
Losses caused by synthetic fertilization may occur due to volatilization, leaching, adsorption, resulting in low plant uptake (ISWAS; LADHA; DAZZO, 2000; GYANESHWAR et al., 2002). The use of B. cereus combined with coconut fiber with 33% of conventional fertilization promoted satisfactory use of nutrients. Also, it allowed identifying greater accumulation of evaluated macro- and micro-nutrients. Previous studies show that inoculation with Bacillus aryabhattai S10 and B. subtilis ZM63 in corn plants promoted phosphate solubilization by raising P levels by 90% (AHMAD et al., 2019). Inoculation with Bacillus sp. PZ-1 in mustard showed efficiency in siderophores production and aided nutrient absorption (YU et al., 2017). In addition to the rhizobacteria itself, which triggers mechanisms of organic matter mineralization, phosphate solubilization and production of siderophores making nutrients available for absorption and promoting greater nutrient absorption by plant roots (ARIF et al., 2017; CHERIF et al., 2017).
The inoculation with B. cereus combined with coconut fiber substrate with 33% of conventional fertilization promoted a 30 to 570% increase in nutrient content. Higher levels of N may be the result of ability of B. cereus in biodegrading organic matter and make nutrients available, in addition to promoting smaller losses through leaching (PAUNGFOO-LONHIENNE et al., 2019). Inoculation with B. megaterium SNji (BmeSNji) and Azospirillum brasilense 65B (Abr65B) in wheat, enhanced N uptake, promoting accumulation in plant biomass (NGUYEN et al., 2019). Coconut seedlings inoculated with B. cereus and fertilized with 33% of conventional fertilization showed higher P content. Positive results were also recorded in sugarcane with the use of Bacillus subtilis combined with B. pumilus and chickpea with the inoculation of Pseudomonas sp. (SANTOS; KANDASAMY; RIGOBELO, 2018; ZAHEER et al., 2019). These rhizobacteria genera have the ability to make P available from phosphate solubilization, which consists in releasing protons and secondary metabolites such as organic acids or chelating cations that follow phosphate anion, besides the production of phosphatases and phytases enzymes that mineralize organic material by hydrolysis of H3PO4 esters and anhydrides (BISHOP et al., 1994; RICHARDSON, 1994).
The seedlings inoculated with B. cereus in coconut fiber also induced the highest K absorption as it was observed in wheat inoculated with B. cereus, with an increaser greater than 25% in K content and dry matter (HASSAN et al., 2018). The higher availability of K in rhizobacteria-inoculated plants can occur through solubilization, from the production of organic acids such as tartaric and citrus, and polysaccharides, as recorded for B. mucilaginosus and B. Aphicu species (RICHARDS; BATES, 1989; LIN et al., 2002), mechanisms that may have occurred with B. cereus isolates inoculated in coconut seedlings. Other nutrients such as Fe, Mg, Ca, B, and Mn may also be limiting to plant growth. When coconut palm seedlings were inoculated with B. cereus in coconut fiber substrate, a high micronutrient content was obtained. Bacteria may have made iron available through the production of organic acids or siderophores (KLOEPPER et al., 1980; NEILANDS, 1995; AHMED; HOLMSTROM, 2014), which are low molecular weight molecules that act as iron chelators (BULGARELLI et al. al., 2013). Contents of Ca, Mg, B and Mn may have increased in B. cereus-inoculated coconut seedlings due to its ability to mineralize organic compounds, as observed in raspberry with inoculation of Bacillus M3 alone or in combination with Bacillus OSU-142, which besides increasing the contents of P, Fe, Ca, Mg and Mn, also increased the growth and yield (ORHAN et al., 2006).
In seedlings inoculated with B. cereus and grown on coconut fiber substrate plus 33% of conventional fertilization showed higher accumulation of dry matter in the aerial part, nutritional content and concentration of GA3 and GA4 gibberellins. This result may have occurred as a consequence of the increase in root development that stimulated the release of new leaves in the aerial part. The greater synthesis of gibberellin in B. cereus-stimulated leaf tissue may be due to direct production of gibberellin through conjugation of gibberellins and or change in the inactive status of gibberellins into active (LUCANGELI; BOTTINI, 1997; PICCOLI et al., 1997; CASSÁN et al., 2001). Similar to alder (Alnus glutinosa) plants, in which the use of Bacillus sp. produced several isomers of gibberellins (GA1, GA3, GA4 and GA20) that were responsible for stem elongation (GUTIERREZ MUNERO et al., 2001). The use of coconut fiber substrate associated with B. cereus showed to be a new strategy for coconut tree seedling production systems. Among the factors that may have contributed positively to the growth and development of the seedlings, the high content of about 92% of organic matter found in coconut fiber stands out. The organic matter in this substrate, after mineralization and decomposition processes may strongly in the supply and release of macro and micronutrients, besides allowing the proper temperature and moisture retention of the substrate, favorable environment for the microbial activities microorganisms, which in turn are the primary decomposition agents of organic matter, facilitating the bioavailability of nutrients to seedlings.
The advantages obtained from inoculation with B. cereus in coconut fiber, as a positive effect on the accumulation of macro and micronutrients, a higher concentration of phytohormones and a greater accumulation of biomass, combined with a reduction in conventional fertilization by 67%, indicate that this technology may be an important tool in the production system of green dwarf coconut tree seedlings in Brazil.
