25 Abstract 26 The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of application of Bacillus cereus combined with the 27 use of substrate and reduction in conventional fertilization on the growth of green dwarf coconut seedlings 28 in Brazil, the Santa Isabel nursery in the state of Pará, Brazil. The experiment design was completely 29 randomized with four treatments: soil+100% fertilizati+on; soil+ 50% fertilization + B. cereus; coconut 30 fiber+100% of fertilization; and coconut fiber+33% of fertilization plus B. cereus, with 5 replications. 31 Biochemical tests were performed with B. cereus and in the field where the following were evaluated: 32 biometrics, hormonal and nutritional profile compared by t Test (P <0.05). Isolate B. cereus produced 33 siderophores, IAA and phosphate solubilizer. In the field, the treatmwxent with inoculated coconut fiber 34 and B. cereus stood out where nursery time was reduced by two months. Increments by 190% in IAA, 31% 35 in GA3, and 17% in GA4 were found. This combination resulted in an increase by 98% in N, 42% in P, 36 82% in K, 103% in Ca, 68% in Mg, 84% in B, 41% in Fe, compared to control plants in coconut fiber+100% 37 fertilization. Therefore, the use of B. cereus to obtain coconut seedlings is a technology that provides greater 38 development in a shorter time in nursery and reduction in application of inputs. 39 Keywords: PGPR.

41 1. Introduction 42 The coconut tree culture has great economic and social importance due to the value generated 43 and added to its production chain. According to FAO [1], Indonesia stands out as the world's largest coconut 44 producer, followed by the Philippines, India and Sri Lanka. Brazil is ranked fifth among the coconut 45 producing countries in the world. Its production occupies and area of 215,700 hectares, yielding 46 approximately 1,937,484 million fruits [2], out of which 1,485,184 correspond to the production of green 47 dwarf and hybrid (SINDCOCO, 2018). 48 In order to achieve vigorous coconut palm seedlings, it is essential to consider obtaining good 49 quality genetic material, adequate phyto-sanitary management, and better use of synthetic fertilizer, as the 50 slow germination and pre-formation of seedlings is irregular, lasting three months at this stage (RABELO 51 et al., 2006). Another important factor is the choice of substrate, in which its physical, chemical and 52 biological characteristics must be considered (YAMANISHI et al., 2004). 53 The production of coconut seedlings has as its main limiting factor the duration of the cycle until 54 transplanting to field, ranging from eight to 12 months, therefore, time, inputs and services are required. 55 Fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, labor, are some of the costs to be considered for obtaining seedlings 56 (VINODHINI; DESHMUKH, 2017). The use of low efficiency synthetic fertilizers is largely related to the 57 loss of leaching and evaporation into the atmosphere (TILMAN, 1998; GYANESHWAR et al., 2002). Thus 58 the efficient use of synthetic fertilizers is important for productivity, combined with less damage to the 59 environment (PAUNGFOO-LONHIENNE et al., 2019). 60 The use of microorganisms in agriculture is considered a viable and sustainable management, 61 especially in search for the best use of synthetic fertilizers. The use of rhizobacteria in plants can promote 62 growth (GANGE; GADHAVE, 2018). Some genera have already been described as growth promoters in 63 coconut seedlings such as Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. (George et al., 2018). Rhizobacteria have the 64 ability to alter anatomical characteristics, and provide better photosynthetic, hormonal and nutritional 65 performance (LUCY; REED; GLICK, 2004; LWIN et al., 2012; SAMANIEGO et al., 2016). Rhizobacterial 66 species such as Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas sp. and Azuspirillum brasiliense has the ability to make 67 nutrients available in other ways, such as producing siderophores, solubilizing phosphate and mineralizing 68 organic matter (AZIZ et al., 2012; SASIREKHAA; SHIVAKUMARB, 2016; NUMOTO et al., 2019). They 69 also stimulate the synthesis of phytohormones such as indole acetic acid (AIA) and gibberellins that 70 promote growth of the roots and the aerial part (PAHARI; MISHRA, 2017). 71 Thus, the objective of this work was to promote the growth of coconut seedlings based on the 72 inoculation with Bacillus cereus, combined with different substrates and reduced synthetic fertilization. 73 Methodology 74 The field experiment was conducted on Reunidas Sococo commercial farm located in Santa 75 Isabel do Pará-Brazil (1°13'26”S and 48°02'29” W). 76 Obtaining Isolate 77 Bacillus cereus isolate was obtained from rhizospheric soil samples taken from commercial 78 coconut palm plantations through serial dilution according to Fillippi et al., (2011) and stored in the crop 79 collection of the Plant Protection Laboratory- (LPP) at UFRA. 80 Identification of bacterial isolate 81 Isolate of B. cereus was cultured in Kado and Heskett (1970) culture medium 523 for 24 hours 82 at 28°C. Microbial growth material was added to a micro-tube containing 567µL TE1x, followed by 83 shaking. After that, 30µL of 10% SDS was added, followed by stirring. Then, 3 µl proteinase K was also 84 added followed by shaking, and incubation for 60 minutes at 37°C. After this period, 100 µL 5 M NaCl 85 was added, followed by stirring. Next, 80 µl CTAB/NaCl was added, followed by stirring and water bath 86 at 65°C for 10 minutes. Finally, 780µL of isoamyl chloroform (24: 1) was added and stirred for 10 minutes 87 and centrifuged for five minutes at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to micro-tubes and 960µL 88 of ice-cold isopropanol was added. Subsequently the micro-tube was inverted until the DNA was visible 89 and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 25 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and 1mL of 70% ethanol was 90 added, and centrifuged for 3 minutes at 14,000 rpm. Then, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was 91 dried for 20 minutes in a slide chamber. The DNA was re-suspended in 100 µL 0.1x TE and 6mg mL-1 92 ribonuclease, followed by incubation at 25°C for 12 hours (DOYLE; DOYLE, 1990). DNA was quantified 93 through BioDrop µLite (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), resulting in a final concentration of 10 ngμL-1 94 and stored at -20°C. 95 The UFRA19 isolate was identified by using the 16S rDNA region gene with the aid of 27F (5'- 96 AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3') and 1492R (5'ACCTTGTTACGACTT-3') primers (LANE, 1991). 97 The PCR amplification reaction was composed of 1X Master Mix 2X (Promega) (0.05 U μL-1 Taq DNA 98 polymerase, 4 Mm MgCl2 reaction buffer, 0.4 Mm of each DNTP); 10 µM of each primer and 50 ng DNA. 99 Amplification of the 16S rDNA region was performed in a thermal cycler (Eppendorf MasterCycler Nexus 100 Hamburg, Germany) with the following steps: initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 minutes; 25 cycles of 94°C 101 for 1 minute, 55°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 1 minute; and final extension at 72°C for 7 minutes. 102 Reactions were purified using 5 μL PCR product plus 2 μL Exo-sap enzyme (Exonuclease / 103 Alkaline Phosphatase). Samples were purified through thermal cycler, performed at 37°C for 4 minutes, 104 followed by an incubation period at 80°C for 1 minute to irreversibly inactivate both enzymes. After the 105 purification reaction, sequencing was carried out in an automated sequencer ABI3730 owned by the 106 Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Biology of the Federal University of Pernambuco (LABBE- 107 UFPE). 108 DNA sequence analysis and assembly of the UFRA19 isolate contigs was performed with the 109 aid of the Staden Package (STADEN et al., 1998). The nucleotide sequence of the UFRA19 bacteria was 110 compared to the isolate sequences available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 111 database using the BLASTn software (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Afterwards, all sequences were 112 aligned (MEGA). Bayesian Inference (IB) analysis was performed by means of Mr. Bayes v.3.2.6 113 (RONQUIST et al., 2012) implemented in CIPRES (https://www.phylo.org/portal2/home.action) using the 114 best nucleotide replacement model selected according to Aikake's Information Criterion (AIC) through Mr. 115 Modeltest 2.3 (Nylander 2004), using 1,000,000,000 generations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), 116 with sampling every 1,000 and 10,000 generations. Subsequent probabilities were calculated after 117 discarding the first 25% generations. All trees obtained from individual genes and concatenated through 118 the IB method were visualized through Fig Tree 1.4.1 software. (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtre). 119 Biochemical Test 120 Detection of Indoleacetic Acid (AIA) Production 121 The B. cereus isolate was grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium under 100 rpm agitation and 122 incubated at 28°C for 78 hours. After this period, 3 mL of the suspension was centrifuged at 4°C for 10 123 minutes at 4000 rpm (MOUSTAINE et al., 2017). Then 90 µL of supernatant and 60 µL of Salkowski 124 reagent were added into another micro-tube, and then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes to determine the 125 occurrence of a change in media color (GORDON; WEBER, 1951). 126 Detection of Siderophores production 127 Isolate of B. cereus was inoculated into test tubes containing 10 mL TSL (1:10 diluted) medium 128 (3 g in 1000 mL distilled water) and incubated at 28°C under agitation at 114 rpm for 24 hours. 129 Subsequently, the tube containing the bacterial suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 12,000 rpm. 130 Then 1 mL of the added supernatant was transferred into another tube containing 1 mL of blue chrome S 131 (BCS) solution. Fifteen minutes after mixing, the isolate converts the dark blue color to yellow when the 132 siderophore is produced (SCHWYN; NEILANDS, 1987). 133 Phosphate Solubilization Detection 134 Isolate of B. cereus was grown in NBRIP growth medium, according to Nautiyal (1999), 135 containing 10 g glucose, 2.5 g Ca3 (PO4) 25 g MgCl2 W6H2O, 0.25 g MgSO4W7H2O, 0.2 g KCl, and 136 0.1g (NH4) 2SO4, pH = 7.0 and addition of 1.5% agar in triplicate. The plates were incubated for 14 days 137 at 28°C, then the presence of halo was evaluated, which characterizes phosphate solubilization. 138 Experimental Design 139 Seedlings of Brazilian green dwarf Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) at one month of age were used 140 in a completely randomized design with four treatments: T1: soil and 100% of conventional fertilization; 141 T2: soil + 50% of conventional fertilization and application of B. cereus; T3: coconut fiber + 100% of 142 conventional fertilization; T4: coconut fiber + 33% of conventional fertilization + application of B. cereus, 143 with 5 repetitions. 144 Fertilization 145 Conventional fertilization was applied to one Brazilian green dwarf coconut seedling over the 146 eight-month cycle: 18 g Urea, 240 g SFS (18% P2O5), 60 g KCL (60% K2O), 30 g MgO (30 % Mg) and 147 3g Ulexite (10% B), the application of synthetic fertilization occurs in three plots at the first, third and fifth 148 months according to Lins and Viegas (2008). 149 Chemical characterization of coconut fiber soil and substrate 150 The seedlings were grown in a 40 x 40- polyethylene bag on soil substrate with the following 151 chemical characterization: pH (CaCl2) 3.9; 0.012g Kg -1 Ca; 0.03 g Kg-1 Mg; 0.019 g Kg-1 K; 0.004 g 152 Kg-1 P and 0.8% organic matter (OM). The chemical characterization of coconut fiber substrate (Golden- 153 Mix type 4-amafribra) was, as it follows: 0.086 g Kg-1 N; 0.264 g Kg-1 P; 0.580 g Kg-1 K; 0.128 g Kg-1 154 Ca; 0.447 g Kg-1 Mg; 272.86mg S; 42.25mg Na; 0.703 g Kg-1 B; 0.12 g/kg Cu; 0.5mg Fe; 0.6mg Mn; 155 0.78mg Zn and 92.43% OM. 156 Suspension Preparation 157 The bacterial suspension was adjusted in a 550 nm Spectrophotometer (Å550 = 0.1 158 corresponding to 108 CFU⋅mL-1) (FILIPPI et al., 2011), and the volume adjusted to 300 mL per pot. Two 159 applications were performed per seedling. 160 Assessments 161 Biometry 162 The biometric evaluations of coconut seedlings were performed at two different periods. For 163 seedlings grown on soil substrate, the evaluation was performed when they were eight months old and six 164 months old for seedlings grown on coconut fiber substrate, due to root extravasation in coconut fiber 165 treatment. The following were evaluated: plant height, stem diameter, fresh mass of the aerial part and roots 166 and dry mass of the aerial part and roots. 167 Hormonal profile 168 Concentration of the hormones AIA, GA3, GA4 and ACC, phytohormone ethylene precursor, was 169 determined following MUNNE´-BOSCH (2011). For the determination, 300 mg of fresh tissue from the 170 second leaf of the plants was stored in liquid nitrogen, soon after, the material was lyophilized and 171 macerated in liquid nitrogen. Then, 40 mg dry mass was weighed and 400 µL of extraction solvents 172 (methanol: isopropyl alcohol: acetic acid 20: 79: 1) were added. Samples were vortexed 4 times for 20s (on 173 ice), sonicated for 5 minutes, placed on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 174 4°C. After centrifugation, 350 µL of supernatant was removed and transferred to another micro-tube. 175 Approximately 300 µL of the extract obtained in flasks was added and from these, 5 µL were injected into 176 the NuBioMol LC/MS system (Biomolecule Analysis Center - UFV, Brazil). A chromatography column 177 (Agilent Eclipse) was used (RRHD, 1.8, lm, 2.1 9 50 mm) with a flow rate of 0.3 mLmin-1 coupled to a 178 triple quadrupole QQQ mass spectrometer (Agilent). Mass spectra were alternately negative/positive 179 operated according to retention time for each hormone standard and sample was scanned through Multiple 180 Reaction Monitoring (MRM) using the following mass transitions: JA 209> 59; SA 137> 93; ABA 263> 181 153; ACC 106> 56. The generated mass spectra were processed using MassHunter Software to obtain the 182 extracted ion chromatograms (XIC) of each transition and area values, indicative of the abundance of each 183 hormone. A curve pattern of each hormone over a concentration range from 0.1 to 300 ng mL-1 was used 184 to convert the XIC area values into ng g-1 of plant tissue (MUNNE´-BOSCH, 2011). Molecular mass 185 spectra analysis was obtained with the aid of Skyline software. 186
187 Nutritional content of dry matter shoot 188 In order to determine the phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and iron 189 (Fe) contents, the plant material was dried and ground and subsequently subjected to nitro-perchloric 190 digestion. Boron (B) was analyzed after dry digestion of the samples by the Azometrinah method. For 191 determination of nitrogen (N) contents, the plant material was submitted to sulfuric digestion 192 (MALAVOLTA; VITTI; OLIVEIRA, 1997). 193 Statistical analysis 194 Differences among means of the treatments were evaluated by the t Test (p <0.01). All data were 195 analyzed using R software version 3.5.1. (R, 2019). 196 3 Results 197 Identification of bacterial isolate 198 The UFRA19 isolate sequence was compared in GenBrank by means of the BLASTn tool. The 199 isolate showed 99.79% identity with the genus Bacillus (ATCC14579T). Based on the construction of the 200 phylogenetic tree, it was possible to identify the species of the genus Bacillus, the isolate showed similarity 201 to B. cereus species. The sequence was deposited in Genbank as UFRA19 with accession number 202 MN393059 (Figure 1). 203 204 Fig 1 Molecular phylogenetic analysis of B.cereus isolated from coconut rhizosphere.

Cereus-ATCC14579. 207 In vitro biochemical test 208 Phosphate solubilization was identified from B. cereus isolate in the evaluation of the in vitro 209 test where halo formation occurred in the peripheral region of the rhizobacteria colonies. When the isolate 210 was exposed to CAS solution, dark blue color was converted into yellow color, indicating that it is capable 211 of producing siderophores. It was possible to identify that the isolate produces IAA from Salkowski's 212 reagent reaction (Figure 2). 213

231 Nutritional Content 232 The inoculation of B. cereus combined with the soil substrate provided green dwarf coconut 233 seedlings an increase by 23% in nitrogen, 49% in boron and 12% in magnesium contents. The application 234 of B. cereus in coconut fiber showed a significant increase in macronutrients: 98% in N, 42% in P, 82% in 235 K, 68% in Mg and 163% in Ca. It also increased B micronutrients by 68% and Fe by 84% when compared 236 to seedlings grown on coconut fiber substrate without B. cereus inoculation (Figure 4). 237 238 Fig 4 Nutritional content of coconut palm seedlings.

260 4. Discussão 261
Rhizobacteria inoculated in coconut fiber in reduced conventional fertilization treatment improve 262 growth, change in hormonal and nutritional levels in Brazilian green dwarf coconut seedlings. 263
264 Based on the analysis of the 16S rDNA region, B. cereus isolate was identified in this study. Sequencing 265 of 16S rDNA region has aided in the distinction between bacterial groups (PATWARDHAN et al., 2014) 266 since it is a gene found in all bacteria. Sequences of 16S rDNA region of unknown bacteria can be compared 267 with sequences of bacteria deposited in databases (CLARRIDGE, 2004; PATWARDHAN; RAY; ROY, 268 2014). The isolates of this genus are described as growth promoters in other studies (NIU et al., 2011; 269 HASSAN et al., 2018). 270 The combination of coconut fiber and B. cereus inoculation resulted in an increase in the growth of coconut 271 seedlings followed by hormonal changes and increased nutritional content, besides a 67% reduction in 272 synthetic fertilizer dose. The higher growth in coconut fiber substrate compared to soil can be attributed to 273 the characteristics of high porosity and moisture absorption, besides favoring the greater adaptation of B. 274 cereus in coconut fiber. These factors allowed the coconut seedlings to a rapid root formation and 275 subsequent increase in nutrient absorption efficiency (GLICK, 2012). 276 The greatest root growth of coconut seedlings inoculated with B. cereus and grown on coconut fiber 277 substrate is the result of the positive interaction initiated from the release of root exudates that attract the 278 bacteria to the root hairs where infection begins (SHARMA; KUMAWAT; KAUR, 2016; DOORNBOS; 279 LOON; BAKKER, 2012). Inoculation with B. cereus in coconut fiber substrate promoted changes in root 280 accumulation in seedlings resulting in an increase in volume and quantity of thin roots as can be seen in 281 Figure 3. These results might be due to the increase in indoleacetic acid concentration (IAA) from B. cereus 282 inoculation. Such phytohormone is responsible for modulating the differentiation and elongation of lateral 283 roots, as well as increasing the number of root hairs, therefore promoting greater nutrient absorption 284 (BHARDWAJ, 2014; TURAN et al., 2014). This enhanced growth resulting from B. cereus inoculation 285 may demonstrate the ability of this isolate to “manage” the activity of enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1- 286 carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase, which regulates ethylene synthesis by cleaving its acid precursor, 1- 287 aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) (BELIMOV et al., 2009; SIDDIKEE et al., 2011), thus 288 decreasing the negative effects on plant growth and allowing plants to develop a better root system (GLICK 289 et al., 1999). 290 Losses caused by synthetic fertilization may occur due to volatilization, leaching, adsorption, resulting in 291 low plant uptake (ISWAS; LADHA; DAZZO, 2000; GYANESHWAR et al., 2002). The use of B. cereus 292 combined with coconut fiber with 33% of conventional fertilization promoted satisfactory use of nutrients. 293 Also, it allowed identifying greater accumulation of evaluated macro- and micro-nutrients. Previous studies 294 show that inoculation with Bacillus aryabhattai S10 and B. subtilis ZM63 in corn plants promoted 295 phosphate solubilization by raising P levels by 90% (AHMAD et al., 2019). Inoculation with Bacillus sp. 296 PZ-1 in mustard showed efficiency in siderophores production and aided nutrient absorption (YU et al., 297 2017). In addition to the rhizobacteria itself, which triggers mechanisms of organic matter mineralization, 298 phosphate solubilization and production of siderophores making nutrients available for absorption and 299 promoting greater nutrient absorption by plant roots (ARIF et al., 2017; CHERIF et al., 2017). 300 The inoculation with B. cereus combined with coconut fiber substrate with 33% of conventional 301 fertilization promoted a 30 to 570% increase in nutrient content. Higher levels of N may be the result of 302 ability of B. cereus in biodegrading organic matter and make nutrients available, in addition to promoting 303 smaller losses through leaching (PAUNGFOO-LONHIENNE et al., 2019). Inoculation with B. megaterium 304 SNji (BmeSNji) and Azospirillum brasilense 65B (Abr65B) in wheat, enhanced N uptake, promoting 305 accumulation in plant biomass (NGUYEN et al., 2019). 306 Coconut seedlings inoculated with B. cereus and fertilized with 33% of conventional fertilization showed 307 higher P content. Positive results were also recorded in sugarcane with the use of Bacillus subtilis combined 308 with B. pumilus and chickpea with the inoculation of Pseudomonas sp. (SANTOS; KANDASAMY; 309 RIGOBELO, 2018; ZAHEER et al., 2019). These rhizobacteria genera have the ability to make P available 310 from phosphate solubilization, which consists in releasing protons and secondary metabolites such as 311 organic acids or chelating cations that follow phosphate anion, besides the production of phosphatases and 312 phytases enzymes that mineralize organic material by hydrolysis of H3PO4 esters and anhydrides (BISHOP 313 et al., 1994; RICHARDSON, 1994). 314 The seedlings inoculated with B. cereus in coconut fiber also induced the highest K absorption as it was 315 observed in wheat inoculated with B. cereus, with an increaser greater than 25% in K content and dry matter 316 (HASSAN et al., 2018). The higher availability of K in rhizobacteria-inoculated plants can occur through 317 solubilization, from the production of organic acids such as tartaric and citrus, and polysaccharides, as 318 recorded for B. mucilaginosus and B. Aphicu species (RICHARDS; BATES, 1989; LIN et al., 2002), 319 mechanisms that may have occurred with B. cereus isolates inoculated in coconut seedlings. 320 Other nutrients such as Fe, Mg, Ca, B, and Mn may also be limiting to plant growth. When coconut palm 321 seedlings were inoculated with B. cereus in coconut fiber substrate, a high micronutrient content was 322 obtained. Bacteria may have made iron available through the production of organic acids or siderophores 323 (KLOEPPER et al., 1980; NEILANDS, 1995; AHMED; HOLMSTROM, 2014), which are low molecular 324 weight molecules that act as iron chelators (BULGARELLI et al. al., 2013). Contents of Ca, Mg, B and Mn 325 may have increased in B. cereus-inoculated coconut seedlings due to its ability to mineralize organic 326 compounds, as observed in raspberry with inoculation of Bacillus M3 alone or in combination with Bacillus 327 OSU-142, which besides increasing the contents of P, Fe, Ca, Mg and Mn, also increased the growth and 328 yield (ORHAN et al., 2006). 329 In seedlings inoculated with B. cereus and grown on coconut fiber substrate plus 33% of conventional 330 fertilization showed higher accumulation of dry matter in the aerial part, nutritional content and 331 concentration of GA3 and GA4 gibberellins. This result may have occurred as a consequence of the increase 332 in root development that stimulated the release of new leaves in the aerial part. The greater synthesis of 333 gibberellin in B. cereus-stimulated leaf tissue may be due to direct production of gibberellin through 334 conjugation of gibberellins and or change in the inactive status of gibberellins into active (LUCANGELI; 335 BOTTINI, 1997; PICCOLI et al., 1997; CASSÁN et al., 2001). Similar to alder (Alnus glutinosa) plants, 336 in which the use of Bacillus sp. produced several isomers of gibberellins (GA1, GA3, GA4 and GA20) that 337 were responsible for stem elongation (GUTIERREZ MUNERO et al., 2001). 338 The use of coconut fiber substrate associated with B. cereus showed to be a new strategy for coconut tree 339 seedling production systems. Among the factors that may have contributed positively to the growth and 340 development of the seedlings, the high content of about 92% of organic matter found in coconut fiber stands 341 out. The organic matter in this substrate, after mineralization and decomposition processes may strongly in 342 the supply and release of macro and micronutrients, besides allowing the proper temperature and moisture 343 retention of the substrate, favorable environment for the microbial activities microorganisms, which in turn 344 are the primary decomposition agents of organic matter, facilitating the bioavailability of nutrients to 345 seedlings. 346 5. Conclusion 347 The advantages obtained from inoculation with B. cereus in coconut fiber, as a positive effect on the 348 accumulation of macro and micronutrients, a higher concentration of phytohormones and a greater 349 accumulation of biomass, combined with a reduction in conventional fertilization by 67%, indicate that this 350 technology may be an important tool in the production system of green dwarf coconut tree seedlings in 351 Brazil. 352 Conflict of interest statement 353 The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper. 354 Authors' contribution 355 All authors acted directly in the development of the study, writing and review. 356
