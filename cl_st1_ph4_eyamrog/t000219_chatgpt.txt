The specter of pandemics is among the most feared and concerning scenarios for humanity. Regrettably, this is the current situation we find ourselves in. Throughout a pandemic, numerous circumstances can prove to be daunting, encompassing not only the direct implications of the disease itself but also the necessary actions required to mitigate its spread and the subsequent aftermath.
Pandemic-related stressors manifest in various forms, including uncertainty, anticipated fear, an overwhelming influx of information that may be inaccurate or misleading, psychological and social distress, the fear of death or severe illness, the loss of loved ones, economic strain on society, and personal financial struggles. These are just a few examples of the stressful circumstances that accompany pandemics. Given the protracted and enduring nature of a pandemic, which involves exposure to numerous potentially traumatic events over an extended period, it could be viewed as a form of complex trauma.
History has demonstrated that psychiatric morbidity is a significant consequence of epidemics. For instance, during the SARS epidemic in 2003, over 700 individuals, primarily in Asian countries, were affected. Following hospitalization, up to 45% of SARS survivors were diagnosed with psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety disorders, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Long-term assessments, conducted up to 30 months post-discharge, revealed persistent psychiatric morbidity, particularly PTSD, depressive disorders, and anxiety-spectrum disorders among SARS patients. Similarly, the 2014/2015 Ebola virus outbreak in Africa led to various psychiatric and psychosocial issues, including stigma, isolation, and psychiatric disorders among both the general population and healthcare workers, such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2015, with a mortality rate of approximately 20%, resulted in intensive isolation measures affecting hundreds of individuals, villages, and cities. During this period, over 40% of the general population reported emotional distress, while nearly 50% of patients experienced significant anxiety symptoms. It is anticipated that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will also have significant short- and long-term psychiatric implications.
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing psychological distress and psychiatric problems. Various individual characteristics, including culture, economic status, coping mechanisms, previous psychiatric or psychological issues, personal level of exposure to the risk of contamination, actual development of the disease, and loss of close individuals, play a significant role in shaping the psychological response during these uncertain times. At a societal level, factors such as access to accurate information, availability of medical services, governmental and medical interventions to control the spread of infection (such as quarantine and social isolation), and the overall psychosocial well-being of the community can collectively influence the response to the outbreak.
However, amidst the challenges, there is a glimmer of hope. Human resilience emerges as a formidable strength, capable of surmounting even the most daunting obstacles. It is evident that a significant portion of the populace will exhibit robust mental health responses in the face of the traumatic circumstances brought about by the pandemic. The capacity of individuals to navigate, persevere, recuperate, and reconstruct their lives may even be fortified during these trying times. Some may articulate heightened sentiments of gratitude, a deeper sense of appreciation for their social connections, an increased commitment to mental and physical well-being, reinforced convictions and spirituality, and a profound sense of personal development.
Recommendations for improving mental health outcomes include strategies aimed at enhancing individual and collective resilience, implementing intensive psychiatric surveillance at both individual and community levels, and identifying and referring individuals at higher risk for developing or exacerbating psychiatric disorders. Providing accurate and reliable information to the population regarding the disease and the measures being taken to combat it, facilitating access to quality healthcare services, and offering social and financial assistance to those most in need are crucial steps in preventing psychiatric morbidity. Additionally, addressing stigmatization and social isolation experienced by individuals who have had the disease or lost loved ones to it, encouraging the initiation and continuation of appropriate psychiatric and psychological treatments, and implementing robust psychosocial interventions are essential for promoting a healthy psychiatric response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. To conclude, a quote attributed to Ali Ibn Abi Talib, the purported cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, serves as a poignant reminder: "Do not let your difficulties fill you with anxiety, for it is only in the darkest nights that stars shine most brightly."
