As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold globally, various reports have documented its neurological manifestations.
Objective: This review aims to examine the existing literature concerning the neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods: A literature search was conducted in accordance with systematic review guidelines, utilizing specific keywords related to the neurological complications of COVID-19 reported until May 10th, 2020.
Results: A total of 43 articles were included in the analysis, encompassing a spectrum of symptoms from common, non-specific ones like hyposmia and myalgia to more intricate and potentially life-threatening conditions such as cerebrovascular diseases, encephalopathies, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
In conclusion, it is imperative to underscore the importance of recognizing the neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2, despite the significant challenges encountered by clinicians tending to critically ill patients who are frequently sedated and experiencing additional systemic complications simultaneously.
Coronaviruses (CoV) are part of the Coronaviridae family within the Nidovirales order. These viruses are enveloped, possess a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome, and are categorized into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. The alpha, beta, and delta CoV primarily infect mammals but have demonstrated the ability to cross species barriers, resulting in the emergence of severe respiratory syndromes in humans. Examples include the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV, and the more recent COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2.
The first description of a CoV-related disease dates back to 1931, marking the isolation of the initial human virus (HCoV-229E) in 1965. Prior to the SARS epidemic in late 2002, only two human CoV types were recognized - HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Subsequently, an additional six human CoVs have been identified, linked to common colds (2 to 10% prevalence), ranking as the second most frequent cause after rhinoviruses. These infections typically present with mild symptoms in adults, such as rhinitis, sore throat, and dry cough. While CoVs can also lead to enteric and systemic illnesses, the majority of cases are mild and resolve spontaneously.
The neurotropic, neuro-invasive, and neurovirulent abilities of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been documented in both animals and humans, resulting in conditions such as encephalitis, meningitis, or encephalomyelitis. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these processes remain inadequately characterized.
SARS-CoV-2 was initially identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and swiftly disseminated to nearly every corner of the globe within a few months, resulting in significant economic, social, and health repercussions, alongside a staggering number of fatalities. The clinical manifestation induced by SARS-CoV-2 is termed COVID-19. In a considerable proportion of instances, symptoms of COVID-19 closely resemble those of the common flu, including fever (90%), cough (70%), myalgia, and fatigue (50%), with less frequent occurrences of headache (8%) and diarrhea (5%), while initial signs of anosmia and ageusia may also be present. A smaller subset of severe cases exhibit more pronounced lower respiratory tract involvement, often necessitating respiratory support. Conversely, 5% of cases are asymptomatic. Furthermore, as the pandemic progresses, mounting evidence suggests that COVID-19 is a systemic ailment. For example, renal impairment is more prevalent than initially acknowledged, and cardiac dysfunction has been extensively documented in numerous individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.
While the data presented are preliminary, a significant number of patients exhibit neurological complications linked to COVID-19. A study involving patients from Wuhan, China, revealed that 36.4% of hospitalized individuals displayed neurological abnormalities. It is important to note that this percentage may fluctuate based on various factors, including the clinical environment (outpatient versus inpatient care), demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity), and the specific methodology employed for neurological evaluation.
The mechanism of neurological involvement in COVID-19 is yet to be fully elucidated, but it is likely to be diverse and multifaceted. This may encompass direct brain involvement by SARS-CoV-2, autoimmune factors, inflammation (such as a "cytokine storm"), drug-related side effects, metabolic disruptions, and critical care neuropathy. Data from Wuhan indicates that many complications manifest early, hinting at the significance of direct viral impact on the nervous system. This contrasts with SARS, where neurological symptoms appeared later, indicating a potential autoimmune mechanism at play.
Absence of reports of phenomena such as chorea, myoclonus, opsoclonus, and ataxia, and the scarcity of cases of acute demyelinating polyradiculopathy suggest that immune-mediated phenomena are not as common in COVID-19, although caution is warranted in interpreting such data due to the prolonged latency of many autoimmune manifestations. However, there are descriptions of ataxia, stroke associated with antiphospholipid antibodies, and even Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in individuals with COVID-19. Another crucial question regarding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the nervous system is whether pre-existing neurological diseases increase the risk of severe complications, such as respiratory failure in COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence supporting this claim. Nevertheless, one might argue that conditions linked to respiratory issues (e.g., severe myopathies, neuropathies, neuromuscular junction disorders) and degenerative diseases like advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) could predispose individuals to a more severe course of COVID-19. Despite the lack of data, it is anticipated that neurological conditions may worsen as a result of COVID-19. The authors' unpublished experience suggests this may occur in PD, which aligns with the understanding that patients with underlying degenerative diseases, including dementing conditions, often experience significant, sometimes irreversible, deterioration due to clinical disturbances. Additionally, factors like social isolation and lack of exercise resulting from staying at home and practicing social distancing may further negatively impact the course of neurological illnesses.
At a global level, the escalation of the pandemic has rightfully prompted health systems to prioritize the prevention and management of COVID-19. Emerging evidence indicates that individuals with pre-existing medical conditions are encountering challenges in accessing healthcare providers, despite a significant rise in telemedicine services. For instance, in the New York City area, there has been an alarming 800% surge in cardiac arrest deaths at home following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend suggests that individuals with neurological disorders may also be experiencing difficulties in reaching out to their neurologists. Therefore, it is imperative for the neurological community to persevere in delivering care to their patients amidst the adversities brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.
The objective of this article is to offer a comprehensive review of the available data pertaining to the epidemiology, pathophysiology, as well as the clinical and laboratory manifestations of neurological complications associated with COVID-19.
A literature search was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in both the MEDLINE and LILACS databases. The search utilized terms such as "coronavirus COVID-19," "COVID-19," "COVID 19," and "SARS-CoV-2," in conjunction with neurological descriptors like "neurology," "neurological," and specific disorders including cerebrovascular, stroke, encephalopathy, encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis, Guillain Barré, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myalgia, headache, hyposmia, anosmia, and ageusia. This search was conducted in medical subject headings, titles, abstracts, and author-supplied keywords. Additionally, the screening of reference lists from systematic review articles was performed to identify any studies that were initially overlooked or presented solely in abstract form. No restrictions were set regarding the study's publication year, encompassing investigations from the earliest available date up to May 10th, 2020. Only studies published in English were considered. The analysis focused on publications involving laboratory-confirmed cases, ranging from extensive case series to more limited case reports and series.
Figure 1 illustrates the flow diagram detailing the process of article inclusion.
Table 1 provides a concise overview of the primary discoveries outlined in the review, which will be elaborated upon in the subsequent sections.
Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly critically ill elderly individuals, seem to have a heightened susceptibility to developing cerebrovascular disease (CVD), encompassing cerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. The documented cases suggest that ischemic CVD in this context may exhibit distinct features, impacting both diagnosis and treatment: a majority displayed large-vessel occlusion, with a notable portion experiencing involvement of multiple territories. While some incidents represented initial occurrences in the patients' medical history, many already presented with other cerebrovascular risk factors like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, or a history of prior stroke. Conversely, recent reports have highlighted six cases of large-vessel stroke in SARS-CoV-2 patients under 50 years of age (33‒49). Among these cases, three lacked vascular risk factors, five exhibited anterior circulation strokes, and all displayed mild to moderate symptoms of the viral infection. The majority of these patients remained severely disabled during the last follow-up assessment.
There is compelling evidence indicating that vascular complications primarily stem from the well-recognized potentially fatal inflammatory storm, characterized by an overactivation of inflammatory factors and dysfunction of the coagulation system, notably D-dimer and platelet abnormalities, thereby heightening the risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, hypertensive SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals often experience fluctuations in blood pressure, possibly attributed to the virus's specific binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Additionally, thrombocytopenia, a known risk factor for cerebral hemorrhage, is notably prevalent in severe cases of the illness. This scenario may be further complicated by cardiogenic and hematologic elements, as evidenced by prior coronavirus and influenza outbreaks indicating that viral infections can instigate acute arrhythmias, exacerbate heart failure, and trigger myocarditis. Furthermore, Zhang et al. highlighted severe coagulopathy, multiple infarcts (in the brain, upper and lower extremities), and the presence of antibodies against cardiolipin and β2-glycoprotein I in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
The evidence mentioned above is supported by clinical data from a case series of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Mao et al. (7) found neurologic symptoms in 45.5% of 88 severely infected patients, with 5.7% presenting ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Asadi-Pooya and Simani (20) conducted a systematic review, identifying ischemic CVD in approximately 5% of cases, along with instances of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and cerebral hemorrhage. Patients with CVD were notably older, more likely to have severe infections, cardiovascular risk factors, elevated serum markers of inflammation, and a hypercoagulable state. More than a third of CVD patients ultimately succumbed to the disease. While a combined analysis indicated a 2.5-fold increase in severe COVID-19 odds with stroke, there was no statistically significant link between stroke and mortality. Figure 2 depicts a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with cerebral hemorrhage observed by one of the authors of this review.
Khosvarani and colleagues (22) have introduced a set of guidelines known as "Protected Code Stroke" to address the management of hyperacute stroke amidst the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic. These guidelines offer insights into various aspects such as screening procedures, the utilization of personal protective equipment, and crisis resource management strategies.
The most extensive data available on neurologic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 originated from a retrospective case series involving 214 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. Among these patients, 78 individuals (36.4%) exhibited manifestations related to the nervous system, which were categorized into three subgroups: central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS), and skeletal-related injury. Specifically, CNS involvement was observed in 53 patients (24.8%), with manifestations including dizziness (n=36; 16.8%), headache (n=28; 13.1%), impaired consciousness (n=16; 7.5%), acute cerebrovascular disease (CVD) (n=6; 2.8%), ataxia (n=1; 0.5%), and seizure (n=1; 0.5%). Notably, impaired consciousness and CVD were more prevalent in patients with severe COVID-19 infection compared to those with nonsevere cases. The authors defined impaired consciousness as any alteration in level (e.g., somnolence, stupor, coma) and/or content of consciousness (e.g., confusion, delirium), essentially indicating an encephalopathic state. Regarding seizures, one patient in the study exhibited acute limb twitching, foaming at the mouth, and a three-minute loss of consciousness. Due to the risk of cross-contamination, MRI and invasive procedures like lumbar puncture were avoided, preventing a more detailed characterization of these patients' encephalopathy.
A retrospective study conducted in China examined 274 patients with COVID-19, comprising 113 deceased and 161 recovered individuals. Among the initial presenting symptoms, headache or dizziness were observed in 31 patients (11%) and 21 patients (8%), respectively, while hypoxic encephalopathy was identified in 24 patients (9%). Although headache and dizziness were equally prevalent in both deceased and recovered patient groups, hypoxic encephalopathy was more common in deceased patients (n=23/113) compared to those who recovered (n=1/161). Another Chinese retrospective series involving 99 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia reported a 9% rate of confusional state. In a multicenter study with 304 patients who either recovered or died, eight individuals were encephalopathic (2.6%; n=8/304), with one obtunded, one delirious, and the remaining six comatose. The study ruled out non-convulsive status epilepticus as a cause for altered mental status.
A French case series documented neurologic complications in 58 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among these patients, approximately two-thirds exhibited confusional state and agitation. Thirteen patients underwent brain MRI due to unexplained encephalopathy, with eight showing leptomeningeal enhancement. Additionally, eight patients underwent EEG, revealing only nonspecific changes. CSF analyses of seven patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The authors speculated on potential mechanisms of neurologic injury, considering factors such as ICU-related encephalopathy, cytokine storm, and medication effects or withdrawal.
The initial instance of presumed COVID-19-associated acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy involved a middle-aged woman displaying respiratory symptoms, fever, and altered mentation, with COVID-19 confirmed through a nasopharyngeal swab. However, CSF studies were hindered by a traumatic lumbar puncture, and tests for HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, and West Nile virus yielded negative results, with SARS-CoV-2 not assessed in the CSF. Neuroimaging revealed hemorrhagic, rim-enhancing lesions in the bilateral thalamus, medial temporal lobes, and subinsular regions, while CT angiography and venography appeared normal. Treatment with IVIG was administered, but the outcome remains undisclosed. It is crucial to acknowledge the presumptive nature of this diagnosis due to the absence of SARS-CoV-2 testing in the CSF, considering that acute necrotizing encephalopathy can be triggered by various pathogens, such as influenza A and B, parainfluenza, varicella, and HHV6. Additionally, two other cases are worth mentioning. The first involves a 54-year-old woman diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2, exhibiting focal frontotemporal seizure activity on EEG and alterations in brain and spine MRI. The second case pertains to a female patient in her early forties presenting with acute dysphagia, headache, dysarthria, and encephalopathy, showing extensive demyelinating lesions on brain MRI T2 FLAIR imaging. While treatment with hydroxychloroquine, ceftriaxone, and IVIG led to a positive response, the lack of peer-reviewed confirmation raises concerns regarding the occurrence of ADEM in this context.
A few days later, the first confirmed case of CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2 was reported, confirming the virus's neuroinvasive properties. The patient, a 24-year-old man, experienced symptoms such as headache, fatigue, and fever a week before hospital admission following a convulsive episode. Meningeal irritation was evident during examination, prompting further investigation with a head CT and lumbar puncture. The CT scan did not reveal cerebral edema, while the lumbar puncture showed elevated opening pressure (320 mm H2O), mononuclear-predominant pleocytosis (12/uL), absence of red blood cells, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Serological tests for HSV-1 and VZV IgM antibodies returned negative. Neuroimaging indicated right mesial temporal encephalitis, right ventriculitis without abnormal enhancement, and pan-paranasal sinusitis. Chest imaging confirmed pneumonia, despite a negative nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. The patient received treatment with acyclovir, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, steroids, and anti-convulsants.
Subsequently, three additional patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were documented as having meningoencephalitis presumably linked to the virus. The first case involved a Chinese man who received a diagnosis of CNS infection based on clinical manifestations such as altered mentation and meningeal signs. Despite normal CSF studies, which included negative SARS-CoV-2 testing, and a head CT revealing no acute findings, the patient's mental confusion resolved by the time of discharge. The second patient, a middle-aged woman in the United States, presented to an emergency department with fever, headache, and a new-onset seizure. Meningeal signs were evident upon initial examination, with normal head CT results but abnormal CSF studies showing lymphocytic pleocytosis, increased protein, and red blood cells; SARS-CoV-2 testing was not conducted, and HSV PCR was negative. Despite lacking significant respiratory symptoms, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and her hospitalization was complicated by encephalopathy, although seizures did not recur following the initiation of anti-convulsant medication; EEG displayed generalized slowing. Unfortunately, there is no available information on her follow-up. The third case involved a 40-year-old man who exhibited acute brainstem dysfunction three days after symptom onset, eventually leading to a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. MRI scans of the brain and spine revealed changes consistent with inflammation of the brainstem and upper cervical cord, resulting in a diagnosis of rhombencephalitis. Additionally, a 64-year-old man from China displayed altered mental status, hyperreflexia, and meningeal signs, with fever and respiratory-related symptoms as his primary complaints; testing indicated negative SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF but positive in a throat swab.
The involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in the context of COVID-19 could stem from purely neurologic origins, systemic injury, or a combination of both factors. The neurotropic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are evidenced by the detection of viral presence in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the potential neuroinvasive properties of the virus. This neuroinvasive potential is suggested by the similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which has been known to invade neurons. Other potential mechanisms contributing to CNS damage in COVID-19 include hypoxic injury due to lung complications, an exacerbated systemic immune response leading to a cytokine storm (involving IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, and TNF-alpha), and harm to the endothelium and blood-brain barrier, resulting in vascular damage.
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) has been associated with various viral infections and has been documented as a complication in past viral pandemics, such as those caused by Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and H1N1 influenza viruses. With the ongoing global spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection since early 2020, it is crucial to remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of GBS during the assessment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. While GBS is generally rare, it is a potentially treatable complication that could increase the lethality of the viral infection if not promptly identified.
At the time of this review, 11 cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) potentially linked to SARS-CoV-2 have been documented. The initial case, reported in early-April 2020, involved a 61-year-old woman who had returned to Shanghai from Wuhan in mid-January 2020, just four days before seeking medical attention. Upon admission, she did not exhibit typical signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with normal lung auscultation, leading to no testing for the virus. Her symptoms included progressive fatigue and symmetric weakness in the lower extremities over a day. Initial blood tests revealed low lymphocyte count and thrombocytopenia. Within three days, her symptoms worsened, affecting her upper extremities and accompanied by decreased sensation to touch. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal cell count but elevated protein levels (124 mg/dL). Nerve conduction studies on the fifth day confirmed a diffuse demyelinating process, leading to a GBS diagnosis and initiation of IVIG treatment. Eight days post-admission (11 days post-Wuhan return), she developed a dry cough and fever, with chest CT revealing lung opacities. Subsequent oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient received isolation, supportive care, and antivirals, showing gradual improvement and discharge after 30 days with normal strength and reflexes, no respiratory issues, and a negative SARS-CoV-2 test. While the patient was not initially tested for the virus, the concurrent occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 and GBS suggests a potential causal link. The presentation aligns more with a parainfectious process, given recent travel history and bloodwork, rather than the post-infectious pattern seen in past pandemics like Zika virus. Additionally, speculation arises regarding whether IVIG treatment may have influenced the manifestation of viral symptoms.
The second case, published in mid-April, involved a 65-year-old male patient from Iran who exhibited typical symptoms of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. This occurred two weeks after being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, confirmed through positive RT-PCR and chest CT imaging, and subsequently treated with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and azithromycin. Neurophysiological study indicated an acute axonal polyradiculopathy variant of GBS. However, CSF analysis was not conducted due to a lack of consent. The patient received IVIG treatment (0.4 g/kg/day for five days), with no specific details provided regarding the outcome. Concurrently, another case involved a 54-year-old male who presented with a two-day history of numbness and progressive weakness in his lower extremities. This patient also exhibited fever, cough for the past 10 days, and diarrhea. Neurological examination confirmed an areflexic motor strength deficit. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed through RT-PCR, with chest imaging revealing bilateral basilar lung opacities. Despite the authors not pursuing further paraclinical confirmation, the diagnosis of GBS was presumed based on the clinical presentation. Treatment involved IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day for five days) and hydroxychloroquine, resulting in a positive outcome with improvements in respiratory and neurological status.
The most comprehensive study on this subject originated from Italy, detailing the cases of five patients who were diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) following RT-PCR confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms included lower-limb weakness and paresthesia in four patients, while one patient presented with facial diplegia followed by ataxia and paresthesia, eventually progressing to tetraplegia within a span of 36 hours to four days in four cases. The time lapse between the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS symptoms varied from five to 10 days. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a normal white cell count in all patients, with elevated protein levels in three cases. Electrophysiological assessments indicated an axonal variant of GBS in three patients and a demyelinating process in two. Treatment involved intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for all patients, with one individual requiring a repeated IVIG course and another undergoing plasma exchange. Post-treatment outcomes were diverse: two patients remained in the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation after four weeks, two were still recuperating with notable weakness, and one had been discharged, able to walk independently.
Another Italian report described a case with a parainfectious presentation, marking the unfortunate occurrence of the first fatal case of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) in this context. The patient, a 71-year-old man, exhibited rapidly progressive ascending tetraparesis, paresthesias, and areflexia. Confirmatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and nerve conduction studies revealed a severe form of acute polyradiculoneuritis with prominent demyelinating features. Notably, the patient had also reported a one-week history of fever and dyspnea, prompting testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and a subsequent chest CT, which confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite receiving immediate treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), antiviral therapy (lopinavir and ritonavir), and hydroxychloroquine in an intensive care setting, the patient tragically succumbed to the illness mere hours after admission.
A Spanish report detailed two cases: one exhibited symptoms of anosmia, ageusia, oculomotor palsy, ataxia, areflexia, albuminocytologic dissociation, and tested positive for GD1b-IgG antibodies five days after experiencing cough, malaise, headache, low back pain, and fever, with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection via RT-PCR. The second case involved a 39-year-old man who presented with ageusia, bilateral abducens palsy, areflexia, and albuminocytologic dissociation three days after developing diarrhea and fever, also testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The initial patient received IVIG treatment, and both individuals achieved complete neurological recovery, albeit with residual anosmia and ageusia.
As of the current review, there is compelling evidence supporting a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection, GBS, and its variants. Moreover, the observed higher incidence of axonal damage suggests the potential for more severe manifestations in this context. It is recommended to be vigilant about this particular complication and consider it in the differential diagnosis of individuals presenting with suspected critical-illness polyneuropathy. Conversely, it is also advisable to screen new GBS cases for the virus amidst the ongoing pandemic.
Anosmia or hyposmia denote the absence or reduction of the sense of smell, while ageusia signifies the loss of taste. These conditions, whether anosmia or ageusia, can manifest independently (idiopathic) or in conjunction with structural damage to the nervous system. Various neurological disorders may exhibit olfactory impairment, including head trauma, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. It is more common for 11 to 40% of individuals with upper airway tract infections, the common cold, or influenza to experience anosmia or hyposmia.
Several recent studies have highlighted anosmia and ageusia as prominent clinical features commonly observed in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Giacomelli et al. (47) conducted an assessment using a straightforward questionnaire on 88 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, revealing olfactory or taste disturbances in 33.9% of the patients, with both symptoms concurrently reported in nearly 20% of cases. Notably, 20.3% experienced anosmia prior to hospital admission, while 91% reported ageusia before being hospitalized. Furthermore, the study indicated that these sensory impairments were more prevalent among female and younger patients.
In a broader multicenter study involving 12 centers, Lechien et al. (48) assessed 417 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, noting that 85.6% and 88.0% of patients experienced olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively, with a recovery rate of 44% within a short timeframe. Notably, 11.8% of patients presented with olfactory dysfunction as their initial symptom. Furthermore, the study revealed a significant impact on females compared to males.
Beltrán-Corbellini et al. (49) assessed the prevalence of taste and smell impairments in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, contrasting them with a control group of influenza patients. Their findings revealed a notably higher occurrence of these deficits in SARS-CoV-2 cases compared to the control group. Additionally, a separate study highlighted that individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection could exhibit isolated anosmia, devoid of accompanying upper respiratory infection symptoms or indications (50).
The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying anosmia and ageusia in SARS-CoV-2 remain incompletely understood, although a mouse model has shown the virus's ability to penetrate the olfactory bulb. Additionally, the cells of the oral mucosa contain the ACE2 receptor, which the virus utilizes for cell infiltration. An assumed dopaminergic pathway dysfunction is also implicated in anosmia among SARS-CoV-2 patients. Lastly, there is evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the inner lining of the nasal cavity, leading to localized inflammation.
Anosmia and ageusia are prevalent symptoms in SARS-CoV-2, occurring more frequently than in other upper airway infections, and should be considered as important clinical indicators to prompt further investigation through serology or PCR testing. Currently, there is no targeted treatment for anosmia and ageusia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with recovery being variable and typically expected within two to three weeks for most affected individuals. Subsequent follow-up evaluations will be essential to ascertain whether these symptoms represent transient manifestations or potential long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Myalgia is a prevalent symptom in neurological clinical practice, typically serving as a non-specific indicator of various conditions when considered in isolation. It is crucial to distinguish myalgia from mimics like cramps, commonly linked to peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases, while myalgia more frequently hints at an underlying muscle disorder. The differential diagnosis for myalgia is extensive, encompassing metabolic myopathies to potential side effects from statin usage.
Brazil, along with several other nations, has experienced recent outbreaks of arbovirus infections such as Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viral diseases. These infections are associated with a wide range of neurological complications, including meningoencephalitis, myelitis, radiculitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and myositis. Myalgia, whether in the presence or absence of myositis, stands out as one of the most prevalent symptoms within this group of arboviruses, alongside influenza virus infections.
During the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there have been consistent reports of muscle involvement. Mao et al.'s retrospective observational study of 214 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, noted muscle involvement in 19.3% of patients. Patients with myalgia exhibited higher serum creatine kinase (CK) levels compared to those without muscle symptoms, irrespective of symptom severity. Myalgias were associated with elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts, increased C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels, indicating heightened inflammatory response and blood coagulation function. These patients also displayed multiorgan damage, including more severe liver and kidney abnormalities. However, the study did not delve into other paraclinical markers for assessing the peripheral nervous system, such as nerve conduction studies/electromyography, CSF analysis, and muscle biopsy. Another study from Wuhan involving five patients with pneumonia from co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses revealed that 40% of them experienced myalgia.
Li et al. (61) conducted a systematic literature review search across major online databases between December 2019 and February 2020, encompassing data from 1,994 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Their findings indicated that 35.8% of these cases exhibited symptoms of myalgia or fatigue. However, the study did not include a correlation analysis of these symptoms with any other variables. In a separate study, Huang et al. (62) prospectively gathered data from 41 hospitalized COVID-19 cases, all of whom displayed pneumonia and abnormal chest CT imaging. They noted myalgia or muscle fatigue in 44% of the patients, with a higher prevalence of 54% among those admitted to the ICU. Additionally, elevated serum levels of CK and lactate dehydrogenase were observed in 33% and 73% of all patients, respectively, with figures rising to 46% and 92%, respectively, for ICU patients.
Rhabdomyolysis, characterized by myalgia and fatigue, has been reported in severe cases of COVID-19, potentially impacting renal function. In a study by Han et al., a comparison of 25 adults and seven children with confirmed COVID-19 revealed that myalgia was significantly more prevalent in adults, affecting 52% of the adult population. Interestingly, children exhibited elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels more frequently than adults, with a rate of 57.1% compared to 4% in adults.
In addition to the aforementioned conditions, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with various neurological symptoms, signs, and potential complications. Headache, a common non-specific symptom in upper airway infections and infections in general, has been consistently reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Given the possibility of meningeal involvement and cardiovascular disease as part of the clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is crucial to consider and rule out meningo-encephalitis and cerebral venous thrombosis in infected patients experiencing persistent or refractory headaches. Additionally, although uncommon, Mao et al. reported cases of epilepsy, dizziness, and ataxia in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In conclusion, this review aimed to highlight the primary neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of writing. These manifestations are notably frequent, affecting over a third of hospitalized patients, ranging from mild symptoms like hyposmia and myalgia to severe complications such as encephalopathy and stroke. The available data on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying some of these neurological manifestations in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest the potential neuroinvasive nature of the virus, directly or indirectly impacting the central nervous system (CNS) or the peripheral nervous system (PNS). As the pandemic progresses, further pathological investigations will be crucial to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from neuronal cells, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the endothelium of cerebral vessels. Despite the challenges faced by clinicians managing critically ill patients who are often sedated and dealing with other systemic complications, it is imperative to prioritize the recognition of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Recent publications have begun to address the intuitive concern surrounding the potential interference of disease-modifying agents utilized in the treatment of immunomediated neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and neuromuscular disorders. These findings should be of particular interest to clinicians responsible for the care of patients with these conditions amidst the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
