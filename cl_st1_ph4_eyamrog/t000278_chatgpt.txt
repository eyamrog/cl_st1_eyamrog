The current level of social distancing measures in place to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 is deemed inadequate. To enhance the existing body of knowledge, it is imperative to consider the following points: (1) In the case of an uncommon virus like COVID-19, social distancing measures tend to exhibit a natural inertia; (2) National public announcements play a crucial role in overcoming this inertia and guiding the public towards adopting a new, more effective level of social distancing; (3) In situations where individuals lack sufficient information regarding the ideal social distancing practices, national communication strategies prove to be more impactful than localized efforts.
We examined a model of social distancing, prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, in which individuals prioritize adhering to appropriate social distances and conforming to societal norms. When individuals are uncertain about each other's beliefs regarding the correct social distance, collective social distancing exhibits significant inertia. Specifically, despite individuals correctly reflecting a positive shock towards the appropriate social distance, the overall social distances tend to fall below the optimal level (Proposition 3). Citizens place importance on adhering to social norms, as evidenced by behaviors such as wearing masks while shopping, avoiding physical contact, or refraining from certain activities if others are not following suit. These concerns contribute to inertia, as individuals strive to align their actions with societal expectations, thereby reinforcing established social norms. However, this inertia poses a challenge, as it hinders the adoption of a new, more effective social distancing standard for the benefit of society.
To enhance the current state of affairs, the state can implement our fourth recommendation, which suggests that public declarations regarding the revised ideal degree of social deviation from prominent figures can diminish resistance by fostering fresh shared knowledge. This, in turn, enables individuals to align their behaviors with updated and more suitable standards.
Proposition 5 suggests that in cases where optimal social distance levels exhibit a strong correlation over time and individuals lack adequate information, it is more effective for national communication to be prioritized over local communication. This approach ensures that past social distance norms are given greater emphasis and are not overshadowed by current circumstances.
This finding indicates that publicly transmitted information generates shared knowledge.
Allcott et al. (2020) investigate the perception of risk in the United States and the interplay of these externalities. The significance of individuals prioritizing the welfare of the community over personal interests, as discussed by Dube and Baicker (2020), is crucial for overall well-being. Furthermore, Christensen et al. (2020) shed light on the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone, emphasizing the critical role of trust in local leaders and institutions.
In contrast, our analysis underscores the significance of social norms and strategic uncertainty as contributing factors to counterproductive inertia within collective social distancing behaviors.
Government outcomes vary significantly. Although information alone may not completely address the issue of standard externalities, coherent and reliable public information plays a crucial role in enhancing social distancing. This is achieved by diminishing strategic uncertainty and facilitating citizens in aligning with new norms. National networks play a pivotal role in disseminating information widely, thereby aiding citizens in effectively coordinating their actions in adherence to the emerging social withdrawal standards.
In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, our norms-based model could potentially represent decisions regarding the appropriate level of social distancing. This model operates on the premise that individuals are uncertain about the optimal degree of social distancing and also unsure about the beliefs of others. Additionally, it considers that the ideal level of social distancing demonstrates serial correlation over time. Furthermore, the model acknowledges a human inclination towards conforming to social norms, indicating a desire for alignment with prevailing societal expectations.
An essential implication of our model pertains to social gatherings. The emergence of COVID-19 rendered it inadvisable, from a social welfare standpoint, for individuals to engage in activities like St. Patrick’s Day festivities, spring break excursions, parties, or sporting events. Nevertheless, there was uncertainty among individuals regarding the severity of the threat posed by COVID-19. Importantly, if individuals perceived that others might view the threat as minimal and consequently persist in gathering, they also had motivations to follow suit. This led to an unfavorable state of inertia, where individuals persisted in their previous behaviors, ultimately detrimentally impacting social welfare.
Similar arguments apply to social practices like handshaking, kissing, and other forms of physical social greetings. It can be uncomfortable to decline an extended hand, as evidenced in a recent presidential press briefing, thus reinforcing a pressure for social conformity that aligns with our modeled behaviors. The ambiguity surrounding others' attitudes towards COVID-19 has led to a regrettable stagnation in physical social greetings.
Our model is also applicable in professional environments. When employees perceive that showing up at the office signifies dedication or drive, it generates a social expectation for them to maintain their physical presence at work, mirroring their managers or supervisors. Faced with this societal pressure, the model posits that there will be a reluctance to change, resulting in individuals persisting in attending the workplace at levels that are inefficiently high, particularly in the initial stages of a viral outbreak.
The model also aids in comprehending inertia in social distancing and its policy implications, not solely during the initial emergence of a contagious virus but also at any juncture where there is a significant shift in the required degree of social distancing.
We employ a standard "beauty contest" model where individuals strive to take actions that align with an uncertain state of the world (the correct action) while staying close to the average action in the population. Subsequent literature has delved into the welfare implications of this concept and its relevance for optimal communication (Morris and Shin, 2007; Angeletos and Pavan, 2007). This framework has been utilized to investigate a broad array of subjects ranging from monetary policy (Lorenzoni, 2010) to leadership in party conferences (Dewan and Myatt, 2007), organizations (Bolton et al., 2013), and judiciaries (Shadmehr et al., 2019). Our study offers an application in the realm of disease control and public health policy.
Our study is situated within the game theoretic discourse on social norms, drawing on Acemoglu and Jackson’s (2017) conceptualization of social norms as the distribution of anticipated payoff-relevant behavior (p. 246). Within our model, a distinct equilibrium emerges, with social norms denoting the average (social distancing) conduct of the populace. In scenarios where agents possess varying levels of information, the projected average behavior hinges on individual knowledge. We conceptualize individuals' inclination to adhere to social norms as a tendency to align with expected behaviors, as evidenced in the actions of others. The complexity posed by a global health crisis lies in the uncertainty it generates regarding societal expectations and behaviors, prompting individuals to rely on outdated and unsuitable behavioral norms.
In contrast to the aforementioned papers, agents within our setting grapple with uncertainty regarding the appropriate course of action and the information possessed by their peers in a dynamic environment. While Acemoglu and Jackson (2015, 2017) delve into the dynamics of cooperation and adherence, our research hones in on the tendencies towards inertia and exaggerated responses to public information within a context where the ideal collective behavior undergoes continual evolution. Our primary emphasis lies on exploring the implications of these behaviors on policy-making processes.
In this study, we investigate the behavioral patterns of citizens in relation to their considerations of making appropriate decisions and conforming to social norms. It is important to note that citizens exist on a spectrum, and the actions of an individual citizen do not significantly impact the overall outcome, whether in the present or in subsequent periods. Therefore, the primary connection between these periods lies in the dissemination of information. As outlined in equation (1), citizen i determines their level of social distancing based on certain factors.
Citizens commonly believe that the correct course of action today aligns with what was deemed correct yesterday, as indicated by the model θt ∼ N (θt−1, σu). This leads to an overemphasis on past actions, causing today's collective decisions to be skewed towards those of the previous day. Consequently, in the aftermath of a significant positive event, such as the impact of COVID-19 on social distancing norms, the overall societal response may fall short of what is actually deemed appropriate.
In each period t, citizens receive both their private signals xit and a public signal pt = θt + ηt, where ηt follows an independent and identically distributed normal distribution with mean 0 and variance ση. This public signal could stem from information disseminated by the government. Proposition 2 and equation (4) remain valid as they are not contingent on the specifics of the information received. Nevertheless, the introduction of public signals alters the level of inertia in aggregate social distancing.
Proposition 4 demonstrates that, post-shock, an informed leader possesses the ability to transmit a public signal that aids in shaping public expectations regarding the optimal collective behavior, consequently diminishing the inertia associated with social distancing compliance driven by conformity pressures. The effectiveness of this signal in reducing inertia is directly proportional to the clarity of the message, indicated by a lower value of ση.
Considering the exaggerated responses of citizens to public messages as outlined earlier, it prompts the question of whether there exists a more effective method for the government to disseminate information. Could it be more advantageous for citizens to receive equivalent information, albeit in a private manner rather than through public channels? For instance, it might be more beneficial for employers or local authorities to furnish individuals with private information instead of having everyone exposed to the same public information during a presidential address or press briefing.
When citizens perceive the past as highly informative about the present (σu small) or feel privately poorly-informed (σE large), they tend to rely excessively on their past experiences. In such instances, it is more effective for the government to communicate publicly rather than privately. This is because citizens tend to overreact to public messages from the government, which, paradoxically, helps to mitigate their exaggerated responses to past experiences. Conversely, when citizens view the past as relatively uninformative (σu large) or consider themselves well-informed privately (σE small), the government should opt for private communication strategies.
In the context of social distancing amidst a novel and uncommon infectious disease outbreak, individuals are often inundated with noisy information (characterized by a large σE), while the appropriate level of social distancing remains relatively fixed (with a low σu, given the unusual nature of the disease as a shock). Consequently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is observed that clear and consistent public pronouncements from a national leader prove more impactful than those from local authorities or employers. This effectiveness does not stem from superior information possessed by the national government, but rather from the fact that unambiguous national directives tend to elicit an exaggerated response that helps counteract the inertia resulting from the excessive influence of past behaviors and societal norms.
