Abstract 
 
Background: COVID-19 was declared pandemic on March 11. By April 18, over 
150,000 people had died around the world. Here we compare mortality statistics due to 
COVID-19 worldwide, by adjusting for the size of the population and the stage of the 
pandemic.  
Methods: Data from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and Our 
World in Data websites were used. Analyses are based on number of deaths per one 
million inhabitants. In order to account for the stage of the pandemic, the baseline date 
was defined as the day in which the 10th death was reported. The analyses included 78 
countries and territories which reported 10 or more deaths by April 9.  
Results: Mortality statistics varied remarkably worldwide. On day 10, India had 0.06 
deaths per million, Belgium had 30.46 and San Marino 618.78. On day 20, India had 
0.27 deaths per million, China had 0.71 and Spain 139.62. On day 30, four Asian 
countries had the lowest mortality figures, whereas eight European countries had the 
highest ones. In Italy and Spain, mortality on day 40 was greater than 250 per million, 
whereas in China and South Korea, mortality was below 4 per million.  Mortality on 
day 10 was moderately correlated with life expectancy (rho 0.53; P<0.001), but not with 
population density (rho 0.12; P=0.31). 
Conclusions: Asian countries presented much lower mortality figures as compared to 
European ones. Life expectancy was found to be correlated with mortality.

Resumo 
 
Introdução: A COVID-19 foi declarada uma pandemia em 11 de março. Até o dia 18 
de abril, há haviam falecido mais de 150.000 pessoas ao redor do mundo. Neste artigo, 
são comparadas as estatísticas de mortalidade por COVID-19 no mundo, ajustando-se 
para o tamanho da população e para o estágio da pandemia em cada país.  
Métodos: Dados dos websites do Centro para o Controle e Prevenção de Doenças da 
Europa e do Our World in Data foram utilizados. As análises são baseadas no número 
de mortes por um milhão de habitantes. Para levar em consideração o estágio da 
pandemia, definiu-se como linha de base a data da décima morte em cada país. As 
análises incluíram 78 países e territórios com 10 ou mais mortes relatadas até o dia 09 
de abril.  
Resultados: As taxas de mortalidade variaram consideravelmente ao redor do mundo.  
No dia 10, a Índia tinha 0,06 mortes por um milhão, a Bélgica tinha 30,46 e San Marino 
tinha 618,78. No dia 20, a Índia tinha 0,27 mortes por um milhão, a China 0,71 e a 
Espanha 139,62. No dia 30, quatro países da Ásia tinham as menores taxas de 
mortalidade, enquanto oito países europeus tinham as maiores. Na Itália e na Espanha, a 
mortalidade no dia 40 era maior do que 250 por um milhão, enquanto na China e na 
Coréia do Sul, era abaixo de 4 por um milhão. A mortalidade no dia 10 correlacionou-se 
moderadamente com a expectativa de vida (rho 0,53; P<0,001), mas não mostrou 
correlação com a densidade populacional (rho 0,12; P=0,31). 
Conclusões: Os países asiáticos apresentaram taxas de mortalidade muito menores do 
que aquelas observadas nos países europeus. A expectativa de vida correlacionou-se 
com a mortalidade.

Introduction 
 
COVID-19, the disease produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was first reported in China 
in late 2019. After being declared by the World Health Organization as an international 
health emergency on January 30, 2020, COVID-19 was declared pandemic on March 11, 
2020.1 Less than six months after the first case, over 150,000 people died around the 
world (as of April 18, 2020). In a single day (April 16, 2020), almost 5,000 people lost 
their lives in the United States due to COVID-19.2    
 
Official statistics on the number of COVID-19 cases are severely biased.3 First, testing 
policies vary around the globe, with most countries testing only symptomatic patients, 
particularly the ones with more severe symptoms. Second, the availability of tests is not 
compatible with the demand. Consequently, looking at official statistics on confirmed 
cases is a perfect analogy to an iceberg. The part of it that our eyes can see is just a small 
fraction of the real size of the iceberg. A recent report using data from a population sample  
of 4,189 individuals in South Brazil estimated that the estimated number of cases is 7-8 
times greater than the number of notified cases.4 In Santa Clara, US, the estimated number 
of cases was 50-85 times greater than the number of registered cases.3 In summary, 
dealing with the number of confirmed cases is misleading, due to the lack of a proper 
denominator.5 
 
Official statistics on deaths represent a much more reliable platform to understand the 
dynamics of COVID-19. In this article, we compare mortality statistics due to COVID-
19 worldwide, by adjusting for the size of the population and the stage of the pandemic 
in each country. We also present the correlation between mortality and (a) life 
expectancy; (b) population density. By using these methods, we disentangle 
misinterpretation and fake news from scientific evidence.  
 
Methods 
 
Data used in this analysis are freely available at the European Centre for Disease 
Control and Prevention, and the Our World in Data websites. All analyses are based on 
number of deaths per one million inhabitants. In order to take into account the stage of 
the pandemic, the baseline date for each country was set as the day in which the 10th 
death was reported in that particular country. Mortality statistics are presented for days 
10, 20, 30 and 40 since the 10th death.  
 
We excluded from our analysis the 125 countries and territories that have reported less 
than 10 deaths by April 18, 2020, as well as those in which the 10th death was reported 
after April 8, 2020. Excluded countries and territories were: Angola, Anguilla, Antigua 
and Barbuda, Armenia, Aruba, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrein, Barbados, Belize, Benin, 
Bermuda, Bhutan, Boner Saint Eustatius and Saba, Botswana, British Virgin Island, 
Brunei Darussalam, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Cayman Islands, 
Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Costa Rica, Cote D’Ivoire, Curacao, Djibouti, 
Dominica, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Falkland Islands, 
Faroe Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Gibraltar, 
Greenland, Grenada, Guam, Guatemala, Guernsey, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, 
Haiti, Holy Sea, Iceland, Isle of Man, Jamaica, Jersey, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, 
Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Latvia, Liberia, Libya, Liechtenstein,  Madagascar, 
Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Monaco, Mongolia, 
Montenegro, Montserrat, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, New Caledonia, 
New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Northern Mariana Islands, Oman, Palestine, Papua 
New Guinea, Paraguay, Qatar, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, 
Singapore, Saint Maarten, Slovakia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, 
Suriname, Syria, Taiwan, Timor Leste, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, 
Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, United States Virgin Islands, Uruguay, 
Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.   
 
We also obtained freely available statistics from the United Nations on life expectancy, 
and from the World Bank on population density. Life expectancy data were not 
available for Puerto Rico and San Marino, and therefore, we obtained them from 
different sources (Puerto Rico: Statista.com; San Marino: Indexmundi.com). We plotted 
mortality on day 10 since the 10th death in each country with (a) life expectancy; and (b) 
population density, as well as calculated Spearman’s correlation coefficients (rho).  
 
Results 
 
Table 1 lists the 78 countries and territories included in the analysis by alphabetical 
order. The mortality variation was remarkably high: on day 10 since the 10th death, 17 
countries (21.8%) presented mortality below one per million, and 19 (24.4%) above 10 
per million. Numbers were extremely high in two small areas: San Marino, with a 
population of 33.8 thousand inhabitants presented a mortality of 618.78 per million. In 
Andorra, with a population of 77.0 thousand people, mortality on day 10 since the 10th 
death was 336.50 per million.    
 
For 48 countries and territories, information on mortality on day 20 since the 10th death 
was available. Only China, India, Indonesia, Japan and Pakistan had a mortality below 
one per million inhabitants on day 20. More than half of the countries (54.2%) 
presented mortality figures on day 20 above 10 per million. The highest values were 
found in Europe: Luxembourg (110.23 per million), Spain (139.62 per million), 
Belgium (175.59 per million), and San Marino (942.90 per million). 
 
Only 17 countries and territories achieved day 30 since the 10th death. Four Asian 
countries (Japan: 0.67 per million; China:1.55 per million; South Korea: 2.71 per 
million; and Philippines: 3.06 per million) had the lowest mortality figures. Italy 
(135.04 per million), France (136.52 per million), Sweden (138.62 per million) 
Netherlands (164.75 per million), United Kingdom (166.88 per million), Spain (311.13 
per million), Belgium (445.48 per million), and San Marino (1,119.69) presented the 
highest mortality figures on day 30 since the 10th death. 
 
Although the absolute number of deaths in San Marino on April 18, 2020 (N=39) might 
appear low, it represents 0.12% of its entire population. Would this catastrophic figure 
of 0.12% happen in other places, it would represent millions of deaths in populous 
countries, such as China, India, United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, Nigeria, 
Bangladesh, Mexico and Japan.  
 
The six countries which achieved day 40 since the 10th death showed remarkable 
differences in mortality (Figure 1). In both Italy and Spain, mortality was greater than 
250 per million, whereas in China and South Korea, mortality was below 4 per million. 
Iran (41.10 per million) and the United States (71.45 per million) presented intermediate 
values.   
 
In Figure 2, we compare mortality per million figures on days 10, 20 and 30 for the 16 
countries with data, except San Marino. Belgium and Spain presented similar curves, 
but from day 20 to 30, the difference became larger. United Kingdom and Netherlands 
came next, with the difference that from day 20 to 30, the increase was much larger in 
the United Kingdom. Curves for the Asian countries were similar, with mortality figures 
much lower as compared to those observed in European countries or the United States.  
 
Figure 3 presents ecological data on mortality on day 10 since the 10th death and life 
expectancy. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was 0.53 (P<0.001). No correlation was 
found between mortality on day 10 since the 10th death and population density (rho 
0.12; P=0.31). 
 
Discussion 
 
All analyses presented in this article refer to the number of deaths. Although some 
degree of underreporting due to insufficient testing is possible, mortality statistics are 
much more reliable than those on number of cases. Recent serological studies in South 
Brazil4 and Santa Clara, United States,3 suggested that each confirmed case represents 
many more real cases at the population level. Recently, data from massive testing in 
Iceland were published.6 While 13.3% of those recruited for targeted testing had 
positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the figure in the general population 
was 0.8%. In order to help overcome this limitation, serological surveys with population 
samples are urgently required. Another report showed that 86% of COVID-19 
infections were undocumented, contributing to the rapid dissemination of the virus.7 It is 
also important to keep in mind that, until reliable prevalence estimates are not available, 
case fatality is another statistic that should not be used at this stage, because the 
denominator (number of cases) is unavailable.  
 
Two issues that are easily depicted by scientists should be widely disseminated to the 
public and to politicians, to avoid misinterpretation and misguided policies. First, 
analyzing the absolute number of deaths is misleading. For example, as of April 18, 
2020, China ranks 7th in the absolute number of deaths. However, when adjusting for its 
population, there are around 80 countries and territories with higher mortality rates per 
million, as compared to China. Second, adjusting for the stage of the pandemic in each 
setting is also essential to correctly interpreting COVID-19 statistics. In this article, we 
opted to take the date of the 10th death as the baseline figure. Again, ignoring this figure 
would lead to biased conclusions. For example, when comparing Italy and Spain only, 
mortality figures were higher in Italy than in Spain until April 5, 2020 if we ignore the 
stage of the pandemic in each country. However, the 10th death in Italy took place on 
February 26, whereas it happened on March 10 in Spain. When we adjust for the stage 
of the pandemic, figures were higher in Spain than in Italy all the time (10.10 vs. 3.26 
per million, respectively, on day 10; 58.52 vs. 35.69 per million, respectively, on day 
20; and 138.62 vs. 135.04 per million, respectively, on day 30).   
 
On one hand, we found life expectancy to be moderately correlated with mortality. This 
finding is in accordance with previous studies showing increasing fatality rates with 
increasing age.2 On the other hand, we found no evidence of an ecological association 
between mortality and population density, despite the fact that the highest mortality 
figures on day 10 since the 10th death were observed in two small areas (San Marino 
and Andorra).   
 
In conclusion, Asian countries presented much lower mortality figures as compared to 
European ones. Although life expectancy was correlated with mortality, its correlation 
with mortality was just moderate, so that there are other factors contributing to these 
differences. Likely explanations are the implementation and adherence to social 
distancing measures, testing policies and health system structures.
