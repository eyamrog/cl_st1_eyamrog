The increasing interest in WhatsApp as a social platform for pedagogical endeavors necessitates a deeper understanding of the role of emojis as an emerging language on the Internet, particularly as mobile technologies become more integrated into educational settings. This study, detailed in the paper, utilized an embedded correlational mixed methods design to investigate the emojis utilized to enhance cognitive, teaching, and social aspects within a teacher education course conducted through WhatsApp. Additionally, the research aimed to explore participants' attitudes towards emoji usage and how age and gender might influence this usage. Analysis of the data derived from teacher interactions on WhatsApp was conducted in alignment with Garrison et al.'s (1999) Community of Inquiry Model, a framework that highlights essential components for successful online educational experiences, emphasizing the interplay of social, cognitive, and teaching presences. The results indicate that emojis can effectively bolster teaching, cognitive, and social presences, with their prevalence appearing to be influenced by cultural and gender factors.
The Internet has revolutionized communication, with the advent of the Web and digital technologies giving rise to a unique language phenomenon in online interactions, distinct from traditional modes of communication, encompassing elements of speech, writing, and electronically mediated properties (Crystal, 2004, p. 48). Initially, various forms of language emerged in asynchronous communication, such as emoticons (short for emotion icons) like :-) for happiness and :-( for sadness. However, contemporary technological advancements have facilitated the development of emojis, now widely utilized in social media, SMS, Messenger, and mobile applications such as WhatsApp, to convey emotions and convey various meanings.
The term "emoji" is a fusion of Japanese terms, and while many believe its similarity to the English words "emotion" and "emoticon" is coincidental, there may indeed be underlying connections, as is often the case with words across different languages. The first emoticon, the simple smiley face :-) was introduced in 1982 by Dr. Scott Fahlman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Today, emoticons and emojis have seamlessly integrated into our daily communication practices. Originally crafted for mobile devices, these updated miniature images serve as a means to convey emotions within text-based conversations. Their rapid rise in popularity has transformed them into a universal form of communication and visual cues within digital culture. From the inception of face-based emojis, the library of available emojis has expanded to include a wide array of categories such as animals, food, and various other pictorial representations (Alshenqeeti, 2016).
Informal written language is increasingly becoming multimodal, as highlighted by Paiva (2016). Paiva's analysis of emojis in social media suggests that emojis serve as a means to convey meaning efficiently in certain interactions. The advent of emojis, facilitated by mobile applications and emoji keyboards, has revolutionized communication on various social media platforms such as Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. A growing body of research is dedicated to deciphering the significance of emojis in digital communication. Studies indicate that despite the visual similarities among emojis, their interpretation is shaped by individuals' cultural backgrounds, gender disparities, and unique visual attributes, thereby establishing a distinct language for communication (Bai, Dan, Mu, & Yang, 2019). Fullwood, Orchard, and Floyd (2013) delved into the use of emojis in Internet chat rooms, discovering that emoticons are utilized across all age groups to express emotions in communication. Their investigation also revealed gender-specific patterns in emoji usage, with female participants displaying a higher tendency to employ expressive emoticons, particularly in direct interactions with others.
Since its introduction to the market in 2009, WhatsApp has experienced a steady increase in popularity. Initially utilized primarily for communication purposes, the app has evolved into a versatile tool capable of facilitating educational experiences. Its widespread availability and mobile functionality, combined with its diverse features for generating and distributing oral, written, and multimedia materials, as well as the ability to respond to and share posts, have captured the attention of educators, particularly in language education, prompting them to incorporate this platform into their teaching and learning practices.
The increasing utilization of WhatsApp as a social platform for facilitating pedagogical endeavors underscores the necessity of comprehending the significance of emojis in communication platforms, particularly in the context of integrating mobile devices and applications within educational settings. Understanding the role of emojis is crucial as they can provide valuable insights into the development of learning communities within educational environments and shed light on the significance of non-verbal and multimodal communication in online educational experiences facilitated through mobile devices.
One of the seminal studies that significantly impacted the understanding of online learning quality was the Community of Inquiry (CoI) Model by Garrison, Anderson, and Archer (1999). This framework was designed to pinpoint essential components for effective text-based communication in online educational settings, operating under the premise that learning is fostered through the interplay of three fundamental elements: social presence, cognitive presence, and teaching presence. While their research acknowledged the significance of emoticons in forum interactions, exploring the influence of emerging languages in educational contexts facilitated by mobile devices could enrich conversations surrounding online communication. Scholars have since delved into various modes of communication in online learning through the lens of the CoI model, as evidenced by studies conducted by Micsky and Foels (2019) and Rath (2012).
Utilizing the CoI model as a framework, this embedded correlational study aims to achieve three primary objectives: firstly, to identify the types of emojis employed to bolster cognitive, teaching, and social presences within an 8-week continuing education program centered on mobile device usage and applications through WhatsApp; secondly, to examine the correlation between participants' attitudes and the utilization of emojis for cognitive, teaching, and social presences throughout the course; and lastly, to investigate how participants' age and gender may influence and potentially elucidate their emoji usage patterns. To fulfill these objectives, this paper provides a concise overview of the Community of Inquiry (CoI) Model.
According to Garrison et al. (1999), cognitive presence is a crucial component of critical thinking, often portrayed as the primary objective of higher education. This presence manifests in asynchronous written communication as students share information, link ideas, and implement new concepts. Garrison et al. further assert that cognitive presence is a fundamental aspect within the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, emerging as participants engage in sustained communication to collectively construct meaning.
Social presence, as defined by Garrison et al. (1999), refers to the capacity of participants within a community of inquiry to project themselves socially and emotionally, embodying their complete personalities through the communication medium employed (p. 94). Within online text-based communication, indicators of social presence include emotion expressions, risk-free expression, fostering group cohesion, acknowledging others, and promoting collaboration, as outlined in Table 1.
An essential aspect of fostering social presence in face-to-face interactions involves the utilization of visual cues by individuals. However, in online settings, where individuals may not have had prior in-person interactions, establishing social presence can be challenging. Kuehn (1993) and Walther (1994) have outlined strategies through which participants can forge connections by incorporating emoticons or other symbols to infuse affective elements into computer-mediated conversations. These resources have proven instrumental in cultivating social presence and enhancing the online experience by integrating emoticons (Bai, Dan, Mu, & Yang, 2019).
Garrison and Arbaugh (2007) posit that research into the impact of student group cohesiveness and interaction on team effectiveness indicates a significant correlation between social presence and learning outcomes. Drawing on investigations by Molinari (2010), Celani and Collins (2005), and Beuchot and Bullen (2005), the authors assert that social presence serves as a cornerstone for cognitive presence (Whiteside, 2015). Recent studies, including those by d’Alessio et al. (2019) and Rolim et al. (2019), further support the notion that social presence is closely intertwined with cognitive presence.
According to Garrison et al. (1999), the presence of a teacher is crucial for fostering appropriate cognitive and social presence in online learning environments, involving tasks such as defining discussion topics and facilitating understanding. Chen, Lei, and Cheng's (2019) study, which utilized peer-facilitation techniques, demonstrated that teacher presence can impact the cognitive presence within online classes. The involvement of peer facilitators, particularly in posing specific types of questions, was found to influence the cognitive presence levels. Braga (2007) also suggests that discussion facilitation in online education can be a shared responsibility, with participants taking on roles traditionally held by teachers, such as encouraging discussions, identifying commonalities and differences, and introducing new ideas.
Given the positive reception of the model among scholars and educators for assessing cognitive, social, and teaching presences, as well as its recognition of various language forms including emoticons, we believe that it can effectively be employed to scrutinize the significance of emojis in interactions within online educational contexts facilitated through platforms like WhatsApp.
The research context involved an 8-week continuing education course that centered on the utilization of mobile devices in language learning. This course, which was a component of a project conducted by the School of Letters at a renowned university in Brazil, was specifically designed for K-12 in-service English teachers hailing from various regions across the country. Given the substantial enrollment of teachers (N = 227), six groups were established and facilitated concurrently.
The map illustrates that the largest number of participants hails from the South East and North East regions of the country. It is noteworthy to highlight the efficacy of mobile applications, particularly WhatsApp, in engaging and mobilizing individuals from diverse geographical locations. In a vast country like Brazil, the course on mobile learning successfully attracted participants from both urban and rural areas, showcasing the inclusive reach of such technology.
All participants underwent a 10-question presurvey before commencing the course, comprising four demographic inquiries (such as name, location, age, gender) and six 5-point Likert scale queries concerning their perspectives on the utilization of mobile devices for educational purposes. Following the 8-week course, participants were administered a post survey containing three questions regarding their preparedness to utilize and integrate mobile devices for educational purposes. The presurvey and postsurvey questions were drawn from the Mobile Learning Survey, initially modified by Gunter and Reeves (2017) to assess educators' attitudes towards online professional development integrated with mobile learning. The internal consistency reliability for the attitude inquiries was deemed acceptable (r = .70 for presurvey items and r = .77 for postsurvey items) as reported by Gunter and Reeves (2017).
This study utilized an embedded correlational mixed methods design, as outlined by Creswell and Plano Clark (2018), where quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis are integrated with a traditional quantitative or qualitative approach. Unlike typical mixed methods designs aiming to merge data sets, here the goal is to address distinct research inquiries. In this research, quantitative data collection and analysis were incorporated within qualitative data collection and analysis. Qualitative data involved gathering transcripts from the WhatsApp course, which were then coded using the CoI framework. Qualitative analysis of emoji usage was conducted through Emoji word clouds, accompanied by detailed participant descriptions to bolster key findings. Subsequently, participants' emoji usage was quantified and correlated with their attitudes based on pre and post survey responses. Furthermore, the correlation between participants' age and emoji usage was examined to ascertain any potential influence of age on emoji usage patterns. Lastly, a comparison of emoji usage between male and female participants was conducted to determine if gender played a significant role in participants' emoji usage. The study was guided by the following research questions:
What types of emojis are utilized to enhance cognitive, teaching, and social presences within an 8-week continuing education course focused on the utilization of mobile devices and applications through WhatsApp?
How do participants' attitudes towards the use of emojis correlate with cognitive, teaching, and social presences in the context of this course conducted through WhatsApp?
c) How do participants' age and gender correlate with and potentially elucidate their emoji usage patterns?
At the onset of the course, all participants completed a presurvey to assess their attitudes towards mobile devices, alongside a demographic questionnaire. The course spanned an 8-week duration and was facilitated through WhatsApp. The instructional tasks were structured around three key components: i) acquainting participants with various mobile applications and WhatsApp features (e.g., location sharing, audio messaging, text communication) and fostering an understanding of prevalent genres on mobile platforms like selfies and memes; ii) creating materials that leveraged the capabilities of mobile devices, including cameras and GPS functionalities; and iii) engaging in discussions about potential approaches to mobile learning (m-learning). Upon completion of the 8-week course, participants were administered a post survey to gauge any shifts in their attitudes towards mobile devices.
Following the 8-week course, transcripts from each group were extracted from WhatsApp and organized in an Excel spreadsheet. These written exchanges served as the basis for analyzing the emojis, aiding in their classification as cognitive, teaching, or social presence indicators. All emojis utilized within the group interactions were meticulously coded according to the CoI categories and indicators outlined in Table 1. In instances where a single emoji was employed as the sole representation in an interaction, the coding process was informed by the ongoing discussion at the time of its usage. Subsequently, the interactions across the six groups (Group 1 - 1962 posts, Group 2 - 1895 posts, Group 3 - 1180 posts, Group 4 - 1436 posts, Group 5 - 1303 posts, Group 6 - 1492 posts) underwent validation by two of the authors involved in this study.
Upon completion of the coding process, it was revealed that a total of 117 distinct emojis were utilized by the participants throughout the 8-week course. To address the initial research query and ascertain the categories of emojis employed to bolster cognitive, social, and teaching presence within the course interactions, frequencies were calculated for each emoji type. Specifically, the frequency of each emoji type (e.g., 😊 or 😂) was tallied within every group and then aggregated for each Community of Inquiry (CoI) category (e.g., Triggering Event or Emotional Expression). The usage of emojis within each CoI category was amalgamated to yield an overall count for each CoI element (or presence type; refer to Table 1). This process was repeated for all six groups, and the totals were combined to obtain an overall count. Essentially, the frequency of each unique emoji was tabulated within and across the six groups for each CoI category. Subsequently, each CoI category was grouped under the CoI Element (i.e., cognitive, teaching, or social) to determine the total frequency of emoji usage for each presence type. Upon completion of this analysis, a total of 2,079 emojis were employed across the groups to signify cognitive, teaching, and social presence during the course. Emoji clouds were generated to visually represent the data, and detailed descriptions extracted from the WhatsApp course interactions were incorporated to elucidate how the diverse emojis were utilized to reinforce each presence category.
To address the second research question concerning the relationship between participants' attitudes and their emoji usage, Spearman Rho analyses were performed on the posttest scores and emoji usage of the 61 participants who completed both the pretest and posttest assessments. This limited sample size necessitated focusing solely on these participants to provide insights into the second and third research questions. To investigate the third research question regarding the influence of age and gender on emoji usage, Spearman Rho analyses were carried out on age and emoji usage, while independent samples t-tests were conducted using gender as the independent variable and emoji usage as the dependent variable.
Frequency distributions were conducted to determine the types of emojis utilized to support cognitive, teaching, and social presences, with results detailed in Appendix A. The most frequently employed emojis across all three presences were identified as the Clapping Hands emoji (n = 287), the Winking Face emoji (n = 251), the Thumbs-Up emoji (n = 139), the Face With Tears of Joy emoji (n = 121), the Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes emoji (n = 120), the Smiling Face emoji (n = 112), the Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes and Hearts emoji (n = 111), and the Rolling On The Floor Laughing emoji (n = 41). For a comprehensive breakdown of the frequencies for each type of emoji used by participants, please refer to Appendix A.
Table 2 illustrates the original meanings of the most commonly used emojis identified in the interactions throughout the continuing education course. The table encompasses the interpretations of emojis that surfaced most frequently in cognitive presence, teaching presence, and social presence. It is crucial to acknowledge that despite the abundance of emojis utilized to convey social presence, there were additional emojis (e.g., 😊 n = 77; 😂 n = 71; 😍 n = 59, 😁 n = 58, 😅 n = 56; 😎 n = 47) that were employed more often than the Rolling On The Floor Laughing emoji, yet did not emerge as one of the top emojis for cognitive, teaching, or social presence, hence their exclusion from Table 2.
In order to ascertain the types of emojis utilized to enhance cognitive presence, frequency distributions were conducted on all interactions. The findings revealed that the Clapping Hands emoji was the most commonly employed emoji (n = 105 times) for cognitive presence, followed by the Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes emoji (n = 51 times), Thumbs-Up emoji (n = 47 times), Smiling Face emoji (n = 47 times), Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes And Three Hearts emoji (n = 40 times), Winking Face emoji (n = 37 times), Face With Tears of Joy emoji (n = 33 times), Slightly Smiling Face emoji (n = 71), and Smiling Face with Heart-Eyes emoji (n = 24 times; refer to Appendix A for details). The data is visually represented as an emoji cloud in Figure 2, where the size of each emoji corresponds to its frequency of use by participants.
As indicated in the analysis, the Clapping Hands emoji emerged as the most commonly utilized emoji to bolster cognitive presence. In order to delve into the ways in which emojis were employed to enhance cognitive presence, detailed descriptions extracted from the text (specifically, interactions within the WhatsApp course) have been incorporated. An illustrative instance from Group 2 (classified as integration) showcases Participant C utilizing this emoji subsequent to being motivated by fellow participants to develop his own educational materials.
In the second example, a discussion unfolds regarding the utilization of GPS for pedagogical objectives within Group 3. Participant B contributes his insights to the discourse, offering commendation for Participant A's proposals on incorporating GPS into the classroom. Participant B employs the Smirking Face With Starry Eyes emoji and the Clapping Hands emoji to bolster cognitive engagement. These emoticons visually underscore the coherence and progression of ideas within the ongoing discussions.
In Group 6, Participant B expressed appreciation for the discussions on raising awareness of fake news in the language classroom by using emojis like Clapping Hands, Smiling Face, and Thumbs-Up. These symbols not only conveyed gratitude but also signaled the participant's intention to implement the discussed strategies in their own teaching practice. Such non-verbal cues were categorized as indicators of resolution within the Community of Inquiry framework.
Various cognitive manifestations were observed in all six groups over the duration of the course, contributing to the facilitation of communication. This was evident in the instances outlined in Table 3, where participants engaged in activities such as resolving uncertainties, delving into diverse experiences and information, amalgamating concepts from specific contexts within their interactions, and incorporating fresh ideas into their teaching methodologies.
The interconnectedness of ideas, the sharing of information, and the generation of novel concepts for implementation in the language learning environment resulting from these interactions not only demonstrate the construction of meaning but also underscore the capacity of WhatsApp to facilitate educational experiences.
Frequency distributions were analyzed for all interactions to identify the types of emojis utilized to enhance teaching presence. The most commonly used emojis to represent teaching presence included the Winking Face emoji (n = 56), Clapping Hands emoji (n = 29), Face With Tears of Joy emoji (n = 20), Thumbs-Up emoji (n = 18), Rolling On The Floor Laughing emoji (n = 14), Beaming Face with Smiling Eyes emoji (n = 13), Smiling Face with Hearts emoji (n = 12), Smiling Face with Heart-Eyes emoji (n = 12), Backhand Index Pointing Up emoji (n = 12), and Face Blowing a Kiss emoji (n = 10) (refer to Appendix A). These findings are visually represented in Figure 3 as an emoji cloud.
Interactions on WhatsApp, being instantaneous and conducive to immediate responses, showcased teaching presence not just from instructors but also from participants who were actively engaged and willing to contribute. Throughout the course, the Mobile Phone emoji was consistently employed whenever teachers and tutors engaged with the group. This deliberate use of the emoji aimed to assist participants in recognizing and distinguishing the teachers' posts, tasks, or interventions, thereby aiding in their comprehension of a specific digital genre. However, since this emoji was intentionally utilized as a pedagogical tool and was not a natural outcome of course interactions, it was not categorized as teaching presence and was consequently not subjected to analysis as such.
In the data analyses and cloud maps, various types of emojis were recognized as indicators of teaching presence. The Winking Face emoji emerged as a common tool to soften the effect of interventions, including confirming and understanding tasks, prompting participants' input, and maintaining discussion focus on the task at hand. An instance showcasing this emoji's role in stimulating participants' contributions in Group 1 is provided. Additionally, the Smiling Face emoji was frequently employed to acknowledge the contributions made by participants.
The subsequent example illustrates that frequently, the course participants assumed the role of a teacher within the course. In a post from Group 3, Participant B went as far as to mimic the Mobile Phone emoji commonly utilized by instructors to recommend apps and articles for the assignment. Additionally, B incorporated the Up Pointing Index emoji and the Smiling Face emoji in their posts to motivate their peer in task development.
In line with the discussions surrounding the intersection of cognitive and social presence, interactions categorized under teaching presence also prominently featured the use of emojis. These visual elements played a crucial role in enabling both educators and facilitators to engage in interventions, as well as empowering participants to initiate their own interventions.
Teaching and instructional manifestations, primarily instigated by educators and mentors, as illustrated in Table 4, were also discernible in interactions shared by course participants. These manifestations occurred throughout instructional management, concept formation, and direct teaching.
Throughout the posts, social presence encouraged participants to assume the role of a teacher, a positive aspect within the social environment of WhatsApp. The dynamic nature and high volume of messages often necessitate a participant to be readily available to take charge, as evidenced in the provided excerpts. The organization and facilitation of class management and instruction highlight the significant role of social presence in bolstering teaching presence.
Frequency distributions were conducted on all interactions to determine the types of emojis used to enhance social presence. The most commonly used emojis to support social presence were the Winking Face emoji (n = 158), followed closely by the Clapping Hands emoji (n = 153). Subsequently, the Thumbs-Up emoji (n = 74), Face With Tears of Joy emoji (n = 68), Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes emoji (n = 64), Smiling Face emoji (n = 60), Smiling Face with Hearts emoji (n = 59), Smiling Face with Heart-Eyes emoji (n = 41), Slightly Smiling Face emoji (n = 40), Face Blowing a Kiss emoji (n = 35), Beaming Face with Smiling Eyes emoji (n = 31), and Grinning Face emoji (n = 31) were also frequently utilized (refer to Appendix A for details). For a visual representation of the emoji distribution, please consult Figure 4.
Social and affective manifestations, including emotion expression, humor, greetings, and acknowledgment of others, were consistently observed across all six groups over the duration of the course. These behaviors seemed to foster a sense of community within the groups, as evidenced by the following examples.
The findings suggest that the prevalence of emojis categorized as social presence may reflect a characteristic of Brazilian culture, which is renowned for its joyful, affectionate, and friendly demeanor both domestically and globally. The abundance of Red Heart ❤, Face Throwing a Kiss 😘, and Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes And Three Hearts 😍 emojis depicted in Figure 4, while predominantly observed in interactions classified as social presence, were also noted in interactions categorized under cognitive and teaching presences.
Another factor contributing to the prevalence of emojis as a form of social presence is WhatsApp's capability for nearly instantaneous replies, enabling users to respond promptly. This real-time feature may have been leveraged to indicate active engagement in ongoing interactions, often manifesting in brief messages accompanied by emojis or solely emojis, particularly in educational settings where teachers are frequently occupied. Pegrum (2014) posits that mobile learning thrives on immediate, on-demand interactions characterized by conciseness, striking a balance between providing sufficient information without overwhelming the recipient.
The utilization of emojis in WhatsApp interactions appears to support Paiva's (2016) notion that the growing prevalence of emojis serves as an effort to communicate additional meaning in a more concise manner within specific interactional contexts. Emojis are observed to signal participants' engagement with the ongoing interaction. Furthermore, the results indicate that emojis can also serve to endorse ideas or soften the impact of written exchanges, as evidenced in the study's findings.
Three Spearman Rho analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between participants' attitudes and their use of emojis for cognitive, teaching, and social presences. The results indicated a significant positive correlation between emoji use for cognitive presence and participants' readiness to utilize mobile devices in the language classroom (rs = .32, p = .01). Essentially, individuals who were more prepared to use mobile devices tended to employ emojis more frequently to enhance cognitive presence. This finding suggests that increased familiarity with WhatsApp led to a higher likelihood of utilizing emojis and other resources to share information, link concepts, and apply newfound knowledge. However, the analysis revealed no significant correlation between emoji use for social (rs = .20, p = .12) or teaching presence (rs = -.09, p = .48) and participants' attitudes towards mobile device readiness. Despite the growing popularity of emojis, participants tended to use them uniformly to foster collaboration and convey emotions, irrespective of their attitudes. Notably, participants often assumed a teaching role to aid their peers, a behavior observed in the Teaching Presence section, regardless of their attitudes, which may explain the lack of correlation. Refer to Table 6 for further details.
Emoji use in relation to cognitive presence showed a significant positive correlation with participants' attitudes towards utilizing mobile technologies such as smartphones, tablets, and apps to support learners with diverse backgrounds, characteristics, and abilities (rs = .31, p = .02). This suggests that the more open they were to employing mobile technologies, the more frequently they utilized emojis to share and implement new concepts during the course. Conversely, emoji use concerning social presence exhibited a positive correlation with participants' attitudes towards mobile technology application but did not reach statistical significance (rs = .24, p = .06). Notably, emoji use in terms of teaching presence did not show any correlation with participants' willingness to adopt mobile technologies (rs = -.01, p = .94). As highlighted by Whiteside (2015), fostering social presence in courses, as observed in this study, encourages students to actively engage in constructing their knowledge and that of their peers, irrespective of their prior experience. Consequently, in this study, participants, regardless of their readiness to leverage mobile technologies for empowering others, felt interconnected and contributed to shaping each other's learning experiences. Refer to Table 6 for more details.
To investigate the relationship between age and emoji usage, four Spearman Rho analyses were conducted. The participants' ages ranged from 21 to 60 years, with an average age of 38 years. The results indicated no significant correlations between age and cognitive presence (rs = -.07, p = .62), teaching presence (rs = .10, p = .44), social presence (rs = .04, p = .74), or total presence (rs = -.002, p = .99; refer to Table 7). Fullwood, Orchard, and Floyd (2013) found no significant age-related differences in emoji usage in internet chat rooms, while Alshenqeeti (2016) suggested that age was not as influential as technological proficiency in predicting emoji use. Consequently, the current study's outcomes are consistent with prior research on age and emoji utilization.
To investigate the impact of gender on emoji usage, four independent samples t-tests were conducted, with gender serving as the independent variable (IV) and emoji use for each presence type as the dependent variable (DV). Among the 61 survey respondents, 39 identified as female, 21 as male, and one did not specify their gender. Regarding cognitive presence, the data revealed that female participants (M = 10.13, SD = 14.30) utilized emojis to convey cognitive presence slightly more than their male counterparts (M = 8.00, SD = 8.38), although this difference was not statistically significant, t(58) = .63, p = .53 (refer to Tables 8 and 9 for detailed information).
In terms of teaching presence, female participants (M = .13, SD = .34) utilized emojis to represent teaching presence significantly more than their male counterparts, who did not use them at all (M = .00, SD = .00), t(38) = 2.36, p = .02. Regarding social presence, female participants (M = 12.97, SD = 19.84) employed emojis to convey social presence slightly more than male participants (M = 9.67, SD = 9.87), although this difference was not statistically significant, t(58) = .72, p = .48. Lastly, concerning total presence, female participants (M = 7.74, SD = 11.27) utilized emojis slightly more than male participants (M = 5.89, SD = 6.02), yet this variance was not statistically significant, t(58) = .70, p = .49.
The analysis of the data reveals that female participants significantly influenced the frequency of interactions throughout the course through their use of emojis. Figure 5 illustrates that these participants tended to incorporate more affectionate responses by frequently utilizing emojis symbolizing affection, including the Face Throwing a Kiss emoji, Smiling Face With Heart-Eyes emoji, Red Heart emoji ❤, Cherry Blossom emoji, among others. Additionally, Figure 5 provides clear evidence that the high frequency of the eight most commonly used emojis was predominantly driven by female participants.
In addition to the affectionate response, which can be interpreted as a strategy for enhancing group proximity, Figure 5 illustrates a significant prevalence of the clapping emoji, employed by participants upon task completion as a form of positive reinforcement within the group. This feedback mechanism serves as a means to foster closeness among members and uphold group cohesion. The frequent utilization of the Clapping Hands emoji, Thumbs-Up emoji, Winking Face emoji, Face With Tears of Joy emoji, and the Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes emoji by female participants signifies their reliance on non-verbal communication tools to compensate for the absence of physical gestures typical in face-to-face interactions. As noted by Alshenqeeti (2016, p. 64), "visual forms of language, encompassing non-verbal cues like body language, have historically been utilized to emphasize and bolster verbal communication. Emojis, in essence, are transposing these visual elements into the digital realm."
The findings of this study align with Fullwood et al.'s (2013) research, indicating that women exhibit a higher tendency to use emojis compared to men. This observation supports Alshenqeeti's (2016) argument that women generally display more emotional and expressive communication styles, particularly in their use of emojis. Furthermore, Alshenqeeti (2016) highlights the contextual nature of emojis, suggesting that cultural differences can impact their usage. The prevalence of emojis in the interactions of Brazilian teachers in this study may reflect both cultural norms and gender-specific communication patterns.
The results indicate a prevalent use of emojis to enhance cognitive, teaching, and social presence, with a majority falling under WhatsApp's categories of face emojis, people, and gestures. This trend suggests a shift towards more visual and multimodal communication within social networks, exemplified not only by emojis but also by the increasing use of stickers, as highlighted by Paiva (2016). Additionally, the widespread use of gifs in social media further supports this evolving trend. Paiva's observations align with the notion that language social practices are intricately intertwined with the interactions among different participants and the technologies that facilitate and mediate these interactions, contributing to the complexity of communication dynamics.
The analysis reveals that face emojis are frequently utilized as social affective expressions that are often intertwined in interactions categorized as cognitive and teaching presence. This aligns with the conclusions drawn by Garrison et al. (2007), Molinari (2010), Celani and Collins (2005), and Beuchot and Bullen (2005), who consider social presence as a fundamental aspect of cognitive presence. Therefore, it can be asserted that emojis, along with written discourse and emoticons, serve as components in online interactions that potentially bolster cognitive presence.
The findings indicate that course interactions demonstrate the varying interpretations of emojis based on their contextual placement. For instance, the wink emoji could either downplay the significance of an intervention or simply convey an 'ok'. Emojis were frequently utilized as non-verbal tools to compensate for the absence of physical gestures, fostering closeness among members and maintaining group unity. Emojis, as noted by Paiva (2016), actively contribute to the construction of meaning, particularly in digital educational environments where they serve pedagogical purposes like fostering community engagement, enhancing group cohesion, managing tasks, facilitating non-verbal communication, and influencing language use. Discussions highlight how emojis can effectively engage participants, foster a sense of community, and sustain cohesion within the group. They also aid in keeping participants focused on tasks and offering timely feedback on educational activities. While emojis can compensate for the lack of visual cues in face-to-face communication, an overreliance on single-line emojis, where interactions or responses consist solely of emojis, may pose challenges in educational settings, particularly in language learning, where written exchanges are crucial for information exchange, meaning negotiation, and language development.
The number and types of emojis utilized in online interactions within educational contexts, such as those on WhatsApp, may exhibit gender and cultural influences. These findings hold significance for the promotion of educational endeavors on platforms like WhatsApp or other social media spaces within multicultural settings. The current trajectory emphasizes the necessity of fostering increased social presence within our educational communities and classrooms. Harn (2017) highlighted the significance of emojis as a visual language and suggested that higher education institutions should incorporate emojis in informal communication to diminish social barriers, forge connections, and enhance overall student engagement by establishing a more personalized form of communication through emojis. This study underscores that social presence was heightened throughout the learning process, as the use of emojis in communication imbued a sense of warmth, openness, and trust, thereby fostering a more amicable and connected rapport, ultimately elevating social presence.
Utilizing this form of communication has the potential to enhance learning experiences across various training and educational environments. It is imperative to assess and enhance collaborative educational communication practices in alignment with contemporary contexts, considering the pedagogical implications to enhance the overall learning atmosphere. Given the emergence of diverse linguistic expressions within these platforms, educators and learners must recognize how varying cultural backgrounds influence communication dynamics. What may be deemed as customary interaction in one nation, such as Brazil, could be perceived as inappropriate in another cultural setting. Similarly, the interpretation of emojis can vary significantly. Cultivating an understanding of these potential disparities could introduce a novel dimension to the etiquette of comparable educational endeavors in the future.
