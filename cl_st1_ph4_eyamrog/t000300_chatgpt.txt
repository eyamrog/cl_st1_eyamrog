The emergence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic, originating from the initial case reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019, has underscored the challenges faced despite concerted international efforts to contain its transmission. An article published in April 2020 highlighted the confirmation of the first COVID-19 case caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Brazil on February 26, 2020, as announced by the Ministry of Health (MH). The patient, a 61-year-old individual from Sao Paulo, had recently returned from Lombardy, northern Italy, a region grappling with a significant outbreak. Subsequent to this initial case, the MH swiftly disseminated technical recommendations and protocols to all states within the Federation, aiming to mitigate the spread of the virus.
In Piauí, a state situated in northeastern Brazil, the initial suspected case of COVID-19 was documented on February 27, 2020. Subsequently, the first confirmed case was officially announced on March 19, 2020. By March 31, a cumulative total of 18 confirmed cases and 4 fatalities attributed to COVID-19 had been recorded, resulting in a fatality rate of 22.2%. Notably, two of these fatalities occurred in Teresina, the capital city of Piauí, which also serves as the focal point for the majority of confirmed cases (16 out of 18).
Teresina, the most populous city in Piauí with approximately 865 thousand inhabitants, boasts excellent connectivity through roads to various regions within the state and houses the sole airport offering direct domestic flights to multiple states in Brazil. Moreover, it serves as the primary hub for highly specialized healthcare services in the developed Entre Rios region, situated in the mid-north area of Piauí, while other regions grapple with fragile, disjointed, and vulnerable healthcare systems. This places an added strain and obstacle on health systems and economies in rural areas of the state, particularly in light of the looming threat of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination.
In response to the initial suspected cases of COVID-19 in mid-February, the state government of Piauí formulated the State Contingency Plan and established the Crisis Management Committee. These initiatives were designed to propose and oversee measures like social distancing and the cessation of communal activities, including public events and school functions. On March 16, 2020, via Decree 18,884/2020, the government advocated for the escalation of actions such as halting collective events encompassing sports, culture, arts, politics, science, commerce, and religion; discontinuing school sessions; monitoring potential cases; enforcing a 14-day isolation period for travelers or individuals in contact with confirmed cases; and implementing sanitary protocols.
In the interim, on March 19, 2020, the country issued Decree 18,895, declaring a state of public emergency in response to the severe public health crisis stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on public finances. This declaration empowered the implementation of extraordinary measures aimed at curtailing the transmission of the disease within Brazil. Furthermore, Decrees 18,901 and 18,902, released on March 19 and March 23, 2020 respectively, included provisions to halt economic activities in response to the movement of individuals.
Specific measures pertaining to the healthcare sector need to be enacted, particularly considering the distribution of resources across the state. With 11 health regions and a total of 227 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, it is notable that a significant proportion, 149 beds (65.6%), are centralized in Teresina within the Entre Rios Region as indicated in Table 1. Furthermore, all diagnoses utilizing reverse transcriptase-C-reactive protein (RT-PCR) are exclusively conducted at the Central Public Health Laboratory, situated in the capital city.
It is important to note that COVID-19 is not the sole public health challenge currently faced. Prior to March 2020, the country reported 441,224 probable cases of dengue, with an incidence coefficient of 209.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The Northeast Region specifically exhibited an incidence rate of 49.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, showing an upward trend but remaining within the anticipated level (endemic channel). Concurrently, there were 2,184 suspected cases of measles, of which 338 (15.5%) were confirmed, resulting in an incidence rate of 0.8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Given this complex epidemiological landscape, there is a clear anticipation of a syndemic involving measles, dengue, and COVID-19, alongside other health conditions affecting the Brazilian population.
In this context, the healthcare system in Piauí, akin to other regions in Brazil and globally, is ill-equipped to confront the escalating pandemic. The swift proliferation of the epidemic can be attributed, in part, to delays in testing suspected cases, delivering results, and isolating patients, alongside the inadequate protection of healthcare professionals. Consequently, there has been a significant dissemination of the virus from healthcare providers.
Hence, it is imperative for the government to promptly address the imperative of expanding healthcare infrastructure in the battle against COVID-19. It is crucial for both the populace and healthcare professionals to adhere to the preventive measures advocated by experts and public health authorities. The general public should practice regular hand hygiene, avoid enclosed spaces, and steer clear of individuals from regions experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks. Healthcare workers, on the other hand, must utilize protective gear such as face shields, surgical/N95 masks, disposable aprons, and gloves during procedures, in addition to maintaining strict hand hygiene, particularly when attending to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Consequently, governments must demonstrate their dedication to providing the entire population with the recommended mitigation strategies to navigate through this crisis. Furthermore, the current situation underscores the necessity of fortifying the Brazilian Unified Health System and the urgency of substantial investments in research, technology, and innovation to effectively combat public health emergencies within our nation.
