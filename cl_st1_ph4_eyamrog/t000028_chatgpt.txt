The aim of this study is to propose adaptations for activities in an English language textbook for blind students in the sixth year of Basic Education. This qualitative research, situated within Applied Linguistics, includes a Literature Review focusing on previous research concerning material adaptations for blind students. Key themes explored encompass the scarcity of research and adapted materials for blind students, inadequate teacher preparation to cater to their needs, and challenges related to fostering autonomy and inclusion in the classroom. Insights from these studies were utilized to inform methodologies and material adaptations within the English curriculum. Subsequently, an analysis was conducted on the most commonly used sixth-grade English textbook in Santa Maria in 2021, titled "Way to English for Brazilian Learners - 6" (FRANCO; TAVARES, 2015). The examination identified the "Vocabulary Corner" as the section most in need of adaptation, as it contains vocabulary activities spanning all units of the book. Based on this analysis and the Literature Review, adaptations were proposed for six activities in the textbook to enhance inclusivity and accessibility for blind students.
Teaching an additional language is a complex and rigorous endeavor as educators must prioritize establishing a safe and conducive learning environment where students are encouraged to freely express themselves, fostering a positive rapport (Hughey, 2011). The primary objective of an additional language class is to prompt students to think critically about language and actively engage with it through various multimodal genres, enabling them to perceive language as integral to specific social contexts and practices (Motta-Roth, Heberle, 2015, p. 2).
To cater to sighted students, English as an Additional Language (EAL) instructors commonly incorporate visual aids like pictures, photos, videos, flashcards, maps, and posters. While these resources serve as tangible tools to enhance language comprehension, they necessitate modification for non-sighted students. Learners with visual impairments rely on tactile or auditory representations of educational materials, enabling them to engage with the content through alternative sensory channels (RESOURCES FOR TEACHING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE TO LEARNERS WITH BLINDNESS OR VISUAL IMPAIRMENT, 2022).
While the Brazilian Education Ministry does offer Braille adaptations in textbooks through the National Textbook Program (Programa Nacional do Livro Didático – PNLD5) as mandated for schools, it is crucial for educators to have a comprehensive understanding of alternative adapted materials. This knowledge enables teachers to select the most suitable approach based on individual student capabilities and learning preferences. These adaptations hold significance not only for visually impaired students, facilitating their inclusion in activities they might otherwise struggle to engage in, but also benefit teachers by providing a range of materials that can enhance the learning experience for the entire group, including both sighted and visually impaired learners.
A review of journal platforms reveals a noticeable absence of discussions on the EAL learning-teaching process for blind students within the field of Applied Linguistics. This dearth of research not only highlights a gap in the literature but also hampers educators in their quest for effective adaptations. This underscores the critical need for further research on tailored didactic materials for blind students, presenting tangible and auditory alternatives that can cater to this specific audience.
The objective of this study is to propose adaptations for didactic activities from the primary textbook utilized by sixth-grade blind students in Santa Maria, RS, in 2021. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive Review of Literature was undertaken, focusing on prior research concerning the teaching and learning processes of visually impaired students. Drawing from the findings of this investigation, specific adaptations for selected didactic activities tailored to blind students are recommended. Preceding the exploration of these adaptation strategies, the subsequent sections of this paper delve into the national integration of visually impaired individuals within social and educational settings, examining historical perspectives on national legislation and pivotal milestones, alongside key insights into the pedagogy of blind students.
In Brazil, a wide range of physical, mental, and sensorial impairments are currently recognized and discussed in relation to the education of students with disabilities. Historically, however, these individuals were often referred to using derogatory and discriminatory language. Prior to the 1970s, individuals with disabilities were marginalized and denied fundamental rights, including access to education. The landscape began to shift nationally in the 1960s and 1970s with the introduction of key legislative measures such as the first Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education and the establishment of the National Center for Special Education (CENESP). These initiatives aimed to normalize the status of individuals with disabilities and ensure their right to education. Subsequent laws further shaped the educational landscape: Law 4.024/61 (1961) focused on education and guaranteeing schooling for the Brazilian population; Law 5.692 (1971) set out guidelines for high school education; and Law 9.394/96 (1994) currently in effect, delineates the responsibilities of municipal, state, and federal governments across the three educational stages in Brazil (preschool, primary school, and high school).
The 1990s marked a period of notable advancements for individuals with disabilities on a global scale. The World Declaration on Education for All, established by UNESCO in 1990, emphasized the fundamental right of every individual to education and the necessity of providing access to essential learning conditions. Subsequently, in 1994, the United Nations introduced the Salamanca Statement, which aimed to promote social and educational inclusion by advocating for equal educational opportunities for individuals with special needs, irrespective of any limitations they may have (FIGUEIREDO; KATO, 2015).
Since 2000, Brazil has introduced several laws and decrees, among which are the National Guidelines for Special Education in Basic Education (Diretrizes Nacionais para Educação Especial na Educação Básica) and the National Special Education Policy from the Perspective of Inclusive Education (Política Nacional de Educação Especial da Perspectiva da Educação Inclusiva). The latter policy ensures the right of students with disabilities to attend public schools, while the former focuses on implementing this democratization by guaranteeing accessibility and inclusion for all individuals (ALVES, 2017).
Despite advancements in legislation both nationally and internationally, regrettably, attitudes of segregation persist in our society. This is primarily attributed to issues such as poor accessibility, entrenched stereotypical beliefs, limited educational and professional prospects, and inadequacies in existing legislation (GARCÍA, 2014). It is imperative that inclusive perspectives and concerted efforts are embraced to foster more tolerant and egalitarian communities, where all citizens have equal access to opportunities.
According to Santos et al. (2018), the visual spectrum can be classified into four levels based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010. These levels include: 1) no visual impairment, 2) moderate visual impairment, 3) severe visual impairment, and 4) blindness, as outlined in Table 1.
According to this classification, individuals are categorized as follows: 1) those with "no visual impairment" have mild vision loss or near-normal vision, being able to perceive light; 2) individuals with "moderate visual impairment" have moderate low vision but can still perceive light; 3) those with "severe visual impairment" have severe low vision and can perceive a minimal amount of light; and 4) individuals classified as "blindness" experience profound to total visual impairment, perceiving little to no light. Therefore, it can be concluded that blindness represents the most severe form of visual impairment within this classification system.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2019, there were nearly 39 million blind individuals globally, with over 1.5 million residing in Brazil (CEGUEIRA AFETA 39 MILHÕES DE PESSOAS NO MUNDO, 2019), as indicated by the latest census conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Additionally, a survey by IBGE published in 2015 (VILLELA, 2015) revealed that the South region of Brazil has the highest proportion of individuals with varying degrees of visual impairment, accounting for 5.4% of its population.
While it is true that a significant portion of individuals with visual impairment or blindness are aged 50 and above (BLINDNESS AND VISION IMPAIRMENT, 2021), it is crucial not to overlook the younger demographic facing similar challenges without adequate support, particularly blind children navigating the educational system. In light of this demographic diversity, we have identified students with blindness, representing the most severe form of visual impairment, as the primary target audience for our proposed didactic adaptation. By catering to this specific group, the adaptation could potentially benefit students across varying levels of visual impairment.
An examination of contemporary didactic materials and textbooks reveals a prevalent inclusion of various visual elements and multimodal texts, including images, drawings, maps, and posters. While these components play a significant role in education, it is essential to note that language teaching resources do not necessarily have to rely solely on visual aids (TEACHING LANGUAGES TO BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS, 2022). Alternative teaching methods exist that cater to non-sighted students, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility in educational settings.
Certainly, EAL teachers may encounter various challenges when teaching blind students, such as potential lack of motivation or feelings of discouragement, unfamiliarity with Braille and other accessible materials, and potential social exclusion from classmates (Benwell, 2022). It is crucial for educators to exhibit patience and establish a supportive learning environment where students feel comfortable expressing themselves and making mistakes. It is essential to recognize that a blind student is primarily a student, with their condition being secondary; thus, they should receive equal treatment compared to their sighted peers, despite differences in learning methods.
Teaching an additional language to a blind student presents unique challenges, yet it is a profoundly rewarding experience for both student and teacher. Through the collaborative construction of knowledge, both parties stand to gain valuable insights. As students gradually build confidence and make progress in learning a new language, the EAL teacher also benefits by exploring diverse teaching materials and acquiring strategies for effectively accommodating blind students in the classroom. This reciprocal learning process unfolds day by day, fostering growth and mutual understanding in the educational journey.
Our research is guided by the following questions: How can a visually impaired student effectively acquire a second language in a mainstream classroom setting without access to traditional printed educational resources and adapted materials? Is it feasible to modify visual and printed learning materials using everyday objects? What strategies can teachers employ to ensure that English as an Additional Language (EAL) printed materials are accessible to visually impaired students? To address these inquiries, we propose modifications to didactic activities informed by a comprehensive Review of Literature on the educational practices and challenges faced by visually impaired students, which will be detailed following the Methodology section.
The current study is qualitative research, rooted in a philosophical stance that aligns with interpretivism, focusing on the interpretation, understanding, experience, production, or constitution of the social world. It employs data generation methods that are adaptable and attuned to the social context in which data are collected (MASON, 2002, p. 3). In this framework, the researcher is not and cannot be neutral, objective, or detached from the knowledge and evidence they are eliciting (MASON, 2002, p. 7).
While this research primarily adopts a qualitative approach, it was deemed necessary to incorporate elements from the quantitative approach to enhance the analysis with quantified data presented in tables and graphics (Silva, 2016; Santade, 2014). As noted by Santade (2014), quantitative research involves organizing numerical data using statistical methods, while qualitative research focuses on a structured and interpretative analysis of information. By integrating these methodologies, the accuracy of data description and analysis is heightened, leading to more authentic and reliable results and conclusions (Santade, 2014, p. 102). The quantitative approach facilitated the collection and quantification of data, both in theoretical aspects (such as gathering articles for the Literature Review) and practical aspects (collecting data from sixth-grade English textbooks used in public schools in Santa Maria, RS, in 2021). Conversely, the qualitative approach proved invaluable during the analysis and interpretation of this data, forming the foundation for our proposed adaptations.
Engaged in the examination of social issues where language plays a fundamental role, our research not only aims to discuss but also to advocate for interventions addressing the identified problems (SCHLATTER, 2009), thus embodying an Applied Linguistics perspective. As Mason (2002) asserts, qualitative research should be approached as a moral endeavor, taking into account its political context (p. 8). This study specifically focuses on addressing the dearth of suitable English as an Additional Language (EAL) materials for visually impaired 6th-grade students. Consequently, our work can be characterized as propositional, as we propose adaptations to EAL activities that better cater to the specific learning requirements of blind students.
In the subsequent sections, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature concerning adapted materials designed for blind students. Additionally, we delve into the selection process of textbooks and units that align with and bolster the proposed adaptation recommendations.
This section delves into exploratory research on the adaptation of didactic materials for blind students. Despite consulting various Applied Linguistics journal websites, no results were found when searching for keywords like "blind," "blind students," and "blindness" in both English and Portuguese languages. These findings underscore the significance of conducting studies on adapting materials for blind students, as they can aid teachers in regular classes to effectively include these students in all didactic activities.
In light of the limited availability of papers in Applied Linguistics journals, our approach involved exploring texts on the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) platform. Employing the research tools at our disposal, the texts identified for investigation prominently feature the term "blind" in their title, alongside the inclusion of "teaching" and "school" within their title, abstract, or keywords. Furthermore, specific research filters were applied: a) the publication journal must be education-related; b) the texts should be openly accessible; c) within the genre category (Tipos de Literatura), the texts should fall under the categories of articles or review articles. This search methodology yielded a total of nine relevant papers.
In line with the objectives of this study, the inclusion criteria were established as follows: a) the selected texts had to be papers published on SciElo; b) they needed to focus on adaptation or didactic materials for blind students; c) they had to be freely accessible online; and d) they had to pertain to blind students within the school environment, regardless of the diverse range of topics covered, not limited to the field of languages.
After applying these criteria and reviewing the nine resulting papers, five of them met the requirements and were included in the Review of Literature, as outlined in Chart 1. The remaining four texts did not meet all the inclusion criteria set forth and were consequently excluded from the study.
The data from the five papers suggest that they collectively offer complementary teaching pedagogies essential for instructing and integrating a blind student into the classroom. These pedagogies are specifically linked to:
There is a notable dearth of existing research on the education of visually impaired students, particularly within the realm of English studies (Oliveira & Reily, 2014).
Teachers' unpreparedness to address the diverse needs of students, including those with visual impairments, can be attributed to the absence of relevant content in teacher education programs (Ferreira & Dickman, 2015; Uliana, 2013; Camargo & Nardi, 2006; Oliveira & Reily, 2014).
The concept of student autonomy and independence has been extensively discussed in the literature (Biagini & Gonçalves, 2017; Ferreira & Dickman, 2015; Uliana, 2013; Camargo & Nardi, 2006; Oliveira & Reily, 2014). These scholars have highlighted the importance of students taking ownership of their learning process, making decisions, and being self-directed in their academic pursuits. By fostering autonomy and independence, educators can empower students to become active participants in their education, leading to enhanced learning outcomes and personal growth.
The absence of tailored educational resources for visually impaired students has been highlighted in several studies (Biagini & Gonçalves, 2017; Ferreira & Dickman, 2015; Uliana, 2013; Camargo & Nardi, 2006; Oliveira & Reily, 2014).
Challenges persist in the integration of blind students into mainstream classrooms, as highlighted by several studies (Ferreira & Dickman, 2015; Uliana, 2013; Camargo & Nardi, 2006; Oliveira & Reily, 2014). These investigations underscore the difficulties faced by blind students in accessing and participating in regular educational settings. The literature suggests that there are significant barriers to inclusion, ranging from inadequate support systems to a lack of accessible materials and technologies. Despite efforts to promote inclusive education, blind students continue to encounter obstacles that hinder their full participation and academic success within mainstream classrooms. The findings from these studies emphasize the ongoing need for targeted interventions and support mechanisms to address the unique needs of blind students in inclusive educational environments.
Suggestions for the adaptation proposal can be drawn from various sources, including the works of Biagini and Gonçalves (2017), Ferreira and Dickman (2015), Uliana (2013), Camargo and Nardi (2006), and Oliveira and Reily (2014). These authors have provided valuable insights and recommendations that can inform the development of a comprehensive and effective adaptation strategy. By synthesizing and building upon the ideas presented in these studies, it is possible to create a robust proposal that addresses the specific needs and challenges of the target population. Incorporating key findings and best practices from these sources can enhance the quality and relevance of the adaptation process, ultimately leading to more successful outcomes in practice.
In the preceding section, the challenge of locating prior studies on didactic materials for visually impaired Brazilian students during the Literature Review was highlighted, with a notable absence of articles addressing EAL language materials. This scarcity of research on materials tailored for visually impaired students does not appear to be confined solely to the English language domain, as evidenced by similar challenges identified in Physics (Ferreira & Dickman, 2015) and Music (Oliveira & Reily, 2014) studies. This underscores a significant research gap across various educational domains, emphasizing the imperative to delve deeper into this issue. These findings underscore the necessity for collaboration with colleagues and special educators to enhance our understanding of how to effectively incorporate and modify materials across all academic disciplines for visually impaired students.
The dearth of research in the educational realm significantly impacts the classroom environment, as it hinders teachers from effectively modifying printed materials for blind students due to the lack of readily available guidance. Furthermore, challenges stem from the inadequate preparation provided in teacher education undergraduate programs (Ferreira & Dickman, 2015; Camargo & Nardi, 2006; Oliveira & Reily, 2014), where prospective educators receive limited exposure to special education topics. This deficiency is underscored in Oliveira and Reily's study (2014), where they conducted semi-structured interviews with five visually impaired music students to explore their learning experiences and the obstacles they encounter in accessing and comprehending music (Oliveira & Reily, 2014, p. 407). Their findings suggest a potential absence of coursework in undergraduate programs that specifically address the needs of students with disabilities (Oliveira & Reily, 2014, p. 417). Similarly, within the teacher education curriculum at Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM), including the English Major, there is only one course dedicated to special education topics. Additionally, Ferreira and Dickman (2015, p. 245) highlight the daily challenges faced by practicing teachers, such as violence, low remuneration, discipline issues, and institutional evaluations, which may impede their pursuit of further specialized education in adapting instruction for students with impairments.
The lack of information and inadequate teacher training in both pre-service and in-service education could potentially hinder the development of autonomy in blind students. Ill-prepared teachers may fail to offer the necessary support, leading to instances where they either overexplain tasks or inadvertently provide answers. Biagini and Golçalves (2017) illustrated this issue through a study involving a group activity for a third-grade elementary class comprising both sighted and visually impaired students. The activity involved dividing the class into groups of four, with each student assuming a distinct role (reader, writer, communicator, and coordinator) to collectively analyze a selected text. The results revealed that the blind student exhibited a reliance on external assistance, frequently seeking help from the teacher or peers even for relatively straightforward tasks, indicating a notable lack of independence in completing activities autonomously.
João received consistent "support" from his classmates, as evidenced by the daily assignment of one of them by the teacher to accompany him during school breaks. However, this display of solidarity from his peers was not without its drawbacks, notably the hindrance it posed to João's autonomy development (Biagini & Gonçalves, 2017, p. 10).
The findings presented by Biagini and Gonçalves (2017) exemplify the extent to which blind students rely on teacher assistance, a reliance that is often exacerbated by teachers' lack of preparedness and insufficient knowledge on how to effectively support blind students in the classroom. This lack of support can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only academic performance but also socialization and self-reflection, as evidenced in the case of João. Despite activities being specifically designed to accommodate his impairment, João's participation was limited to reacting to prompts from his peers and instructors, highlighting the challenges faced by blind students in educational settings (Biagini & Gonçalves, 2017).
It is crucial to avoid placing the entire burden solely on in-service teachers, who are often overwhelmed and lack the necessary working conditions and time to adjust materials. In many public schools, the lack of tactile resources for didactic purposes across various subjects poses a significant challenge (ULIANA, 2013). This issue served as a driving force behind Uliana's research (2013), which sought to develop and test a pedagogical kit for teaching Math to visually impaired students. Through semi-structured interviews, both teachers and students emphasized the importance of having specially adapted materials tailored for visually impaired students readily available in schools, as indicated in Chart 2.
It is crucial to note that despite the presence of a resource room designated for special educational services, there was a notable absence of pedagogical materials tailored for blind students to effectively engage with the entire curriculum, resulting in significant gaps in their learning journey. As a result, the teacher found themselves compelled to create makeshift materials, frequently without any financial support, in order to meet the need for adapted resources that were lacking within the school environment.
The issue of including blind students in the classroom (CAMARGO; NARDI, 2006; ULIANA, 2013; OLIVEIRA; REILY, 2014; FERREIRA; DICKMAN, 2015) is a significant concern that warrants attention. Ferreira and Dickman (2015) highlight that while the concept of inclusivity for blind individuals is theoretically sound, practical implementation within the classroom remains a formidable challenge. Their study aimed to elucidate how the oral history methodology can enhance the understanding of blind students in the realm of Physics education. By employing oral history, which amplifies the voices of an often overlooked minority, the researchers sought to delve into the personal experiences of blind students and address existing obstacles. This approach empowered blind students to articulate their encounters with various educational materials and pedagogical strategies, thereby enabling educators to tailor teaching methods to individual student needs. The positive outcomes of Ferreira and Dickman’s (2015) study underscore the efficacy of the oral history method as a viable solution to the issue of blind student inclusion in educational settings.
With this methodology, the researchers delved deeper into the narratives of teachers and students involved in the process of reformulating and creating educational materials to enhance the inclusion of blind students. Simultaneously, they were able to develop methodological procedures that catered to the curricular needs of teachers. This approach, as highlighted by Ferreira and Dickman (2015), not only facilitated a better understanding of the challenges faced by blind students but also provided practical solutions to make educational content more accessible and inclusive.
Camargo and Nardi (2006) conducted a study addressing the exclusion of blind students in Physics classes, with the goal of raising awareness among undergraduate teachers and proposing potential solutions. Their research involved a two-fold approach, encompassing both preparatory and practical phases, where prospective Physics educators could design a curriculum inclusive of both sighted and visually impaired students. The investigation revealed challenges faced by undergraduates in devising non-visual teaching methods, given the prevalent use of visual aids like blackboards and experiments in Physics instruction. To enhance the integration of blind students and address this issue, the students devised Physics activities emphasizing collaborative and complementary roles, including oral presentations, group discussions, reading exercises, and even theatrical performances (Camargo & Nardi, 2006).
The strategies proposed for accommodating blind students in classroom settings are not only pertinent to the field of Physics but also extend to all educational domains, offering adaptable techniques that can be implemented across various disciplines. While the pedagogical aims, methodologies, and educational contexts may vary between the reviewed literature and our research focus, the insights gleaned from these sources significantly enrich our efforts in tailoring English as an Additional Language (EAL) activities for visually impaired students.
Biagini and Gonçalves (2017, p. 8) emphasize the significance of "cooperation, solidarity, and respect for differences" among students, advocating for these values to be fostered through group activities. Their study proposed a group reading activity involving four roles: reader, writer, communicator, and coordinator. The activity unfolded in three stages: individual responses to teacher queries followed by group discussions to formulate a collective answer; presentation of these answers to the entire class, sparking further discussions; and finally, sharing each group's conclusions and results with the class. While the researchers focused on a Natural Sciences text for their discussion, they noted the adaptability of such activities to other disciplines, including English language studies. Furthermore, Biagini and Gonçalves (2017) conducted an experiment exploring the significance of water for plant growth, potability, and water treatment. Through this experiment, they underscored the value of multisensory resources (tactile, olfactory, auditory observations) in aiding blind students' comprehension of the subject matter.
Ferreira and Dickman (2015) introduced various concepts by conducting interviews with blind students, emphasizing key considerations for the classroom. One student highlighted the importance of providing equal conditions and necessary adjustments for blind students to achieve the same level of comprehension as their peers. Additionally, the student emphasized the significance of practical activities and dialogues between teachers and students to prevent Physics (or any subject) from becoming overly challenging and discouraging. To address these challenges, Ferreira and Dickman (2015) suggested adaptations proposed by participants, including the necessity of describing images and graphs when printed, as well as utilizing tactile mockups to aid blind students in interpreting visual information.
Uliana's (2013) research offers valuable insights through the introduction of a pedagogical kit, emphasizing key characteristics for creating adapted materials. These materials should be cost-effective, utilizing items like magnets, metal plates, EVE, paper, glue, and polystyrene, while also being portable, lightweight, and easily assembled and disassembled to create various figures and graphical representations. Building on previous studies, Uliana (2013, p. 598) highlights the significance of tactile materials for blind students, enabling them to abstract information on par with sighted peers. The author suggests that minor adjustments, rather than drastic changes in teaching methods, can effectively cater to the needs of blind students.
Uliana (2013) focuses on tactile resources, while Oliveira and Reily (2014) delve into audible materials in the context of teaching music to blind students. Drawing on Pring and Ockelford (2005), Oliveira and Reily (2014) assert that a significant correlation exists between language, cognitive, and motor skill development in individuals within a musically enriched environment, a factor that enhances the educational experience for both sighted and visually impaired students. The authors propose various didactic materials for blind students, including engaging activities that pique their interest, as well as tactile resources like embossed materials, Braille, voice synthesizers, screen readers, and other assistive technologies that facilitate learning. Furthermore, Oliveira and Reily (2014) underscore the crucial role of support from students' families, teachers, and the community in fostering their educational progress.
Camargo and Nardi (2006) offer innovative teaching methods proposed by undergraduate Physics instructors to facilitate the inclusion of blind students in classroom settings. To adapt printed materials like written assessments, prospective educators recommended incorporating oral activities and recorded audios. For hands-on experiments, they suggested utilizing everyday items that engage tactile and auditory senses. Additionally, they proposed group activities that foster collaboration between sighted and visually impaired students, such as debates, reading sessions, and discussions involving orality and complementary roles. The authors and students underscored the significance of active, inclusive, dialogic, and participative educational strategies that promote students' reflective, analytical, and decision-making skills, as well as teachers' understanding of their students' perspectives throughout the educational journey (Camargo & Nardi, 2006, p. 56).
Methodological strategies such as those outlined above exemplify effective approaches to accommodating blind students in the classroom, thereby mitigating potential challenges related to non-inclusion, lack of autonomy, and teacher unpreparedness that may impede the student's learning experience. Nevertheless, it remains crucial to engage in open communication with the student to ascertain their preferred learning methods and optimal comprehension strategies (Uliana, 2013; Ferreira & Dickman, 2015). By doing so, educators and learners can collaboratively devise a tailored approach that is mutually beneficial and conducive to successful learning outcomes.
The papers reviewed in this study not only presented ideas for didactic materials but also offered insights into teaching perspectives and strategies to address challenges in the development of blind students. Uliana (2013, p. 610) argues that the absence of sight should not be viewed as an insurmountable barrier to a student's mathematical progress. This sentiment extends to other disciplines like English language teaching, where it is feasible to attain educational objectives for visually impaired students through the use of accessible resources and inclusive instructional approaches.
Insufficient research and teacher training in educating blind students, particularly in the English language domain, can lead to negative outcomes for their inclusion and autonomy. Consequently, there is a growing need for ongoing exploration of intervention strategies and customized materials to integrate blind students effectively in classrooms, thereby reducing segregation and fostering student independence. Following the theoretical framework, this study transitions to practical considerations, focusing on textbook selection, unit planning, and proposed adaptations for specific teaching activities.
Following the theoretical framework, we present the procedures and results concerning the selection of the textbook and unit, as well as the proposed adaptations for specific didactic activities within that unit.
The textbook selection process was guided by two key principles as outlined by Cargnin, Rossi, and Ticks (2018, p. 562): firstly, the book had to be approved by PNLD in 2021, and secondly, it needed to be the predominant choice among English language teachers for sixth-grade students in public schools in Santa Maria, RS during the same year. To determine the most widely utilized textbook in Santa Maria, access was gained to the SIMAD website, and the requisite form was completed in accordance with the specified parameters illustrated in Figure 1.
The parameters selected for this study encompassed the year 2021 and focused on the PNLD program within various school settings, including urban and rural, under the municipal administration domain in Santa Maria.
The website yielded a total of 74 results, comprising three CEIs (Child Education Centers), 54 EMEFs (Municipal Elementary Schools), and 17 EMEIs (Municipal Nursery Schools). To determine the most commonly selected English language textbook for sixth grade, the analysis focused solely on the EMEF data. This decision was made due to the fact that the mandatory instruction of English language commences specifically in elementary schools, starting from the sixth grade onwards.
The data from the website is summarized in Graph 1, displaying both the percentage and frequency of mentions for each textbook. The category of schools classified as "Not informed" primarily pertains to the early elementary years, spanning from first to fifth grade, where no specific English language textbook was chosen.
According to the criteria established by Cargnin, Rossi, and Ticks (2018) and the data depicted in Graph 1, it can be inferred that the predominant English language textbook chosen for implementation in public schools in Santa Maria in 2021 is the book titled "Way to English for Brazilian Learners - 6". This particular textbook is anticipated to be utilized in a significant number of public schools within the region during the triennial period spanning from 2021 to 2023.
The English language textbook series titled "Way to English for Brazilian Learners," authored by Claudio Franco and Kátia Tavares, made its debut in 2015. This collection is structured into four distinct levels, catering to students in the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, respectively.
The "Way to English/Way to Go!" website offers supplementary resources for English language teachers, including flashcards, worksheets, tests, educational videos, and songs. These materials are categorized by textbook, unit, and content for easy reference. While songs and listening activities are versatile for various classroom settings, it is worth noting that specific materials tailored for blind students were not identified on the website.
This paper introduces an adaptation designed for activities tailored to sixth-grade blind students. Specifically, it focuses on the initial level of this collection, which centers around the textbook "Way to English for Brazilian Learners - 6".
It is essential to note that the textbook under examination in this study is the student edition, which can be found on the "Way to English/Way to Go!" website, as the teacher's edition was not accessible.
As the inaugural volume in the "Way to English" series, this textbook delves into fundamental aspects of the English language, offering activities in both English and Portuguese based on their complexity levels - simpler tasks are in English, while more intricate ones are in Portuguese. The book commences with a concise introduction highlighting the significance and ubiquity of the English language in our daily routines, alongside an overview of the objectives across the four volumes in the collection. Subsequently, a synopsis of the eight units within the textbook is provided, delineating the sections and topics covered. The subsequent segment, labeled "Tips into Practice," features exercises focused on reading and learning strategies aimed at bolstering students' confidence in tackling the exercises found throughout the textbook. This is followed by two pages dedicated to English sentences designed for classroom use by both students and educators.
The textbook then introduces its eight units, each designed to cover the key concepts that sixth-grade students are expected to learn throughout the academic year. Chart 3 displays the titles, contents, and discourse genres featured in each unit, with the chart being compiled from the initial information outlined in the textbook for each unit.
After every two units, the textbook includes sections dedicated to content review activities, focusing on the vocabulary and grammar covered in the preceding units. Subsequently, there is a segment titled "Vocabulary Corner" that consolidates the key vocabulary acquired throughout the eight units. Following this, the book introduces the "Language Reference in Context" section, which offers activities centered around the application of grammar concepts learned in authentic texts, encompassing various discourse genres like comic strips, posters, and signs. The remaining pages of the book are allocated to the Glossary, Index, and Bibliography sections.
During the initial phase of our research, the primary objective was to choose one of the eight main units from the "Way to English for Brazilian Learners - 6" book for presentation and adaptation in our paper. However, upon closer examination of the textbook, it became evident that the "Vocabulary Corner" section stood out as the most crucial component to adapt for blind students.
The section titled "Vocabulary Corner" (pages 154 to 165) comprises 13 activities focusing on the vocabulary covered in all eight units of the textbook. The adapted materials proposed in this paper are designed to be utilized throughout the academic year and can be incorporated into a range of instructional activities. It is worth noting that all the activities within this section incorporate visual elements, including pictures and drawings, yet there are no adaptation suggestions provided for visually impaired students.
Image 3 depicts two activities related to units 1 and 2, respectively, serving as illustrative examples of the activities showcased in the Vocabulary Corner.
The section commences with activities centered around the vocabulary content covered in unit 1: Greetings. Visual aids depicting various greetings are provided, accompanied by blank spaces prompting students to deduce and input the appropriate greeting. Subsequently, the second activity pertains to unit 2, focusing on vocabulary related to Personal Interests. Similar to the first exercise, images representing various hobbies are displayed, with corresponding blank spaces for students to correctly label. Additionally, a sentence is provided for students to complete by sharing their preferred leisure activities. Continuing with unit 2, the subsequent task delves into Numbers, necessitating students to fill in the blanks with the numerical equivalent of the written form.
In Unit 3, three activities are outlined. The initial activity involves a vocabulary review focusing on Occupations, where students are presented with images and tasked with writing the corresponding words. The second activity revolves around the Months of the Year, providing an incomplete calendar for students to correctly add the months. Lastly, the third activity delves into Countries and Nationalities, featuring images of flags for students to identify the respective country and nationality they represent.
Proceeding further, the subsequent tasks are centered around the vocabulary covered in unit 4. One task involves a review of School Subjects, prompting students to match the subjects with corresponding figures, while another task focuses on the Days of the Week, requiring students to list the seven days in sequence. Subsequently, a task entails completing a family tree with the Members of the Family, aligning with the content from unit 5. Moving on to the next exercise, which revisits the vocabulary from unit 6, students are presented with images depicting Parts of a House and Furniture, and are tasked with identifying and writing the corresponding terms.
The following activity focuses on animals, featuring images with blank spaces for students to fill in the names of the animals discussed in unit 7. The final two exercises pertain to the vocabulary of unit 8, specifically Colors and Abilities. These exercises require students to write the appropriate words below corresponding images.
Upon scrutinizing and elucidating each activity, it becomes apparent how closely aligned they are and their heavy reliance on visual components. A predominant recurring aspect across these activities is the requirement for students to articulate the word corresponding to a given image. Consequently, it is imperative to acknowledge the potential exclusion of visually impaired students from participating in these exercises within a classroom setting.
In the subsequent section, we propose modifications to several didactic activities outlined, drawing upon insights from the literature review.
Drawing from prior research, the materials presented in this study adhere to the recommendations outlined in the literature review. These resources are specifically designed for visually impaired sixth-grade students with the aim of engaging this target audience and fostering their interest in acquiring a second language, specifically English.
While the adaptations proposed are rooted solely in the literature review, it is crucial to underscore the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration with school educational advisors and Special Education professionals. This partnership can offer additional perspectives beyond those outlined in this study, aiding in the development of optimal strategies to address the unique needs of individual students.
In the preceding section, the decision was made to modify the activities of the Vocabulary Corner, which pertains to the vocabulary acquired throughout the entire textbook. To enhance the appeal and accessibility of these activities for blind students, ludic approaches were chosen. These approaches aim to foster student interaction in an enjoyable and meaningful manner, stimulating engagement not only among blind students but also sighted students. Consequently, the adaptations outlined in this study do not solely concentrate on written vocabulary but also emphasize the recognition of English words and their contextual meanings.
Six activities from the Vocabulary Corner were chosen out of a total of 13, serving as exemplars showcasing the diverse array of possibilities for transforming a visual resource into an educational tool suitable for both sighted and non-sighted students. These specific activities are highlighted in Chart 4.
Encouraging cooperation and interaction between sighted and non-sighted students is crucial, a goal that can be facilitated through group activities (Camargo & Nardi, 2006; Biagini & Gonçalves, 2017). For example, Activity A (depicted in Image 4) revolving around Occupations vocabulary, could be modified into a group-based interactive task emphasizing speaking and listening skills.
Instead of utilizing images and completing fill-in-the-blank exercises, the EAL teacher has the option to task students with researching a potential career they aspire to pursue in the future either online or through books. This research activity can be conducted at home with the support of the students' parents, relatives, or friends, and subsequently presented to their peers in class. Within a circle setting, each student succinctly describes the career they have selected, prompting their classmates to guess the occupation being portrayed. To conclude the activity, the student can confirm their choice by finishing the sentence "I want to be a...".
Another adapted group activity that proves effective is letter E, which focuses on the months of the year (refer to Image 5).
In a classroom setting, students are encouraged to engage in a structured activity where they respond to questions posed by the English as an Additional Language (EAL) teacher, such as identifying the starting month of summer in Brazil, the current month, or the month in which Halloween is celebrated. The teacher facilitates this exercise by prompting one group or pair at a time to provide answers, ensuring that all students have the opportunity to participate and interact within their respective groups. This approach not only enhances listening and speaking skills but also fosters a sense of playfulness and inclusivity, ultimately aiming to promote active engagement and involvement among the students.
In addition to group exercises, the EAL teacher can utilize tactile resources to create inclusive didactic activities. Uliana (2013) exemplifies this approach by developing a pedagogical kit, highlighting the significance of concrete materials in facilitating the learning experience for visually impaired students. These resources enable blind students to engage at a comparable level to their sighted peers. Furthermore, exploring numerical concepts, as depicted in Image 6, presents an intriguing avenue for further investigation.
The numbers could be represented on cards with high relief, using materials like relief glue, popsicle sticks, or bead pieces. For students familiar with these resources, numerals and complete numbers could also be presented in Braille. Image 7 showcases examples of these cards in Braille, which were created as part of a Special Education course.
The cards can serve as a valuable tool for visually impaired students, functioning both as a tactile aid and as an engaging educational game. In this activity, the teacher mixes up the cards, prompting the student to organize them to correspond with the word and its corresponding numeral. This interactive approach not only enhances oral communication and auditory skills but also strengthens the student's ability to recognize and associate written words with their numerical representations.
The same resources can also be utilized to modify activity D, which pertains to the days of the week (Image 8).
It is feasible to construct a high-relief calendar utilizing velcro, EVE, cardboard, and glue, enabling the visually impaired student to assemble and disassemble it daily. This activity can be coordinated with activity C and/or activity B to create a more comprehensive calendar. Consequently, there would be three sets of EVE cards (one set with seven cards for the days of the week, another with the 31 numbers representing the months, and a third with the 12 months), along with a piece of cardboard where the day of the week, month, and numeral would be affixed using velcro. Similar to the previous suggestion, the words and numbers can be inscribed in Braille or, as illustrated in the digitally created model below (Image 9), in the high-relief alphabetic/numeric system.
In addition to serving as tangible illustrations of activities for visually impaired students to engage with while acquiring a new language, these resources also adhere to the criteria outlined by Uliana (2013) for designing tactile adaptations: the materials should be cost-effective, portable, and feature components that are straightforward to put together and take apart.
In addition to group and tactile activities, the EAL teacher may choose to incorporate working with sounds or songs. This approach highlights the importance of orality in the classroom, emphasizing the practical applications of oral genres in various contexts. Camargo and Nardi's study (2006) revealed that prospective teachers utilized orality by proposing activities such as oral presentations and theatrical plays to address challenges that could emerge when teaching Physics to visually impaired students.
Examples of didactic activities from the Vocabulary Corner that could be modified to incorporate sounds and oral elements are activities E and F, as depicted in Images 10 and 11.
In activity E, the EAL teacher can enhance the learning experience by presenting the sounds produced by various animals. This can be achieved through the utilization of digital audio resources such as YouTube. Students can then be prompted to identify the corresponding animal in English. This interactive exercise can be conducted in various formats including group work, paired activities, or as a whole class exercise. By engaging in this activity, students have the opportunity to hone their listening and speaking skills in a dynamic and engaging manner.
For Activity F, teachers have the option of utilizing a song that focuses on various forms of greetings. With numerous choices accessible online, educators can select the most suitable ones for their class. However, we recommend considering the video titled "Hello Song for Kids - Greeting Song for Kids - The Singing Walrus" available on The Singing Walrus channel on YouTube. This particular video stands out for its interactive nature and relevance to students' daily routines.
To facilitate the internalization of the greetings content, one approach could involve encouraging students to engage in communication with each other utilizing the vocabulary acquired from the song. The teacher could facilitate this process by setting up specific scenarios, such as those outlined in the textbook, which involve greetings, farewells, and inquiries about well-being, and then allowing students to interact within these contexts. This activity serves the dual purpose of fostering inclusivity and interaction between the visually impaired student and their peers, while also functioning as a fun and contextualized exercise that helps students perceive the new language as a social tool rather than just a set of grammatical rules.
The aforementioned adaptation suggestions represent only a limited selection of approaches for instructing blind students; however, there exists a plethora of other adapted didactic materials that hold potential for further investigation and integration into their educational framework. For example, materials presented in Braille (OLIVEIRA; REILY, 2014), recorded audio resources (CAMARGO; NARDI, 2006), engaging in debates (CAMARGO; NARDI, 2006), and providing detailed descriptions of images and graphs (FERREIRA; DICKMAN, 2015) are additional strategies that can prove beneficial and intellectually stimulating when educating blind students.
disciplines as well. It is crucial to engage in effective communication with students to ascertain their individual learning needs and determine the most suitable approach for their academic development. Furthermore, the modified activities outlined in this study are not limited to educators in the English language domain but can also be beneficial for instructors across various disciplines.
The research conducted in this study prompted us to contemplate the English education of visually impaired students and underscored the significance of delving into this subject matter. While the obstacles are apparent, the benefits derived from instructing blind students are equally notable, as it fosters a collaborative knowledge-building process between educators and learners.
It is widely acknowledged that the government has a responsibility to ensure adequate provisions for public education; however, there are instances where schools may lack the necessary didactic materials for the education of blind students. In such cases, the onus falls on the teacher to devise adaptations for the existing materials, particularly when dealing with textbooks or printed activities. Consequently, it becomes imperative for language teachers to familiarize themselves with basic adaptation techniques and establish effective communication with visually impaired students. This approach is essential for tailoring teaching methods to suit the specific needs and challenges faced by blind students.
Teachers have various options to modify didactic activities, such as incorporating tactile resources, sounds, songs, games, or group activities that focus on senses beyond vision. By implementing these changes, blind students can experience increased confidence and freedom to engage in classroom activities, crucial attributes for learning a new language. Additionally, these adaptations foster a sense of inclusion among blind students, as they feel supported and accepted by both their teachers and peers.
This research, building upon prior studies, not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge but also paves the way for future opportunities and enhancements in the adapted activities (Uliana, 2013).
Consulting with schools' educational advisors and special education professionals regarding the efficacy and integration of these materials into mainstream classrooms is crucial.
Testing and enhancing the adapted material in alignment with the specific needs and capabilities of blind students is crucial.
Encouraging the implementation of adaptations in educational settings is crucial for the integration of blind students into mainstream classrooms, particularly when traditional textbooks are utilized.
Analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the material for sighted students, as well as students with other disabilities like Down syndrome and children with motor difficulties, is crucial for understanding the overall impact of the educational resources. By considering the diverse needs of students with varying abilities, educators can tailor their teaching methods to ensure inclusivity and accessibility. This comprehensive approach not only benefits students with disabilities but also enhances the learning experience for all individuals in the classroom.
Continuing to develop adaptations for various activities, textbooks, and grade levels is essential for catering to impaired students who require specialized materials to facilitate effective learning.
This study aims to showcase the potential for adaptations to benefit blind learners, offering a valuable resource for educators across various disciplines, not limited to English language instruction. By developing lesson plans and didactic materials that prioritize accessibility and inclusion, teachers can ensure that every student, irrespective of any impairments, can fully engage with the learning process.
