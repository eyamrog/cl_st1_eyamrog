In this study, we assessed the efficacy of Holt's model in predicting the daily reported COVID-19 cases in Brazil and three specific Brazilian states.
Methods: The commencement of the study period was set from the date of the initial COVID-19 case up to April 25, 2020, designated as the training phase, followed by the subsequent period from April 26 to May 3, 2020, identified as the test phase.
Results: The Holt model demonstrated strong forecasting accuracy for cases in Brazil, as well as in the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais. However, it notably underestimated the forecasted cases in Rio de Janeiro state.
Conclusions: The Holt model may serve as a suitable short-term forecasting method provided that its assumptions are thoroughly verified and validated by experts in the field.
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is attributed to SARS-CoV-2 (or 2019-nCOV), a pathogen that predominantly affects the human respiratory system. Common symptoms observed at the initial stages of the illness include cough, fever, and fatigue. The initial cases were documented in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and swiftly disseminated across the nation and subsequently globally. By January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified COVID-19 as a "public-health emergency of international concern."
To address the challenge of predicting disease spread and obtaining short-term forecasts, various mathematical and statistical models can be employed (refer to sources 4 and 5 for examples). Considering an epidemic curve as a time series dataset depicting the daily case count of a disease, let Yt represent the cumulative confirmed cases on day t. Typically, this curve exhibits exponential growth initially, which eventually slows down and approaches a saturation point. Consequently, the simple exponential model is often utilized to characterize the outbreak's early phase, while S-shaped models like logistic, Gompertz, log-normal, and Richards models are commonly employed to capture all reported cumulative cases of a disease. In this study, we propose the use of double exponential smoothing as an alternative method for short-term forecasting of daily COVID-19 cases in Brazil, particularly before reaching the peak of cases.
Exponential smoothing methods are commonly employed for forecasting purposes. These techniques rely on a moving average of historical data points, with the current smoothed value serving as the prediction for the next data point. The Holt-Winters exponential model offers a more comprehensive approach to data smoothing, particularly when trends and seasonal patterns are evident. Double exponential smoothing, also known as Holt's method, is a specific scenario where seasonality is not a factor. Conversely, single exponential smoothing is utilized when neither trend nor seasonal variations are present in the data. In the formula for Holt's method, the forecasted value of the series at time t is determined by a formula involving the estimated level (Lt) and trend (Tt).
The estimated slope, denoted by <> in the context of this study, is determined by the smoothing parameters α and β, with detailed technical information available in reference 8. To implement Holt's model, we utilized the holt function within the forecast library of the R language, specifically version 3.6.2.
Daily COVID-19 case data were sourced from the Brazilian Health Ministry, accessible at https://covid.saude.gov.br/.
Our analysis incorporated data from the entirety of Brazil and specifically from the highly populated Brazilian states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro, collectively accounting for over 80 million residents, approximately 40% of the country's population. The training period encompassed daily reports starting from the initial case notification in Brazil and each state up to April 25, 2020, while the validation period consisted of observations from April 26 to May 3, 2020. To assess forecast accuracy, we compared Holt's method with traditional logistic, Gompertz, log-normal, and Richards growth curves, utilizing the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) to gauge the disparities between forecasted and actual values. The Theil's U entropy coefficient served as a metric for out-of-sample forecasting accuracy, with values exceeding 1 indicating less precision in the forecasts compared to a simplistic naïve approach where forecasts mirror the last observed value.
Figure 1 illustrates the cumulative reports of COVID-19 in Brazil, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro until April 25, 2020, alongside the projected values derived from Holt's method, including their respective prediction intervals. These numerical insights are further elaborated in Table 1, which juxtaposes the real-time and projected daily figures from April 26 to May 3, 2020. The Theil's U coefficients, indicative of forecast accuracy, demonstrate values below 1 for Brazil, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais, but surpassing 1 for Rio de Janeiro (as depicted in Figure 1). Notably, the majority of actual daily COVID-19 reports fall within the 95% prediction intervals, with the exception of projections for Rio de Janeiro, as highlighted in Table 1. It is worth noting that the estimated case count tends to underestimate the actual reports post-April 27, attributed to a sudden surge in notifications from that date onwards.
In Brazil, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values for forecasting methods utilizing logistic, Gompertz, log-normal, and Richards curves are 17.09, 10.84, 9.05, and 10.84, respectively. In the state of São Paulo, these values are 21.81, 15.70, 14.37, and 15.70; in Minas Gerais, they are 14.63, 8.52, 5.13, and 8.52; and in Rio de Janeiro, they are 18.00, 10.54, 8.18, and 10.55. Across all scenarios, MAPE values for Holt’s method forecasts (depicted in Figure 1) are consistently lower than those derived from traditional growth curves, indicating superior performance of Holt’s method. This trend holds true even when analyzing data from Rio de Janeiro. Figure 2 illustrates a visual comparison between actual daily COVID-19 reports from April 26 to May 3, 2020, and forecasts generated by various models, including Holt’s, logistic, Gompertz, log-normal, and Richards, for Brazil and the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. Exponential models were excluded from this analysis due to their inadequate performance in capturing epidemic trends during the training phase.
To accurately interpret the outcomes of these statistical models, it is crucial to consider a significant statement by Saffo10: "The goal of forecasting is not to predict the future but to inform you about what you need to know to take meaningful action in the present." Consequently, the out-of-sample predicted values should primarily be viewed as the expected daily count of COVID-19 cases if the epidemic curve continues to progress with the same pattern observed during the training phase. The variability in the time series of reported cases is heavily influenced by external factors, such as test availability for essential screening, the pace of result updates, changes in mitigation measures11, and the virus's incubation period of around 14 days (interquartile range, 8–17 days), which can vary based on the patient's age and immune system status12. Hence, it can be inferred that the Holt’s model demonstrated satisfactory forecasting performance for Brazil's data and the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, likely due to minimal changes in the epidemic curves at the start of the validation period. Conversely, this was not the case for Rio de Janeiro's data. Nonetheless, we do not attribute this to a flaw in the method but rather to a failure to adhere to its assumptions. These observations are applicable to any mathematical or statistical model utilized for predicting COVID-19 cases, underscoring the necessity for expert input from individuals well-versed in infectious disease dynamics. It is essential to emphasize that the findings of this study are specifically geared towards short-term forecasts of the cumulative COVID-19 cases in a particular population, as the Holt’s model exhibits limited sensitivity in predicting outbreak peaks or offering long-term projections.
An important limitation of this study is its reliance solely on the reported number of COVID-19 cases officially notified, neglecting the reality of underreported cases due to inadequate screening tests in Brazil. It is evident that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than what is documented. Despite this bias, these data serve as the primary source guiding our understanding of outbreak dynamics. Given the urgency for information crucial in decision-making during an epidemic, we acknowledge these limitations and utilize the available data as the best resource currently accessible. It is essential to recognize that the models presented in this study only reflect the cumulative case count, whereas more sophisticated models like the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models and their extensions can offer more precise predictions by considering susceptible and recovered individuals as well.
In conclusion, despite the challenges outlined in this study regarding the prediction of COVID-19 cases, the Holt's model may serve as a viable alternative to the conventional S-shaped curves, provided that its assumptions are thoroughly scrutinized and endorsed by experts.
