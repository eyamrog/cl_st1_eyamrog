The task of conducting a literature review has become increasingly challenging for researchers due to the continuous expansion of scientific knowledge across various fields, as highlighted by Basilio et al. (2021). This challenge is exacerbated by the sheer volume of research articles being published monthly through numerous academic channels. Drawing on Simon's (1955) theory of limited rationality, it is evident that researchers, like all individuals, are constrained by three key dimensions: the availability of information, the cognitive limitations of the human mind, and the time constraints imposed on decision-making processes.
Decision-making is a fundamental aspect of human activities, involving the evaluation of individual decision options based on preferences, experiences, and available data (Sałabun et al., 2020; Basilio and Pereira, 2020). Decisions can range from simple to complex, with varying levels of consequences (Behzadian et al., 2012; Kahraman et al., 2015; Govindan and Jepsen, 2016). Real-life problem-solving often entails reconciling conflicting viewpoints to arrive at a sound decision (Wang et al., 2008). Formally, a decision is a choice made using information or a method of action to address a specific problem (Greco et al., 2016). Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a valuable tool for evaluating potential courses of action and selecting the most favorable option or ranking them (Basilio et al., 2019; Basilio and Pereira, 2020a; Basilio et al., 2020; Moreira et al., 2022). In practical terms, MCDA plays a crucial role in guiding decision-makers towards rational choices, especially when faced with limited resources and competing interests in both organizational and personal contexts. Various terms like multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) or multiple-criteria decision aid (MCDA) are used interchangeably by researchers, highlighting the importance of these methods in aiding decision-making processes (Roy, 1990).
Zyoud and Fuchs-Hanusch (2017) and Sałabun et al. (2020) have emphasized the prevalent use of MCDA methods, categorizing them into two main "schools": the American and the European. The American school relies on a functional approach, primarily focusing on value or usability without considering potential uncertainties in data or decision-maker preferences. These methods typically employ a single synthesized criterion within an operational framework. Key methods associated with the American school include MAUT, AHP, ANP, SMART, UTA, MACBETH, and TOPSIS. In contrast, the European School adopts a relational model, utilizing criteria synthesis based on outranking relationships that involve transgressions between decision options. Notable methods from the European School include ELECTRE and PROMETHEE, alongside others like NAIADE, ORESTE, REGIME, ARGUS, TACTIC, MELCHIOR, and PAMSSEM. Many MCDA methods integrate aspects from both American and European decision support schools, such as EVAMIX, QUALIFLEX, PCCA, MAPPAC, PRAGMA, PACMAN, IDRA, COMET, and DRSA. Additionally, as highlighted by Behzadian et al. (2010), Govindan and Jepsen (2016), Basilio et al. (2017), and Zyoud and Fuchs-Hanusch (2017), MCDA methods find application in diverse fields including information and communication technology, business intelligence, environmental risk analysis, environmental impact assessment, water resource management, solid waste management, remote sensing, flood risk management, health technology assessment, healthcare, transport, nanotechnology research, climate change, energy, international law and policy, human resources, financial management, performance benchmarking, supplier selection, e-commerce, m-commerce, agriculture, horticulture, chemical and biochemical engineering, software evaluation, network selection, education, social policy, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, small-scale energy management systems, and public security.
Sałabun et al. (2020) emphasize that despite the abundance of MCDA methods, it is crucial to acknowledge that no method is flawless and universally applicable to all decision-making scenarios or problems (Guitouni and Martel, 1998). Consequently, employing various multi-criteria methods may yield divergent decision recommendations (Zanakis et al., 1998). It is essential to recognize that conflicting outcomes from different multi-criteria methods raise doubts about the validity of each choice (Gershon, 1984). In such instances, selecting a decision support method tailored to the specific problem at hand (Watróbski et al., 2019; Basilio et al., 2019) emerges as a critical research concern, as only a well-suited method enables the derivation of an accurate solution that mirrors the decision maker's preferences (Cinelli, 2020).
Human beings engage in decision-making as a fundamental aspect of their daily lives. While some decisions are simple and have limited consequences, others hold significant sway over individuals, communities, and even entire nations. Recognizing the crucial role of multi-criteria methods in aiding decision-makers across diverse domains, this study aims to address key inquiries and establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating academic productivity concerning multi-criteria decision-making techniques.

The ability to make decisions is a defining characteristic of individuals, with humans often relying on spontaneous and intuitive judgments driven by the information processing capacities of the brain. Decision-making spans a spectrum from trivial choices like selecting a tie color for a business meeting to weighty determinations such as investing millions in a specific project. It is evident that decisions can be categorized into two broad types: those that are straightforward and those that are complex. Simple decisions, characterized by a limited number of variables, can be made with relative ease. However, when faced with intricate problems involving a matrix of variables (n x m), the utilization of methods and computer capabilities becomes essential to systematize, organize, and prioritize the optimal choices to facilitate decision-making. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this research endeavor was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the global advancements in the study and implementation of multicriteria decision-making methods.
