1. Introduction
With the constant growth of the dissemination of scientific knowledge in its most varied fields of knowledge, the literature review becomes a challenging task for the researcher, as reported by (Basilio et al., 2021). The challenge finds adherence in the volume of research published monthly by the thousands of academic publication vehicles. Based on the theory of limited rationality by (Simon, 1955), it can be said that a researcher, like any other human being, has his rationality limited by three dimensions: the information available; the cognitive limitation of the individual mind; and the time available for decision making.
Decision-making is essential for human activities. All such decisions are made based on the assessment of individual decision options, usually based on preferences, experience, and other data available to the decision maker (Sałabun et al., 2020; Basilio and Pereira, 2020). Some decisions are simple, while others are complex (Behzadian et al., 2012). According to (Kahraman et al., 2015; Govindan and Jepsen, 2016), decisions may be relatively simple, especially if the consequences of a wrong decision are not significant, while others may be highly complex and have substantial outcomes. Real-life problem solving generally involves several conflicting points of view, which must be considered together to reach a reasonable decision (Wang et al., 2008). Formally, a decision can be defined as a choice made based on the available information, or a method of action aimed at solving a specific decision problem (Greco et al., 2016). In practice, multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) evaluates a collection of possible courses of action or options by selecting a preferred option or sorting the options from best to worst (Basilio et al., 2019; Basilio and Pereira, 2020a; Basilio et al., 2020, Moreira et al., 2022). In daily practice, the application of MCDA is crucial in signalling the best rational alternative for the decision maker, so that he can allocate finite resources between competing and alternative interests. Because in simple or complex decisions, whether in the organizational or domestic environment, the decision maker is always faced with several paths and few resources. Researchers refer to multiple criteria methods in different ways. Such methods are frequently referred to as multicriteria decision-making or multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM). Some authors prefer the term multiple-criteria decision aid or aiding (MCDA), while others prefer to use the term multiple-criteria decision analysis (Roy, 1990).
(Zyoud and Fuchs-Hanusch, 2017; Sałabun et al., 2020) highlight the most used MCDA methods, which are basically grouped into two "schools": the American and the European. The methods of the American school of decision support are based on a functional approach, namely, the use of value or usability. These methods usually do not take into account the uncertainty, inaccuracy, and uncertainty that can occur in data or decision-maker preferences. This group of methods is strongly connected with the operational approach using a single synthesized criterion. The basic methods of the American school are MAUT, AHP, ANP, SMART, UTA, MACBETH, and TOPSIS. The methods of the European School use a relational model. Thus, they use a synthesis of criteria based on the relation of outranking. This relation is characterized by transgression between pairs of decision options. Among the methods of the European School of Decision Support, the groups of ELECTRE and PROMETHEE methods should be mentioned above all. Other examples of methods from the European MCDA field are NAIADE, ORESTE, REGIME, ARGUS, TACTIC, MELCHIOR, and PAMSSEM. Many multi-criteria methods combine the approaches of the American and European decision support school, as an example we can mention the following methods: EVAMIX, QUALIFLEX, PCCA, MAPPAC, PRAGMA, PACMAN, IDRA, COMET, and SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3576 3
DRSA. Furthermore, as stated by (Behzadian et al., 2010; Govindan and Jepsen, 2016; Basilio et al., 2017; Zyoud and Fuchs-Hanusch, 2017), MCDA methods are used to solve decision-making problems in several areas, including the information and communication technology; business intelligence; environmental risk analysis; environmental impact assessment and environmental sciences; water resource management; solid waste management; remote sensing; flood risk management; health technology assessment; healthcare; transport; nanotechnology research; climate change; energy; international law and policy; human resources; financial management; performance and benchmarking; supplier selection; e-commerce and m-commerce; agriculture and horticulture; chemical and biochemical engineering; software evaluation; network selection; education and social policy; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and small-scale energy management systems; and public security.
As Sałabun et al. (2020) asserts, despite the large number of MCDA methods, it should be remembered that no method is perfect and cannot be considered suitable for use in every decision-making situation or for solving every decision problem (Guitouni and Martel, 1998). Therefore, using different multi-criteria methods may lead to different decision recommendations (Zanakis et al., 1998). It should be noted, however, that if different multi- criteria methods achieve contradictory results, then the correctness of the choice of each of them is questioned (Gershon, 1984). In such a situation, the choice of a decision support method appropriate to the given problem (Watróbski et al., 2019; Basilio et al., 2019) becomes an important research issue, as only an adequately chosen method allows one to obtain a correct solution reflecting the preferences of the decision maker (Cinelli, 2020).
Human beings make decisions daily, and decision-making is an intrinsic part of their nature. Some decisions are straightforward and have minimal influence on people's lives; others, on the other hand, directly impact people's lives, cities, and nations. In this regard, and in light of the importance of multi-criteria methods in assisting decision-makers in various fields, the current study seeks to answer the following questions and develop a reference framework on academic productivity about multi-criteria decision-making methods:
Q1: Who are the most influential authors and researchers in terms of their scientific productivity on the subject area of multicriteria decision-making methods? Q2:What is the annual scientific publication growth in the multicriteria methods of decision-making? Q3:Which countries have the most significant production of articles on the multicriteria methods of decision support? Q4:Which journals do the researchers mainly publish their articles on? Q5:What are the conceptual structures of the multicriteria methods of decision support?
Throughout this research process, 342 systematic literature reviews on the theme of multicriteria methods have been identified as per the ten largest categories classified by the Web of Science, i.e., green sustainable science technology (Fossile et al., 2020); energy fuels (Siksnelyte-Butkiene et al., 2020); environmental sciences (Akhtar et al., 2021); operations research and management science (Syan and Ramsoobag, 2019; Costa et al., 2021); computer science and artificial intelligence (Salih et al., 2019); management (Pelissari et al., 2021); economics (Moreno-Calderón et al., 2020); engineering environmental (Heidari et al., 2021); computer science and interdisciplinary applications (Cunha et al., 2021); engineering civil (Serugga et al., 2020).
This article is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief description of the methods and materials. Section 3 presents the preliminary bibliometric results and visualizes the collaborative relationships between countries, and authors, using R and the VOSviewer software. Keyword co-occurrences are analyzed, and strategic diagrams are constructed in the same section to reveal thematic trends on the multi-criteria decision support theme. The main conclusions are summarized in Section 4.

2. Methods and data
In this study, a topical query on April 29, 2021 was conducted in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus database, using the following search query: ( ( "MULTI-ATTRIBUTE DECISION MAKING" OR “MADM” OR “MCDA” OR “MODM” OR “MCDM” OR "MULTICRITERIA" OR "MULTI-CRITERIA" OR "MULTIPLECRITERIA" ) AND ( “AHP” OR “TODIM” OR "TOPSIS" OR "PROMETHEE" OR "ELECTRE" OR "VIKOR" OR "MAUT" OR "FITRADEOFF" OR "DEMATEL" OR "COPRAS" OR "MULTIMOORA" OR "SWARA" OR "ANALYTICAL NETWORK PROCESS" OR “ANP” OR "FUZZY DECISION MAKING" OR "HYBRID MCDM" OR "FUZZY SET THEORY" OR “FST” OR "SIMPLE MULTI-ATTRIBUTE RATING TECHNIQUE" OR “SMART” OR "GOAL PROGRAMMING" OR "THOR" OR “CBR” OR “SAW” OR “BORDA” OR “CONDORCET” OR "DOMINANCE-BASED ROUGH SET APPROACH" OR “DRSA” OR “GAIA” OR “GRA” OR "MEASURING ATTRACTIVENESS BY A CATEGORICAL BASED EVALUATION TECHNIQUE" OR “MACBETH” OR "MULTI-ATTRIBUTE GLOBAL INFERENCE OF QUALITY" OR “MAGIQ” OR "NEW APPROACH TO APPRAISAL" OR “PAPRIKA” OR "WEIGHTED PRODUCT MODEL" OR “WPM” OR “WSM” OR “UTADIS” OR “WASPAS” ) ).
The search query was used for obtaining results only from articles, titles, abstracts, and keywords. The query was limited to publications made between 1945 and 2021. In the WoS database, the search was done only on the Core Collection. The search started with 31,932 records resulting from the query made to the WoS and Scopus databases. After downloading the records, the bibliometrix package version 1.2.1335 of RStudio was installed on the Win64 operating system. The bibliometrix R package was used to perform the bibiometric analysis and obtain the answers for questions Q1 to Q5. Then, we used the bibliometrix tool’s functions to create descriptive and co- citation networks, respectively. The function convert2df embedded in the bibliometrix package was used to extract and create a data frame corresponding to the unit of analysis within the exported files from WoS and Scopus databases. After creating the data frames from the WoS and Scopus files, the mergeDbSources function merged the WoS and Scopus data frames and excluded duplicate records from both files. 11,071 duplicate records were removed, resulting in a data frame with 20,861 records for bibliometric analysis. The process of obtaining the bibliographic records file can be seen in Figure 1.

3. Finding and discussion
The results from the bibliometric analysis show that 29,050 authors produced 20,861 documents in the period from January 1, 1977, to April 29, 2021. The types of documents identified in the sample, despite the limitations described in the methods and data section, were as follows: 71.12% are article (14,837); 1.64% are review (342); 7.04% are conference paper (1,469); 1.47% are article-proceedings paper (307); 1.39% are article-early access (290); 15.19% are proceedings paper (3,169); and others. Regarding academic production, studies on multicriteria methods of decision support had their genesis in 1977. Figure 2 illustrates the trajectory of publications up to April 2021. Observing the graph, it appears that the growth began from 1986 with a small degree of inclination. In this period, the number of average publications was 7.3 documents per year. From 1987 to 1996, the average document increased to 28.3 documents per year. In the following ten years, this average jumped to 123.2 documents per year, and finally, from 2007 to 2021, the average was 1265.73, thus showing a high degree of interest on the part of researchers in the topic. Considering the total period, publications on multicriteria decision support methods reached an annual percentage growth rate of 13.88365. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the average total citations per year (16.06) and the average years from publication (6.36), respectively. The volume of publications resulted in a total of 472,345 references.

Figure 6 is elaborated to observe the relationships between organizations through the Co- authorship analysis, having the universities as the unit of analysis. The following criteria were used: 1) the minimum number of documents per organization (n>=50); 2) the minimum number of citations per organization (n>=50). With the established criteria, 50 organizations out of the 7619 analyzed were separated. The nodes represent the universities, the diameter of the nodes represents the number of citations, and the thickness of the connecting lines between the nodes represent the level of cooperation between the institutions. In this way, we highlight the following organizations: Islamic Azad University and Vilnius Gediminas Technical University. Figure 7 illustrates international cooperation between countries and highlights the following leading countries: China, India, Iran, Turkey, Taiwan, United States, Brazil, Spain, Italy, and Malaysia.

3.4 Evolution of the concept map on multicriteria methods
VOSviewer was used to extract and analyze keywords from 33,761 articles. Figure 10 depicts 329 terms that appeared more than 50 times which are grouped into six clusters: cluster 1 (in red); cluster 2 (in green); cluster 3 (in blue); cluster 4 (in yellow); cluster 5 (in purple); and cluster 6 (in light blue). Keywords that appeared frequently are represented by frames with a big size. The following keywords have the highest connection strength inside Cluster 1: AHP (14,621), analytic hierarchy process (8,026). Furthermore, relevant terms in Cluster 2 included: model (14,499), performance (5,679), framework (4,987), supplier selection (3,975), and dematel (2,807). The primary keywords in Cluster 3 were topsis (13,046), multicriteria decision making (4,171), and group decision- making (3,748). Similarly, the main keywords in Cluster 4 were decision-making (8,304), ranking (4,050), optimization (3,658), and promethee (3,084). The main keywords in Cluster 5 were selection (12,276), mcdm (6,947), and vikor (4,054). Relevant keywords in Cluster 6 were fuzzy (2,181), prioritizing (1,023), and fahp (666).
Figure 11 depicts a map of the conceptual framework constructed from the authors' keywords. The map, created using the MCA method (Multiple Correspondence Analysis), is divided into three periods: the first spans the years 1982-2001, highlighting the following methods: AHP, PROMETHEE. There are two clusters in the second phase between 2002 and 2011. The blue cluster represents the ANP method, whereas the red cluster reflects the AHP, PROMETHEE, TOPSIS, VIKOR, and GIS methods. Finally, in the third period of 2012-2021, four clusters can be observed, with the red cluster being the most prominent one. Furthermore, a wide range of methods and applications is observed demonstrating a significant rise in scientific output throughout this time of multicriteria methods. Figure 12 shows the outcome of using the Bibliometrix package's thematicMap function. The illustration is split into four quadrants. The first portrays the motor themes, the second the highly developed and isolated themes, the third the developing or decreasing themes, and the fourth the basic and transversal themes. This thematic map was split into three phases to illustrate how the themes revolving around using multicriteria methods evolved between 1982 and 2021.

4. Conclusion This research article presents a bibliometric analysis of the multicriteria methods from 1977 to April 29, 2021. The bibliographic data was obtained from the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases. The bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Bibliometrix R tool and the VOSviewer software to investigate the essential characteristics of the studies done so far, including publications; citations, citation structure; influential authors; co-citation contributors, and burst detection analysis; author-keywords; co-occurrence analyses; and timeline view analysis. The ability to make decisions is a trait that distinguishes a person. Man makes judgments spontaneously and intuitively based on the information processing capabilities of our brain. We make decisions ranging from the color of our tie at a business meeting to whether or not to spend millions on a particular project. We recognize that we are dealing with two different sorts of decisions: easy and difficult. We can make easy judgments with few variables without much difficulty. However, when the problem involves a matrix (n x m) variable, we need methods and computer capability to systematize, organize, and rank the best possibilities to help us make decisions. In this view, the purpose of this study was to comprehend the global progress of research on the development and application of multicriteria decision methods. With a 13.88 percent yearly growth rate in scientific production, it is evident that the academic community is interested in researching and publishing articles on multicriteria decision-making methods. Furthermore, 60.93 percent of all publications were concentrated in only ten countries, with China leading the way with 14.14 percent, India with 10.76 percent, and Iran with 8.09 percent. It is also found that the remaining 39 percent of publications have a production rate of less than 1% on average, indicating a potential for multicriteria method research dissemination in such nations and investment to increase academic output. The leading ten countries follow the same pattern in terms of citations, accounting for 62.48% of all citations made during the research period. In terms of multi-country collaboration in publications, it is observed that among the top ten countries, Turkey has the lowest MCP ratio with 0.0519, suggesting limited collaboration with researchers from other countries, followed by India (0.0641) and Brazil (0.0861). Malaysia, having an MCP ratio of 0.2331, takes the lead in multi-country collaboration, followed by the United States (0.2234) and Spain (0.2169). In terms of universities, about 80% of the publications come from China, India, Iran, and Turkey respectively, which are the top four countries having the most publications on the topic of multicriteria methods. The academic production of these universities amounts to 11.79 percent, with the Islamic Azad University of Iran accounting for 2.14 percent and Vilnius Gediminas Technical University of Lithuania accounting for 2.18 percent. Interestingly, Lithuania is not among the top ten countries in terms of scientific production. However, Prof. Edmundas Kazimieras Zavadskas of Lithuania is placed first among the other authors in this study, with 240 publications published on the subject of multicriteria methods. Regarding sources that publish articles related to multicriteria methods, the analysis reveals the top ten journals having published about 10.4 percent of the total publications about the topic. ‘Expert Systems With Applications’ leads the ranking with 1.70 percent of articles published thus far, followed by ‘Sustainability’ with 1.68 percent, and ‘Journal of Cleaner Production’ with 1.29 percent. In terms of citations, the leading journals are: ‘Expert Systems With Applications’ with an average citation of 7.88, followed by ‘European Journal of Operational Research’ with an average citation score of 6.61 per article. With respect to the country of origin of publications, it is observed that eight among the top 10 countries publish most of their articles in the ten best-ranked journals. However, in the case of the ‘European Journal of Operational Research,’ the ratio is 2 out of 10. In terms of the most influential authors in this subject area, it can be seen that around 0.034 percent of the total of 29,050 authors are responsible for 6.98 percent of publications in the past forty-four years, with ZAVADSKAS E having the most publications with 240 articles; followed by WANG J with 211 articles; and TZENG G with 191 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3576 27
articles. Through this bibliometric analysis, it is also observed that six of the top ten authors are Chinese, with Central South University being the standout for author affiliation. Furthermore, in addition to identifying authors with higher academic productivity, this study also provides a detailed overview of the countries, funding sources, and the five most explored multicriteria methods, i.e., AHP, TOPSIS, VIKOR PROMETHEE, and ANP, by the authors in their respective studies. In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multicriteria methods through a bibliometric analysis, which would aid the researchers in understanding the current state, future development trends, and research scope of the multicriteria decision-making methods. As an indication for future research, we can highlight the need to understand the emergence and regionalization of some methods and their variants; expand research within the ranked countries to deepen knowledge about their scientific production in relation to the topic explored; Apply topic modelling to identify latent themes in the studied database; and systematize the variants of the methods and their interfaces with other areas of operational research.
