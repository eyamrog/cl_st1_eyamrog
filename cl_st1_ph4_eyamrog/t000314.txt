This paper shows a technique for the detection of regularities in the complete genome of 
Coronavirus 2. For this, the concept of intervals in the RNA chain and their comparison 
within the known sequence is used. The Maximum Regularity Index was applied. The results 
show that areas of high regularity are identified that coincide with ORF10, Gene N, 
nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and others. The interval around 3500 and the interval around 
11000, respectively, appear with high values of regularity and this do not correspond to 
particularly documented elements (both within Gene: Orf1ab). It might be in the interest 
of giving importance to that region. The detection of regularities can enhance the creation 
of biochemical or genetic techniques to deactivate certain functions of Coronavirus 2 or 
control its effects. 

Coronavirus 2 has a sequence of 29902 nt (April 10th, 2020) [1].  Its full lineage is: Viruses; 
Riboviria; 
Nidovirals; 
Cornidovirineae; 
Coronaviridae; 
Orthocoronavirinae; 
Betacoronavirus; Sarbecovirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and 
its genbank acronym is SARS-CoV2.  

A method has been applied in which chains of RNA of a certain length are taken and 
compared with chains of the same length within the complete genome. In previous work 
this technique has been applied to other microorganisms [2],[3],[4].  

The index of maximum regularity  𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟 was defined in [5] and in other papers such as [4] 
has been widely described. 

In summary, a string or interval lc is defined. It considers the new sequences that are 
generated 𝑙𝑐−1  when a shift is made, one nucleotide at a time.  Each ordered pair is part 
of the set 𝐵× 𝐵, where 𝐵= {𝐴, 𝐺, 𝑇, 𝐶}. This procedure is repeated considering the original 
sequence together with the one generated by reversing its order. 

The 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟 was applied to the complete genome of Coronavirus 2. Below are the results of 
coincidence with the genes already discovered by other techniques (NCBI, 2020) and 
possible areas of study for possible deepening. 

For a visualization on the components of Coronavirus 2, the configuration of the NCBI (2020) 
is shown. 

In the indicated regions, there are intervals that take higher values (Table 1).  

Thus, it is evident that in the areas near the intervals around 21578, 29876, 29390, 3952, 
11076 have high values. As consulted in the database, this is positive because Gene S, Gene 
N and ORF10 were identified. It is important to research in more detail what happens 
around 11078 interval (20 nt).  It should be clarified that Gene: Orf1ab is in the range [269, 
21 558] (71% of the entire genome) which is extremely wide and the 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟  indicates 
something of importance around 11000 

The following is the complete genome analysis with 16 nt. (Graph 2 and Table 2) 

In this string size, Gene S (start) and Gene ORF10 are identified. And again, the  𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟 
points to an important zone around the 11000 interval.   

When calculating with a length interval of 28 nt, the sectors around 3500 and 11000 appear 
with high values. Longer chains are not considered because the probability of occurrence 
decreases with the number of combinations of the four possibilities. 

During the analysis Gene S, Gene N and ORF10 were identified. The interval around 3500 
and the interval around 11000, respectively, appear with high values of regularity and this 
do not correspond to documented elements (both within Gene: Orf1ab). It might be in the 
interest of giving importance to that region. 

The strategy developed here may offer insights into Coronavirus 2 and eventually, with 
much more research and sophistication, a treatment may be found.
