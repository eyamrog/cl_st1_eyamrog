A novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov, later named SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Wuhan, China, towards the end of 2019, and was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Given its high level of contagiousness, significant regional and national adjustments were implemented, with social isolation being strongly recommended, resulting in the suspension of various services, including elective dental procedures. This review sought to examine the alterations observed in the orthodontic practice landscape post-COVID-19. To achieve this, a thorough search was conducted across databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and SciELO, utilizing the keywords "Orthodontics" and "Covid-19". Following the application of specific inclusion criteria, 11 articles were chosen for detailed analysis. The research revealed that social distancing measures had a notable impact on the scheduling of orthodontic appointments and heightened patient concerns regarding treatment duration. The integration of teleodontology emerged as a valuable tool for both screening and patient management. Furthermore, the implementation of stringent infection control measures is imperative to ensure the safety of orthodontic practices moving forward.
Following the identification of a significant number of cases related to a novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China [1] (initially termed 2019-nCov and later renamed as SARS-CoV-2) [2,3], the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [4]. In efforts to curb the rapid transmission of the highly infectious COVID-19, substantial regional and national measures have been implemented, resulting in the closure of non-essential services [5].
It has been advised to suspend non-urgent dental procedures, with the exception of emergencies, as a means to support social distancing efforts, minimize the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), decrease aerosol generation, and subsequently lower the risk of infection [6].
The postponement of orthodontic consultations has raised concerns among patients regarding the potential prolongation of their treatment [7]. Additionally, anxiety has surfaced regarding the scheduling of their next visit to the orthodontist [8], particularly as social isolation measures have been implemented by numerous countries [9].
In the absence of face-to-face consultations, professionals and patients undergoing orthodontic treatment have turned to technology to provide and receive virtual assistance, utilizing photo, video, or video-call applications. This approach enables orthodontists to assess the necessity of in-person visits [5,6]. These technological communication tools not only maintain the patient-professional relationship but also reduce anxiety by eliminating the risk of contamination that may occur during in-person appointments [8].
For a complete resumption of orthodontic practice, it is imperative that all dental team members consistently implement effective infection control measures. This includes proper handwashing techniques, thorough disinfection of all surfaces within the dental office, and a comprehensive understanding and adherence to the protocols outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) [7].
This study sought to ascertain the alterations that have transpired in the orthodontic practice landscape post-COVID-19, recognizing the significance of up-to-date information on the prevailing circumstances.
The bibliographic review in this research employed a documentary technique grounded in existing literature. The search for relevant articles was conducted on bibliographic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and SciELO. The keywords "Orthodontics" and "Covid-19" were utilized in both Portuguese and English. These terms were sourced from the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) provided by the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME).
The eligibility criteria for inclusion in this study encompassed articles published up to August 2020, written in either English or Portuguese, with full-text availability on the specific theme under consideration. Excluded from the analysis were articles that focused on the theme of COVID-19 in Dentistry but did not pertain to the Orthodontics specialty, letters to the Editor, and studies conducted on animals (in vivo).
A total of forty-seven articles were identified, with thirty-eight sourced from the PubMed database, eight from Scopus, and one from SciELO. After excluding twelve duplicates, thirty-five unique articles underwent review by two independent assessors. Subsequently, eleven articles met the predefined inclusion criteria and were chosen for detailed analysis, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Chart 1 presents a comprehensive overview of the 11 selected articles, detailing the author, year, and country of the study, along with the objectives, main results, and conclusions. This data serves as a guiding framework for the subsequent discussion of the results within this article.
There are concerns surrounding the appearance, epidemiology, risks, and precautions during the disease crisis [15], as well as the implications of coronavirus infection for orthodontic treatment [5]. Various preventive strategies for infection control [12] and aerosol reduction [13] have been documented. Furthermore, recommendations have been made for the utilization of virtual assistance [11, 13, 14], along with assessments of the pandemic's impact on orthodontic consultations and the anxiety experienced by both patients and professionals [6-9].
In light of the coronavirus pandemic, it is imperative for dental professionals to remain vigilant of the occupational hazards associated with COVID-19 and to stay abreast of the latest infection control protocols. The onus falls on orthodontists to safeguard the well-being of their team members and to mitigate the risk of cross-contamination within the dental practice [5,15].
The risk of contracting COVID-19 can manifest through various means, such as exposure to droplets of saliva expelled during coughing or sneezing, indirect contact with contaminated surfaces, aerosols produced during orthodontic procedures, aligner removal and replacement, as well as interactions with multiple individuals during various orthodontic activities like bonding and bracket removal, wire changes, and placement of mini implants. Orthodontic tools and materials that lack individual packaging can serve as potential sources of contamination. Given that the coronavirus has been detected in the saliva of infected individuals, this bodily fluid poses an additional hazard for orthodontic professionals and their close contacts.
In Orthodontics, urgent situations include the insertion of a wire from a fixed orthodontic appliance into the gum or oral mucosa, causing severe pain or infection, as well as circumstances related to dental trauma in patients using fixed or removable appliances. Neglecting care in these cases could harm the patient, for instance, by leading to gingival inflammation due to the loosening of an orthodontic band or the detachment of brackets [18].
In the realm of teleodontology, various tools such as photos, videos, video calls, communication applications like WhatsApp and Telegram, and websites have been utilized [10,13]. Virtual assistance has emerged as an effective method for offering support to patients, offering advantages such as cost reduction, increased treatment accessibility, minimized infection risks, fewer consultations, issue resolution, and enhanced follow-up particularly with odontophobic individuals [10,13,14]. Remote monitoring has proven to be a feasible approach for certain orthodontic treatments during pandemics, and could potentially serve as a solution even in non-crisis times to streamline the requirements of orthodontic therapy [14].
Assessments were conducted using questionnaires to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on orthodontic consultations and the anxiety experienced by both patients and professionals. Findings indicated that anxiety levels were higher among women than men, with the primary concern being the delay in treatment. It was noted that fixed lingual appliances and invisible aligners were less likely to cause high levels of anxiety regarding treatment duration when compared to conventional fixed appliances. In contrast, professionals expressed apprehension about resuming their daily activities due to perceived risks to themselves and their families.
Procedures within orthodontic practice necessitate strict adherence to preventive measures to effectively control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, thereby reducing aerosol usage to minimize infections and prevent environmental contamination. Initially, treatment guidelines can be delivered remotely, with in-person treatment only occurring when the infection prevention and control protocol is rigorously followed. Teleorthodontics serves as a means of providing reassurance to both patients and professionals, allowing for ongoing patient support without compromising treatment outcomes.
The necessity for social isolation mandated by the coronavirus pandemic has been demonstrated to affect the scheduling of orthodontic appointments and heighten patients' anxiety regarding the extension of their treatments. The utilization of communication technologies has proven invaluable in patient care, facilitating initial screenings prior to in-person consultations. It is imperative to implement stringent infection control protocols to ensure that orthodontic procedures can be carried out safely, minimizing risks for both patients and healthcare professionals.
