The initial in vitro plant establishment of seeds and nodal segments from the bromeliad Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch presents distinct respiratory rates and shoot formation patterns. Our study aimed to explore the morphological and respiratory variations during in vitro shoot development from seeds and nodal segments of Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch, highlighting disparities in plants derived from micropropagation. Over a 35-day culture period, seeds exhibited complete plant formation 14 days earlier than nodal segments, showcasing longer leaves and increased root growth. Conversely, nodal segment plantlets displayed enhanced shoot multiplication. O2 consumption and CO2 release peaks were observed at 7 and 14 days for nodal segments and seeds, respectively, indicating a heightened energy demand during initial growth stages. Notably, nodal segments displayed a higher respiration peak compared to seeds, potentially attributed to the energy-intensive process of multiple bud breaks. Subsequently, respiration levels decreased, converging to similar values in both propagules by day 35, suggesting a progressive enhancement in photosynthetic activity in seed and nodal segment plants, likely linked to shoot development. In summary, the developmental trajectory of nodal segment plants may influence energy and respiratory requirements differently compared to seedlings.
An efficient conservation method for endangered plant species involves the development of in vitro germplasm banks, enabling the storage of numerous plants in compact spaces with minimal maintenance compared to field or greenhouse cultivation (Imarhiagbe et al., 2016; Oseni et al., 2018). This technique is applicable to seeds or tissue explants, such as nodal segments (NS, Pilatti et al., 2011). The ornamental bromeliad Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch (Bromeliaceae) can be propagated in vitro through seeds and NS isolated from elongated plant stems, which are subcultured to generate new plants (Santos et al., 2010). Micropropagation has been utilized in the cultivation of various bromeliad species to meet the demand in the ornamental plants market, thereby curbing illegal extraction (Mercier & Nievola, 2003; Negrelle et al., 2012). The ability to maintain cultures under controlled conditions (light, temperature, nutrients, etc.) has facilitated the study of basic physiology in various species, including bromeliads (Narayani & Srivastava, 2017; Bakhshipour et al., 2019; Chetty et al., 2020), as evidenced by research conducted by Carvalho et al. (2013), Freitas et al. (2015), Andrade & Tamaki (2016), Santos et al. (2017), Silva et al. (2017), Andrade-Santos et al. (2020), and Silva et al. (2020).
The growth of plants in sealed flasks may result in a limited exchange of gases between the internal and external environments, leading to the accumulation of gases like CO2 and O2 within the flasks (George et al., 2008). Consequently, the gaseous composition of the isolated in vitro atmosphere mirrors the respiratory and photosynthetic activities of micropropagated plants (Chen, 2006). Under photomixotrophic conditions, characterized by high sugar concentrations in the culture medium, low light intensity, high relative humidity, and restricted gas exchange in enclosed vessels, the photosynthetic rate decreases, while respiration is less impacted due to the availability of carbon (Lucchesini et al., 2001; George et al., 2008; Ševčíková et al., 2019).
The consumption of gases and respiratory activity of seeds and non-seed propagules would inevitably differ due to the distinct processes involved in shoot development from each type: germination entails the imbibition of the seed, followed by heightened respiration and metabolic activity leading to root emergence from the seed testa (Taiz et al., 2017).
Nodal segments (NS) lead to shoot formation from an axillary bud meristem that is stimulated after apical dominance is broken due to the node's isolation from the mother plant (George et al., 2008). Nevertheless, no studies investigating respiration during in vitro plantlet development from lateral buds and its comparison to seed germination were identified.
Considering the developmental disparities between seeds and NS, it is hypothesized that the propagules of A. strobilacea exhibit distinct rates of respiration during plant formation. To test this hypothesis, the morphological development during the initial in vitro shoot formation from seeds and NS of A. strobilacea was investigated, alongside the progression of respiratory rates over 35 days by monitoring CO2 and O2 levels within culture vessels. By tracking the evolution of respiratory rates during in vitro plant formation, potential differences in photosynthetic activity between propagules could be identified. The findings obtained may shed light on the metabolic status of plants originating from seeds and NS, offering insights into the timing of photosynthetic initiation and the subsequent enhanced ability to withstand acclimatization (Ševčíková et al., 2019). Consequently, this research has the potential to enhance the management of germplasm collections and plant production of A. strobilacea, while also introducing an innovative approach for the simultaneous assessment of the developmental timeline of these explants during micropropagation.
Seeds of Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch were collected at the Reserva Biológica de Mogi Guaçu in São Paulo State, Brazil, and stored at 8°C for approximately 12 months before the commencement of the experiments. The seeds were subjected to a series of sterilization steps following the method outlined by Santos et al. (2010). Initially, they were surface sterilized in 100% (v/v) commercial sodium hypochlorite (2% active chlorine) with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20® for 20 minutes, then treated with 25% (v/v) hydrochloric acid for 10 minutes to eliminate a significant portion of the mucilage. Subsequently, the seeds were immersed in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 minutes, followed by a 15-minute exposure to the fungicide Benomyl 0.1% (w/v), and finally soaked in 100% (v/v) commercial sodium hypochlorite with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20® for 1 hour (Santos et al. 2010). The sterilized seeds were then transferred under aseptic conditions to 250 mL flasks containing 40 mL of Murashige & Skoog (1962) medium (MS) with 1/5 of the original macronutrient concentration (MS/5), full MS micronutrients, 2% sucrose (w/v), 100 mg L-1 myo-inositol, and 0.1 mg L-1 thiamine. The pH was adjusted to 5.8, and agar (5 g L-1) was added before autoclaving at 121°C for 15 minutes. The seeds were cultivated in a growth room at 25±2°C, with a 12-hour photoperiod and 14 μmol m-2 s-1 light intensity to promote the elongation of the stem axis (Santos et al. 2010). After three months, the non-sterile (NS) plants were isolated from the elongated plants (figure 1a) and transferred under aseptic conditions to flasks with 20 mL of the same culture medium, sealed with caps containing a 2-mm hole covered by a rubber septum for air sample collection (Lamarca & Barbedo 2012). This process was repeated for a batch of surface-sterilized seeds. The flasks were maintained in a growth room with a 12-hour photoperiod, at 25±2°C, and 30 μmol m-2 s-1 irradiance. Plant growth assessment and air sample collection were conducted during the light period from five flasks, each containing five propagules, at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 35 days.
The oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) percentages in the flasks were determined using a gas analyzer (model ILL6600, Illinois Instruments, Inc., Johnsburg, IL, USA) as outlined in Lamarca and Barbedo (2012). These analyses provided an indirect assessment of respiratory activity by calculating O2 consumption and CO2 release rates. The percentage values of O2 and CO2 were then converted to partial pressure of gas using the equation: p1 P-1 = v1 V-1, where p1 represents the partial pressure of gas (atm), P is the local atmospheric pressure (0.9 atm), v1 is the gas volume (%), and V is the total volume (100%) (Atkins & De Paula, 2001). Subsequently, these values were further converted to micromoles of O2 and CO2 through the equation: p1 V = n RT, where V denotes the total volume of air in the flasks (L), n represents the number of moles of gas, R is the gas universal constant (0.082 atm L mol-1 K-1), and T signifies the temperature in Kelvin (Atkins & De Paula, 2001).
In each period, 20 plants were randomly selected from a pool of 25 propagules for evaluation of growth parameters, including the number of leaves and roots, as well as the longest leaf and root length. Measurements were taken only for roots exceeding 0.5 cm and leaves that had fully expanded. This selection process was necessary due to the presence of non-sprouting NS and seeds that failed to germinate during the experiment.
To assess the number of shoots per propagule, a distinct set of NS and seeds were grown in 250 mL flasks with 40 mL of MS/5 culture media. These were kept in a growth room with a 12-hour photoperiod, maintained at 25±2 °C, and exposed to 30 μmol m-2 s-1 irradiance. The evaluation of shoot production was conducted every 15 days during the in vitro culture period, spanning 75 days. This assessment involved 15 plants per period, with five plants per flask across three flasks.
Leaf formation was initially observed in seeds after 14 days of culture, coinciding with the emergence of roots as depicted in figures 1d and 2. Similarly, in the case of NS, leaf development was noted at 28 days, following the appearance of roots as shown in figure 2. Previous studies have indicated that Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch seedlings exhibit an earlier development of roots compared to leaves (Pereira, 1988). In contrast, in node cultures, shoots typically precede root formation, necessitating the addition of hormones to the media to stimulate rooting, as highlighted by George et al. (2008). Interestingly, this hormonal requirement for rooting induction does not apply to A. strobilacea, as demonstrated by Santos et al. (2010, 2017).
In the study, it was observed that NS exhibited shoot multiplication within two weeks of culture, as evidenced by data presented in Table 1 and Figures 1b and c, a phenomenon not observed in seeds as indicated in Table 1, Figures 1d and 2e. However, by the 35th day of culture, seedlings displayed higher leaf elongation, along with more and longer roots compared to NS plants, as illustrated in Figure 2. This enhanced root and leaf growth in seedlings could potentially be attributed to reserve mobilization from the seed, providing essential nutrients for the plant until it achieves nutritional independence (Taiz et al., 2017). On the other hand, the observed shoot multiplication in NS plants may be a consequence of multiple bud breaks induced by the release of apical dominance following node excision from the mother plant, as suggested by George et al. (2008).
The oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide release rates in seeds of A. strobilacea reached their peak at 14 days of culture, as depicted in figure 3, aligning with the full formation of seedlings as shown in figure 2. In contrast, respiratory rates in non-seed tissues peaked at 7 days, as illustrated in figure 3, being five times higher than in seeds and occurring before the emergence of leaves at 14 days. This suggests that non-seed tissues exhibited a more intense and earlier demand for energy generation through respiration compared to seeds in order to initiate plant formation. The isolation of nodes and the release of apical dominance stimulate cytokinin accumulation in excised tissue, leading to cell proliferation in lateral buds and the formation of new shoots, as supported by studies (Souza et al. 2010, Buchanan et al. 2015, Li et al. 2018). Consequently, respiratory activity would increase to meet the energy demands for cell division during shoot formation and the multiplication process (Siqueira et al. 2018). It has been noted that sugar accumulates in non-seed tissues cultivated in vitro to promote bud outgrowth and provide substrates for respiration to sustain the intense cell division, as discussed in a review by Schneider et al. (2019). A similar trend was observed in the bromeliad Ananas comosus (Souza et al. 2010). Additionally, the higher respiration rates in non-seed tissues compared to seeds may be attributed to the multiple bud breaks in the former, as indicated in table 1 and figures 1b and c.
The peaks in respiration observed during plant formation may lead to an increase in electron flux within the mitochondria, subsequently resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Møller, 2001). These ROS play a crucial role in cell signaling pathways and the regulation of specific gene expression linked to seed germination, seedling development, and the release of bud dormancy (Bailly et al., 2008; Kranner et al., 2010; Considine & Foyer, 2014). Therefore, it is plausible that the respiration patterns observed in seeds and non-seed plants (NS) in this study are associated with fluctuations in mitochondrial ROS levels, which directly impact the formation of seedlings and plants from NS.
The rates of O2 consumption and CO2 release in both non-symbiotic (NS) and seed plants exhibited a progressive decline after peaking at 7 and 14 days, respectively, eventually reaching similar levels by day 35 (Figure 3). This reduction in respiration rate could be attributed to the concurrent increase in photosynthetic activity, driven by leaf and shoot development in seeds and NS plants, respectively, as well as the depletion of carbon sources in the growth medium. In vitro plants grown under photomixotrophic conditions, as in our study, demonstrated photosynthetic activity, albeit at lower levels compared to respiration rates (Ševčíková et al., 2019). Previous research on protocorm-like bodies of the Cymbidium Melody Fair 'Marilyn Monroe' orchid revealed an increase in photosynthetic rates alongside a decrease in respiration between days 20 and 60 of in vitro culture in MS medium with 2% sucrose (Ogasawara et al., 1995). Studies have suggested that enhanced photosynthesis can elevate cytosolic ATP/ADP ratios, thereby inhibiting respiration (Krömer, 1995; Buchanan et al., 2015). The decline in O2 consumption observed in our study may also reflect a reduced cellular energy demand post-seedling establishment and full morphogenesis in NS plants, both energetically demanding processes (Yaseen et al., 2012; Taiz et al., 2017). The presence of some level of photosynthetic capacity in seed and NS plants by day 35 could potentially aid in their successful acclimatization ex vitro at that stage (Ševčíková et al., 2019). Notably, our research group achieved a 100% survival rate when transplanting one-month-old A. strobilacea seedlings (De Carvalho et al., 2014) and NS plants (unpublished data) onto Pinus bark substrate under identical environmental conditions.
The current study represents a pioneering effort in comparing the time course of in vitro plant development from distinct propagules simultaneously. This unique approach has led to the observation that the developmental process of NS plant formation may impact cell energy demand and respiratory activity differently compared to seedlings. Despite these differences, both seeds and NS plants of A. strobilacea demonstrate the ability to develop into viable plants with leaves and roots within a short timeframe, thereby expanding the potential applications of in vitro culture for both conservation and commercial production of this species. The utilization of seeds ensures genetic diversity, a crucial aspect for germplasm conservation as highlighted by Pence (2010), while the shoot multiplication in NS plants facilitates large-scale clone production, a valuable asset for commercial production targeting the ornamental plants market as emphasized by Kyte et al. (2013).
Finally, given the significance of mitochondrial ROS production and carbohydrate mobilization in seed germination and bud outgrowth as highlighted in previous studies (Considine & Foyer, 2014; Taiz et al., 2017; Signorelli et al., 2018), it would be beneficial to explore the impact of redox status and carbohydrate composition on shoot development from seeds and non-seed structures of A. strobilacea. This investigation could offer a deeper understanding of the developmental differences observed between these two processes.
