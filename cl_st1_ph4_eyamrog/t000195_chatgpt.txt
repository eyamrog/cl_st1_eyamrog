Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears to be linked to a pronounced thrombotic inclination, stemming from various mechanisms that remain unidentified, potentially leading to arterial and venous thrombosis. Nevertheless, the risk assessments for these complications are currently in a preliminary stage.
We present a case involving an 89-year-old female patient who was admitted to the emergency room of a tertiary hospital presenting with right hemiparesis, aphasia, and dysarthria. Imaging studies including cranial computed tomography (CT) (Figs. 1, 2) and cranial CT angiography (Fig. 3) revealed indications of an acute ischemic stroke affecting the left middle cerebral artery territory. The patient reported experiencing flu-like symptoms for approximately two weeks, and chest CT scans indicated features consistent with a viral infection (Fig. 4). Subsequent rapid testing confirmed a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.
