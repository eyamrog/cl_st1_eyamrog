The global community is currently facing the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, with dentists being particularly vulnerable. This study aimed to explore the precautions taken by Turkish dentists in dental clinics amidst the pandemic. The research focused on dentists in Turkey, with an online questionnaire comprising 23 questions and 57 items being distributed to a sample of Turkish dentists between March 16 and March 20, 2020. The questionnaire delved into dentists' demographic details, concerns, and the preventive measures implemented in dental settings against COVID-19. The study encompassed 1,958 Turkish dentists, among whom 1,274 (65.1%) were general dentists and 684 (34.9%) were specialists. A notable 26.7% of dentists had participated in an informational session on COVID-19, with nearly 70% of them self-reporting adequate knowledge about the virus. Over 90% of the dentists expressed concerns for their own well-being and that of their families. Surprisingly, only 12% of the dentists reported using N95 masks. While some precautionary steps were taken by Turkish dentists, the study revealed a lack of comprehensive measures to safeguard themselves, their colleagues, and patients from COVID-19. Notably, as the number of COVID-19 cases surged, there was a slight increase in precautionary measures within dental clinics. It is strongly advised that dentists rigorously adhere to maximum safety protocols in clinical settings. Regional and national dental associations should disseminate comprehensive guidelines on the COVID-19 pandemic to all dentists for enhanced protection.
The COVID-19 outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, and has since emerged as a significant global public health concern, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. A novel coronavirus was identified on January 7, 2020, following the exclusion of other potential pathogens such as the influenza virus, avian influenza virus, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV. Initially referred to as "new coronavirus" (nCoV), the pathogen was later designated as SARS-CoV-2.
The initial confirmed case of COVID-19 in Turkey was identified on March 10, 2020. Subsequent to this date, the incidence of cases has steadily risen on a daily basis as per data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The transmission of this virus between individuals primarily happens through airborne droplets containing respiratory secretions from an infected person or via direct contact with an infected individual or contaminated surfaces. There is currently no conclusive evidence supporting transmission through blood or saliva. Nevertheless, drawing parallels with diseases like HIV/AIDS, HCV, and HBV, which are known to be transmitted through blood or saliva, there is speculation that 2019-nCoV might also spread through these routes.
The average incubation period of 2019-nCoV is estimated to be 5 to 6 days, with some evidence suggesting it could extend up to 14 days. While there are reports indicating a possible extension to 24 days, the accepted timeframe for medical observations and quarantine measures for individuals potentially exposed to the infection is typically set at 14 days.
The 2019-nCoV virus has the ability to survive on various surfaces for a range of time periods, from a few hours to several days, contingent upon factors such as the surface type, ambient temperature, and humidity. While individuals of all age groups are susceptible to this infectious disease, an examination of the modes of transmission during this pandemic has revealed that individuals in close proximity to symptomatic/asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, including healthcare workers and other patients in medical facilities, face a heightened risk of contracting the infection. Notably, within the context of dental clinics, the transmission of the virus can be particularly prevalent among dentists and their patients.
In regions impacted by COVID-19, it is imperative to implement rigorous and efficient infection control measures within dental facilities and hospitals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Dental Association (ADA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued guidelines specifically tailored for dentists and dental personnel to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. These protocols are crucial in safeguarding the health and safety of both patients and healthcare providers.
If an individual has recently visited regions affected by the pandemic within the last 14 days, it is advisable for them to undergo a quarantine period of at least 14 days. In areas where COVID-19 has spread, non-emergency dental procedures should be put on hold. Oral emergencies are characterized as sudden-onset oral conditions that necessitate urgent intervention, including but not limited to toothaches, dental injuries, temporomandibular joint dislocations, oral and maxillofacial traumas, and infections.
High-speed rotary handpieces and ultrasonic instruments generate aerosols and droplets carrying body fluids like blood and saliva, potentially exposing dentists to various pathogenic microorganisms in contaminated clinical environments. The risk of 2019-nCoV infection is heightened by direct contact between contaminated hands and compromised mucosa, as sharp dental tools can damage the protective epithelial barrier and cause cuts or punctures in the mucosa, facilitating viral transmission.
It is advised that patients with COVID-19 in the acute febrile phase avoid visiting dental clinics due to infection risks. To mitigate potential risks, all patients entering the dental clinic should have their body temperature measured using a contact-free forehead thermometer initially. Prior to seating patients in the dental chair, it is recommended that they complete a form detailing any potential infection risk factors. Patients should only be seated if all parameters on this form are negative. Before oral examinations, patients can use mouthrinses like povidone-iodine (1%), cetylpyridinium chloride (0.05%~0.10%), or mouthrinses containing essential oils to effectively reduce droplets and aerosols produced during dental procedures.
The transmission of COVID-19 through the oral-fecal route underscores the critical significance of maintaining proper hand hygiene practices. Inadequate attention to hand hygiene stands out as a key contributor to the rapid spread of the disease. Consequently, it is imperative for dentists, who may not have the opportunity to frequently wash their hands, to utilize supplementary measures like hand sanitizers to mitigate the risk of transmission.
Dentists are advised to adhere to personal protective measures such as wearing masks and goggles to shield themselves from droplets and aerosols produced during dental procedures. Airborne droplet transmission is recognized as the primary mode of spread, particularly in dental settings and healthcare facilities. Therefore, it is strongly advised that dentists utilize a range of protective equipment including safety goggles, masks, gloves, face shields, and protective outerwear to establish a barrier against potential viral transmission during all healthcare services.
In the current landscape dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, dentists are compelled to adapt their customary clinical practices. This study sought to examine the extent to which Turkish dentists, actively engaged in their professional responsibilities, have modified their attitudes and behaviors concerning COVID-19 within their dental practices, either prior to or during routine dental procedures. The primary objective was to shed light on any discernible shifts in their approaches and to underscore the significance of these adaptations in the context of the ongoing health crisis.
The study received approval from the Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Inonu University, located in Malatya, Turkey, under process number 2020/592.
A novel questionnaire pertaining to COVID-19 was devised for this research endeavor. Initially, an extensive literature review was conducted in both Turkish and English languages, focusing on guidelines related to the keywords "COVID-19," "Coronavirus," "dentistry," and "dental treatment." Subsequently, a comprehensive questionnaire comprising 22 questions (56 items) was meticulously curated from the identified sources. The questionnaire was efficiently constructed using Google Forms to facilitate data collection and analysis.
The questionnaire's content adequacy was evaluated by experts to determine the clarity of the items before the main study. Five experts, including two pediatric dentists, one periodontist, one general dentist, and one biostatistician, reviewed the questions. Following their feedback, one question was incorporated. Subsequently, the final set of 23 questions (57 items) underwent testing by two experts, a pediatric dentist, and a general dentist, to ensure comprehension and alignment with the conceptual framework. The questionnaire was then validated by a Turkish language expert, marking the completion of this stage.
The final online questionnaire was distributed to all dentists in Turkey whose contact details had been obtained through email, WhatsApp, and various private social networking platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Furthermore, the questionnaire was disseminated through Facebook groups that serve as active online forums for dentists in Turkey. A total of 1,958 Turkish dentists, who volunteered to participate, completed the questionnaire. The number of participating volunteer dentists exceeded the required sample size for this study, which was calculated based on the proportional distribution of dentists across different specialty areas in Turkey. Data collection for the survey took place from March 16 to March 20, 2020.
The power analysis indicated that surveys involving 1,454 or more individuals should maintain a 98% confidence interval, a population size of 40,429 individuals, with the actual value falling within ±3% of the surveyed value. To enhance the study's reliability, 1,958 individuals who completed the web-based questionnaire during the survey period were incorporated. Utilizing a stratified random sampling approach, the minimum number necessary for each specialty area was established, taking into account the desired sample size.
The data were presented as mean and standard deviation or frequency with percentage values for all variables. Proportions were compared using the z-test when applicable, and pairwise comparisons were conducted using Bonferroni's method. A significance level of P<0.05 was adopted. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 26.0.
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to correlate dentists' self-assessed COVID-19 knowledge score (target variable) with related variables, including survey questions and the questionnaire completion date (input variables). The dataset was randomly split into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%). The MLP ANN model was utilized to calculate importance values for the input variables, which were then ranked in descending order based on their significance.
The study included 1,958 participants with a mean age of 32.5±23.5 (ranging from 20 to 74) years, of which 70% were female. Among the participants, 53.3% were single, 67.7% were living with an immediate family member, 5.7% were living with an extended family member, 21.9% were living alone, and 33.9% had a child or children. Furthermore, 3.3% of the participants had traveled abroad in the past month, 18.2% had face-to-face contact with someone who had traveled abroad in the same period, and 33.9% presented with some medical problem.
In terms of dental specialties, the distribution was as follows: 65.1% were general dentists, 3.8% were maxillofacial surgeons, 5.2% were endodontists, 2% were oral diagnosis and radiology specialists, 3.4% were orthodontists, 10.3% were pediatric dentists, 4.3% were prosthodontists, 3.6% were periodontists, and 2.3% were restorative dentistry specialists. The response rates from Turkish general dentists and specialists were 3.7%, 7.6%, 14.7%, 9.8%, 5.5%, 28%, 8.2%, 9%, and 8.3%, respectively.
Among the study participants, 29.8% were employed in private hospitals or clinics, 43.6% in public hospitals, and 26.6% in universities. The dentists' self-assessed COVID-19 knowledge scores ranged from 1 to 5, with percentages of 59.2%, 15.3%, 8.8%, 9.9%, and 6.8%, respectively.
The majority of dentists responded affirmatively to three specific questions (Q20, Q21, and Q22) as indicated in Table 1.
When queried about their sources of information regarding COVID-19, 96.27% of respondents indicated that they obtained this information from "physicians' personal websites/social media accounts," representing the highest percentage among all responses. In contrast, a mere 26.65% of dentists reported attending an informational session specifically focused on COVID-19.
The distribution of participants' responses to specific questions (Q12, Q13, Q14, Q15, Q16, Q19, and Q23) is illustrated in Table 2.
The distribution of responses concerning modifications implemented by dentists and institutions for patient admission over the 5-day data collection period is presented in Table 3.
The significance of various variables, including survey questions and the date of questionnaire completion, on dentists' self-assessed COVID-19 knowledge score as per the MLP ANN model is detailed in Table 4. The question deemed most crucial was "As a dentist, do you inform your patients about COVID-19?" accounting for 15.39% importance, while the variable with the least significance was "marital status" at a mere 0.03% (Table 4).
According to the WHO Global Dashboard, the total number of confirmed and new cases of COVID-19 for the period of 16-20 March 2020, during which this survey was conducted, is detailed in Table 5.
This survey study aims to highlight the importance of promptly implementing essential measures and offers an examination of whether dentists in Turkey have modified their standard dental treatment protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
The initial confirmed case of COVID-19 in Turkey was identified on March 10, 2020, prompting the implementation of a web-based survey conducted between March 16 and 20, 2020. Notably, these dates coincided with a surge in the number of confirmed cases within the country.
Data collection, although limited to a span of 5 days, witnessed a notably high level of participation. Surpassing the minimum sample size initially calculated for the study (n = 1,454), the inclusion of 1,958 participants aimed to bolster the validity and reliability of the results obtained. This research, encompassing dentists' attitudes and behaviors across Turkey, was conducted with a sample size determined through power analysis. Despite the voluntary nature of survey participation, the response rate was substantial, potentially attributed to the prevailing concern surrounding COVID-19. Dentists, grappling with uncertainties on how to navigate this infection, exhibited a keen interest in the survey, reflecting their apprehensions and eagerness for guidance.
In this study, various variables were examined, including sociodemographic status, medical status, traveling abroad, and the dentists' self-assessed knowledge scores as presented in Table 1. The findings revealed that over 80% of professionals were psychologically affected by COVID-19. Specifically, 67.6% of maxillofacial surgeons and 78.2% of general dentists reported experiencing psychological distress. Interestingly, the level of psychological distress seemed to correlate with the level of knowledge about COVID-19, with percentages ranging from 55.6% to 81.5% as knowledge increased.
Based on the variables outlined in Table 1, it is evident that a significant proportion of dentists expressed concerns regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19, with over 90% indicating such worries. Moreover, the data also revealed that more than 95% of dentists were apprehensive about potentially transmitting the virus to their families, underscoring the high level of concern for both personal and familial well-being among dental professionals. Given the nature of their work, it is understandable that dentists would harbor fears of becoming infected with the 2019-nCoV and inadvertently spreading it to others in their vicinity. This concern is further substantiated by a recent clinical study conducted in Wuhan, China, which reported that 29% of the 138 hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia were healthcare team members, highlighting the occupational risks faced by healthcare professionals, including dentists.
The dentists indicated that they primarily sourced information on COVID-19 from "physicians' personal websites/social media accounts (96.27%)" and from "the websites of official entities such as the Ministry of Health, WHO, and professional organizations, and/or their social media accounts (91.37%)". Ensuring effective control of COVID-19 spread necessitates reliable and informative sources for physicians to assess professional encounters related to the virus. To access the most precise and trustworthy information, dental professionals are advised to rely solely on official organization websites.
Regrettably, only 26.65% of Turkish dentists participated in informational meetings regarding COVID-19, a figure deemed insufficient given the heightened susceptibility of dentists to the virus. It is imperative to boost the frequency of these meetings and make attendance mandatory for all dentists.
Coronaviruses have the ability to persist on various inanimate surfaces, such as metal, glass, or plastic, for a duration of up to 9 days. However, these viruses can be effectively neutralized by utilizing surface disinfection products containing 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within a mere 1-minute timeframe. In instances where soap and water are not readily accessible and hands do not exhibit visible dirt, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum alcohol content of 60% can serve as a suitable alternative. Nevertheless, if hands are visibly soiled, it is imperative to opt for the traditional method of washing hands with soap and water.
In this study, dentists predominantly emphasized the importance of frequent hand washing (98.57%) and avoiding physical contact such as handshaking, embracing, and kissing (92.13%) as crucial measures against COVID-19 in their daily routines. Professional precautions included more frequent hand washing (96.88%), wearing gloves (96.58%), and using masks (85.90%). Notably, only 12.36% reported using N95 masks, possibly due to their limited availability and high cost nationwide. Khader et al. (19) highlighted that 92.9% of dentists utilized personal protective equipment like masks, gloves, and goggles, while 96.2% regularly sanitized their hands with alcohol-based sanitizers and soap. Despite their awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission modes, infection control, and clinic protocols, Jordanian dentists demonstrated a limited understanding of additional preventive measures for safeguarding both dental staff and patients from the virus. It is worth noting that there were no reported local cases in Jordan during the data collection period.
When evaluating the working conditions of dentists, it is imperative that they consistently utilize personal protective equipment within dental clinics. Particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, dentists deemed to be at a heightened risk of contracting the virus must adopt additional precautions. As highlighted by Samaranayake et al.20, the use of rubber dams and robust saliva ejectors has been shown to effectively minimize the dispersion of aerosols or droplets during dental procedures. Moreover, the wearing of face shields or goggles is essential to mitigate the risk of exposure to blood, saliva, and water droplets. It is crucial to acknowledge that all dental professionals who remain active in their practice during this pandemic are inherently vulnerable to the threat of COVID-19.
In this study, it was found that 63.79% of Turkish dentists utilized strong dental suction during dental procedures, while 49.95% actively avoided aerosol-forming procedures whenever possible. Among those initiating treatment with a pre-procedural mouthrinse, 36.47% opted for 0.2% povidone (Batticon) and 10.32% chose chlorhexidine. According to the Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia (5th edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, chlorhexidine, a common dental practice agent, was reported to have no efficacy against COVID-19. Instead, mouthrinses containing oxidative agents like 1% hydrogen peroxide or 0.2% povidone were recommended. The ADA and CDC specifically endorse peroxide for virus eradication.
It is now established that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through human contact and droplets, although the possibility of airborne transmission has not been definitively ruled out. Recommendations have been in place since the end of January 2020 advising the Chinese population to avoid crowded settings such as hospitals and dental clinics to minimize the risk of cross-infection due to the rapid spread of the virus.
COVID-19 transmission primarily occurs through close contact, typically within a range of about 6 feet. The virus spreads when an infected individual coughs, sneezes, or talks, releasing droplets from their mouth or nose into the air, which can then be inhaled by nearby individuals or land in their mouths or noses. Importantly, asymptomatic carriers also contribute significantly to the spread of COVID-19, as individuals can transmit the virus before showing any symptoms. This underscores the necessity of maintaining distance from others, regardless of apparent health status. Social distancing serves as a crucial measure to reduce contact with infected individuals and contaminated surfaces. This practice involves maintaining a physical distance of at least 6 feet (2 meters) from others outside the household, avoiding mass gatherings and group activities. Particularly crucial for individuals with underlying health conditions, social distancing remains a key strategy in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.
In the literature, it has been noted that various dental procedures have the potential to transmit bacteria and viruses to dental staff and individuals in dental settings. Health authorities in certain cities in China have mandated the suspension of routine non-emergency dental treatments in dental facilities, allowing only emergency dental services to be provided. Consequently, patients have been discouraged from seeking dental care unless it is deemed an emergency. Similarly, in Turkey, during the second day of data collection for our study, the Turkish Ministry of Health and the Turkish Dental Association recommended that only emergency dental cases be attended to starting from March 17, 2020. Guo et al. reported that a significant majority (94.6%) of dental visits during the COVID-19 outbreak were for emergency procedures. Over a 5-day period, healthcare providers and institutions notably decreased patient admissions, prioritizing emergency dental cases. The percentage of dentists reporting no changes in patient admissions in their practices decreased from 50.4% on day 1 to 5.2% on day 5. This decline was primarily attributed to the implementation of preventive measures by dentists and health authorities in response to the escalating COVID-19 cases, as well as the guidelines and regulations issued by the CDC, ADA, WHO, the Turkish Ministry of Health, and the Turkish Dental Association for dental professionals and staff.
Turkish dentists have expressed significant concerns regarding the lack of patient awareness amidst the challenges faced in their workplaces (41.30%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A notable 82.94% of these dentists indicated that they took the initiative to inform their patients about the pandemic, likely in response to the observed low levels of COVID-19 awareness among the general population. This aligns with findings by Khader et al.19, who reported that an overwhelming majority of dentists (97.8%) emphasized the importance of educating individuals to curb the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, a substantial portion of Turkish dentists (21.85%) highlighted difficulties in accessing essential protective equipment such as masks and shields during the pandemic. Regrettably, this challenge is not unique to Turkey, as many countries worldwide grapple with a surge in demand for protective gear amidst rising case numbers. Urgent measures are needed to ramp up the production of protective equipment globally and drive down prices to ensure accessibility for all.
A significant limitation of this study lies in the lack of information regarding the COVID-19 infection status of the participating dentists. Consequently, the study was unable to definitively establish any differences between dentists who implemented preventive measures against COVID-19 and those who did not. Furthermore, the absence of recorded personal information for the participants precludes the possibility of follow-up studies involving the same individuals.
The findings from the survey conducted in this study indicate that while Turkish dentists have implemented heightened protective measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, their attitudes and behaviors have not yet reached optimal levels. It is evident that further research with a larger sample size and an extended follow-up period is necessary to obtain more accurate and detailed results. Moreover, the prevalence of COVID-19 infections among Turkish dentists warrants further investigation to better understand and address this issue.
The authors extend their sincere gratitude to all participants for their invaluable contributions to this study. Furthermore, they express profound appreciation to the healthcare professionals who have dedicated themselves to combating COVID-19. This paper is dedicated to honoring the memory of all Turkish healthcare workers who tragically lost their lives due to the pandemic.
