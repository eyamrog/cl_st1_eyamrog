In tropical and subtropical regions, lianas play significant roles in ecological succession. This study aims to assess the photosynthetic and morpho-physiological performance of two Mikania genus liana species under varying light intensities: full sun (I0), 25% (I25), 50% (I50), and 75% (I75) solar radiation retention. Plants exposed to I75 exhibited a decrease in net photosynthetic rate (A). Notably, dynamic photoinhibition was observed at I0 during periods of intense irradiation and high temperatures. The highest and lowest leaf chlorophyll levels were recorded at I75 and I0, respectively, while carotenoids/total chlorophyll and leaf thickness increased under I0. Total dry mass was greater in plants cultivated at I0 and I25. However, A values and biomass production were higher in Mikania laevigata at I25, whereas Mikania glomerata exhibited greater biomass accumulation between I0 and I50. Consequently, it can be inferred that M. laevigata and M. glomerata display distinct morpho-physiological responses under identical radiation conditions.
Lianas, commonly found in tropical and subtropical forests (Gentry & Dodson, 1987), traverse all forest layers using various mechanisms of ascension, growth patterns, and physiological strategies (Schnitzer & Bongers, 2002; Gerwing, 2004; Kazda et al., 2009). With relatively thin stems that rely on external support for sunlight access, lianas species tend to allocate less carbon to stem growth and more to photosynthetic and vascular tissues (Putz, 1984; Schnitzer, 2005), resulting in faster growth rates compared to trees (Zhu & Cao, 2009). Their ability to grow both laterally and vertically enables lianas to easily infiltrate the canopy, extending long branches to reach optimal light conditions (Schnitzer & Bongers, 2002; Toledo et al., 2003). Due to their high radiation requirements, lianas are often categorized as gap-dependent pioneer species, exhibiting a distribution pattern akin to pioneer tree species (Putz, 1984; Schnitzer & Bongers, 2002). Nevertheless, some lianas can germinate and thrive in the understory (Nabe-Nielsen, 2002; Sanches & Válio, 2002; Schnitzer et al., 2012), indicating a degree of shade tolerance (Gerwing, 2004).
In recent decades, there has been a notable increase in the abundance and productivity of lianas in tropical forests, primarily attributed to high rates of deforestation and human-induced climate change (Granados & Korner, 2002; Phillips et al., 2002; Wright et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2004; Schnitzer & Bongers, 2011). Evidence suggests that in mature and undisturbed forests, the heightened density of lianas may be a result of alterations in precipitation patterns (Schnitzer & Bongers, 2011). Light availability is a crucial factor influencing the growth and distribution of lianas, with studies indicating that increased solar radiation enhances the growth rates of liana seedlings (Kurzel et al., 2006; Schnitzer & Bongers, 2011). Lianas may encounter varying levels of radiation and spectral quality during their growth, leading to an expected high phenotypic plasticity in response to different light conditions, particularly in terms of photosynthetic and gas exchange adjustments (Bazzaz & Carlson, 1982; Ribeiro et al., 2005). The level of stomatal opening plays a pivotal role in determining the balance between CO2 absorption and water loss through transpiration (Caemmerer & Baker, 2007). The adaptive success of lianas under diverse light conditions hinges on adjustments in leaf morphology, anatomy, and photosynthetic apparatus, ensuring greater efficiency in converting radiant energy into carbohydrates to sustain plant growth (Dias-Filho, 1997; Campos & Uchida, 2002; Gratani, 2014).
Mikania glomerata Spreng. and Mikania laevigata Sch. Bip ex Baker are liana species native to the Atlantic Forest in Brazil (Gasparetto et al. 2010). Both species belong to the Asteraceae family and are commonly referred to as "Guaco," benefiting from Atlantic forest fragmentation. The Atlantic forest, situated within biodiversity hotspots globally, is deemed the most susceptible ecosystem to deforestation and climate change (Béllard et al. 2014). Despite its diverse forest physiognomies (Myers et al. 2000, Ricketts et al. 2005, Metzger 2009), only 28% of its original area remains (Rezende et al. 2018). These species share similar morphologies and are frequently utilized in traditional medicine for treating colds, flu, asthma, and bronchitis due to their bronchodilator and expectorant properties (Moura et al. 2002, Graça et al. 2007, Bolina et al. 2009, Gaspareto et al. 2010). Recent research has highlighted the distinct chemical compositions and therapeutic attributes of M. glomerata and M. laevigata (Melo & Sawaya 2015, Almeida et al. 2016, Costa et al. 2017). However, there is a lack of literature on the photosynthetic properties and gas exchange behavior under varying light conditions for both species.
Our objective was to assess the morpho-physiological performance of two Mikania species, Mikania glomerata, and Mikania laevigata, across varying levels of solar radiation retention: full sun (I0), as well as 25 (I25), 50 (I50), and 75% (I75) retention. Our primary hypothesis posits that both Mikania species will exhibit improved photosynthetic activity and biomass production when exposed to higher levels of radiation.
Plant material and growth conditions - The experiments were conducted at the University of São Paulo's Ribeirão Preto campus in São Paulo, Brazil, situated at coordinates 21° 10 '08.4'' S and 47° 51' 50.6'' W, characterized by a tropical wet and dry climate (Aw) as per the Köppen-Geiger classification. Detailed climatic information throughout the experiment can be found in supplementary material table S1. Mikania glomerata Spreng. and Mikania laevigata Sch. Bip ex Baker were the species utilized in the study. Plantlets of each species were obtained through cuttings taken from the middle of branches of various parental plants, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter and 12 cm in length, with a node at the top of the cutting and a pair of leaves (Lima et al., 2003). These plantlets were then placed in 3-kg plastic bags filled with a mixture of manure and soil (redlatosol soil type, 1:1 ratio) within greenhouse conditions. Following root establishment (around 60 days), the plants were transplanted into 20 L pots filled with soil and subjected to treatments for a period of 150 days. The soil was enriched with 1 g of NPK (4-14-8) fertilizer per kg of soil. The plants were exposed to four different light conditions: full sun (I0), and 25% (I25), 50% (I50), and 75% (I75) retention of solar radiation flux (refer to supplementary figure 1). To achieve the desired levels of solar radiation, specialized greenhouses were constructed with artificial shading of varying degrees. Throughout the experiment, the pots were watered daily and maintained at soil field capacity, monitored using a ML2× Theta Probe sensor (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK).
Gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence, and photosynthetic pigment content were assessed at 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after treatment initiation (DAT). Leaf anatomy and biomass production were examined at 90 and 150 DAT. Three leaf samples per plant were collected from the upper, middle, and lower canopy regions for analysis.
Gas exchange measurements were conducted daily from 8:00 to 11:00 hours in fully expanded leaves using an infrared gas analyzer model LCpro+ (ADC BioScientific, Ltd., UK) to assess the net photosynthesis rate (A, µmol m-2 s-1), transpiration rate (E, mmol m-2 s-1), and stomatal conductance (gs, mol m-2 s-1). These measurements were taken under ambient conditions of radiation, [CO2], and air temperature. Additionally, the intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE; µmol mol-1) was calculated from the gas exchange data (A/gs).
Chlorophyll fluorescence was assessed by measuring the maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry (Fv/Fm) in three fully expanded leaves utilizing a portable fluorometer model OS-3P (ADC BioScientific, UK). The leaves underwent a dark adaptation period of 30 minutes before measuring the dark fluorescence yield (Fo), maximum fluorescence yield (Fm), and variable fluorescence (Fv), from which the Fv/Fm ratio was derived. Diurnal courses of Fv/Fm were conducted at four intervals between 6:00 and 18:00 hours, every two hours, at 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after treatment (DAT). On sampling days, relative humidity and ambient temperature were monitored using a hygro-thermometer, while the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was measured with a quantum sensor connected to an irradiation meter model LI-250A (LI-COR, USA) (see supplementary material figure S1).
Photosynthetic pigment analysis was conducted by extracting and quantifying pigments according to the methodology outlined by Hendry and Price (1993). Leaf discs weighing 0.1g were ground in 80% acetone, and their absorbance was measured at 480, 645, and 663 nm using a Genesys 5Spectronic spectrophotometer. Subsequently, the absorbance values were utilized to calculate the concentrations of total chlorophyll and carotenoids.
Leaf anatomy - Leaf fragments (1 cm²) were fixed in FAA 70% for 24 hours and dehydrated in an ethanol series following the method outlined by Kraus and Arduin (1997). Subsequently, the samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned using a microtome (8 μm), and stained with 1% toluidine blue. The prepared samples were then examined under a QUIMIS microscope (model Q720 ED), photographed, and the images were utilized for measuring the leaf thickness, adaxial (AdE) and abaxial epidermis thickness (AbE), as well as palisade (PP) and spongy parenchyma (SP) thickness. These measurements were conducted using the AnatiQuanti 2.0 software developed by the Laboratory of Plant Anatomy at UFV. Interestingly, a hypodermic layer was identified beneath the adaxial epidermis in both species; however, due to its inconsistent presence across all samples, quantitative analysis of this tissue was not feasible.
For the epidermis analysis, the lower epidermis (hypoestomatic leaves) was isolated from the mesophyll using the Jeffrey solution, consisting of 10% chromic acid and 10% nitric acid in a 1:1 ratio. Subsequently, the samples were stained with safranin for 30 seconds and then mounted in 50% glycerin as per the method described by Kraus and Arduin in 1997. The prepared samples were examined under a QUIMIS microscope (model Q720 ED) and photographed for further analysis. The number of epidermal cells and stomata were quantified, and the stomatal density (SD) and stomatal index (SI) were calculated using the AnatiQuanti 2.0 software developed by the Laboratory of Plant Anatomy at UFV. The stomatal index (SI) was determined using the formula: SI = (SN/EC) x 100, where SN represents the stomata number and EC denotes the number of epidermal cells.
Leaf area and biomass analysis were conducted by detaching leaves from the entire plant and obtaining leaf discs measuring 1 cm2 from the basal, median, and apical regions of the leaves. The mean leaf area was estimated using the disc area, disc dry weight, and total leaf dry weight. Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated as the ratio of leaf area to leaf dry mass (dm2 g-1).
For biomass analysis, five plants from each treatment were harvested and divided into roots, stems, petioles, and leaves. The plant material was then dried in an oven at 70°C until a constant mass was achieved. Following this, the dry weight of each organ was measured to determine the biomass distribution within the plants.
The study's experimental design and statistical analysis involved assessing the impacts of irradiance interference, species, and their interactions through a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) conducted using the SYSTAT software package from SPSS Inc. in Chicago, IL. A significance level of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Post hoc analysis using Tukey's test was performed on significant effects. The ANOVA incorporated two species, M. glomerata and M. laevigata, and four levels of sunlight retention in the solar radiation flux treatment: 0% (I0), 25% (I25), 50% (I50), and 75% (I75).
Gas exchange was notably influenced by solar radiation levels, impacting stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E) across all species, with the exception of the 150 DAT mark (Figure 1 a-d; ANOVA details in supplementary material Table S2). Plants subjected to higher solar radiation retention (I75) exhibited reduced E and gs values. Notably, at 150 DAT, gs reached its lowest values compared to earlier samplings. In terms of species comparison, M. laevigata demonstrated higher gs values than M. glomerata (supplementary material Table S2).
The net photosynthetic rate (A) of both Mikania species was significantly influenced by solar radiance levels and species, with no observed interactions between these factors for A (Figure 1 e-f). Plants grown under high solar radiances exhibited higher A compared to those grown under the greatest shading (I75) in both species (Figures 1 e-f). At 150 days after treatment (DAT) and under I75, A reached its lowest values, being 6.7 and 4.5-fold lower in Mikania glomerata and Mikania laevigata, respectively, compared to plants under I25. On average, the highest A values (12.69 and 14.87 µmol m-2 s-1) in M. glomerata and M. laevigata were observed in plants grown under I25 compared to other treatments (Figure 1 e-f). Throughout the experiment, the lowest A and stomatal conductance (gs) values were recorded at 150 DAT, a period characterized by low air relative humidity, high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and increased air temperature (see supplementary material Table S3).
The intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) of M. glomerata plants cultivated under I75 exhibited a higher value compared to those grown under I0 (Figure 1g). Conversely, M. laevigata plants subjected to I75 displayed the lowest iWUE values among the treatments (Figure 1h). A comparison between M. laevigata and M. glomerata plants revealed lower iWUE values in the former (Supplementary Material Table S2), potentially attributable to the heightened stomatal conductance (gs) observed in M. laevigata plants (Figure 1h).
Diurnal patterns of chlorophyll a fluorescence - In both species, under high shading conditions (I75), Fv/Fm values exhibited a notable increase compared to all other treatments (Figure 2). Notably, at 60 and 90 DAT, only plants grown under I0 in both species displayed a decline in Fv/Fm ratio, dropping below 0.75, indicative of dynamic photoinhibition (Figure 2 a-d). Subsequently, at 120 and 150 DAT, a reduction in Fv/Fm was evident across all treatments except for I75 (Figure 2 e-h). Recovery of this parameter was generally observed by 18:00 hours, with exceptions noted in M. glomerata plants under I0 and I25, as well as M. laevigata under I0 at 150 DAT, suggesting a slower recovery rate. Notably, the lowest Fv/Fm values were consistently recorded between 12:00 and 16:00 hours in plants exposed to full sunlight across all treatments (Figure 2).
Photosynthetic pigments - The impact of solar radiation retention on photosynthetic pigments was consistent across both species, with significant effects observed for total chlorophyll and carotenoids influenced by solar radiances and species (Figure 3; Supplementary Material Table S2). Notably, pigment concentrations exhibited an increase under conditions of low light availability. Plants subjected to I0 conditions displayed a decrease in chlorophyll and carotenoid content over the course of the experiment (Figure 3 a-d). For M. glomerata, the chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were 5.6 and 4.0 times higher, respectively, in the I75 treatment compared to I0 at the conclusion of the experiment (150 DAT) (Figure 3 a, c). Similarly, in M. laevigata, this difference was 4.9 and 3.6-fold. Furthermore, in the same sampling, both species under I25 exhibited an average increase of 3-fold in chlorophyll and 2.5-fold in carotenoids compared to those under I0 (Figure 3 b, d). Interestingly, both species displayed higher carotenoids/chlorophyll ratios in plants grown under I0 conditions as opposed to those grown under higher shading levels (I75) (Figure 3 e, f).
Leaf anatomy - The impact of solar radiation flux retention on leaf anatomy was consistent across both species. The thickness of the adaxial epidermis (AdE) and mesophyll (comprising palisade and spongy parenchyma) decreased with increasing solar radiation flux retention, as indicated in Table 1. Specifically, the AdE was approximately 1.2 and 1.3 times higher in I0 compared to I75 for M. glomerata and M. laevigata, respectively. Notably, under varying radiation levels (I0, I25, and I50), the AdE was consistently 1.4 and 1.7 times higher in M. laevigata compared to M. glomerata at 90 and 150 days after treatment (DAT). Similarly, under I75, M. laevigata exhibited a higher AdE, with values 1.2 and 1.4 times higher than those observed in M. glomerata at 90 and 150 DAT, respectively. Additionally, under I0, the palisade and spongy parenchyma at 150 DAT were 10% and 17% higher in M. laevigata compared to M. glomerata, as outlined in Table 1.
Stomatal index (SI) and stomatal density (SD) exhibited an increase corresponding to elevated radiation levels, as depicted in Table 2. The peak SI and SD values were noted at 150 DAT for both species under I0 and I25 conditions. In the case of M. glomerata cultivated under I0, the SI and SD values stood at 18.05% and 256 stomata/mm2, respectively, while for M. laevigata grown under I0, the SI and SD were recorded at 14.41% and 176 stomata/mm2, respectively. Irrespective of the solar radiation levels, M. glomerata consistently displayed higher SI and SD values in comparison to M. laevigata.
Morphology and biomass partitioning were significantly influenced by the retention of solar radiation flux and species in terms of leaf area (LA). Specifically, M. glomerata exhibited higher LA compared to M. laevigata at 90 and 150 days after treatment (DAT) as depicted in figure 4. At 90 DAT, the LA of plants cultivated under I0 was 50% and 12% greater than those under I75 for M. glomerata and M. laevigata, respectively (figure 4a). By 150 DAT, this disparity ranged between 23% and 27%. Notably, at the same sampling point, the LA of M. glomerata under I0, I25, and I50 was 1.7 times higher than that of M. laevigata (figure 4b). Furthermore, specific leaf area (SLA) exhibited a decrease with escalating levels of solar radiation (figure 4c, d). For both species at 150 DAT, plants grown under I75 displayed, on average, a 1.4-fold increase in SLA compared to those under I0, I25, and I50 (figure 4d).
The highest aboveground biomass production was noted at 90 days after transplanting (DAT) in M. glomerata under I50 (45.37 g DW) and in M. laevigata under I0 (28.19 g DW) (Figure 5a). By 150 DAT, shoot biomass in M. glomerata was greater under I0, followed by plants grown under I25 and I50 (Figure 5b). Conversely, in M. laevigata, plants exhibited the highest aboveground dry mass under I25, followed by I0. Notably, at both 90 and 150 DAT, root dry mass was notably higher under I0 compared to other treatments, irrespective of species (Figure 5). At 90 DAT, both species displayed higher leaf biomass production compared to other plant parts, while at 150 DAT, stem biomass surpassed leaf dry mass (Figure 5). Towards the end of the experiment (150 DAT), enhanced biomass production was evident under I25 in M. laevigata compared to other solar radiation treatments. Specifically, in M. laevigata, leaf, stem, and root biomass of plants grown under I75 were 38%, 48%, and 70% lower, respectively, than those under I25. Furthermore, root biomass exhibited a 54% and 69% reduction under I50 and I75 treatments, respectively, compared to full sun treatments (I0) (Figure 5).
In M. glomerata plants, leaf and stem biomass exhibited an average increase of 40% and 48% under I0, I25, and I50 compared to I75. Root biomass also showed significant differences, being 56%, 40%, and 70% higher under I0 in comparison to plants grown under I25, I50, and I75, respectively. Additionally, our observations revealed that M. glomerata plants cultivated under I0, I25, and I50 displayed higher leaf and stem biomass than those of M. laevigata plants, as illustrated in figure 5.
In this study, we investigated the primary morpho-physiological characteristics of two tropical liana species in relation to light availability. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, Mikania glomerata exhibited superior growth performance under I0, I25, and I50, while Mikania laevigata showed enhanced performance under I25. Plants cultivated under I0 and I25 demonstrated increased stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration (E). The rise in air temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) noted at 150 days after treatment (DAT) likely led to a decline in gs, E, and photosynthetic rate (A) in both Mikania species. Stomatal closure in response to high light levels, elevated temperature, and low relative humidity serves as a mechanism to reduce water loss to the surroundings, albeit at the cost of limiting CO2 intake into the leaves (Hsie et al., 2015). This stomatal regulation proves advantageous, particularly during dry periods. In natural settings, the enhancement of intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) through reduced gs and consistent A values emerges as the most effective strategy for sustaining plant growth without significant water loss (Hanba et al., 2002).
Our data revealed that M. glomerata and M. laevigata plants grown under conditions retaining up to 50% of solar radiation flux exhibited higher A values compared to plants grown under I75. The lower A values under I75 are likely attributed to a combination of factors including thinner leaves, reduced stomatal density, decreased gs, and lower light intensity, leading to a decrease in intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), Rubisco activity, and electron transporters (Lambers et al., 1998). Interestingly, plants grown under I25 showed higher A values than those grown under full sunlight (I0), indicating that the irradiation levels at I0 were potentially too high, inducing dynamic photoinhibition. The parameter Fv/Fm serves as an indicator of photoinhibition level, with values below 0.75 suggesting photoinhibition and a subsequent reduction in the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Bolhàr-Nordenkampf & Öquist, 1993). Under full sunlight conditions, the decrease in Fv/Fm at noon followed by recovery by the end of the day signifies dynamic reversible photoinhibition (Bolhàr-Nordenkampf & Öquist, 1993). Dynamic photoinhibition, involving the inactivation of PSII, acts as an effective defense mechanism by enhancing non-photochemical dissipation when CO2 influx is limited (due to stomatal closure), thereby preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and photooxidative damage (Choudhury & Behera, 2001).
Differences in the levels of total chlorophyll, carotenoids, and the carotenoids/chlorophyll ratio have been documented between sun and shade-adapted leaves in various species (Demmig-Adams 1998; Lichtenthaler & Babani 2004, Lichtenthaler et al. 2007). The increased accumulation of chlorophyll in Mikania plants grown in the shade signifies a compensatory mechanism aimed at enhancing light capture (Almeida et al. 2005). Chlorophyll undergoes a continuous cycle of synthesis and degradation (photo-oxidation) in the presence of light, with chlorophyll molecules being more susceptible to photo-oxidation under high light intensities, establishing a balance under lower irradiation levels (Kramer & Kozlowski 1979). Reductions in chlorophyll content and Fv/Fm values serve as indicators of oxidative stress, as observed in plants developed under I0. However, in M. laevigata grown under I25 and I50, the lower chlorophyll content compared to M. glomerata may aid in photoprotection by reducing light interception, resulting in higher Fv/Fm values in this species (Munné-Bosch & Alegra 2000).
Elevated levels of carotenoids in high light conditions serve as a crucial photoprotective mechanism by averting photooxidative harm to chloroplast pigments and inhibiting singlet oxygen formation (Demmig-Adams & Adams, 1992; Yamamoto & Bassi, 1996; Gonçalves et al., 2001). The ratio of carotenoid molecules to chlorophyll molecules is generally greater in leaves exposed to intense irradiation than in those of shaded plants, aligning with the findings of our study.
In shaded conditions, plants exhibit increased chlorophyll content alongside morphological changes such as higher LA and SLA, aiding in light interception, as seen in Mikania plants under I75 (Artru, 2018). Conversely, plants developed under I0 show reduced SLA, which serves to protect against and mitigate damage from excessive solar radiation (Givnish et al., 2004; Matos et al., 2009; Wentworth et al., 2006). The compact, small leaves of plants grown in full sunlight represent a morphological adaptation to minimize water loss and shield the photosynthetic apparatus from potential photo-oxidative harm caused by intense solar radiation (Lima Junior et al., 2005).
Lowest specific leaf area (SLA) values signify an augmented leaf thickness attributed to thicker parenchyma and epidermis under high solar radiation levels. Notably, M. laevigata plants exhibited a greater leaf thickness in comparison to M. glomerata. This increase in leaf thickness, primarily due to a thicker adaxial epidermis, could elucidate the diminished photoinhibition and enhanced photosynthesis in plants cultivated under I25. The epidermis serves to diminish UV radiation while permitting photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to permeate into photosynthetic tissues. For instance, Verdaguer et al. (2017) noted a thicker adaxial epidermis in plants exposed to UV-A radiation. The formation of a thicker adaxial epidermis, or hypodermis, appears to function as a protective mechanism for the palisade parenchyma against excessive visible light and to prevent leaf wilting under high solar radiation levels (Chazdon & Kaufmann, 1993). Alterations in leaf structure play a pivotal role in plant adaptation to diverse environmental conditions (Hanba et al., 2002; Schlüter et al., 2003). Solar radiation levels also influenced stomatal density (SD) and stomatal index (SI) in Mikania leaves. The concurrent elevation in SD and SI suggests that solar radiation levels prompted the differentiation of epidermal cells in stomata, and changes in SD and SI were not a result of reductions in the size or quantity of epidermal cells (Woodward, 1987). The heightened SD and SI in plants with the least solar radiation retention likely led to increased stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthetic rate (A).
In this study, elevated dry matter production was noted under high solar radiation levels in both Mikania species. Similar findings were reported in other liana species, including Acacia kamerunensis, Loeseneriella rowlandii, and Afrobrunnichia erecta (Toledo-Aceves & Swaine, 2008), as well as Plukenetia volubilis (Cai, 2011). The enhanced biomass accumulation is closely linked to the efficient transport of photoassimilates between organs, along with patterns of cell division and expansion. High light levels in this study induced photosynthesis, likely boosting carbohydrate and dry matter production. Our results indicated that plants grown under low light availability directed a larger portion of assimilates to aerial organs to access light in the upper canopy layer, optimizing photosynthesis in conditions where low light could constrain the process (Thompson et al., 1992; Walters et al., 1993). Leaf biomass in both Mikania species was notably higher under increased light conditions, contradicting the findings of Boeger et al. (2009), who reported that shading promoted greater leaf biomass in M. glomerata. Furthermore, higher root biomass was observed under full sunlight conditions in both species, potentially enhancing water and nutrient absorption to cope with elevated rates of photosynthesis and transpiration in bright environments (Poorter, 2001; Mielke & Schaffer, 2010).
Our data revealed that plants cultivated under low light intensity exhibited elevated levels of chlorophyll, LA, and SLA, with A being notably lower compared to other treatments, likely resulting in reduced aboveground dry mass. In both Mikania species, those grown in shaded environments (I75) displayed inferior performance compared to plants in other settings. Plants under I25 demonstrated higher photosynthesis values than those under I0, potentially linked to an increased chlorophyll content. Despite their morphological similarities, M. glomerata and M. laevigata exhibited distinct responses to varying irradiance levels. M. glomerata displayed significant biomass production under I0, I25, and I50 with minimal variation in photosynthetic rates, whereas M. laevigata showcased peak photosynthesis under I25 and I50, with higher biomass production under I25. Notably, M. laevigata exhibited a greater investment in root growth under higher solar radiation levels (I0 and I25), resulting in decreased aboveground biomass compared to M. glomerata. While M. glomerata displayed higher SI, SD, LA, and SLA, M. laevigata featured thicker leaves, attributed to increased AdE. The lower chlorophyll content and higher photosynthesis rate observed under I25 and I50 in M. laevigata likely contributed to reduced photoinhibitory effects (Fv/Fm) compared to M. glomerata under similar solar radiation levels.
Our study revealed that M. laevigata exhibited superior performance when subjected to 25% retention of solar radiation flux rather than full sun, thereby contradicting our initial hypothesis. Additionally, we observed that both Mikania species displayed a limited ability to thrive in shaded environments. Nevertheless, when grown under shade, both species allocated more resources to shoot biomass, a strategy likely aimed at accelerating growth to reach the canopy more rapidly. Despite being categorized as light-dependent plants, the two species exhibited distinct responses to identical irradiance conditions. Specifically, M. laevigata demonstrated enhanced growth under 25% irradiation interference, whereas M. glomerata exhibited optimal growth between 0 and 50% irradiation interference.
