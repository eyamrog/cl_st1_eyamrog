Introduction: The surgical protocol for bicruciate knee ligament injury lacks a well-established foundation in existing literature. Objective: This study aims to establish correlations between clinical data and intraoperative findings with postoperative evaluation outcomes measured through the Lysholm scale, Tegner activity score, and SF-36 questionnaire following bicruciate knee ligament two-stage reconstruction.
Materials and Methods: A total of 25 patients, comprising 20 males and 5 females, with a mean age of 32.3 years (ranging from 17 to 53 years) and a mean BMI of 26.2 (ranging from 18.9 to 34.9), were evaluated in this study. The mean duration of the lesion was 18.3 months, indicating chronicity. The INLAY technique was employed for PCL reconstruction, utilizing the central 1/3 of the patellar tendon. Following a minimum interval of 3 months, ACL reconstruction was carried out arthroscopically using hamstrings. Four patients necessitated an additional surgical procedure, with two cases requiring patellar tendon procedures and two cases involving MCL interventions.
Results: Over a mean follow-up period of 24.8 months, the posterior drawer test yielded zero or + (0.5 cm) in 60% of cases, while + + (1cm) was observed in 40% of cases. Additionally, 60% of patients were rated to be in good condition or excellent according to the Lysholm scale. Only one patient managed to reach the pre-lesion Tegner activity level. It was noted that the duration of the lesion had a negative impact on postoperative clinical outcomes, particularly affecting parameters such as physical functioning, limitations in physical aspects, vitality, and mental health as assessed by the SF-36 scale.
In conclusion, the two-stage reconstruction of the bicruciate knee ligament demonstrated enhanced knee stability and subjective evaluation; however, a significant majority (96%) of patients did not fully regain their pre-injury level of physical activity. Additionally, there was an observed inverse statistical correlation between the time of injury and subjective evaluations related to physical functioning, limitations in physical aspects, vitality, and mental health as indicated by the S-36 score.
The bicruciate knee ligament injury, involving the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), is considered one of the most severe injuries affecting the knee joint, warranting a dedicated chapter within the realm of knee ligament lesions. In this regard, a surgeon's understanding of the intricate anatomy and biomechanics of both ligaments, along with a thorough grasp of the injury's history, mechanism of trauma, and the patient's physical activity level, are crucial factors that significantly influence decision-making processes.
This intricate knee ligament injury is characterized as a rare occurrence, typically linked to high-energy traumas, either with or without concurrent damage to other joints, structures, or organs. Additionally, meniscal and osteochondral injuries frequently coexist with peripheral ligament lesions, exacerbating symptoms, instability, and joint degeneration [3].
Boisgard et al. (4) delineated four distinct types of bicruciate knee ligament injury mechanisms. The initial type involves a straightforward femorotibial gaping on a plane around a perpendicular axis, while the second type arises from femorotibial translation. The third mechanism combines simple gaping with knee translation, and the final type encompasses femorotibial gaping and translation either in isolation or in conjunction with rotational movements (5). Nevertheless, in clinical settings, pinpointing the precise trauma mechanism proves challenging, particularly in chronic cases, as patients often provide insufficient information regarding the event.
From a biomechanical perspective, a bicruciate knee injury disrupts stability and normal joint kinematics, leading to substantial clinical implications that impact an individual's quality of life. Due to the intricate nature of this injury, surgical intervention is typically recommended.
The impact of bicruciate knee ligament reconstruction on quality of life, symptom improvement, return to work and sports participation, and subjective and objective outcome assessments remains a significant area of interest due to limited scientific research on the topic. This study seeks to establish correlations between clinical data and intraoperative observations with postoperative assessments using the Lysholm scale, Tegner activity score, and SF-36 questionnaire following two-stage bicruciate knee ligament reconstruction.
This retrospective and descriptive study examined 31 patients who underwent bicruciate knee ligament two-stage reconstruction between 2002 and 2010.
Six patients were excluded from the study for various reasons: one due to a bilateral lesion, one with an intra-articular fracture (specifically, a fracture of the lateral tibial plateau), two who underwent tibial osteotomy, and two who were lost to follow-up. Consequently, the final study cohort comprised twenty-five patients, as detailed in Table 1.
Twenty-five patients, comprising twenty men and five women, were reassessed for this study. The average age of the participants was 32.3 years with a standard deviation of 9.81 years, ranging from 17 to 53. The mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated to be 26.2 with a standard deviation of 3.27, ranging from 18.9 to 34.9. Among the patients, fourteen had their right knees assessed, while eleven had their left knees examined.
In terms of the mechanism of injury, car, motorcycle, and bicycle accidents accounted for 72% of cases, with sports practices contributing to 16% and falls or sprains to 12%. The average duration of the lesions was 18.28 ± 29.63 months, ranging from 1 to 120 months, indicating that all patients presented with chronic injuries.
The average age at the time of surgery was 29.4 years, with a range from 16 to 50 years. Among the surgical methods employed was the INLAY PCL reconstruction, utilizing a graft sourced from the central third of the patellar tendon. This graft was secured using an interference screw in the femoral tunnel and a cortical screw with a washer in the tibial tunnel, as illustrated in Figure 1. Following the procedure, postoperative care involved maintaining the extended knee in an inguinal–malleolus splint for a duration of six weeks.
Following a minimum 3-month interval and an observed improvement in range of motion, the patient proceeded to undergo anatomical, outside-in position guided arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. This procedure involved the utilization of quadruple hamstring grafts, with femoral-tibial fixation achieved through the use of interference screws, as illustrated in Figure 2.
It is noteworthy that four patients with concomitant ligament injuries necessitated further surgical interventions. Specifically, two individuals underwent patellar tendon reconstruction utilizing contra-lateral semitendinosus and gracilis grafts, while another two patients underwent medial collateral reconstruction employing contra-lateral semitendinosus and gracilis grafts.
Data on meniscal and chondral lesions (grade ≥ 2) were extracted from medical records, with a predominant occurrence on the medial side of the knee, specifically on the femoral condyle, medial tibial plateau, and patellar surface. Due to their classification as minor injuries, no quantification of the cartilage damage area was conducted; instead, the reports simply indicated the presence or absence of cartilage damage.
The mean postoperative follow-up period was 24.8 ± 20.63 months (range: 9 - 92), during which data on clinical, radiological, and functional assessments using the Lysholm scale, Tegner activity score, and SF-36 questionnaire were gathered. Thigh circumference, measured at 14 cm above the superior end of the patella, was also documented. Prior to participation, informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study received approval from the Ethics Committee of the respective service (CEP n° 963/2010).
The data underwent statistical analysis using the SPSS 13.0 program, with numerical variables and categories being assessed through the Mann-Whitney, Spearman, and Wilcoxon tests at a significance level of p<0.05. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to determine variables influencing quality of life and clinical assessment. In cases where normality was lacking, transformations were applied to the dependent variables. The stepwise selection criterion was utilized during analysis, with a significance level of 5% set for all statistical tests.
All 25 patients included in this study exhibited a complete restoration of their range of motion. Among them, ten patients (40%) displayed a circumference variation exceeding 2cm when measured at a point 14 cm above the superior aspect of the patella.
The postoperative evaluation revealed a decrease in tibial posterior drop during the posterior drawer test by at least one level (+ or 0.5cm). Consequently, seven patients (28%) exhibited a negative posterior drawer test, while eight patients (32%) displayed a residual posterior drawer of 0.5 cm (+/+++). Additionally, ten patients (40%) had a residual posterior drawer of 1 cm (++/+++) in the operated knee, with none of the patients showing a residual posterior drawer of 1.5 cm or more (+++/+++).
The study identified a chondral lesion in 16 patients (64%), a meniscal lesion in 11 patients (44%), and associated ligament lesions in 12 patients (48%). Intraoperative findings of chondral injury were documented in the charts; however, no measurements were conducted.
The study identified associated ligament lesions in a subset of patients, with patellar tendon lesions observed in 2 patients (8%), medial collateral ligament injuries in 5 patients (20%), and posterolateral corner injuries in 6 patients (24%) as detailed in Table 2. Notably, surgical interventions were undertaken for patellar tendon reconstruction in 2 patients and medial collateral reconstruction in 2 patients. However, it is important to highlight that none of the 6 patients diagnosed with mild posterolateral corner injuries underwent surgical reconstructions.
There were no statistically significant differences observed between the groups when analyzed for variables such as age, BMI, presence of chondral, meniscal, and ligament-associated lesions, as well as residual posterior drawer.
Based on the Lysholm score (83.44 ± 16.83), 08 patients (32%) were categorized as excellent, 07 (28%) as good, 08 patients (32%) as regular, and 02 patients (8%) as poor, as shown in Table 3.
The Tegner activity score indicated a decrease in postoperative physical activity levels compared to the no injury status as shown in Table 4. Despite this decline, statistical analysis did not reveal a significant difference. Among the cases examined, only one patient managed to reach the pre-injury activity level, a finding that was statistically significant (p<0.001).
The Lysholm scale demonstrated a statistical correlation with the Tegner deficit, indicating that an enhanced Lysholm scale score was associated with a lesser decrease in physical activity levels following bicruciate knee ligament reconstruction.
The duration of the lesion prior to surgery exhibited a significant inverse correlation with physical functioning, physical limitations, vitality, and mental health as assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire, indicating a detrimental effect on the overall clinical outcome. The findings from the SF-36 questionnaire are summarized in Table 5.
The duration of the postoperative period did not show a statistical correlation with the variables under study, suggesting that a postoperative period of nine months was adequate to achieve the ultimate clinical outcome.
The primary discovery of this study revealed that while the bicruciate knee ligament two-stage reconstruction enhanced knee stability and subjective evaluation, it did not fully restore pre-injury levels of physical activity in 96% of patients. Additionally, the timing of the injury exhibited an inverse statistical correlation with the subjective assessment of physical functioning, limitations in physical aspects, vitality, and mental health as indicated by the S-36 score.
Concomitant lesions are frequently observed in bicruciate ligament injuries, primarily due to the high-energy trauma associated with such incidents. In this study, it was found that 72% of the cases were linked to car and motorcycle accidents, as indicated in Table 1.
In the realm of world literature, the suboptimal and variable clinical results following conservative treatment have prompted a shift towards surgical intervention, yet a universally agreed upon timeframe for surgery remains elusive. Shapiro et al. and Harner et al. [6, 7] advocate for surgical intervention within the second to third week post-injury, contrasting with Chuang et al.'s [8] suggestion of surgery post-attainment of full range of motion.
Hayashi et al. (2009) assessed joint mobility following surgical bicruciate reconstruction and noted a motion deficit in 15% of the patients (n=19). Conversely, Lo et al. (2009) reported a motion deficit in 27% of cases (n=11), while Hirschmann et al. (2011) observed a motion deficit in 38% of patients (n=24). However, in the current study, all patients regained knee range of motion following the two-stage surgery. This suggests that the extent of surgical trauma may impact postoperative joint mobility.
In their examination of postoperative knee stability, Hirschmann et al. [11] found that 96% of patients in both acute and chronic cases exhibited stability, while Ohkoshi et al. [12] noted a residual posteriorization of less than 0.5cm in all cases. Spiridinov et al. [13] documented substantial enhancements in subjective and objective outcomes, along with improved knee stability following endoscopic treatment for isolated and combined grade-III PCL double-bundle reconstruction.
In this series of cases, it was noted that preoperative knee stability showed improvement following bicruciate knee ligament reconstruction. However, a residual posteriorization of less than or equal to 0.5cm was observed in 60% of the patients. It is important to consider that this series consisted of heterogeneous chronic cases, with 28% of the patients presenting associated injuries such as bone fractures or patellar tendon ruptures.
Lo et al. (2010) assessed 11 patients with bicruciate lesions and identified associated ligament and meniscal injuries in 73% and 27% of the patients, respectively. Subbiah et al. (2014) reported ligament lesions in 73% of cases, LUSTIG et al. (2008) observed these lesions in 83.4% to 97% of patients, and Fanelli et al. (2002) found related ligament lesions in 97% of cases in a series of 35 knee dislocation cases. In our current study, 48% of patients exhibited related ligament lesions (refer to Table 2), with 16% of these cases requiring an additional surgical procedure. Additionally, 44% of cases presented with meniscal injuries.
Lo et al. (2010) conducted an analysis of postoperative outcomes, finding no recorded complications in their study. Similarly, no postoperative complications were identified in their research. Schofer et al. (2016) examined a group of 9 patients with chronic bicruciate lesions, reporting an average Lysholm score of 74. Hirschmann et al. (2011) documented a mean Lysholm score of 85 among 24 individuals, comprising 17 acute lesion cases and 7 chronic injury cases. Lo et al. (2010) achieved an average score of 88 for 11 chronic patients. In the current investigation, an overall Lysholm score of 83 was deemed typical (refer to Table 3). Notably, chondral lesions were present in 64% of cases, with these patients exhibiting lower subjective Lysholm scores compared to those without chondral injuries (82.6 ± 19.5 and 85.0 ± 11.5, respectively). Nevertheless, no statistically significant difference was observed (p=0.609). Lustig et al. (2013) also noted the presence of chondral lesions in 42% of cases.
It is important to highlight that inaccurate diagnoses, along with the delayed referral of these patients to specialized services, played a significant role in the prevalence of chronic cases within this sample.
Regarding the pre-injury activity level, it was noted that this intricate lesion notably compromised the patient's quality of life. Hirschmann et al. [11] documented that 33% of the patients (08 individuals) reached the pre-injury activity level, whereas Lo et al. [10] found that 82% of the patients (09 out of 11) managed to achieve the pre-injury activity level. However, in the current study, only one patient reached the pre-injury activity level (4%) with a Tegner score activity of 4 (Table 4).
In the context of isolated ACL reconstruction, Möller et al. and Nunez et al. [17, 18] documented a mean SF-36 score exceeding 70, whereas in isolated PCL reconstruction, Sekiya et al. [19] reported a mean score nearing 50. The authors highlighted that acute and subacute PCL injuries exhibited a superior score in comparison to chronic injuries (p=0.036).
In their examination of bicruciate reconstruction, Schofer et al. and Hirschmann et al. [16, 20] noted that the mean SF-36 score for physical functioning ranged from 43 to 58 points. In contrast, the current study revealed mean values ranging from 60 to 80 points (Table 5).
Furthermore, the duration of preoperative injury exhibited an inverse correlation with four components of the SF-36 questionnaire: physical functioning, physical limitations, vitality, and mental health. This indicates a detrimental impact of the length of the lesion prior to surgery on the postoperative clinical outcomes.
Nevertheless, factors such as age, BMI, associated ligament injuries, residual posterior drawer laxity, and length of postoperative monitoring failed to show any significant correlation with the outcomes following surgery.
This non-randomized, retrospective study focuses on a heterogeneous group of patients with chronic lesions who underwent a two-stage reconstruction of the bicruciate knee ligament using autografts. Despite its limitations, the significance of this study lies in its evaluation of 25 patients with bicruciate injuries who all underwent the same two-stage surgical procedure, conducted by a single surgeon. Given the complexities involved in this surgical technique, which necessitates the harvesting of two or more autografts, as well as the associated surgical trauma and time requirements, a bicruciate knee ligament two-stage reconstruction emerges as a viable and practical strategy to consider.
The two-stage reconstruction of the bicruciate knee ligament resulted in enhanced knee stability and subjective evaluation; however, a significant majority (96%) of patients did not fully regain their pre-injury level of physical activity. Additionally, there was an observed inverse statistical correlation between the time of injury and the subjective evaluation of physical functioning, limitations in physical aspects, vitality, and mental health as indicated by the S-36 score.
