This paper presents a multimodal analysis focusing on the compositional metafunction within the picturebook "Me, Daddy & Dad" (2017), which features a two-father family. The aim of this analysis is to explore the construction of textual meanings. Drawing upon the grammar of visual design as applied to picturebooks, as outlined by Painter et al. (2013), this study delves into the relationship between written text and visuals, the various themes depicted, the layout, framing, and focal points within the images. Through a detailed examination of the images in the picturebook, it becomes evident that both fathers are actively involved in childcare and household tasks like cooking, portraying two-father families in an egalitarian light. However, the analysis also reveals a lack of overt displays of affection among the characters, as interactions between the two fathers or between them and the child are minimal despite their presence together in certain scenes.
Children's picturebooks play a crucial role in fostering literacy development, with their combined linguistic and visual elements serving as key contributors to children's socialization and the assimilation of cultural norms essential for navigating relationships both within and beyond the classroom (Arizpe, Farrell & McAdam, 2013; Evans, 2015). Through engagement with these picturebooks, children not only cultivate their ideological perspectives but also internalize societal patterns, all while fostering a genuine interest in literature (Painter, 2018).
Picturebooks, being multimodal, play a significant role in fostering children's development of multiliteracies by enhancing their understanding of the interplay between language and image in storytelling (Unsworth, 2006). Consequently, they serve as valuable tools for highlighting children's reading and writing skills (Soto Reatiga, 2017), as emphasized by Salisbury & Styles (2012, p.75), who assert that picturebooks serve as both art objects and primary literature for early childhood, offering a captivating narrative experience through the fusion of visual and verbal elements. Moreover, these books facilitate the establishment of connections between the fictional world depicted in the story and the real world, aiding children in relating their reading experiences to their everyday lives.
This paper contributes to the exploration of the relationship between written text and visuals in the picturebook "Me, Daddy & Dad" (2017) by Gemma Denham, published by Elizabeth Publications. The primary aim is to delve into the compositional metafunction to understand how textual meanings are constructed. Building on the notion that picturebooks serve as potent ideological tools, capable of influencing social and political discourse (Baguley & Kerby, 2021, p.2), this study seeks to illuminate how such texts contribute to children's socialization and ideological development. Through a multimodal analysis, the examination will focus on the interplay between visual and written elements. The narrative follows Emily, the central character, as she recounts various activities with her two fathers. By scrutinizing how this picturebook generates compositional meanings, the study aims to challenge and deconstruct traditional family models.
Research has shown that being raised in a two-father family can play a significant role in the development of gender schemas among children. Exposure to diverse gender portrayals and family structures, such as those depicted in children's books, can help foster openness and acceptance. Studies by Campagnaro (2015), Coats (2018), and Soler Quiles (2015) have all highlighted the positive impact of such exposure. Furthermore, literature in this context can also aid in sex-role socialization, as evidenced by the findings of Weitzman et al. (1972, p.1126).
Picture books are crucial in early sex-role socialization as they serve as a medium for conveying societal values to young children. These books offer a window into the world beyond their immediate surroundings, allowing them to observe the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions of other boys and girls. Furthermore, they help children discern between right and wrong, as well as understand the societal expectations placed upon individuals of their age. Additionally, picture books offer children role models, presenting them with images of who they can aspire to become in the future.
The examination of the verbal and visual elements within the compositional metafunction reveals that both modes play a crucial role in shaping meaning, with illustrations being particularly significant in storytelling. Therefore, it is imperative to educate children on how to interpret not just the written words but also the accompanying visuals. As highlighted by Unsworth & Ortigas (2008, p.5):
In order for children to effectively engage with the interpretive potential of images, it is essential for them to enhance their comprehension of the meaning-making mechanisms utilized within images. This necessitates the establishment of a common metalanguage, akin to a linguistic framework used to articulate the meaning-making tools present in written texts.
Understanding how to interpret visual elements is crucial for analyzing meaning in picturebooks, as the visual component often dominates the page. Visuals play a significant role in aiding children's comprehension of the written text by expanding upon the meanings conveyed through words. By engaging with both visual and verbal modes, children can effectively grasp the narrative and enhance their literacy skills.
This picture book was selected for two primary reasons. Firstly, its simple plot revolves around the activities of a child named Emily and her two fathers, with the actions depicted not being exclusive to gay families. Secondly, the book presents a symmetrical portrayal of the fathers, indicating equal significance for both. Throughout the narrative, the child mentions the activities she engages in with each father, emphasizing their shared involvement and importance in her life.
According to Halliday (1978, p.27), language is conceptualized as 'meaning potential' as it is influenced by the communicative context, guiding speakers' linguistic choices. This perspective underscores the interconnectedness of text and context, framing language as a form of social semiotics (Halliday, 1978). Semiotic resources, therefore, are defined as the organized systems of meanings that shape the cultural 'reality' within a society (Halliday, 1978, p.123).
Various modes are employed in multimodal texts, including the picturebook examined in this study. Each mode serves a distinct purpose as they are comprised of specific sets of semiotic resources. Scholars like Elleström (2010) and Bateman (2011) have contributed to the understanding of mode. In essence, mode is defined as a "socially shaped and culturally given resource for meaning making" (Kress, 2010, p. 54), with context and culture playing pivotal roles in determining the selection of modes within a communicative context.
The selected multimodal text communicates through the deliberate selection of visual forms by the writer and illustrator, which are then combined with written text. This amalgamation results in a multimodal text that adheres to the cultural conventions within which it exists, as each text is situated within a specific cultural context that dictates the principles governing its creation; for instance, multimodal texts in Western cultures differ from those in Eastern cultures. Therefore, when analyzing a multimodal text, it is essential to consider the interconnectedness of all its resources (such as music, images, language) as they collectively contribute to the overall meaning. This approach involves the utilization of various semiotic channels that work together to convey meaning within a specific context, as outlined by Gatti (2013, p.17).
The multimodal page transcends mere text, as meanings are constructed and disseminated through diverse resource systems, each operating through distinct organizational, orientational, and presentational modes (Lemke, 2002). The integration of these varied modes on the page is not merely additive; instead, it is interactive.
Picturebooks exemplify multimodal texts that integrate written language and visuals to convey meaning. Various scholars have explored the amalgamation of diverse semiotic modes in multimodal discourse, including Kress and van Leeuwen (2006), Molina and Alonso (2016), O’Halloran (2004, 2008), Unsworth (2006, 2014), and Painter et al. (2013), among others.
Various scholars have focused on the ways in which different modes contribute to the creation of meaning in children's picturebooks (Baguley & Kerby, 2021; Martínez Lirola, 2020; Moya Guijarro, 2014, 2016, 2019; Moya Gujarro & Pinar, 2009; Moya Gujarro & Ruiz, 2020; Moya Guijarro & Ventola, 2021; Painter, 2007; Salisbury & Styles, 2012). These investigations delve into how these modes serve distinct purposes in constructing meaning and how visual elements can either enhance or expand upon the meaning conveyed through written text. At times, the visual components take precedence over the written narrative, while in other instances, there exists a harmonious equilibrium between both modes, as articulated by Kümmerling-Meibauer (2018, p. 3).
The term "picturebook" denotes a medium primarily consisting of a book with visual content, typically pictures. It is important to note that the term does not necessarily require the inclusion of text, although there is a general consensus that picturebooks typically contain both pictures and text. In academic discussions, distinctions are often made between picturebooks where the text takes precedence over the illustrations, and those where there is a more balanced interplay between text and visuals.
Visuals play a crucial role in texts of this nature, as they are instrumental in conveying values, ideas, and examples that hold significance in the storytelling process. It is essential to analyze the visual elements alongside the written text to understand how these modes of communication complement each other and interact to construct meaning within the picturebook (Kümmerling-Meibauer, 2014). Scholars have delved into how children develop multiliteracies from a young age (Lewis, 2001; New London Group, 2000; Moya Guijarro & Ruiz, 2016; Pinar & Moya Guijarro, 2016; Unsworth, 2014). Furthermore, research highlights the pivotal role visuals play in storytelling and in conveying the transmitted ideology (Hamer et al., 2017; Kümmerling-Meibauer et al., 2015).
Painter et al. (2013) present a model for analyzing multimodal meanings in picturebooks that focuses on representational, interpersonal, and compositional meanings, drawing from Kress & van Leeuwen's (2006) visual grammar model. Representational meanings center on the connections between participants, objects, their actions, and the contexts in which they unfold. Interpersonal meanings delve into the social dynamics among individuals, considering factors like distance, gaze, and perspective. Lastly, compositional meanings scrutinize the various relationships between elements within the discourse.
The methodology employed in this study is primarily qualitative-descriptive, focusing on the detailed analysis of a single picturebook. Due to constraints in space, this paper will specifically delve into one metafunction, namely the compositional aspect, while leaving the other two for future investigations. The analysis will primarily center on the textual metafunction as defined by Halliday (1978) and Halliday & Mathiessen (2014), referred to as compositional by Painter et al. (2013). It aims to examine the interplay between the written text and visual elements within the picturebook being scrutinized (refer to Section 4 for further details).
In terms of the analysis categories, Painter et al. (2013) make reference to the layout, framing, and focus as key elements to be investigated in order to enhance the understanding of the compositional significance of picturebooks. This framework draws upon the work of Kress & van Leeuwen (2006), who delve into information value, salience, and framing to unravel textual meanings. Consequently, the analysis will primarily focus on these elements to provide insight into the narratives of the picturebooks.
The opening scene of Me, Daddy & Dad is intriguing as it features scattered pieces of paper and pencils in the foreground, yet none of the characters are visually represented. However, they are mentioned in the written text and depicted in the background images. The text is predominantly displayed on the wall, except for a single line that stands out on the carpet, positioned centrally on the page. Subsequently, the following page introduces all the characters: dad and daddy are situated in the background, while Emily, the central character, is positioned in the left foreground, partially obscured by Max, their pet dog. The setting includes a carpet that serves as a framing device. Each character is attired in casual clothing, such as jeans, t-shirts, and shirts. Dad is depicted with dark hair, while Daddy and Emily share blonde hair coloring.
In the subsequent page, Emily is depicted engaging in drawing and painting activities with her father and dad. Positioned on the right side, Dad is actively drawing alongside Emily, while Daddy is situated on the left, merely observing their artistic endeavors. Transitioning to the following page, Papa's elbow is visible on the left, with two cups of tea and a kettle placed on the right. This page elaborates on the various activities Emily partakes in with her family. The phrase "Craft with paint and string," referencing the visual representation from the preceding page, is mentioned towards the conclusion of the text. Once more, the written content is centrally positioned on the wall.
In some instances, the written text precedes the visual action depicted, as evidenced on page 10, where it is positioned on the left side, prominently displayed on the white pavement for clear visibility: "I like to help to wash the car, so that it sparkles like a star. I squeeze the sponge to make some bubbles, And splash around in all the puddles. And if I’m feeling really cheeky, Super quiet and extra sneaky…I spray my Daddy with the hose, until it runs between his toes." This textual excerpt serves as a precursor to the visual narrative unfolding on page 11. This pattern continues on subsequent pages, with the visual depiction of Emily cooking with her dad on page 12, where she is situated on the right side, while the written description of the cooking activity is foregrounded at the bottom of the page within the kitchen setting. The subsequent pages follow a similar sequence, with the written text preceding the visual representation of the three characters enjoying tea. Notably, there is a deliberate mention of Emily's tea set being pink, a color traditionally associated with girls, as explicitly stated in the visual: "We sit around and sip our drink, from my tea set which is pink," on page 15. Drawing from van Leeuwen (2011), the use of color serves as a textual strategy to enhance narrative cohesion or highlight character attributes. In this context, the choice of pink can be viewed as stereotypical, given its longstanding association with femininity and the societal norm of girls being socialized in pink.
On page 16, Emily is depicted in the park with Dad pushing her on the swings, positioning her prominently on the right side of the page. The subsequent page elaborates on this scene, with the written text centered on the right side, placed on the grass. In this illustration, Daddy and Max are portrayed as mere spectators, observing Dad's active involvement in pushing Emily on the swing. This serves as a stark contrast, highlighting Dad's proactive role in contrast to Daddy's passive observation of the interaction between the two fathers and Emily.
On page 18 of the book, a parallel pattern to that found on page 6 emerges, with certain objects prominently featured on the floor. Specifically, a pair of glasses, a crown, and a dress-up box take center stage. The same images and a bookshelf are visible in the background to the left. The textual content is positioned centrally on the wall, with the exception of the final two lines, which spill onto the carpet. Moving forward to the subsequent page, the trio of characters is depicted on the carpet. Notably, Daddy occupies the central space on the carpet, donning a petite pink dress that accentuates his significance by virtue of wearing feminine attire, thereby underscoring his role as the focal point of attention.
Until page 20, the only instance of Daddy engaging in an action with Emily is depicted visually as he is seen in the background fishing alongside her. Subsequently, on the following page, it is Dad who is portrayed sitting on a bench with Max, observing their fishing activity. The written text is positioned at the bottom of the page, in the foreground, immediately following the stream that was also featured on the preceding page.
On page 22, the written text is once more positioned at the center left of the page, set against a grassy backdrop. Subsequently, Emily, Max, and the two fathers are depicted engaged in a running scene within the countryside. Emily is prominently featured in the foreground, positioned towards the right side of the page. Max is situated in the mid-ground, while the two fathers are placed in the background of the illustration. The action within this scene is verbally described as follows: <>
After a sequence of events occurring outside the home, the narrative shifts back to Emily's bedroom on page 26. The unmistakable setting is confirmed through a direct textual reference, "I lay by books upon my bed," positioned centrally on the left side of the page. The scene is unmistakably Emily's room, evident from the visible portion of her bed and a glimpse of Dad's legs. Transitioning to the subsequent page, Emily is depicted nestled in bed between her two fathers. Notably, Daddy occupies the right side, a position of significance, aligning with the text indicating his role as the reader: "My Daddy reads in silly voices, and then I laugh with all my might, until it’s time to say ‘goodnight.’" The trio is engrossed in the book, jointly holding it as they engage in the shared reading experience.
In the subsequent visual, the scene unfolds in Emily's room where she is depicted lying in bed asleep, while the two fathers are positioned in the background, distinctly framed by the door, watching over her slumber. Positioned on the right is Daddy, with his arms crossed, mirroring the posture he assumes on page 17.
The book concludes mirroring its beginning, with text positioned centrally on the page against a wall backdrop. The illustration depicts Emily's room, featuring her scattered pens and pencils, reminiscent of page 26. Just as observed in the initial pages, a distinct mention of Dad, Daddy, and Max follows in sequence: <>.
The analysis reveals that the themes, which are predominantly unmarked in most instances (75%), typically function as the subject in declarative clauses such as 'my name', demonstratives like 'this', personal pronouns ('I', 'we', 'they'), and the predicator or let + subject in imperative clauses ('be careful', 'come', 'find out', 'let's not forget'). Simple themes are more prevalent than multiple themes, as illustrated in Table 1.
In 23 out of the 64 sentences analyzed, the theme of 'I', referring to Emily, is prevalent, accounting for 35.93% of the examples. This written theme of 'I' aligns with Emily being the visual focus in the majority of the pages, as the entire picture book revolves around her interactions with her fathers. Additionally, there are seven other themes (10.93%) that depict the characters as 'Me and Dad', 'Dad and Daddy' (three instances), 'they', 'my dad', and 'my daddy'. In each of these instances, the characters are visually represented in the illustrations, reinforcing the written theme. Furthermore, the theme of 'We', referring to Emily, Daddy, and Dad, emerges in five cases (7.81%).
In the three cases (4.68%) analyzed, the dog, Max, emerges as the central theme, referred to as 'Max' and 'he' twice. This textual emphasis aligns with his visual prominence, as he is positioned in the foreground on the right-hand corner of page 24. By thematizing the dog, the narrative underscores his significance within the context of the story. Furthermore, Max is strategically foregrounded in relation to Emily, standing out as the primary focus when all characters are depicted together for the first time.
The remaining themes encompass 'our adventures', 'the kitchen', 'the park', or 'a game', focusing on Emily's activities or the locations where they occur. Nevertheless, there are instances of marked themes (25%) present when a textual theme precedes the topical one before conjunctions such as 'and/but', the adverbial 'sometimes', the prepositional phrase 'On a damp and rainy day' on page 14, 'there', 'then', and 'so'.
The visual depiction of the two fathers indicates distinct personalities and caregiving roles: Daddy is portrayed with a smile, while Dad appears more serious. Additionally, Dad's choice of a blue shirt implies a more masculine role. This color choice accentuates masculinity, particularly on page 19 when Dad is dressed as a pirate, in stark contrast to Daddy's pink costume, which aligns him with a more feminine role. As previously noted, color serves as a textual device that aids in conveying meaning, as suggested by Painter et al. (2013, p.35), who argue that color can be utilized cohesively to create visual connections within a narrative.
The pages featuring Emily alongside her two fathers reveal distinct positioning for Daddy and Dad: Daddy is positioned on the right on page 7, encircling her on pages 8, 14, and 27, placed centrally and on the left on page 19, and depicted in the background with Daddy on the right, connected to Emily through vectors on pages 23 and 28. Conversely, when Emily is depicted with Daddy, she is positioned on the right on page 11 and on the left on page 20. Dad is introduced first on page 6, the initial page with written text stating, "This is my Dad, and my Daddy," and he is prominently placed (on the right, symbolizing new information) the first time he appears visually on page 7. Furthermore, he is shown engaging in activities such as drawing on page 8 and cooking on page 12, indicating a more active role compared to Daddy.
Analyzing the visual representation of Dad and Daddy as visual themes reveals that the written theme 'This is my Dad, and my Daddy' aligns with portraying Dad on the right side of the page. Among the instances where both fathers are depicted with Emily simultaneously, it is observed that Dad and Daddy are equally represented as visual themes, each appearing on the right side four times. It is noteworthy that whenever Dad and Daddy are the written theme, Dad consistently takes precedence in mention.
While the initial mention of Dad is evident, there lacks a specific reference to him being Emily's biological father. The resemblance of Daddy's hair to Emily's suggests a biological connection. Furthermore, Daddy is depicted as being physically closer to Emily and assuming a protective role, as evidenced by their positioning on the cover of the picturebook (refer to Figure 1).
Daddy's intimate bond with Emily is evident in several instances. On page 8, Daddy is depicted standing behind Emily, attentively watching as she draws, embodying a protective presence.
In the illustration, Dad is depicted alongside Emily, mirroring her actions. This dynamic is evident on page 11, where Daddy engages in playful interaction with Emily, as indicated by the line, "I spray my Daddy with the hose, until it runs between his toes." Additionally, Dad is shown observing Emily during various activities such as painting on page 15, serving tea on page 15, and swinging on page 17. Positioned protectively behind Emily in the stream on page 20, Dad assumes a guardian role. The representation shifts on page 23, where Dad is portrayed running with Emily, following closely behind Max, the dog. However, a notable change occurs on page 24, where Dad is depicted on the right side, attempting to catch Emily, while Daddy looks on. This particular illustration foregrounds the dog, adding a new dimension to the visual narrative.
The father figure is prominently featured in various ways throughout the illustrations: he consistently appears on the right-hand side of pages 7, 8, and 15, actively engaging in activities with Emily such as drawing on page 8, cooking on page 12, and pushing her on the swing on page 16. In contrast, the character of Daddy is predominantly situated on the left side of the pages mentioned, primarily depicted observing the interactions between Emily and Dad on pages 17 and 24. Exceptions to these portrayals occur on page 19, where Daddy is centrally positioned, on page 20 where he is shown fishing with Emily, and on pages 23, 27, and 28 where he is positioned on the right alongside Dad. These distinctions suggest that Dad assumes a more dynamic and involved role in Emily's life and within the family unit. Notably, the placement of Daddy in the center of the page wearing a pink dress on page 19 associates him with certain feminine attributes. The use of pink in Emily's tea set, fishing equipment, and overall depiction reinforces traditional gender associations, with pink symbolizing femininity. Conversely, the presence of purple in the lamp, bed cover, and pyjamas in Emily's room aligns with feminist connotations traditionally linked to the color purple.
The narrative unfolds predominantly within the confines of the house, specifically on pages 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, and 26 to 29, as well as in various outdoor settings adjacent to the house, such as on pages 10 and 11 (immediately outside the house), on pages 16 and 17 (in the park), on pages 20 and 21 (by the stream), and on pages 22 to 25 (in the countryside). Notably, the recurring appearance of the kettle on pages 9 and 12 serves as a symbolic representation of the domestic setting, emphasizing the centrality of the home environment to the unfolding events. Furthermore, the primary location within the house where the majority of actions occur is the sitting room, as evidenced by its frequent mention on pages 6, 7, 14, 15, 18, and 19.
In the analysis of the relationship between written text and visuals within the context of this research, two distinct patterns emerge. In some instances, the written text serves as an introduction to the characters or actions depicted on the subsequent page, as evidenced on pages 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26. Conversely, there are instances where the visual representation precedes the written text, with the text providing an explanation of the visual action already presented. This pattern is observed on pages 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, and 29. These contrasting patterns highlight the dynamic interplay between written and visual elements in conveying narrative information.
In general, characters are typically not portrayed on pages containing written text, except for two instances in the analyzed material. On page 17, Daddy is positioned to the left of the written text, emphasizing the textual content as more significant. Conversely, on page 21, Dad and Max are placed above the written text, highlighting the visual elements as more prominent due to their top position and their function as ideals, aligning with the principles outlined by Kress & van Leeuwen (2006, p.187).
In instances where the upper portion of a page is dedicated to text while the lower section features one or more images, the text assumes the primary ideological role, with the pictures serving in a subservient capacity that is nonetheless significant for providing specification, evidence, practical implications, and other relevant aspects. Conversely, when the roles are inverted and images take precedence in the top section, the visual elements convey the primary ideological message, while the text functions to expound upon and elaborate upon this visual communication.
From the outset of the book, it is evident that image and verbal language are intricately intertwined, as noted by Painter et al. (2013, p. 93), with each semiotic mode playing a distinct role in the construction of meaning. The layout of the book positions image and verbiage on facing pages, indicating their equal significance. A closer examination reveals a deliberate separation between the visual and written text, with the written content occupying its own designated space within the layout. Furthermore, the written text is strategically placed either before or after the corresponding visual element it describes or references, emphasizing the unique distribution of visual and textual components within the book.
In terms of framing, the visuals within this book are bound, as the images are enclosed by margins or spaces that create a separation between readers and the story world. Painter et al. (2013, p. 105) support this notion by stating that "Bound images, those situated within page margins or borders, delineate the story world as more distinctly separated from the reader's world than unbound ones and may also function to contain or confine the character." The written text consistently appears in black, providing a stark contrast against the light hues of the walls, pavement, or green grass where it is situated.
The margins play a crucial role in establishing the ambiance of the setting, effectively placing the characters within a specific room or outdoor environment. Referred to as ambient margins, they serve to create a sense of containment and belonging. Throughout the text, various instances can be observed where characters are framed by different elements within the house or from nature. Examples include the sofa and carpet on pages 7 and 19, the table on page 8, the house and car on page 11, a window and shelves on page 12, and a fence on pages 16 and 17, among others. Not only are characters framed by physical elements, but the written text itself is also enclosed by various objects and settings, such as pens, shelving, and pictures on page 6, the wall on page 9, and pots and kitchen jars on page 13. These frames, as noted by Painter et al. (2013), serve to delineate and enclose elements within the narrative, emphasizing the boundaries that separate them.
The written text on specific pages is carefully considered, while visual elements are emphasized through various patterns. In certain instances, characters are arranged in a centrifocal-polarised pattern, positioned in two distinct corners across pages 7, 11, 16, 20, 23, 27, and 28. Conversely, in other cases, characters are depicted in lines, adhering to an iterating aligned pattern, as observed on pages 8, 12, 15, 19, and 24. When characters are presented in lines, they form a singular focus of attention. However, in centrifocal-polarised patterns, multiple focuses of attention are connected by vectors.
This picturebook serves as a prime example where the visuals effectively complement and elucidate the written text's message. The narrative can be comprehended solely through the illustrations, as they vividly depict the key actions described in the text. Consequently, children encounter no obstacles in grasping the storyline and witnessing how the visual and verbal elements synergize to underscore the primary messages conveyed through the characters' actions. The fluid placement of the written text, whether preceding or succeeding the visuals, implies that its positioning does not significantly impact children's comprehension of the picturebook's plot.
The narrative in the research article is centered around Emily's perspective, with the pronoun 'I' predominantly used to refer to her. Emily is visually emphasized as a theme, often depicted in a foregrounded position on the right or at the center of the page. Notably, there are no instances where she is portrayed in isolation, indicating that the narrative aims to showcase the various activities she engages in with her fathers. Characters are typically depicted in full-length, medium-sized figures that occupy a significant portion of the page, reflecting a general trend in the visual representation within the narrative.
The juxtaposition of visuals depicting the girl with her two fathers alongside those showing her engaged in activities with just one father implies distinct roles for each parent in the girl's life. Both fathers are portrayed with equal significance throughout the narrative and in the girl's life, as evidenced by their equal representation in the visual themes (refer to Section 3). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the written text introduces "Dad" first and positions him prominently in the visuals upon his initial appearance. Furthermore, the portrayal of Dad engaging in more activities with Emily than with Daddy serves to underscore his role in the girl's life.
In "Me, Daddy & Dad" (2017), the characters engage in various activities such as painting, washing the car, playing with the hose, cooking, playing 'Time for tea', visiting the local swings, playing dress up, fishing, playing chase, and reading. Notably, all the verbs used describe material processes and actions. The visual and textual depiction of these activities suggests that Emily and her two fathers are an active family. Their interactions, including drinking with the girl, playing and running together, and reading to her in bed, emphasize their familial bond and the shared experiences typical of any family. This picturebook exemplifies what Sunderland and Mclashan (2012, p. 168) refer to as the "backgrounding strategy" in portraying gay families. Rather than directly addressing gay sexuality, the book focuses on family dynamics and personal life experiences that are universal and not exclusive to gay families.
The chosen activities indicate that Emily leads a well-rounded life, engaging in various pursuits with both of her fathers. Some of these activities bring her joy, like playing indoors and outdoors. Others are clearly associated with domestic tasks, such as cooking and sewing. It is interesting to note that there is no representation of Emily studying or doing homework. The activity that comes closest to academic work is when she paints or reads with her fathers in bed towards the conclusion of the story.
Following Emily's introduction of her family at the start of the book, subsequent pages depict the various interactions she has with each of her fathers. While there are instances where she is depicted with both fathers simultaneously in the picturebook, these occurrences are limited, comprising less than one third of the total pages. Specifically, out of the 24 pages, such instances are observed on only 7 pages, accounting for approximately 29.16% of the book.
The narrative unfolds in two distinct settings, the home and the countryside, where actions transpire, underscoring the dual spheres of socialization for children. This dichotomy emphasizes the sharing of cultural patterns and social norms within and beyond the household. In Table 2, a visual representation delineates the interactions between the fathers, highlighting the frequency of physical contact. The data reveals that in "Me, Daddy & Dad" (2017), physical displays of affection between the fathers are sparse, occurring approximately one third of the time they are together. Similarly, instances of physical contact between Emily and her fathers are infrequent, as indicated in Table 2.
Table 2 reveals a scarcity of instances depicting affection between the fathers in Me, Daddy & Dad (2017). It further demonstrates a higher frequency of physical contact between Daddy and the child within the book, suggesting a discrepancy in the display of affection between the two fathers. The analysis underscores the limited occurrences of interactions between the fathers, a trend that aligns with their infrequent joint appearances in the visual representations.
Demonstrating affection or expressing closeness is linked to emerging forms of masculinities. Promoting an egalitarian form of masculinity is crucial for establishing novel family structures that deviate from the traditional hegemonic model prevalent in conventional heterosexual families. The portrayal and embodiment of these new masculinities, whether in heterosexual or homosexual partnerships, pose a challenge to the patriarchal system, rooted in a social hierarchy that favors men with greater power and privileges, supported by an ideology that rationalizes this hierarchical arrangement.
When children engage with picturebooks, such as the one under examination in this study, they encounter diverse family structures that play a crucial role in their socialization. By depicting the protagonist, a girl, engaging in activities with her two fathers that are typically associated with heterosexual couples, like cooking, playing, and running, the narrative contributes to the normalization of non-traditional family models. This portrayal reinforces an alternative gender ideology that challenges conventional norms by presenting various family configurations as commonplace. Furthermore, the depiction of activities both within and outside the home in the picturebook serves to normalize the daily life of the family it represents, further solidifying the acceptance of diverse family dynamics.
The pedagogical application of utilizing this picturebook with children is evident: it contributes to teaching that both men share the responsibility of caring for the child and engage in activities with the child both at home and outside. Consequently, the picturebook emphasizes the depicted actions as the two fathers are shown actively participating in activities with Emily.
The analyzed picturebook contributes significantly to the promotion of two-father families, serving as a tool to empower students who come from such family structures. Moreover, the content of this book not only encourages acceptance and respect for diverse family compositions but also fosters a cultural and social shift towards inclusivity. By challenging traditional family norms, this book paves the way for alternative family structures to become more widely accepted. Through its narrative, children are exposed to values of equality and the advocacy of rights for individuals regardless of their sexual orientation. As a result, the picturebook plays a crucial role in creating an inclusive curriculum that caters to all children, particularly those who may feel marginalized or misunderstood due to their family dynamics.
