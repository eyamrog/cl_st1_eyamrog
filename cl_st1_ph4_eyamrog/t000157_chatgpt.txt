Drawing on a specific interpretation of the notion of "relatedness" as formulated within the framework of "new kinship," this study offers a critical analysis of the concept of identity and puts forth a more fluid and dynamic alternative to the established understanding.
In exploring the intersection of kinship/relatedness and immigration, our research takes two distinct ethnographic paths: one tracing international migration from Governador Valadares (M.G.) and the other focusing on Japanese immigration to Brazil. Through a series of ethnographies conducted by our research group on this subject, we have uncovered the potential for critiquing identity constructions rooted in relatedness. Our current analysis reveals that the concept of "identity" has obscured significant internal differences within seemingly homogeneous groups (such as Japanese descendants), while also presupposing the existence of these groups to be explained. By emphasizing relatedness, we can delineate "groups" based on their own distinct criteria. To capture these amalgamations of shared practices, values, and experiences, I have introduced the concept of "differentialities."
In Valadares, through ethnographies conducted in the predominantly modest neighborhoods from which most emigrants originate, a dynamic termed "nano-houses" was identified (Machado, 2010). This phenomenon emerged as a significant driver of international mobility, serving as a means to fulfill a deeply ingrained desire within kinship structures. The concept of "nano-houses" encapsulates the aspiration to consolidate a network of relationships and social connections. This consolidation necessitates a tangible form of support: a personal residence capable of accommodating the nuclear family while also facilitating gatherings with extended family members and friends. The possession of such a home symbolizes a degree of autonomy and independence from other social circles. Essentially, owning a home allows for the act of centralization, whereas lacking one results in being centralized by others.
The perception of the need for material resources to centralize "immaterial" relationships reflects the desire for immigration as a means to expedite the process: to quickly earn more money, return, establish a business, and thrive economically and socially. This ethnographic description of the process, essentially from bottom to top, introduces a different concept of kinship rooted in the idea of relatedness (Carsten, 2004), aiming to comprehend the practical implications of emigration analyses in Governador Valardes. Choosing kinship as an analytical framework prompted a contemplation of the diverse immigrant experiences. The correlation between Valadarense immigrant kinship and the immigrant's life production in the host country suggests that the concept of identity oversimplifies the entire process. What was initially perceived as "identity" based on the experiences of Valadarense immigrants in Portugal, ultimately revealed itself to be nothing more and nothing less than kinship.
The exploration of diversity in this context progressed primarily as a theoretical analysis stemming from our examination of the Japanese community in Brazil through a kinship lens. Our focus on the varied experiences of the Japanese population in Brazil, particularly within the Valadarense kinship framework intertwined with emigration, prompted us to adopt the concept of "multiple Japanesicities." This approach enabled us to offer an alternative perspective, shedding light on different facets of Japanese-descendant kinships, as highlighted in Machado's work (2011).
The concept of multiple Japanesicities arises from a concern with the intricate processes involved in a broad category like "Japanese-descendent identity." By viewing internal differences as "Japanesicities," the analysis is de-hierarchized, allowing us to perceive Japanesicity as a multifaceted construct. This perspective enables us to refrain from evaluating the subjects' conditions on a spectrum of being "more or less" Japanese, but rather as uniquely Japanese in their own right. The term Japanesicities can be likened to a "tangle" of lines, as described by Ingold (2007), representing intertwined trajectories that are shared and experienced collectively, forming a complex web of self-referential paths. These interwoven paths give rise to ontologies, which emerge from the exchange of perspectives along the trajectory. These tangles, in essence, represent totalities akin to a ball of yarn: unraveling and reweaving the threads results in new configurations of interconnected trajectories.
The concept of Japanesicities represents a departure from traditional notions of boundaries, limits, and fixed distinctions between Japanese individuals and Brazilians. These Japanesicities encompass situations and processes that challenge, subvert, or disrupt existing assumptions. The production of Japanese identities extends beyond mere blood relations, a significant aspect within Japanese and Japanese descendant communities as highlighted by numerous studies, as well as racial categorizations. It is possible for non-descendants to embody a more authentic Japanese identity than actual descendants, adhering to the criteria set forth by these Japanesicities. Consequently, non-consanguine relationships continually complicate a simplistic definition of Japanese identity based on superficial racial characteristics such as narrow eyes.
The examination of Japanesicities offers a nuanced exploration of race, ethnicity, and culture, transcending the boundaries of descent. Japanesicity, in essence, extends beyond the realm of lineage, emphasizing the construction of kinship ties. By delving into alternative forms of relationships that extend beyond blood ties, we uncover Japanese kinships that embrace diverse configurations, including those that involve non-descendants while excluding descendants. This highlights the intricate ways in which individuals navigate their connections, forming kinship networks that defy conventional norms.
The utilization of differentiality proves to be a valuable approach in examining the vast array of Japanese experiences in Brazil, primarily by initially negating the notion of a homogenous group. This negation enables the introduction of novel perspectives, particularly in redefining and expanding the concept of who constitutes the Japanese community. Traditionally, the identification of Japanese descendants has been predominantly based on phenotypical characteristics: Japanese lineage or appearance. In essence, it has always been linked, albeit implicitly, to Japanese ancestry. The group's definition has consistently revolved around biological parameters, subsequently allowing for the exploration of alternative distinctions. By moving away from biological determinants, we can conceptualize Japanesicities as dynamic ontological processes that transcend the confinement of genetic lineage. This shift in perspective avoids reducing a population solely to its genetic makeup.
The ethnography conducted in Valadares effectively showcased a kinship in motion, illustrating the interconnected flow of individuals, commodities, emotions, concepts, and influences. This instance serves as a clear demonstration of the role kinship plays within the Valadares community. The contrasting "Japanese examples" presented in the study, when juxtaposed with each other and with the Valadares research, reveal a multitude of processes that shape what we tentatively term as "differentialities." These investigations also highlight the deep interconnection between these differentialities and Japanese kinship dynamics in Brazil. Furthermore, they bring to light the intricate interweaving, or "complex imbrication," that prompts a reevaluation of the correlation between identity and kinship, challenging the notion that identity solidifies the group's existence as commonly assumed.
Reification occurs when we approach the category of "Japanese descendants" in a generic manner, overlooking the internal distinctions within this group that are crucial for comprehending social dynamics. Recognizing differentiality enables us to understand that the group labeled as "Japanese descendants" does not solely consist of blood relations; individuals who are not descendants may belong to this group, while some descendants may not. This aspect transcends the conventional notion of identity.
Identity theory has engaged in dialogue with cultural criticism since the late 1980s, influenced by Cultural Studies. This interaction has allowed for discussions on behaviors, shared symbols, and intergroup relations, moving away from a specific focus on culture towards a consideration of individuals embodying multiple identities. This shift has enabled the discourse on "immigrant identity" rather than solely "immigrant culture," illustrating the flexibility of the term "identity." Whether discussing broad concepts like "Brazilian identity" or more specific identities such as "Pentecostal Brazilians," the emphasis lies on delineating boundaries or limits to differences rather than adhering to a rigid set theory. By focusing on the delineation that separates groups, regardless of cultural or identity contents, the key lies in understanding what defines the identity within the confines of the group. Therefore, the primary concern is not the content of the identity itself, but rather what distinguishes the identity of a pre-established group.
This issue continues to pose challenges, particularly within the realm of anthropology, as it revolves around the concept of difference. This inevitably steers the conversation towards the notion of identity. However, as the internal differences within immigrant populations garnered more attention, the efficacy of the identity construct began to wane. It appeared nebulous, marked by a hierarchical categorization of differences, while simultaneously fostering notions of similarity and uniformity. Primarily, it encouraged the perception of difference as something peripheral, temporary, and superficial. This superficial understanding falls short in capturing the complexity of these processes, which can be better understood as a multitude of "differentialities."
I aimed to encapsulate the essence of difference within migrant "communities, introducing a concept that transcends the notion of "identity." The provisional concept of differentiality enables us to contemplate the intricate processes associated with the Japanese presence in Brazil, leading us to conceptualize Japanesicities. Conversely, we consider Valadarense kinship to elucidate similar occurrences in Governador Valadares, portraying it as a minute variation of the familiar structures in Valadares - termed Valardarense differentiality, primarily manifested through kinship. The Valadarense kinship and the Japanese kinships under scrutiny share a commonality in generating differentialities, almost as if they were structural manifestations. Whether through the fragmented Valadarense ethnography, emphasizing an all-encompassing kinship, or the diverse ethnographies of Japanesicities, unraveling the essence of kinship, we witness a complex interplay between kinship (relatedness), differentialities, and migration. Both processes underscore that the concept of identity falls short in capturing the distinctions engendered by individuals.
