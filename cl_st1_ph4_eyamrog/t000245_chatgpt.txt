The Ganodermataceae family, known for its cosmopolitan nature, is characterized by the presence of double-walled basidiospores, with the inner wall being thick and ornamented, and the outer wall smooth. Despite the growing interest in this family, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding of its species in various regions of Brazil, particularly in central Brazil. This study sheds light on the distribution of Ganodermataceae species in the Cerrado biome of the Midwest region, where we identified 23 specimens belonging to five species across three genera: Amauroderma, Foraminispora, and Ganoderma. Among these species, one (A. exile) represents a new record for the Cerrado, while four (A. exile, F. rugosa, G. multiplicatum, and G. stipitatum) are new to the State of Goiás, and one (G. stipitatum) is a new find for the Distrito Federal. Notably, Amauroderma aurantiacum has been rediscovered in Goiás after an absence of 88 years. This research significantly contributes to enhancing our understanding of the geographic distribution of these taxa in Brazil.
Proposed in 1948, the family Ganodermataceae (Donk) Donk comprises approximately 220 described species, categorized into seven genera (Amauroderma Murrill, Foraminispora Robledo, Costa-Rezende & Drechsler-Santos, Furtadoa Costa-Rezende, Robledo & Drechsler-Santos, Ganoderma P. Karst., Haddowia Steyaert, Humphreya Steyaert, and Tomophagus Murrill) (Ryvarden 2004, Kirk et al. 2008, Costa-Rezende et al. 2017). Regarded as cosmopolitan, this family is characterized by the presence of double-walled basidiospores, featuring a thick and ornamented inner wall and a smooth outer wall, setting it apart from other polyporoid groups. Basidiospores exhibit globular and ellipsoid shapes with pigmentation (Gilbertson & Ryvarden 1986, Ryvarden 2004, Cannon & Kirk 2007). These distinctive features, along with the pileus' hardness, play a crucial role in the identification of Ganodermataceae species (Ryvarden 2004, Gugliotta et al. 2011).
The Ganodermataceae family is of significant importance in upholding trophic balance within ecosystems, primarily through their involvement in nutrient cycling and induction of white rot in woody tissues (Ryvarden, 2004). This family encompasses species that hold both economic and medicinal value, with certain members being sources of bioactive compounds that are extensively researched for their potential biotechnological applications (Zjawiony, 2004; Tseng et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2016).
Species of the Ganodermataceae family, with the exception of the genus Haddowia, are widely distributed in tropical regions, including various Brazilian ecosystems as documented by several researchers (Gibertoni & Cavalcanti 2003, Ryvarden 2004, Silveira et al. 2008, Baltazar & Gibertoni 2009, Campacci & Gugliotta 2009, Drechsler-Santos et al. 2009, Gomes-Silva & Gibertoni 2009, Gibertoni & Drechsler-Santos 2010, Gugliotta et al. 2010, Gomes-Silva et al. 2011, Costa-Rezende et al. 2016, Bononi et al. 2017). However, the knowledge regarding this family within the Cerrado biome is limited to the documentation of 17 species, primarily belonging to the genera Amauroderma and Ganoderma, as highlighted in previous studies (Gibertoni & Drechsler-Santos 2010, Abrahão et al. 2012, Maia et al. 2015, Costa-Rezende et al. 2016, Bononi et al. 2017). This current research contributes new insights by presenting novel species occurrences of the Ganodermataceae family within the Brazilian Cerrado and Midwest region.
The specimens examined were gathered from Cerrado regions spanning the years 2005 to 2018, primarily within conservation units (UC) in Goiás State. These areas include the Parque Estadual da Serra de Caldas Novas (PESCAN) in Caldas Novas (17°43'56"S to 17°50'55,7"S; 48°40'0"W to 48°42'57,6"W), Rio Quente (17°47'35"S and 48°47'36"W), Floresta Nacional de Silvânia (FLONA) in Silvânia (16°38'30.46"S and 48°39'3.11"W), Bosque Auguste Saint-Hilaire (BASH) in Goiânia (16º36'26.74"S and 49º15'51.69"W), Reserva Ecológica of the Universidade Estadual de Goiás (REC-UEG) in Anápolis (16º23'40"S and 48º57'32"W), as well as various locations within the urban area of Anápolis (16º20'12"S and 48º56'42"W; 16º19'14"S and 48º55'39"W), Anápolis municipality (14º11'44"S and 49º20'19"W), Kalunga community in Cavalcante, Engenho II (13º34'56"S and 47º28'16"W), and Brasília municipality in Distrito Federal (15º46'48"S and 47º55'45"W).
The Cerrado, situated in the Central Plateau of Brazil, is recognized as the second largest biome in South America. Encompassing the States of Goiás, Tocantins, Bahia, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Maranhão, Piauí, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Distrito Federal, Rondônia, and Paraná, this biome is distinguished by its savanna and grassland forest formations, featuring a diverse mix of trees, shrubs, and undergrowth vegetation. The region experiences a tropical climate characterized by a rainy season with hot summers and dry winters, as noted by Ribeiro and Walter (1998) and Klink and Machado (2005).
The taxonomic identification of the collected specimens was conducted by analyzing macro and micromorphological characteristics, following the methodologies outlined by Teixeira (1995) and Ryvarden (2004). Subsequently, the specimens were carefully preserved and stored in the Herbarium of the Universidade Estadual de Goiás (HUEG) for future reference and study.
In our study, we identified a total of 25 specimens, which belong to three genera and five species. Among these specimens, one represents a novel finding for the Cerrado region, specifically Amauroderma exile (Berk.) Torrend 1920. Additionally, we discovered new records for the State of Goiás, including Foraminispora rugosa (Berk.) Costa-Rezende, Drechsler-Santos & Robledo 2017, Ganoderma multiplicatum (Mont.) Pat. 1889, and G. stipitatum (Murrill) Murrill 1908. Furthermore, we identified Ganoderma stipitatum as a new record for the Distrito Federal. Notably, A. aurantiacum (Torrend) Gibertoni & Bernicchia 2008 was rediscovered in the State of Goiás, its original type locality, 88 years after its initial publication.
The species chosen for this study was selected as a representative sample that displayed resistance to changes in seasonality, with sampling conducted during both dry and rainy seasons in the designated areas. The holotype was initially documented in the State of Goiás in 1932 (Gibertoni et al. 2008), and remarkably, after 88 years, the species was once again recorded in the same state. Various descriptions of the species' hyphal system exist, with Furtado (1968) and Ryvarden (2004) presenting differing perspectives. Furtado describes the system as trimitic, comprising generative hyphae with clamp connections, branched thick-walled connective hyphae, and arboriform skeletal hyphae, while Ryvarden views it as dimitic, consisting of generative hyphae with clamp connections and arboriform skeletal hyphae. For this study, the trimitic hyphal system was adopted. In the field, the species closely resembles A. calcigenum (Berk.) Torrend, but can be distinguished by the presence of ellipsoid basidiospores. Notable characteristics include the reddish hue of the basidiome and the globose basidiospores, which are yellowish with dense reticle-shaped ornamentation.
The species is distinguished by its sessile basidiome, lacquer layer, reddish hue, and 6-8 pores per mm. A. multiplicatum bears a striking resemblance to G. orbiforme (Fr.) Ryvarden, yet microscopic examination reveals notable distinctions. G. orbiforme showcases larger basidiospores measuring 8.8-10.4 × 6.4-7.2 μm and cuticle cells with more pronounced protuberances (Gugliotta et al., 2011). This discovery marks a novel addition to the State of Goiás' fungal biodiversity.
According to Ryvarden (2004), the distinguishing characteristic of this species lies in its dark resinous bands within the context. Despite its macroscopic similarity to Ganoderma lucidum (Curtis) P. Karst., as noted by Martins-Júnior et al. (2011), it can be differentiated microscopically by the hyphal system, which is dimitic in G. stipitatum and trimitic in G. lucidum, as well as by the basidiospores, which are ellipsoid to oblong and truncate at the apex in G. stipitatum, contrasting with the ellipsoid to obovate shape in G. lucidum (Groposo & Loguercio-Leite 2002, Singh et al. 2014). This discovery represents a new occurrence for both the Distrito Federal and the State of Goiás.
