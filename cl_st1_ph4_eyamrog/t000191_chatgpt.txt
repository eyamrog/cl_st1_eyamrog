This study aimed to present preliminary research results on the impact of COVID-19 on the professional practice of dentists in Pernambuco. It is a cross-sectional, descriptive, and exploratory study, with the population consisting of dental surgeons actively enrolled in the Regional Dentistry Council of Pernambuco. Data collection was conducted through an electronic form, encompassing the characterization of professionals (gender, age, years since graduation, marital status, family income, and field of work) and health status (vaccination status, presence of comorbidities, knowledge of biosafety measures, and COVID-19 testing). The preliminary data, collected during the first week, were analyzed in terms of frequency, proportions, and measures of central tendency. Among the 363 dental surgeons, 38.6% work in both public and private sectors. Comorbidities that could exacerbate COVID-19 were found in 35.0% of participants, with 24.5% not up to date on influenza and hepatitis vaccines, and 79.3% not tested for COVID-19. Regarding biosafety training for COVID-19, 30.7% received no instruction. It is imperative to immunize dental surgeons against immunological diseases, expand COVID-19 testing capacity, especially for those at risk, and provide essential biosafety training for the safe resumption of activities.
The initial instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus responsible for COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, located in Hubei province, China (Chen N et al, 2020). The contagion swiftly disseminated throughout China and soon after, cases were reported in nations like Japan, Thailand, and the Republic of Korea. As the number of cases escalated worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified the outbreak as a pandemic in March 2020 (WHO, 2020).
The initial case of COVID-19 in Brazil was officially recorded on February 26, 2020, with community transmission being recognized across the nation a month later. In response to this public health crisis of significant national concern, the Secretariat of Health Surveillance within the Ministry of Health (SVS) modified the Surveillance System for Acute Respiratory Syndromes. This adaptation was designed to provide guidance to the National Health Surveillance System in light of the concurrent circulation of coronavirus, influenza, and other respiratory viruses (Brasil, 2020).
According to the Epidemiological Bulletin number 18 from the Ministry of Health dated June 15, 2020, Brazil reported 888,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 43,959 deaths (Brasil, 2020). However, these figures may not accurately represent the true prevalence of COVID-19 within the population due to the testing strategy in place, which primarily targets individuals exhibiting symptoms, particularly those with severe cases. Consequently, a significant portion of those infected, who may only display mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic, are likely going undetected (HALLAL et al., 2020).
According to the Epidemiological Bulletin of the State Health Secretariat dated 06/16/2020, the state of Pernambuco reported a total of 46,427 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 17,405 classified as severe and 29,022 as mild. This places Pernambuco in second position within the Northeast Region for the highest number of deaths attributed to the disease. As of the latest data, severe cases have been identified in 168 municipalities (90.8% of the total) across Pernambuco, including the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (PERNAMBUCO, 2020).
Once the virus infiltrates oral tissue cells, it can contaminate the aerosols produced during dental procedures, posing a potential risk. Consequently, dental practices, crucial for overall health maintenance, are deemed high-risk environments for contagion (PENG et al, 2020). This fear of contamination has deterred individuals from seeking dental care post-reopening of health services, potentially leading to a surge in emergencies or more intricate procedures. Furthermore, it is imperative to assess the necessity for modifications within dental offices to mitigate or eradicate viral presence in aerosols and on service environment surfaces. Dentists must also adapt to this new norm, prioritizing their own well-being and that of their patients.
Given the significant disruptions caused by the pandemic on the delivery of dental services, exploring strategies to adapt this practice could play a crucial role in ensuring the continued provision of this vital service to the community. Given the widespread interest in this subject both nationally and internationally, the findings from this study aim to provide valuable insights into the risks associated with dental practices during the pandemic, particularly for healthcare professionals in the field. The primary goal is to quantify these risks by implementing protective measures, identifying dentists with underlying health conditions, conducting COVID-19 testing, and gathering feedback from the professionals involved.
The current study adopts a quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, and exploratory methodology. Respondents were included in the initial eight days of the survey, spanning from June 9th to June 16th, 2020.
The study population comprised 9,793 dental surgeons registered with the Regional Dentistry Council of Pernambuco (CRO-PE). All actively enrolled dental surgeons were initially considered for inclusion in the research. Exclusions were made for individuals lacking an email address, displaying inconsistencies in contact information, not possessing the Whatsapp messaging application, being unable to access the survey form, or having unsigned or suspended registrations.
The data collection instrument was created and implemented in an electronic format using Google Forms. It was distributed through the official email list of CRO-PE, the message transmission list of the WhatsApp messaging app, text messages, and posted on the social media platforms of the organization. This protocol was designed to reduce potential data loss, improve response rates, and adhere to social distancing measures, which prevented in-person data collection.
The professionals under investigation were characterized based on various socioeconomic factors including gender, age, years since graduation, marital status, family income, and whether they worked in the public and/or private sector. In assessing their health status, variables such as adherence to the updated vaccination schedule, understanding of biosafety measures for COVID-19, undergoing COVID-19 testing, and the presence of comorbidities were examined.
The data was exported to Microsoft Excel version 2000 for analysis, which involved examining the distribution of frequencies, percentages, mean, and median. To ensure respondent confidentiality, the professional's registration number from CRO-PE was compared with the one provided in the questionnaire. Each participant was then assigned a unique number to maintain anonymity and prevent the professional from being identified.
The research adhered to all guidelines outlined in Resolution 466/12 of the National Health Council pertaining to research involving human subjects. Approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of the Academic Center of Vitória (CEP/CAV) at the Federal University of Pernambuco, with reference to CAAE number 32362120.3.0000.9430 and report number 4.068.546.
One week after commencement, the survey garnered responses from 363 dental surgeons, with 72.5% (n = 263) being female, 58.1% (n = 211) married or in a common-law relationship, and 33.9% (n = 123) single. In terms of family income, 66.1% (n = 240) reported an income equal to or exceeding five minimum wages, 23.1% (n = 84) fell within the range of 3 to 4 minimum wages, and 10.7% (n = 39) reported an income of up to 2 minimum wages. On average, participants had 14.6 years of post-graduation experience. In terms of postgraduate education, 55.9% (n = 203) held specialization or residency as their highest degree, while 22% (n = 80) did not possess any postgraduate qualifications. Additionally, 38.6% (n = 140) were engaged in professional activities across both public and private sectors.
In examining the health status of these professionals, it was noted that 35.0% (n = 127) have comorbidities that could exacerbate the symptoms of COVID-19. The prevalent conditions include arterial hypertension (14.3%), pulmonary diseases, respiratory failure, or asthma (9.6%), obesity (8.8%), and diabetes (4.1%). In terms of vaccination compliance, 24.5% are not up to date with either influenza or hepatitis vaccines. Furthermore, 79.3% (n = 288) of dentists had not undergone COVID-19 testing, with 70.6% (n = 53) of those tested receiving negative results. In terms of preparedness for clinical care, 30.3% (n = 110) of respondents reported not receiving any training or courses on biosafety for COVID-19 (see table 1).
This study represents the inaugural attempt to investigate the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the oral health workforce across various dimensions. Specifically, it aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the health status of dentists, encompassing financial and emotional implications as well as alterations in their professional practices. The insights gleaned from this research are poised to inform discussions on the requisite adaptations that the dental community must undertake in the aftermath of the pandemic.
The research findings indicate a significant presence of women in Dentistry, aligning with existing literature on gender participation in the field (Morita, Haddad, & Araújo, 2010). It is crucial to contemplate gender dynamics when discussing the repercussions of COVID-19, particularly in Dentistry, given the higher susceptibility of women to infection due to their numerical majority. Additionally, considerations must be made regarding the implications of informal work arrangements, heightened economic vulnerability, increased caregiving responsibilities within households, and limited representation in leadership roles and decision-making spaces (Wenham, Smith, & Morgan, 2020).
The implementation of the National Oral Health Policy - Smiling Brazil ("Brilho no Sorriso") has created job opportunities in the public sector, attracting dentists seeking financial stability and security in their careers, particularly in light of uncertainties in the private sector. Statistics from 2014 reveal that approximately one third of the country's dental practitioners are employed within the Unified Health System (SUS), yet many also pursue opportunities in private practice. This trend is consistent with the findings of our study, where a majority of respondents reported working in both public and private settings. Therefore, discussions surrounding the impact of the pandemic on dental professionals' daily practices should acknowledge this dual employment dynamic, as individuals often navigate between different economic sectors while performing their professional duties.
Health professionals operate within an environment where occupational hazards are a constant presence. These risks, along with the associated apprehension of falling ill or experiencing such consequences, significantly impact the work performance of individuals, subsequently affecting their overall quality of life (NORONHA, 2013). Research conducted among dental surgeons in India reveals that merely 10% express confidence in resuming post-pandemic care. Factors contributing to this hesitancy include concerns related to personal health and financial stability (KINARIWALA et al., 2020).
Personal health is a critical consideration in light of the risk of contamination, as this research has highlighted a significant number of professionals with chronic diseases that serve as risk factors for COVID-19. Such health conditions may prevent individuals from attending work due to the fear of exacerbating their condition in the event of contracting the virus. Existing literature underscores the correlation between comorbidities and the deterioration of COVID-19 patient outcomes, with studies indicating that a higher number of comorbidities escalates the severity of these outcomes (YE et al., 2020).
It was noted that nearly one-third of the professionals surveyed had not undergone any formal training or courses on biosafety for COVID-19, potentially leading to risks of contamination. To address this deficiency, virtual courses could serve as a viable alternative, offering a potential educational solution during periods of social isolation (Quijano-Escate et al., 2020).
In order to reduce occupational risks, it is imperative to revise the vaccination schedule, as immunization plays a crucial role in safeguarding both healthcare workers and patients. Not only is vaccination deemed safe and effective, but it is also accessible through the Unified Health System (SUS). Research indicates the influenza vaccine's efficacy in lowering case rates and absenteeism among healthcare professionals (IMAI et al., 2018). Similarly, studies have shown comparable positive outcomes for hepatitis B vaccination among dental surgeons within the public health system in São Paulo (GARBIN et al., 2019).
The limited extent of testing conducted across all regions of Brazil is evident in the initial findings of this study, with fewer than a quarter of professionals undergoing COVID-19 testing. Enhancing the testing capabilities for both the general population and healthcare workers is crucial to gather essential data and metrics required to formulate effective strategies for projecting outcomes that encompass the societal and demographic variations, facilitating a secure transition back to normalcy while mitigating the risk of potential future epidemic resurgences (BARRETO et al., 2020).
This study is limited by the presentation of preliminary data; however, it offers insights into the health status of dental surgeons in Pernambuco amidst the most significant public health crisis of this century. It is important to highlight that data collection will persist, and with a larger sample size, analytical measures can be assessed. This will allow for inferences regarding the financial and emotional repercussions, as well as changes in the work dynamics. Furthermore, it will facilitate the extension of the analysis to encompass other categories of oral health professionals, including oral health assistants and technicians.
The proficiency of a dental surgeon is crucial for the well-being of individuals and should be grounded in secure clinical practices for both the oral health team and health service users. The emergence of the novel coronavirus has introduced fresh challenges for the field of dentistry, necessitating immediate and long-term adaptations. Addressing these challenges requires collaborative efforts among professionals, professional organizations, governmental bodies, and academic institutions to develop, execute, and oversee initiatives that support them.
The research on the impact of COVID-19 on the professional practice of dental surgeons reveals several key findings. Firstly, there is a pressing need for the immunization of these professionals against immunological diseases. Additionally, expanding testing capacity for COVID-19 is crucial to enhance the accuracy of disease control measures, particularly for professionals in high-risk groups. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of enhancing biosafety qualifications to ensure a safe return to practice. These findings are anticipated to inform the planning and restructuring of health services in both public and private sectors.
We express our gratitude for the assistance provided by the Regional Council of Dentistry and the Pernambuco Health Secretariat, specifically through the State Coordination of Oral Health.
