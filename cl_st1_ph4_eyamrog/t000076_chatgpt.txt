Objective: The treatment of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) in ambulatory patients under the age of 7 often involves the utilization of three pelvic osteotomies - Salter, Dega, and Pemberton. In this study, we introduce a modified version of the Salter Pelvic Osteotomy (SPO) that combines the benefits of these established procedures. Methods: We evaluated the short- and mid-term outcomes of 19 patients who underwent the modified SPO. Preoperative and postoperative assessments were conducted, with follow-up examinations at 6 months and beyond. Results: Prior to surgery, the Acetabular Index (AI) measured 39.5 ± 7°, which significantly improved to 24.4 ± 5.5° postoperatively, further decreasing to 20.4 ± 5° at 6 months and 14.5 ± 4° at follow-up. The AI correction averaged 14.9 ± 5.5°. The Lateral Centre-Edge Angle at follow-up was 22.7 ± 4.7°. Clinical evaluations at follow-up revealed I/II McKay grade in 18 patients (94.7%), while radiological assessments showed I/II Severin class in 18 patients (94.7%). Conclusion: The modified SPO demonstrates the ability to enhance femoral head coverage in all directions, yielding excellent or good outcomes in the majority of patients who undergo this procedure.
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) stands as one of the most prevalent pathologies affecting the hip joint in children. The timing of DDH detection plays a crucial role, as non-surgical interventions prove effective only when diagnosed early, particularly in non-walking patients. Conversely, late detection in walking patients or following unsuccessful non-surgical approaches, such as in cases of residual acetabular dysplasia or femoral head redislocation, necessitates surgical intervention. Various surgical procedures exist for managing DDH, with pelvic osteotomies demonstrating the most favorable outcomes in terms of efficacy and success rates.
Three distinct pelvic osteotomies, namely Salter, Dega, and Pemberton, are frequently employed in patients under the age of 7 with Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH). Each of these procedures comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Salter osteotomy, for instance, is relatively easier to execute but primarily enhances anterolateral femoral head (FH) coverage and offers a lower degree of acetabular deformity correction compared to Pemberton and Dega osteotomies. Dega osteotomy, on the other hand, allows for comprehensive FH coverage in all directions and achieves a higher correction degree, yet it poses technical challenges in patients under 4 years due to the thinner iliac bone. Pemberton pelvic osteotomy also enables a higher correction degree, but it only enhances anterolateral FH coverage; a potential drawback post-surgery includes the risk of triradiate cartilage injury.
It is widely recognized that Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DHH) is not solely characterized by an anterolateral acetabular deficiency; in fact, three distinct types of acetabular deformities have been identified. Consequently, there arises a necessity for a pelvic osteotomy procedure that can enhance femoral head coverage in all planes. Essential criteria for such a pelvic osteotomy include the ability to achieve adequate correction of acetabular deformities, ease of execution across all age groups, and a minimal risk of triradiate cartilage injury. At our institution, we have adopted a modified Salter Pelvic Osteotomy (SPO) that fulfills these essential prerequisites.
The objectives of this study were threefold:
In this study, we outline our adaptation of the SPO technique.
To demonstrate the short and medium-term outcomes following the implementation of this technique.
Approval from the institutional ethics board committee (Protocol No. 4, dated December 10, 2021) was secured for the dissemination of the findings from this study.
In our institution, the modified Salter pelvic osteotomy (SPO) has been utilized since 2015. This procedure is specifically employed in patients aged over 2 years with acetabular dysplasia, characterized by acetabular index (AI) values equal to or exceeding 30°. The upper age threshold for the application of this technique is set at 6 years old.
The modifications in our SPO procedure compared to the traditionally described method include the following: 1) a curved osteotomy line that extends horizontally up to the terminal line before turning downwards towards the top of the greater sciatic notch, as illustrated in Figure 1, A/D; 2) a more proximal starting point for the osteotomy line, depicted in Figure 1, B/E; 3) the chisel's blade outer side is angled at 45° upward laterally, following the Dega pelvic osteotomy principle, shown in Figure 1, C/F. These distinctive features of our modification are visually represented in Figure 1.
The modified SPO technique enhances the femoral head coverage in all directions by utilizing a curved osteotomy line, as illustrated in Figure 2. This approach also enables a more substantial degree of acetabular index correction by optimizing the chisel blade position, thereby increasing the bony contact between iliac bone fragments during the correction of acetabular deformities. Importantly, this modification is straightforward to execute irrespective of the patient's age, as it involves a complete iliac bone osteotomy that is not contingent on iliac bone thickness. Furthermore, the risk of triradiate cartilage injury is minimized due to the distance of the osteotomy line from this structure. Figure 3 provides a visual representation of the application of the modified SPO technique.
To assess the outcomes following modified SPO, a cohort of 19 patients who underwent this surgical procedure between 2015 and 2020 was chosen for analysis.
In this study, a total of 19 patients were included, comprising 18 girls (94.7%) and 1 boy (5.3%). The left hip joint was affected in 12 cases (63.2%), while the right hip was affected in 7 cases (36.8%). The average age of the patients was 3.6 ± 1.5 years, with a range of 2 to 6 years. The mean follow-up period for these patients was 2.7 ± 1.6 years, ranging from 1 to 5 years.
During the pelvic osteotomy, we enhanced the femoral head coverage in areas where there was a deficiency as indicated by X-rays. The anterior coverage deficit was assessed based on the anterior center-edge angle (CEA) values on the false profile view, comparing it with a "healthy" hip. The deficit in posterior femoral head coverage was determined by analyzing the contours of the anterior and posterior acetabular walls on anterior-posterior X-rays, with the medial position of the posterior wall relative to the anterior wall indicating a posterior acetabular wall deficit, akin to the posterior wall sign in adults. In cases where both anterior and posterior acetabular deficiencies were present, we improved the femoral head coverage in the more deficient direction. Lateral femoral head coverage was consistently enhanced in all patients.
In addition to the modified SPO procedure in all cases, femoral varus derotational osteotomy (FVDO) was conducted to reduce femoral anteversion and valgus deformity. Femoral head open reduction was implemented when concentric closed reduction of the femoral head was unattainable, with femoral shortening being a mandatory procedure for these patients. The amalgamation of femoral head open reduction, pelvic, and femoral osteotomies is recognized as One-Stage Surgery (OSS). Among the patients, a combination of modified SPO and FVDO was carried out in 8 individuals (42.1%), while OSS was performed in 11 patients (57.9%).
Patients underwent clinical and radiological examinations before surgery, immediately postoperatively, at 6 months post-surgery, and during follow-up. Prior to the surgical procedure, the DDH Tonnis grade and AI values were established. The day following surgery, AI values and the degree of AI correction were measured. At the 6-month postoperative mark, AI values were assessed, and any indications of femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) were identified. During follow-up, AI values and Wiberg lateral CEA values were determined, while femoral head AVN sequelae were evaluated based on Bucholz and Ogden's criteria. Long-term radiological outcomes were classified according to Severin classification 3, and long-term clinical outcomes were assessed using McKay's criteria 13.
For statistical calculations, we utilized JASP Team's software (2020), specifically JASP Version 0.11.1.0.
Based on the DDH Tonnis classification, Grade II was observed in 6 patients (31.5%), Grade III in 1 patient (5.3%), and Grade IV in 12 patients (63.2%).
The preoperative AI values were recorded at 39.5 ± 7 degrees (range: 30-53).
The day following the surgical procedure, the AI values were recorded at 24.4 ± 5.5 degrees Celsius, with a range of 15 to 33 degrees Celsius.
The degree of AI correction observed in the study was measured to be 14.9 ± 5.5 degrees, with a range of 8 to 28 degrees.
At the 6-month mark, the AI values averaged 20.4 ± 5 ° (range: 9-28). Signs indicative of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head were observed in 8 patients, accounting for 42.1% of the total sample.
At the follow-up, the AI values measured 14.5 ± 4 degrees (range: 6-23), while the lateral CEA values were 22.7 ± 4.7 degrees (range: 15-29). Femoral head AVN sequels were categorized as type I according to Bucholz and Ogden in 5 patients (26.3%), type II in 0 patients, type III in 1 patient (5.3%), and type IV in 2 patients (10.5%). Clinical outcomes, as per McKay's criteria, were as follows: grade I in 12 patients (63.2%), grade II in 6 patients (31.5%), grade III in 1 patient (5.3%), and no patients falling under grade IV (0%). Radiological assessments based on the Severin criteria revealed class I in 14 patients (73.7%), class II in 4 patients (21%), class III in 1 patient (5.3%), and no patients classified under class IV-VI.
Table 1 displays the preoperative characteristics of the patients, as well as their postoperative clinical and radiological outcomes.
The long-term outcomes following the implementation of the modified SPO application are illustrated in Figure 4. A comparison between the results obtained from our modified SPO approach and those reported by other researchers using standard SPO techniques (or their variations) is detailed in Table 2.
Non-surgical management of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) proves effective in instances of early diagnosis, however, in cases of neglect or when non-surgical treatments fail, surgery becomes imperative. Pelvic osteotomies have been established as the most effective surgical approach for treating DDH. Each pelvic osteotomy utilized in DDH treatment for patients under the age of 7 presents its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, it is recognized that DDH not only involves a deficiency in anterolateral femoral head coverage but also encompasses three distinct types of acetabular deformities. Consequently, the optimal pelvic osteotomy should enhance femoral head coverage in all directions without any known drawbacks. This study outlines our modification of the Salter pelvic osteotomy, designed to meet these criteria. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the short-term and mid-term outcomes following the application of the modified Salter pelvic osteotomy.
Our adaptation of the SPO technique deviates from the traditional approach by incorporating a curved osteotomy line, initiating the procedure at a more proximal point, and utilizing a chisel blade with an upward-directed lateral edge.
The short-term and mid-term clinical and radiological outcomes following the modified SPO application, with a follow-up period ranging from 1 to 5 years, demonstrated favorable results, with 94.7% of patients reporting good to excellent outcomes and no instances of unsatisfactory results. Our findings align with previous studies investigating the standard SPO application or its variations 1-3, 13-20. Nevertheless, we emphasize the importance of individually evaluating the direction of femoral head deficiency and incorporating this assessment into preoperative planning for optimal outcomes.
Several limitations are evident in this study. Firstly, the follow-up period was relatively short. Secondly, there was an absence of a control group for comparison. Thirdly, the age range of the patients was limited to 2-6 years old, potentially restricting the generalizability of the findings. Lastly, the study did not provide results specifically after isolated SPO modification, as each patient included in the study underwent additional procedures. These shortcomings should be considered when interpreting the results of the study.
The Modified Salter Pelvic Osteotomy offers the potential to enhance femoral head coverage in all directions for ambulatory patients with Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) who are under the age of 7. Notably, the procedure is relatively straightforward to execute regardless of the patient's age. Moreover, this method yields favorable correction of the Acetabular Index. Following a Modified SPO, outcomes are consistently rated as excellent or good for the majority of patients, highlighting the efficacy and reliability of this surgical approach.
