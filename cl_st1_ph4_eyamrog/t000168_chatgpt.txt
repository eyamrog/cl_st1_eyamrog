Intensive care units (ICUs) have increasingly embraced flexible visitation models to prioritize patient and family-centered care. The objective of this study was to assess an extended visitation model in an adult ICU from the perspectives of family members and the healthcare team. Conducted as a cross-sectional study, the research involved relatives of patients and healthcare professionals in a general ICU with an extended visitation policy at a hospital in southern Brazil. The evaluation of the extended visitation approach was conducted through a 22-question survey. Analysis of responses from 95 family members and 95 ICU staff members revealed contrasting viewpoints. Nursing staff predominantly viewed the changes in work attitudes negatively (77.9%), citing interruptions (46.3%) and minimal impact on reducing family anxiety and stress. In contrast, family members reported decreased anxiety and stress (91.6% versus 58.9%; p <0.01) and improved communication (86.3% versus 64.2%; p <0.01) as positive outcomes. While both groups generally viewed the extended visitation model favorably, discrepancies emerged in perceptions, particularly with healthcare team members expressing concerns about work interference, attitude changes, limited anxiety reduction, and discomfort from family presence.
The nursing staff plays a crucial role in enhancing the experience of families within the ICU setting; however, they require assistance to navigate the obstacles presented by the adoption of a more adaptable visitation policy.
The traditional practice of limited visiting hours in intensive care units (ICUs) globally stems from concerns about potential physiological stress, disruptions to patient care organization, and increased infection risks associated with flexible visitation policies (McAdam and Puntillo, 2013; Cabrera and Cunha, 2014; Ramos et al., 2014). Nevertheless, a shift towards open or flexible visitation schedules in some ICUs aims to prioritize patient-centered care, enhance patient and family satisfaction (Vandijck et al., 2010; Rosa et al., 2010; Puggina et al., 2014). Despite these benefits, resistance from some healthcare professionals persists, citing concerns about increased nursing workload and care disorganization with family member presence (Ramos et al., 2013; Giannini et al., 2013). Understanding the areas of agreement and disagreement between professionals and families on flexible visitation can aid in developing an optimized model that caters to the needs of patients, families, and staff, with the primary focus on patient recovery and care in the highly intensive ICU setting (Goldfarb et al., 2017; Begonã and Tricas, 2012; Gerritsen et al., 2017; Cappellini et al., 2017).
The hospitalization of an individual in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is recognized as a challenging period for the family, triggering a range of emotions that extend beyond the hospitalized family member to encompass their life perspectives, potentially resulting in emotional upheaval. The ICU is often perceived as a setting associated with gravity and mortality, further compounded by the family's unpreparedness to navigate the complexities of a loved one's hospitalization. Consequently, certain family members may grapple with feelings of uncertainty and powerlessness when confronted with the inevitability and unpredictability of the situation (Athanasiou et al., 2014).
Previous research has indicated that rigid visiting hours for families in hospital units, constrained physical space, unavailability of professionals to address relatives' inquiries, lack of empathy towards the family's circumstances, and dissatisfaction with unmet needs are among the obstacles experienced during interactions with healthcare teams in high-intensity settings (Vandijck et al., 2010; Huffines et al., 2013).
The configuration and regulations within the majority of hospitals have not been designed with caregivers and family members in mind. Visiting hours, responsibilities for care, sleep management, bathing protocols, temperature control, and meal arrangements are all structured based on hospital policies, often disregarding the unique habits and routines of patients and their families (Fumis et al., 2015). In the context of ICU visitation, the traditional approach has been to limit the number of visitors during pre-set intervals, typically lasting between 30 to 60 minutes, scheduled throughout the day including morning, afternoon, and evening.
The presence of relatives during the recovery of ICU patients has been shown to have a positive impact. In situations where healthcare professionals may struggle to convey messages or understand patient responses, family members play a crucial role in interpreting and facilitating communication between the patient and the medical staff (McAdam and Puntillo, 2013; Cabrera and Cunha, 2014; Ramos et al., 2014; Vandijck et al., 2010).
If a family member's hospital stay is prolonged, it becomes imperative to establish protocols that ensure their comfort and well-being within the hospital setting. One crucial aspect involves adequately training the healthcare team to effectively communicate with and support these relatives, given the demanding nature of their work and the need for seamless interactions with patients and their families. It is essential to recognize that implementing an extended visitation policy is a multifaceted endeavor that must carefully balance the needs and preferences of both patients and their loved ones.
To assess the efficacy of an extended visitation model within an adult intensive care unit, this study aims to gather insights from both family members and the healthcare team.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in a 56-bed adult ICU located in a general hospital in the South of Brazil. This hospital has implemented flexible family visiting hours, permitting up to two family members to stay with the patient at the bedside for a maximum of 12 hours each day.
The inclusion criteria for accompanying family members encompassed individuals who were part of the family of hospitalized patients, irrespective of gender (such as parents, children, siblings, or spouses), above 18 years old, spending over two hours daily at the patient's bedside in a hospital sector for more than 48 hours, regardless of the reason for hospitalization. Caregivers designated by the responsible family member were also considered. However, individuals with visual impairments among family members and caregivers were excluded from the study. Additionally, ICU care team members (including nurse staff, physiotherapists, nutritionists, psychologists, and physicians) were included based on specific criteria: being integral to the ICU's operational structure, having a minimum of three months of experience in the sector, and possessing an understanding of the concept of extended visitation periods exceeding two hours daily. Questionnaires with any unanswered questions were omitted from the study to ensure data integrity.
Data collection took place between September and December 2016. The evaluation of the flexible visitation policy with the care team was conducted using the open visit questionnaire (Ramos et al., 2013). Responses to all questions were provided on a Likert scale ranging from never (1) to always (4), except for questions 20, 21, and 22, which offered three response options: yes (1), no (2), and don’t know (3).
The individuals accompanying their hospitalized relatives were invited to participate in the survey and, upon agreeing, signed the Informed Consent Form. Subsequently, the questionnaires were provided to the participants, who completed them in a private location either near or within the ICU, and then deposited them in a designated area within the research facility. The survey instrument utilized was identical for assessing the adaptable visitation protocol for accompanying relatives, albeit with certain questions modified for enhanced clarity. These questionnaires were self-completed and typically required around 30 minutes to finish. Additionally, sociodemographic data were gathered from both family members and caregivers.
The sample calculation for the care team members was derived from a prior study that utilized the evaluation tool for open visitation (Ramos et al., 2013). Given that positive evaluation responses stood at approximately 44.8% for the care team, with a 5% margin of error and a significance level of 5%, it was determined that 95 participants needed to be included based on the number of professionals in the sector. To ensure comparability, an equal number of participants were also selected for the group of relatives.
Descriptive and analytical data analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 21.0. The results were categorized into negative (never/occasionally) and positive (frequently/always) responses. Questions Q3, Q4, Q9, Q10, Q11, Q12, Q13, Q14, and Q15 were reverse-coded for analysis. Categorical variables were presented in absolute (n) and relative (%) values, while continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation. Chi-square tests were employed for comparing categorical variables, and Mann-Whitney's test was used to compare responses between groups. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
The study received approval from the institutional review board (CAAE no. 54454016.5.0000.5345).
A total of 95 family members of patients admitted to the ICU and 95 members of the ICU care team were included in the study. Among the team members, the majority were nursing technicians (57, 60%), followed by nurses (19, 20%), physicians (11, 11.6%), and others (8, 8.4%). The average duration of work experience for the care team members was 4.2 years (SD, 4), with a mean age of 32 ± 6 years. The majority of the attending family members were women (78=82.1%), with a mean age of 51 ± 12 years. In terms of the patients' neurological status, 63 (66.3%) were conscious and able to speak. The most commonly affected organ systems at the time of data collection were neurological (23, 24.2%), respiratory (22, 23.2%), and cardiovascular (19, 20%).
The family members accompanying the patients exhibited a more favorable attitude towards visitation flexibility compared to the ICU healthcare team. The distribution of responses, as illustrated in Table 1, indicates a notable disparity in the percentage of positive and negative perceptions. Notably, responses to questions 12 and 18 did not display significant differences. Particularly striking were the variations in positive perceptions concerning issues such as interruptions in team workflow (Q11), shifts in team demeanor (Q16), and the alleviation of anxiety and stress among family members (Q5).
This study assessed the extended visitation policy in adult ICUs at a hospital in southern Brazil, two years after its implementation, from the perspectives of family members and ICU care team members. The majority of family members accompanying patients in the adult ICU were female, employed, educated at the college or university level, and primarily the children of the patients. Previous research has highlighted women as the most prevalent and active family caregivers in hospital settings (Goldfarb et al., 2017; Huffines et al., 2013). Despite the increasing presence of women in the workforce, a significant number continue to take on caregiving roles within families, potentially influenced by societal norms where women are traditionally involved in the care of ill family members (Cappellini et al., 2014).
In this study, it was noted that the majority of relatives and members of the care team hold a favorable view of a companion, whether they are family members or caregivers, remaining at the patient's bedside. They believe that this presence contributes to the patient's recovery and helps to ease the suffering experienced by the family. Nevertheless, the findings indicated that family members tend to have a more positive perception of the prolonged visit compared to the care team across various aspects, as outlined below.
Work interruptions and delays in procedures due to extended visiting times are perceived differently by accompanying relatives and the care team. A study on nurses' opinions regarding open visits revealed that 75.5% of nurses find it challenging to plan nursing care, and 59.4% believe it leads to procedure delays (Smithburger et al., 2017). Similarly, another study assessing medical staff, nurses, and physical therapists found that most professionals agree that continuous family presence causes care delays (Gerritsen et al., 2017). The presence of certain family members can increase professionals' workload in the ICU, leading to task delays. Instances were noted where family members frequently seek information, interrupt procedures, disrupt unit dynamics, or contribute to patient restlessness. In such stressful scenarios, the care team must prioritize patient comfort, even if it means separating them from the family member. Therefore, visitation approaches should be tailored to individual units to address the needs of patients, families, and healthcare providers effectively.
The majority of ICU care team members perceive the changes in workplace attitudes resulting from extended visits negatively, in contrast to the family's predominantly positive evaluation. It is crucial for professionals to deliver care that instills a sense of security and confidence, facilitating the patient and family's comprehension and acceptance of established procedures, thereby enhancing treatment efficacy (Clark et al., 2016; Fumis et al., 2015). The presence of a companion in the ICU disrupts the unit's daily routine, prompting structural and organizational adjustments that create new avenues for social interaction. This underscores the necessity for more effective communication strategies among all parties involved, given that the accompanying family member has increased interaction with the team and more opportunities to observe the patient's care.
In terms of alleviating anxiety and stress among patients and their relatives, the majority of participants noted a reduction in these symptoms. However, over a third of the care team expressed skepticism, believing that such symptoms can only be occasionally or never mitigated in patients and relatives admitted to the ICU. Research indicates that prolonged presence of family members in highly intensive environments can contribute to diminishing feelings of anxiety, stress, delirium, and depression in patients (Rosa et al., 2010; Clark et al., 2016). Conversely, some professionals and services argue that the presence of family members may heighten physiological stress in patients. They suggest that a family member's presence could impede care and assistance, potentially leading to physical and mental exhaustion within the family due to the demands of hospitalization (Cabrera and Cunha, 2014; Giannini et al., 2013).
The discomfort caused by the presence of family members alongside patients was noted to be more pronounced for the ICU care team, with the family often being unaware of this. This sentiment aligns with findings from a study by Gerritsen et al. (2017), which highlighted that professionals felt uneasy when conducting patient examinations in the family's presence. The team's discomfort could stem from their unfamiliarity with having visitors observe their daily practices and the potential disruption to their workflow due to inquiries from relatives regarding patient care. Embracing a more open ICU visitation policy could lead to a shift where professionals view such interactions as natural and even beneficial, allowing for increased participation and engagement with both the patient and their accompanying family member.
In our study, both groups concur that an advantageous aspect of the extended visit is the family's ability to acquire more information about the patient. A previous study revealed that the nursing team in an evaluated ICU lacked clarity on how to convey a sense of security, both in terms of the type of information to be shared and in interpreting the care provided (Ellis et al., 2015). It is crucial to highlight the importance of preparing the care team to effectively receive and inform these family members, as the team's daily tasks necessitate interaction with both patients and their families. Offering clear and consistent information can aid in the family's decision-making process concerning the patient's best course of action, as the family's continuous and active presence can facilitate collaborative decision-making between the team and the family regarding optimal care and treatment practices. Notably, convening meetings between the multiprofessional team and family members within the initial 24-48 hours post-admission presents an opportunity to enhance communication strategies, establish rapport, address concerns, set objectives to alleviate family members' stress and anxiety, and define the rights and responsibilities of companions during the hospitalization period.
Extended visits enable healthcare professionals to gain a deeper understanding of the unique circumstances of each family and the support systems available to each patient. This allows them to effectively communicate information that offers comfort and alleviates the suffering experienced by both patients and their families, ultimately leading to a more compassionate and personalized form of care.
This study is subject to certain limitations. Primarily, the research was carried out at a single center, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the self-administered nature of the study raises concerns about the reliability of responses, as participants may have provided inaccurate information due to a lack of comprehension regarding the subject matter.
It is the responsibility of nurses and other members of the care team in intensive care settings to explore ways to enhance the flexibility of patient visits. The nursing team plays a crucial role in enhancing the experience of families within the ICU environment due to their direct and daily interactions with patients, enabling them to provide support during emotionally challenging moments when family members are present (Eugênio and Souza, 2017). Moreover, they can engage families in minor tasks like assisting with patient feeding, participating in hygiene and comfort procedures, sharing pertinent information calmly and clearly, and empowering families by promoting their autonomy in caregiving.
To facilitate this process, teams require assistance in surmounting the obstacles hindering the adoption of a more adaptable visitation policy. Understanding the varying perspectives held by healthcare professionals and family members can enhance efforts towards implementing an extended visitation model. By gaining insights into these perspectives, strategies can be developed to educate families and provide training for professionals to effectively manage the heightened presence of relatives in the ICU. Additionally, it allows for a reevaluation of the necessary staffing levels per patient in light of the increased visitation allowances.
Both groups generally viewed the model of extended visitation positively, with a majority of aspects receiving favorable evaluations. However, significant differences emerged in their assessments, particularly in relation to the interference in the team's work and changes in attitudes at work, which were perceived more negatively by health team members. Additionally, the health team expressed lower perceptions of the reduction of anxiety and stress in both families and patients, as well as discomfort caused by the presence of a relative.
The existing literature provides a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Previous studies have highlighted various aspects related to this topic, shedding light on its complexities and nuances. Researchers have delved into the historical background, theoretical frameworks, and empirical findings that contribute to our current knowledge. Through a synthesis of these works, a foundation has been established for further exploration and analysis. This body of knowledge serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to deepen their understanding of the subject.
In the realm of intensive patient care, inadequate communication serves as a significant stressor, particularly in interactions between healthcare staff and patients' families.
Many professionals in the field contend that delays in ICU patient care activities stem from the persistent presence of family members.
The presence of a companion in the adult ICU significantly alters the daily operations of the unit, leading to notable structural and organizational modifications.
The contributions of this paper are as follows:
This section introduces key components that may be utilized in the development and execution of adaptable visitation programs or policies within an ICU setting. These elements can serve as valuable resources for care teams when deliberating the inclusion of family members at the patient's bedside, thereby creating a novel arena for social engagement and interaction.
The study suggests implementing an initial systematic approach to family and support strategies to help the team overcome barriers that may arise from the adoption of a flexible or open visitation policy.
