In late 2019, a novel coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, leading to the emergence of the disease known as COVID-19. As cases surged, an atypical symptom for this virus began to surface: anosmia and dysgeusia, with an uncertain etiology that could potentially be linked to autonomic dysfunction, particularly affecting the baroreflex. It is plausible that subclinical manifestations of baroreflex involvement may be occurring in these cases. The baroreflex regulation is governed by the autonomic nervous system, maintaining a delicate balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. This study aims to investigate potential alterations in this mechanism among COVID-19 patients through the use of ECG Holter monitoring.
Materials and Methods: The study design adopted was cross-sectional, observational, descriptive, and prospective in nature, with sampling conducted through non-probabilistic convenience methods. Inclusion criteria involved patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who were admitted to the Internal Medicine Service of JB Iturraspe Hospital in Santa Fe city, Argentina, between May 10 and July 20, 2021. Resting ECG Holter recordings were obtained for a duration of 5 minutes, with the analysis of frequency domain variables carried out using Fourier transform analysis through Kubios software. The data presented encompass frequency measures of Heart Rate Variability (HRV), specifically focusing on low-frequency power (LF), high-frequency power (HF), and normalized units LFnu and HFnu. Exclusion criteria involved patients with a history of diabetes mellitus exceeding 5 years, those on beta-blocker medication, or individuals with a prior history of neck irradiation.
Results from the study of 68 patients revealed that 62% were men and 38% were women, with a mean age of 48.9 ± 13.3 years. The median systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 120 mmHg (95 to 170) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 80 mmHg (60 -110). Heart rate averaged at 76 ± 13 beats per minute, while respiratory rate was 24 (16 to 40). Anosmia was observed in 22% (n = 15) of the patients, and dysgeusia in 19% (n = 13). In terms of frequency domain analysis, LF was recorded at 135.8 ms2 (13.7 - 2861.7) and HF at 89.04 ms2 (4.14-5234.4), with LFnu at 57.57 ± 22.39 and HFnu at 43.18 ± 22.64. The LF / HF ratio was noted at 2.1 ms2 ± 2.09, with 41.2% (n = 28) of patients exhibiting a high LF / HF ratio (> 2).
Discussion: Within the frequency domain analysis, the high frequency (HF) components, primarily associated with parasympathetic function, and low frequency (LF) components, reflecting both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, are key indicators. The balance between these elements, denoted as the LF/HF ratio, signifies the sympatho-vagal equilibrium. Our findings revealed that 41.2% of the patients under study exhibited an elevated LF/HF ratio.
In conclusion, 41.2% of the COVID-19 patients hospitalized exhibited an elevated LF/HF ratio, suggesting a potential disruption in autonomic function.
In late 2019, a previously unidentified coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, exhibiting unique traits and rapidly disseminating worldwide. Given its primarily respiratory manifestations in severe cases and its resemblance to the pathogen responsible for the 2003 pandemic, it was designated as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2), leading to the nomenclature of the associated illness as COVID-19.
In the early stages of the pandemic, there was a rise in reports detailing an atypical presentation associated with this particular virus: anosmia and dysgeusia. While the precise mechanisms underlying the emergence of these symptoms remain unclear, there is a prevailing hypothesis suggesting neurological involvement. Additionally, there have been communications highlighting potential disruptions in the autonomic nervous system, presenting as conditions like postural tachycardia syndrome with dysautonomia (POTS), orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope.
In this context, it is probable that subclinical manifestations of baroreflex involvement occur, a mechanism accountable for 90% of the short-term variability in blood pressure and heart rate. The regulation of the baroreflex is orchestrated by the autonomic nervous system through the equilibrium between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.
If there is a modification in the baroreflex resulting in decreased sensitivity, it may lead to challenges in diagnosing and treating arterial hypertension. Furthermore, if this alteration persists, it could potentially serve as a cardiovascular risk factor of uncertain significance.
Baroreflex assessment can be conducted through time domain analysis, including metrics such as mean RR intervals, standard deviation, and RMSSD. Additionally, the frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability, employing the Fourier transform, holds significant importance. This method allows for the calculation of LH and HF indices, the ratio of which reflects the balance between sympathetic and vagal activity.
The assessment of the LF/HF (low frequency/high frequency) ratio in spectral analysis of heart rate variability serves as a straightforward approach to evaluating the baroreflex mechanism. This study aims to investigate potential alterations in this mechanism among COVID-19 patients through Holter recording analysis.
The study employed a cross-sectional, observational, descriptive, prospective design with non-probabilistic convenience sampling.
Patients meeting the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria outlined by the Argentine Health Ministry (4) for a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. These individuals were admitted to the Internal Medicine Service at JB Iturraspe Hospital in Santa Fe city, Argentina, during the timeframe spanning from May 10 to July 20, 2021.
Verbal informed consent was obtained to mitigate the risk of exposure to contaminated material from the infected patient, while prior authorization was secured from the hospital's Teaching and Research Committee. Throughout the study, adherence to the principles of good clinical practice was maintained, in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.
An ECG Holter recording was conducted while the subject was at rest for a duration of 5 minutes. The variables in the frequency domain were assessed using Fourier transform analysis via Kubios software (version 3.0.0, free edition) for HRV analysis, developed by the University of Eastern Finland.
The research article presents data on frequency measures of Heart Rate Variability (HRV), specifically focusing on low-frequency power (LF) and high-frequency power (HF) in both milliseconds squared (ms2) and normalized units, as well as the ratio of LF power to HF power (LF:HF). The normalized spectral indices, denoted as LFnu and HFnu, are defined as LFnu = LF / (LF + HF) and HFnu = HF / (LF + HF) respectively.
Patients who had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus for over 5 years, were on beta-blocker medication, or had a history of neck irradiation were excluded from the study.
The results were analyzed using the statistical software IBM® SPSS® (version 23). Normality of continuous variables was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Parametrically distributed quantitative variables were presented as means and standard deviations, while non-parametric variables were described using the median and range. Qualitative variables were represented in percentages.
Reference values from the normal population as reported in the literature were utilized, with a threshold exceeding 2 deemed indicative of an abnormality in the LF/HF ratio.
A total of 68 patients were included in the study, with 62% being men and 38% women. The average age of the participants was 48.9 years with a standard deviation of 13.3 years. The median systolic blood pressure (SBP) was recorded at 120 mmHg, ranging from 95 to 170 mmHg, while the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 80 mmHg, varying between 60 and 110 mmHg. The heart rate averaged at 76 beats per minute with a standard deviation of 13, and the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, ranging from 16 to 40. Anosmia was reported in 22% of the patients (n = 15), while dysgeusia was observed in 19% (n = 13).
The variables analyzed in the frequency domain were as follows: LF at 135.8 ms2 (ranging from 13.7 to 2861.7), HF at 89.04 ms2 (ranging from 4.14 to 5234.4), LFnu at 57.57 ± 22.39, HFnu at 43.18 ± 22.64, and LF/HF ratio at 2.1 ms2 ± 2.09. Among the patients, 41.2% (n = 28) exhibited a high LF/HF ratio (> 2).
The proposed theory to elucidate the emergence of neurological symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infection posits that the virus triggers an internalization of angiotensin II receptors within the solitary tract nucleus, consequently disrupting the baroreflex response.
The high and low frequency components, referred to as HF (High Frequency) and LF (Low Frequency) respectively, are indicative of parasympathetic and both sympathetic and parasympathetic functions. These components can be derived through frequency domain analysis. The interplay between HF and LF signifies the sympatho-vagal balance, quantified as the LF/HF ratio.
In our study, it was noted that 41.2% of the patients examined exhibited an elevated LF/HF ratio, leading us to infer that this anomaly stemmed from an autonomic function imbalance attributed to heightened sympathetic activity. The clinical implications of this discovery on the disease progression remain uncertain at this juncture.
No previous publications have demonstrated the presence of dysautonomia through an objective measurement, such as that obtained by Holter, in this particular type of patient.
Limitations of this study encompass the absence of prior knowledge regarding LF/HF values before infection and the lack of control groups. Furthermore, there has been no follow-up conducted to ascertain the persistence of this alteration over an extended period.
