Abstract
The outbreak of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported for the first time in Wuhan, China in late December 2019 have 
rapidly spread to other countries and it was declared on January 30, 2020 as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) 
by the World Health Organization. Before the first COVID-19 cases were reported in Brazil, several measures have been implemented 
including the adjustment of legal framework to carry out isolation and quarantine. As the cases increased significantly, new measures, 
mainly to reduce mortality and severe cases, have also been implemented. Rapid and robust preparedness actions have been undertaken 
in Brazil while first cases have not yet been identified in Latin-American. The outcome of this early preparation should be analyzed in 
future studies.

INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS AND 
EMERGENCY HEALTH OPERATIONS CENTERS
In the last two decades, the world has undergone important changes 
that impact health and the economy at individual and global levels, 
and these reflect directly on the public health of populations of many 
countries1. The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with first 
cases reported in Wuhan, China in late December, 2019, quickly spread 
to other countries2 and was declared by the World Health Organization 
(WHO)  as of January 30, 2020, an Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern (PHEIC)3,4. PHEIC are extraordinary events 
which pose a large scale public health risk with international spreading 
and which, in general, require a coordinated response5. In Brazil, 
national public health emergencies (NPHE) are defined according to 
Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) as events that represent risks to 
public health and that occur in situations of outbreaks or epidemics 
(as a result of unexpected agents or  reintroduction of eradicated 
diseases or with high severity), disasters and of lack of assistance to 
the population, which go beyond the response capacity of the state6.  
In our current pandemic scenario, which represents an important 
NPHE, the promotion of actions and quick responses is necessary 
and Emergency Health Operations Centers (EHOCs) play an 
important role. When necessary, EHOCs are activated and work 
continuously in an organizational structure by monitoring and 
analyzing epidemiological data and field reports from various 
sources in order to support the decision making of managers and 
technicians in the definition of appropriate and timely strategies 
and actions for coping with such public health emergencies7,8. 
In Brazil, the health surveillance secretariat (HSS) is responsible 
2/6
Croda J et al. - COVID-19 in Brazil
for activating EHOCs, based on the Event Monitoring Committee’s 
(EMC) recommendations, as well as for classifying the emergency 
level (zero, I, II, III)9.
HOW DID BRAZIL RESPOND TO COVID-19?
In the context of COVID-19 in China and the provisions of 
decree MH No. 2,952 of December 14, 201110, NPHE was declared 
in Brazil on January 10, 2020. On January 22 the Brazil’s MoH, via 
Decree No.18811 activated the EHOC-nCoV operations center, with 
alert level 1 (no suspected cases at the time), which was coordinated 
by HSS.  The fundamental objective of EHOC-nCoV was to respond 
to the SARS-CoV-2 emergency at the national level by organizing 
a coordinated action within the scope of UHS. In addition,  EHOC-
nCoV would advise states and municipalities secretaries of health and 
the federal government, public and private health services, agencies 
and companies regarding contingency plans and response measures 
that should be proportional and restricted to the current risks12. 
On January 27 the first suspected coronavirus case in Brazil was 
identified, leading to raising the alert level to level 2 (imminent risk).
On January 28, the first EHOC-nCoV Epidemiologic Bulletin13, 
epidemiological surveillance Guideline and National Contingency 
Plan (NCP) for the COVID-19 with alert levels were published13. 
Epidemiological surveillance aims at guiding the National Health 
Surveillance System and the UHS service network to act in the 
identification of COVID-19 cases in order to mitigate the risks 
of sustained transmission and the appearance of severe cases and 
subsequent deaths12. The epidemiological surveillance and NCP 
are based on structured documents and evidence accumulated by 
other countries including China, in epidemics such as SARS-CoV, 
MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which had never occurred before 
in Brazil. However, Brazil had previous experience with other 
respiratory virus pandemics, such as H1N1, which started in 2009 
and was responsible for 46,355 cases registered in the country until 
March 2010. In addition, NCP actions are based on national and 
state plans for surveillance and clinical management of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS) and flu syndrome (FS)13. 
All states in the country were encouraged to adapt the NCP 
based on their infrastructure and regional characteristics, as well as 
to provide for actions to combat the disease in their territories. It is 
important to highlight that the NCP is based on the information made 
available by WHO (based on compilation of information received 
by different countries) and on scientific evidence, and therefore 
the NCP procedures undergo necessary changes14. Risks should 
be assessed and reviewed periodically, with a view to developing 
scientific knowledge and adoption of locally appropriate measures13.
On January 30, COVID-19 was declared a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO. The 
Brazilian Interministerial Executive Group on Public Health 
(IEG-PHE) was reactivated through Decree No. 10,211 (January 
30). Its main attributions are i) to propose, monitor and articulate 
preparedness and coping measures, allocation of budgetary-
financial resources to implement the necessary measures; ii) to 
establish guidelines for the definition of local criteria for monitoring 
the implementation of emergency measures and iii) to prepare 
reports on the public health emergency situation and diseminate 
to ministers15.
Brazil declared COVID-19 a public health emergency (PHE) 
on February 3, and on February 6 the MoH approved the law 
No.13,97916 (Quarantine Law), with measures aimed at protecting 
the community and dealing with PHE resulting from SARS-
CoV-2, including isolation; quarantine; compulsory notification, 
epidemiological study or investigation; exhumation, necropsy, 
cremation and corpse management; exceptional and temporary 
restriction on entering and leaving the country; requisition of 
goods and services from natural and legal persons, in which 
case the subsequent payment of fair compensation will be 
guaranteed. However, these measures can only be determined 
based on scientific evidence and analysis of strategic health 
information.
The first case of coronavirus in Brazil and in South America17 
was registered on February 26, 2020 in São Paulo. It was a 61-year-
old man with a history of travel to the Lombardy region, Italy, which 
had reported a high number of cases and deaths. The number of cases 
has increased since in the territory, and several measures have now 
been taken. On March 13, MoH and professionals from the state 
health departments across the country announced recommendations 
to prevent the spread of the disease, as previously determined in 
Decree No. 356 of  March 11th18,19. MoH recognized that community 
transmission was occurring across the country on March 20, as a 
strategic measure to ensure a collective effort by all Brazilians in 
order to reduce the virus transmission20. Implementation of nom-
pharmacological measures, including physical distancing and 
quarantine required the determination of community transmission 
countrywide by the MoH. Quarantine has been controversial and 
must be evaluated very carefully, taking into account the COVID-19 
epidemic progression in China, Italy and Spain.
Currently, the disease has shown an increase in the number of 
cases, and as of March 31, 5,933 reported cases and 206 deaths 
had been registered in Brazil. São Paulo has been the most affected 
state, with 136 deaths and 2,339 confirmed cases, followed by Rio 
de Janeiro with 23 deaths and 708 confirmed cases. On March 27, 
MoH made official (Note nº 5/2020-DAF/SCTIE/MS21) the use of 
chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in patients with 
severe forms of COVID-1922–27. The proposed protocol consists of 
treatment over five days, however these two drugs should be used 
as a complementary measure to all other types of treatment support 
used, such as mechanical ventilation and symptomatic medications, 
as well as others provided in the treatment manual21. Two national 
clinical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the CQ use as 
treatment for COVID-19 infection were approved by the national 
research ethics committee (CONEP)28. 
PROGRESSION OF CASES IN BRAZIL 
AND MISTAKES ALONG THE WAY
The number of cases in Brazil is growing rapidly. Several 
measures had been taken by MoH even before the first case was 
registered in the country, as previously described and shown in 
Figure 1. It is important to note, however, that on January 27 WHO 
admitted a significant error associated with COVID-19 global risk 
assessment, which until three days earlier was considered moderate, 
however the disease was considered of very high risk in China, while 
at high regional and global levels. This may have hindered measures

to implement specific international interventions in a timely manner 
and may have resulted in an increase in the number of cases in China 
and the spread of the disease to other countries, including Brazil.
In this sense, Brazil has been following WHO recommendations 
and recent scientific evidence generated by China and Italy29. 
However, it is important to note that Brazil has distinct and peculiar 
characteristics, including population structure. It is a country 
whose population consists mainly of young adults. In addition, 
comorbidities and co-infections, such as diabetes, hypertension, 
HIV, tuberculosis, obesity, among others, are prevalent. Thus, 
it is potentially important that the younger population with 
comorbidities/co-infections are not neglected. 
In addition, it is important to note that fall is coming in the next 
days in the southern half of Brazil. During fall and winter seasons, the 
incidence of respiratory diseases increase (cold, flu, asthma attacks, 
sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchitis) and currently COVID-19 should 
be added to this list. Drier air and lower temperature may lead to 
an increase in the risk of coronavirus transmission and number of 
COVID-19 cases. Because symptoms of flu and SARS-CoV-2 are 
similar, MoH anticipated the usual free vaccination for influenza, 
for major risk groups, in order to help health professionals rule out 
influenza in patient screening and improve diagnosis of the new virus.
BRAZIL’S EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER 
HEALTH EMERGENCIES
Brazil has already experienced other public health emergencies 
with diseases including polio, smallpox, cholera, H1N1 (influenza 
A), avian influenza, yellow fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome, 
and zika. Many of these emergencies marked the history of Brazilian 
public health policy and led to the implementation of control and 
eradication measures, such as for smallpox, which was eradicated 
in 1977. Among the most recent public health emergency diseases, 
the H1N1 epidemic in 2009 and the Zika epidemic in 2015-2016 are 
noteworthy. Both constitute an important legacy of how to deal with 
epidemics; the latter (Zika) demonstrated Brazil’s scientific leadership 
due to the association of infection with cases of microcephaly30.
The H1N1 pandemic helped UHS improve its capacity to 
respond to emergencies due to respiratory syndromes (RS), an 
ongoing process since 2005. Currently, UHS has plans, protocols, 
procedures and guides for identifying, monitoring and responding 
to emergencies due to RS. Many recommended procedures, mainly 
those included in the influenza chapter of the Epidemiological 
Surveillance Guide, are applied in the context of suspected cases 
of Coronavirus12,14. However, the initial recommendation is to 
discard the most common respiratory diseases and adopt the flu 
treatment protocol in a timely manner to avoid serious cases and 
deaths from known respiratory diseases, when indicated. The 
UHS has the capacity and experience to respond to RS-related 
emergencies and currently, with the new Coronavirus protocol, it 
has been possible to adjust some recommendations to the specific 
context of the COVID-19 emergency. These adjustments are based 
on the information made available by WHO on a daily basis and 
every procedure is susceptible to the necessary changes and its 
adequacy may be fundamental to deal with the next pandemics 
that are likely to occur14.
In addition to that, the country counts on a decentralized network 
of central laboratories in each state (LACENs), with existing 
capacity, and a public manufacture chain of laboratory supplies for 
diagnostic RT-PCR, e.g., in Fiocruz (Biomanguinhos). In case of 
evidence of CQ efficacy, Farmanguinhos and LQFEx are already 
public producers of CQ diphosphate for malaria treatment.
During the Zika epidemic, Brazil led the discovery and reported 
the relationship between the Zika virus and the increase in cases of 
microcephaly. The first reports of increased cases of microcephaly 
occurred in the state of Pernambuco, in October, 201530,32. As soon 
as it was discovered by the state health departments, the MoH 
sent technical teams to help with the investigations and notified 
WHO of the situation30. Once the association between Zika and 
microcephaly in Brazil, where it occurred first, was confirmed, 
the first version of the plan to fight Aedes spp. and microcephaly 
was published in December 201531,32. WHO recognized Brazil’s 
main role in this critical finding. In May 2017, a risk assessment 
concluded that Brazil no longer met the criteria for defining an 
emergency, according to WHO parameters.
COVID-19: THE WAY FORWARD
Although Brazil is attempting to implement measures to reduce 
the number of cases, mainly focused on physical distancing, an 
increase in COVID-19 cases is expected in the coming months. 
Several mathematical models have shown that the virus will be 
potentially circulating until mid-September, with an important 
peak of cases in April and May. Thus, there are concerns regarding 
availability of intensive care units (ICUs) and mechanical ventilators 
necessary for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 as well as the 
availability of specific diagnostic tests, particularly real time RT-
PCR, for the early detection of COVID -19 and the prevention of 
subsequent transmission. RT-PCR increased capacity and serologic/
RDT tests may become available soon, in part due to the private and 
public/academia collaboration/contribution (e.g., Farmanguinhos, 
Vale). Virus sequencing has been performed by sentinel sites and 
molecular biologists interact intensely now.
Regarding cultural differences, the use of masks is common and 
accepted in Asia, none existing in Latin America. This means both 
culturally accepted and daily routine, but also people can buy them 
easily there, as well as bowing more there, much more physical 
contact in our cultures. These differences might be decisive in the 
evolution of the pandemics, and also need to be addressed in social 
sciences protocols.
Physical distancing is a measure that should be suggested early 
in order to flatten the epidemiological curve with the least possible 
economic impact. By the end of March 2020, Brazilian authorities 
still maintain the recommendation of physical distancing and have 
not implemented a lockdown through the use of security forces 
to prevent mass movement of people. If physical distancing is 
effective by limiting the public’s access to essential services only, 
the economic impact can be mitigated while the current COVID-19 
epidemic is controlled.
