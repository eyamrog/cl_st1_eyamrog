ABSTRACT | To identify and classify available information 
regarding COVID-19 and eye care according to the level of 
evidence, within four main topics of interest: evidence of 
the virus in tears and the ocular surface, infection via the 
conjunctival route, ocular manifestations, and best practice 
recommendations. A structured review was conducted in 
PubMed, ScienceDirect, LILACS, SciELO, the Cochrane Library 
and Google Scholar on COVID-19 and ophthalmology. The 
Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine 2011 Levels of 
Evidence worksheet was used for quality assessments. 1018 
items were identified in the search; 26 records were included 
in the qualitative synthesis, which encompassed 6 literature 
reviews, 10 case series or cross-sectional studies, 4 case 
reports, and 6 intervention descriptions. Seventeen out of 26 
records (65%) were categorized as level 5 within the Oxford 
CBME methodology grading system, the rest were level 4.  
The evidence generated on COVID-19 and ophthalmology 
to date is limited, although this is understandable given the 
circumstances. Both the possible presence of viral particles 
in tears and conjunctiva, and the potential for conjunctival 
transmission remain controversial. Ocular manifestations are 
not frequent and could resemble viral infection of the ocular 
surface. Most recommendations are based on the strategies 
implemented by Asian countries during previous coronavirus 
outbreaks. There is a need for substantive studies evaluating 
these strategies in the setting of SARS-CoV-2. In the meantime, 
plans for applying these measures must be implemented with 
caution, taking into account the context of each individual 
country, and undergo regular evaluation.

RESUMO | Identificar e classificar as informações disponíveis 
sobre o COVID-19 e o tratamento oftalmológico de acordo com o 
nível de evidência, dentro de quatro tópicos principais de interesse: 
evidência do vírus nas lágrimas e na superfície ocular, infecção 
pela via conjuntival, manifestações oculares e recomendações 
de melhores práticas. Foi realizada uma revisão estruturada no 
PubMed, ScienceDirect, LILACS, SciELO, Biblioteca Cochrane 
e Google Scholar no COVID-19 e oftalmologia. A planilha de 
Níveis de Evidência 2011 do Oxford Centre for Evidence Based 
Medicine 2011 foi usada para avaliações de qualidade. Mil e 
dezoito itens foram identificados na busca; Foram incluídos 26 
registros na síntese qualitativa, que incluiu 6 revisões de literatura, 
10 séries de casos ou estudos transversais, 4 relatos de casos e 
6 descrições de intervenções. Dezessete dos 26 registros (65%) 
foram classificados como nível 5 no sistema de classificação da 
metodologia Oxford CBME, o restante foi no nível 4. As evidências 
geradas no COVID-19 e na oftalmologia até o momento são 
limitadas, embora isso seja compreensível dadas as circunstân-
cias. Tanto a possível presença de partículas virais em lágrimas 
e conjuntiva quanto o potencial de transmissão conjuntival 
permanecem controversos. As manifestações oculares não são 
frequentes e podem se assemelhar a infecção viral da superfície

ocular. A maioria das recomendações baseia-se nas estratégias 
implementadas pelos países asiáticos durante surtos anteriores  
de coronavírus. Há necessidade de estudos aprofundados 
avaliando essas estratégias no cenário da SARS-CoV-2. Enquanto 
isso, os planos para a aplicação dessas medidas devem ser im-
plementados com cautela, levando em consideração o contexto 
de cada país e submetidos a auditorias periódicas.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by the 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus type 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), previously named 2019 novel coronavi-
rus (2019-nCoV)(1). The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic 
has been linked to ophthalmology since its beginnings. 
On December 30, 2019, Dr. Li Wenliang, a Chinese 
ophthalmologist, warned his colleagues through the 
social network WeChat about a SARS-like outbreak in 
Wuhan and its possible link to a local market(2). On 
January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
confirmed the outbreak as a public health emergency of 
international interest(3), and on March 11, 2020 it was 
declared a pandemic(4).
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to cause infections in 
humans and other mammals(5,6), they gained public atten-
tion during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 
outbreak in East Asia in 2003 and the spread of Midd-
le Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012(5,7). 
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense, enve-
loped RNA virus(1). The main method of transmission is 
human-to-human through direct contact and droplets; 
transmission from asymptomatic carriers has also been 
reported(8). Viral stability in aerosols on different surfa-
ces has been demonstrated(9), supporting evidence on 
indirect viral acquisition from fomites(10), through the 
mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes(11). At 
present, conjunctival transmission of CoVs has not been 
confirmed and remains controversial.
Out of the seven types of human coronaviruses 
(HCoV), HCoV-NL63 is the only one that has been con-
firmed to produce ocular disease, specifically conjunc-
tivitis(12), although the pathogenic mechanism of ocular 
infection has not been elucidated(2). Ocular symptoms 
from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which produce simi-
lar respiratory manifestations to SARS-CoV-2, have 
not been reported(2). On the other hand, detection of  
SARS-CoV RNA in tears was confirmed in three out  
of 36 patients with SARS during the 2003 outbreak; fur-
ther studies failed to confirm these results(13,14).
Reports on SARS-CoV-2 conjunctival transmission, 
viral shedding through tears, and ocular manifestations 
in COVID-19 patients have emerged(15-17). As the current 
pandemic progresses, so does the need for reliable in-
formation to help generate evidence-based recommen-
dations on best practices. Incentives to rapidly produce 
scientific reports and positive results lead to the risk of 
disseminating poorly supported evidence and overloa-
ding the public with uncertain or even false informa-
tion(18,19). In this review we aim to identify the available 
information regarding COVID-19 and eye care and to 
classify it according to four main topics of interest: 
evidence of the virus in tears and the ocular surface, in-
fection via the conjunctival route, ocular manifestations, 
and best practice recommendations.
METHODS
Search strategy and searching other sources
A search strategy was developed using MeSH terms 
and free-text terms in the following databases: PubMed, 
ScienceDirect, LILACS, Scielo and the Cochrane Library. 
A verification search was performed on Google Scholar 
to identify articles on archival services such as bioRxiv, 
medRxiv and others. 
The search strategy was designed to identify stu-
dies providing data on issues related to COVID-19 and 
ophthalmology. The final search was conducted on April 
21. Table 1 lists the keywords included in the search 
strategy, which were as follows: (“ophthal*” OR “ocular” 
OR “vision” OR “visual” OR “eye” OR “conjunctiv*” OR 
“tear”) AND (“covid-19” OR “covid19” OR “2019-nCoV” 
OR “coronavirus” OR “coronavirus19” OR “coronavi-
rus-19” OR “SARS-Cov-2” OR “severe acute respiratory 
syndrome 2” OR “SARS2”). Finally, we searched the 
reference lists of the identified screened publications.

Study selection and data extraction
Results were limited to publications from 2020, as 
the report from Chinese authorities to the WHO was 
filed on December 31, 2019. No language restrictions 
were used, and all publication types were retrieved. 
Articles in languages other than English, Spanish, Portu-
guese and French were translated using three different 
online platforms: Google Translator®, DocTranslator® 
and DeepL®; all included articles had at least an abstract 
available in English. Duplicates were excluded. 
Two reviewers independently extracted data using 
a pre‐defined template (Microsoft® Excel spreadsheet). 
Disagreements were resolved through discussion or by 
a third reviewer. All articles that required an online 
platform translation were assessed by three reviewers.
Data synthesis
Previous validated methods were selected to assess 
the appropriateness of the publications: CARE(20) gui-
delines checklists for case reports and case series, and 
STROBE(21) checklists for observational studies. A nar-
rative approach was used to synthesize the extracted 
data. The Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine 
(OCEBM) 2011 Levels of Evidence worksheet was used 
for quality assessments.22 The risk-of-bias assessment 
used a qualitative approach, taking into consideration 
the study design, limitations in the methodology and  
the rigor of execution.
During the selection phase, it was noted that the 
identified articles corresponded to a limited number of 
authors. A reference list was created to determine the 
number of citations for each author when reporting on 
this topic.
Ethics approval was not required, as the review 
involved publicly available data. The report was con-
ducted in accordance with the requirements of the Pre-
ferred Information Elements for Systematic Testing and  
Me­ta-Analyses (PRISMA)(23).
RESULTS
Search results
A total of 1018 records were retrieved from data-
bases and ten others were found through referencing. 
After screening by title and/or abstract, 918 records 
were excluded. Duplicates and grey literature were 
removed, leaving 80 records which met the eligibility 
criteria. Correspondence and editorials accounted for 
43 records (54%) which were reassessed and excluded. 
A full text assessment for eligibility was carried out for 
the remaining documents. Further analysis led to the 
exclusion of three publications which were deemed 
opinion pieces, four due to incoherent translation; and 
three others, which focused on topics outside the scope 
of this review. One case report was excluded as it did not 
fulfill the CARE checklist guidelines. Finally, 26 records 
were included in the qualitative synthesis: 6 literature 
reviews, 10 case series or cross-sectional studies, 4 case 
reports, and 6 intervention descriptions (miscellaneous) 
(Figure 1). 
Included studies 
The included studies are presented in tabular form 
in Table 2. Additional information is provided regarding 
the author, journal, type of study, main question and 
other comments. Seventeen out of 26 records (65%) 
were categorized as level 5 within the Oxford CBME 
methodology grading system, the rest were level 4. 
The six reviews focused on different subjects: 1) 
ocular involvement of coronaviruses in humans and 
animals(6), 2) variations of ocular manifestations(24), 3) 
preventive strategies in hospital-based ophthalmology 
departments(25), 4) recommendations for contact lens 
practices(26), 5) recommendations for eye care facili-
ties(27), and 6) evidence of ocular manifestations and PCR 
positivity in COVID-19 patients(28). The ten case-series 
or cross-sectional studies reported findings regarding

ocular manifestations; six reported on conjunctival and 
tear samples tested for viral material. Nine studies were 
carried out in China, and one in Singapore. Four case 
reports provide detailed descriptions of ocular manifes-
tations in COVID-19 patients. The six intervention des-
criptions present recommendations for ophthalmology 
departments and healthcare workers (HCW) to decrease 
the risk of transmission. Three of these were extracted 
from Chinese literature and include recommendations 
by the Society of Public Health Ophthalmology, Chinese 
Preventive Medicine Association. The other three papers 
were from Indian, Iranian and Italian authorship. The 
publication from India included recommendations  
from the All India Ophthalmological Society.
Risk of bias
Due to the purely descriptive nature of the publi-
cations and their limited internal validity, they pose a 
high risk of bias. Qualitative assessment determined 
the presence of various confounders and covariates that 
may have influenced the results, and consequently the 
final analyses.
Primary outcomes
Evidence of viral particles on the ocular surface
Eight case series or cross-sectional studies and four 
case reports included testing for the presence of viral 
particles or genetic material from SARS-CoV-2. Ten 
studies collected samples using conjunctival swabs and 
performed reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reac-
tion (RT‐PCR) assay for the detection of viral RNA. One 
cross-sectional study used tears collected via Schirmer 
strip and performed viral isolation through Vero-6 cell 
inoculation. Another study used conjunctival swabs 
for RT-PCR and Vero-6 cell inoculation. The four case 
reports observed positive results for RT-PCR of con-
junctival swabs; one of them reports on a patient with 
repetitive positive conjunctival swabs from day 3 to 21 
with samples taken almost daily. The results are summa-
rized in table 3.
In all these studies, the percentage of patients with 
evidence of viral particles in tears or conjunctiva re-
mained low, ranging from 0 to 7.14%. Across studies, 
there were variations in testing procedures and the type 
of patients tested. The days at which the samples were 
taken also show significant variation. The earliest timing 
was reported as early as day 2 after the initial onset of 
symptoms. Four studies do not specify the timing of the 
samples. Case reports included a total of five cases with 
ocular manifestations; all of these tested positive via 
conjunctival RT-PCR. 
In their review, Sarma et al.(28) conducted a meta-ana­
lysis of pooled patients across 5 studies (four items in­
cluded in the current revision; the other one was discar-
ded during the screening process). They concluded that 
the proportion of conjunctival/tear sample that were 
positive for the virus was 1.95% (95% C.I. 0.74 to 4.11). 
The literature review by Seah et al. comments on the 
similarities of SARS-CoV-2 to other CoVs with the possi-
bility of viral shedding in conjunctiva and tears(6). Yu A 
et al. mention the proven evidence of aerosol formation 
through air puff tonometry and the possibility of trans-
mission through contact with conjunctiva(24). They both 
conclude that the evidence about the virus in tears and 
on the ocular surface remains controversial. 
The conjunctiva as an infection route
A few anecdotal reports describe non-specific ocular 
symptoms as the first manifestation of COVID-19. We 
found one case report of keratoconjunctivitis as the 
initial presentation. Additionally, Li et al. describe two 
cases of HCW who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 
nasopharyngeal (NP) and conjunctival swabs, despite 
having worn appropriate personal protective equipment 
(PPE) except for eye protection(40). The first case involved 
an anesthesiologist who performed an intubation pro­
cedure on a COVID-19 patient without ocular protection. 
She later presented with red eye and viscous conjunctival 
discharge; after three days she developed respiratory 
symptoms and was diagnosed with COVID-19. The se-
cond case was a nurse with respiratory symptoms and 
pruritus as well as conjunctival congestion. Both reports 
support the theory of the conjunctival mucosa acting  
as an entrance route for the virus. 
Ocular manifestations 
The ten case series or cross-sectional studies repor­
ted ocular manifestations, particularly conjunctival con­
gestion. Four case reports presented with signs compa-
tible with follicular conjunctivitis and one as unilateral 
keratoconjunctivitis. The timing of onset of ocular mani-
festations varies across the studies, with these symptoms 
appearing to be most prominent in the early stages of 
the disease. Most manifestations are bilateral and seem 
to cause little to no discomfort. Only the study by Chen 
et al. focuses on patient-reported ocular symptoms(33),

while the remaining case series focus on observable 
signs. The results are summarized in table 4. 
Overall, ocular manifestations are not common in 
COVID-19 patients. Six of the case series show less than 
5% of patients with any sign, while two report no ma-
nifestations. Wu et al. report on hospitalized patients 
with moderate to severe pneumonia; their findings 
show 31.6% of patients with ocular signs. They also 
report that according to univariate analysis, patients with 
ocular symptoms were more likely to suffer more severe 
presentations of the disease.
The timing of ocular manifestations during the evolu-
tion of COVID-19 is ill-defined. Six studies report ocular 
findings in eight patients before day 5 of the disease. 
A case report describes conjunctival congestion more 
prominently from day 8(38). Another study reports on a 
patient who showed ocular symptoms from day 8 to 12, 
characterized by congestion and tearing(33). An additio-
nal series describes manifestations averaging from 
day 7 until day 25(35). Two studies do not specify the 
onset of manifestations, while the remaining report 
no ocular findings. 
Sarma et al also conducted a meta-analysis of poo-
led patients across 6 studies (5 items included in the 
current revision; the other one was discarded during 
the screening process) to study ocular manifes­tations. 
They concluded the proportion of patients presenting 
with conjunctivitis/red eye was 3.17% (95% C.I. 1.16 to 
6.13)(28).

Recommendations to prevent propagation  
of the virus
Nine articles describe measures that can be imple-
mented in ophthalmology departments and practices in 
order to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three are lite­
rature reviews(25-27) and six are intervention protocols 
with low levels of evidence(41-46).
Table 5. Current recommendations on the management of eye care services during the COVID-19 epidemic
Hierarchy
Recommendations
Administrative Control
- Patient workflow management, including rescheduling and reducing non-urgent appointments(25-27,41,42,44-46)

- Adapting waiting rooms to maintain two-meter space between patients(25,27,41,45,46) 
- Specific recommendations are made for each subspecialty, according to three levels of care: emergency, urgent and routine(45)
- Reduce admission time and avoid paperwork exchange(45,46)
- Requesting specific informed consent to authorize care in the context of the pandemic(45,46)
- In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, ophthalmological care should be provided in a multi-specialty hospital(27,45,46) 
- Patients with conjunctivitis to be evaluated in an isolated office with maximum protection(45)
- Patients with conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis should be asked about risk factors for COVID-19(25)

- Perform chest x-rays on all patients requiring surgery(45)
Environmental control
- Use of ventilation and HEPA units(27,41,45)
- No-AC policy if possible(45)
- Protective shields on slit lamps(25,27,41,43,45,46) 
- Avoid talking during the evaluation(27,45,46) 
- Disinfection guidelines for office spaces and equipment(25,27,41,43,45,46)
- Ultraviolet light sterilization units can be installed(45)
Use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Universal masking:(41,45,46)  
- Use of surgical masks(25,27,43,46) (in non-suspect patients)
- N95 respirators for health staff: in suspected COVID-19 cases;(41,46) and aerosol-generating procedures(25)
- Eye protection (goggles)(25,27,41,43,45,46)

- Use of long gloves(25,27,45,46)
- The patient should wear gloves during the evaluation(41)
- Hand washing with soap and water and/or alcohol gel(25-27,41,43,45,46) 
- Testing for symptomatic staff members or self-isolation for 7 days(25,27,46)
- Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth(26,43,46)
- Prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine under internal medicine supervision(45)
Throughout the four intervention descriptions by Chi­
nese authors, recommendations are based on general 
strategies built upon a three-level hierarchy system 
employed in mainland China and Hong Kong: adminis­
trative control measures, environmental control mea­
sures and the use of personal protective equipment 
(Table 5).
COVID-19 and the eye: how much do we really know? A best evidence review
258
Arq Bras Oftalmol. 2020;83(3):250-61
The review by Lyndon et al. gives evidence for con-
tact-lens practices, concluding that there is no evidence 
suggesting contact lens wearers who are asymptomatic 
should cease using contact lenses due to an increased 
risk of developing COVID-19. It also states there is no 
evidence suggesting that wearing prescription glasses 
provides protection against SARS-CoV-2(26). 
References in the analyzed literature
Among the screened records, 47% referenced the 
case series by Xia et al.(5) in which 1 of 30 patients 
had positive RT-PCR results in conjunctival secretions 
(1.3%); this was the most cited item. Similarly, 40% 
referenced a letter by Lu et al. stating the hypothesis 
of transmission through the conjunctiva(47). The rest of 
the screened documents were referenced at an average 
rate of 3%.
DISCUSSION
We found that current recommendations regarding 
COVID-19 and ophthalmology are based on levels of 
evidence 4 and 5 according to the Oxford CBME metho-
dology grading system. The amount of research conduc-
ted to date is limited; the nature of the disease and the 
scarcity of cases with ocular involvement pose challen-
ging circumstances for research efforts. As the pandemic 
evolves so will the need for further data to bolster our 
understanding on COVID-19, its implications for eye 
care and the outcomes of the implemented strategies. 
In a small percentage of patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA 
has been isolated in the tear film. In the published li-
terature, positive findings were reported in 0 to 7.14% 
of subjects across different studies; Sarma et al. found 
that the virus was present in 1.95% (95% C.I. 0.74 to 
4.11) of samples(28). Possible explanations for a negati-
ve finding of viral particles on the ocular surface have 
been set forth: sensitivity of the tests; time of sampling 
collection; antimicrobial mechanisms of the conjuncti-
va; collection techniques; and washing of viral particles 
by tearing and passage to the nasopharynx through the 
lacrimal duct(6,48). 
The reviewed publications showed wide heteroge-
neity in their methodology. First, the time of sample 
collection, counted from the onset of any symptom, 
varied on average from 2 to 18 days, and in some studies 
was not even specified. Second, the number of samples 
taken was not consistent across the studies and even 
within them; some, such as case reports, performed only 
one test, and others up to four. Lastly, the methods for 
sample collection and processing included conjunctival 
swabbing and RT-PCR in the majority of the studies, 
while one collected tears using Schirmer strips and two 
also performed viral isolation through cell culture. The-
refore, pooling of the data was not deemed appropriate. 
Until further evidence is available, we cannot rule out 
the possibility of viral particles being present in tears 
and conjunctiva; therefore, precautionary measures 
should be insisted upon.
Possible conjunctival transmission is mainly based 
on anecdotal reports of HCW who did not use eye 
protection(40), early conjunctival congestion symptoms 
reported in some patients, or the presence of viral RNA 
in the tear film(15,16). Several hypothetical transmission 
me­chanisms have been proposed. First, the virus adhe-
res to ACE2 receptors found on the conjunctival and 
corneal epithelia(49,50). Second, the nasolacrimal duct 
would serve as a pathway from the conjunctiva to the 
upper respiratory tract where the virus can infect the 
host(51). However, some authors believe that this is not 
enough evidence to confirm the conjunctival route 
of transmission and suggest the following counter-
-arguments: a) the presence of the ACE2 protein in the 
conjunctiva is low compared to the lung; b) lactoferrin 
and secretory IgA present in the tears could eliminate 
the virus; and c) the presence of the virus in tears could 
be explained by fomites transmitted to the conjunctiva 
via splashed droplets or by direct contact with a con-
taminated hand(51). Qiao et al. report that the overall 
incidence of COVID-19 among eye professionals across 
10 hospitals was 2.52% (95% CI: 1.68-3.63%); the 
incidence of the disease was similar in ophthalmolo-
gists as that of general practitioners(52). Although there 
is currently no confirmed conjunctival transmission  
route, the authors agree with the WHO and other orga-
nizations´ recommendations that PPE must include eye 
protection such as goggles or face shields(2,24).
A wide range of non-specific ocular manifestations 
has been reported for COVID-19; at this time, a charac-
teristic presentation has not been clearly determined. 
The most common ocular manifestations were conjunc-
tival hyperemia and watery discharge. This presentation 
varies, as can be observed with the report of Cheema et 
al. on a patient presenting with keratoconjunctivitis(39). 
The methodology of the reports also varies widely, as can 
be seen in the approaches taken by two of the studies. 
Wu et al. examined hospitalized COVID-19 patients who 
were more severely ill, including intubated patients, fin-
Olivares-de Emparan JP, et al.

Arq Bras Oftalmol. 2020;83(3):250-61
ding that patients with ocular manifestations presented 
more severe systemic disease or abnormal findings on 
blood tests(16). Chen et al. obtained data via telephone, 
face-to-face surveys, or a smartphone application(33). If 
statistical measures to overcome the underlying studies 
limitations and the appropriateness of a pooled analysis 
are accepted, then Sarma et al. report that conjunc­
tivitis/red eye is featured in 3.17% (95%CI 1.16 to 6.13) 
of patients(28). The normal prevalence of dry eye and  
allergic conjunctivitis could explain some of the repor-
ted ocular symptoms; other explanations may be related 
to poor hygiene or face mask misuse. Overall, severe eye 
manifestations have not been reported, and more speci-
fic observations will be needed to establish a particular 
set of findings.
Because of a lack of interventional studies, recommen­
dations in current publications are based on lower-level 
evidence. Most derive from the experience gained and 
the general strategies implemented during the SARS  
outbreak in 2002-2004(41,53). Administrative, environ-
mental and PPE measures should be implemented, and 
attention should be given to protecting both HCW and 
patients. There is a need for studies that test or certify 
the effectiveness of these intervention measures during 
the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; however, erring on 
the side of safety is currently necessary. As better evi-
dence continues to accumulate, it will be important to 
update these measures and adapt to a rapidly evolving 
scenario.
It was of particular interest to the authors that a con­
siderable proportion of the analyzed literature referen-
ced an anecdotal report about a Chinese respiratory 
expert who contracted COVID-19 despite having worn 
appropriate PPE except eye protection(2,47,54). This report 
was cited in 40% of the screened publications and might 
have been the initial source for many of the recom-
mendations on ocular protection(47). This phenomenon 
illustrates how quickly information with low levels of 
evidence can be widely disseminated. 
This is the first review on the level of evidence for 
ophthalmology recommendations and COVID-19 con-
ducted to date. It includes an independent full text re-
view performed by five reviewers. This study was limited 
to SARS-CoV-2; therefore, data obtained from previous 
coronavirus epidemics might have been outside of its 
purview. Some of that information may be as important 
as what has been reviewed here; the article by Seah et al. 
on the evidence of ocular involvement in coronavirus 
cases might have served to counteract this shortcoming. 
An additional limitation is the dependence on third-party 
translation for Chinese publications; in order to address 
this limitation, translations were performed on multiple 
platforms, and an additional reviewer was added to 
these papers. Publication bias was approached by sear-
ching through grey literature, editorials, opinion pieces, 
pre-published works, and non-peer-reviewed articles 
alongside traditional publications, without language 
restrictions.
COVID-19 is a novel disease that has caused a 
pandemic unlike any we have experienced in modern 
medicine, not only because of the characteristics of the 
disease, but because of the speed of the spread of in-
formation. The pandemic has only begun to be studied 
properly; therefore, the scarcity of medical appraisals, 
randomized controlled trials and case control studies 
is not surprising. In this structured review we classified 
the available evidence and recommendations relating 
to ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Overall, the level of available evidence for current re-
commendations is rising. 
Currently, there is not sufficient evidence to rule out 
the possibility of viral particles being present in tears 
and conjunctiva. A few hypothetical mechanisms have 
been proposed suggesting that the conjunctiva may act 
as an entry route for SARS-CoV-2. With the varying de-
grees of evidence supporting or refuting it, conjunctival 
transmission remains controversial. Ocular manifesta-
tions are not common in COVID-19 patients; evidence 
suggests that they can resemble a viral infection of the 
ocular surface, with hyperemia and watery discharge 
as the cardinal signs. Most of the literature published 
to date consists of anecdotal reports, editorials, and 
opinion pieces with a high level of cross-referencing. 
The documents that currently contribute to expanding 
the knowledge of ocular involvement in COVID-19 are 
ranked as having low levels of evidence. Most recom-
mendations are based on the strategies implemented in 
Asian countries during previous CoVs outbreaks, many of 
them are likely to prevail and set new standards of pre-
ventive measures in health systems. During the evolution 
of this worldwide phenomenon, reliable information will 
be crucial to elucidate recommendations to mitigate the 
propagation of SARS-CoV-2. As new studies and cases are 
reported, it will be fundamental to evaluate their level of 
evidence to correctly assess the recommendations and 
adapt them to the local circumstances.
