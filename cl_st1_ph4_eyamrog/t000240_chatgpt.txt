The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is part of a group known for causing acute respiratory syndromes that range from mild symptoms to severe conditions, leading to hospitalization, the requirement for mechanical ventilation, and a notable mortality rate [1]. In addition to respiratory issues, individuals may also experience other systemic symptoms, including neurological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal disorders [2].
Little is currently understood about the enduring physical implications of COVID-19. However, individuals requiring mechanical ventilation during the acute phase of the disease may encounter severe repercussions, manifesting as the post-intensive care syndrome, affecting survivors across all age groups. This syndrome is chiefly characterized by prolonged disability, accompanied by muscle dysfunction, fatigue, pain, and dyspnea as secondary manifestations. Another prevalent consequence observed in critically ill patients is ICU-acquired weakness, attributed to factors such as immobility, inadequate glycemic control, and the iatrogenic administration of steroids and neuromuscular blocking agents. Additionally, potential subsequent complications include critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy. Furthermore, less frequent physical aftereffects stemming from prolonged immobility encompass cardiorespiratory deconditioning, postural instability, venous thromboembolism, muscle shortening, contractures (myogenic, neurogenic, arthrogenic), and pressure injuries.
To mitigate the potential long-term consequences of hospitalization, it is imperative for physical therapists to intervene early in the hospital phase, ideally at the onset of the illness, to facilitate a swifter functional recovery and expedite the discharge process. When confronted with cases involving a productive cough due to infection, physiotherapists administer bronchial hygiene techniques to aid in the removal of secretions and alleviate respiratory distress. Conversely, in instances characterized by a dry, non-productive cough, a more common occurrence with COVID-19, respiratory physical therapy may not be deemed necessary. Nevertheless, the scope of physical therapists' responsibilities in the acute phase extends beyond respiratory care, encompassing exercises and mobilizations that effectively mitigate musculoskeletal impairments stemming from prolonged immobilization, underscoring their indispensable role in this critical phase of patient care.
In non-severe cases, coronavirus disease can result in enduring consequences. Given the absence of a definitive treatment for the virus, alongside hygiene practices, social isolation remains the primary recommendation by the World Health Organization to curb its rapid transmission and alleviate strain on healthcare infrastructures. However, this approach could potentially exacerbate another longstanding global health crisis: physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyles.
Although not directly related to COVID-19, social isolation can exacerbate musculoskeletal symptoms like myofascial pain and arthralgias, particularly in individuals with autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Furthermore, social restrictions may heighten symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia due to increased anxiety and stress. For physical therapists specializing in musculoskeletal disorders, navigating these challenges involves addressing two key issues: patients with preexisting physical limitations facing reduced opportunities for exercise and limited access to physical therapy resources, as well as the uncertain long-term outcomes for individuals recovering from COVID-19.
To mitigate such impacts, the professional councils of physical therapy in Brazil have introduced teleconsultation, teleconsulting, and telemonitoring as viable and replicable tools to provide supervision and care for patients requiring clinical intervention. Physical activity has been shown to reduce stress, enhance self-esteem, boost cardiorespiratory capacity, increase muscle strength and coordination, prevent frailty, sarcopenia, and dinapenia, as well as lower the risk of falls and cognitive decline in the elderly. Monitoring exercises, offering postural and functional guidance, and educating patients with chronic conditions on energy conservation principles are crucial strategies to prevent the onset of critical conditions and the manifestation of previously unseen symptoms. Consequently, rehabilitation professionals play a pivotal role during the isolation period by assisting patients in optimizing functional independence, enhancing quality of life, and facilitating their eventual reintegration into the community.
Studies conducted on patients who had contracted SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) caused by the oldest strain of coronavirus revealed persistent reductions in cardiorespiratory capacity, musculoskeletal limitations, and diminished quality of life post-recovery. This underscores the imperative for these individuals to focus on regaining their functional abilities. Even a year after recuperation, these patients exhibited elevated levels of stress, depression, and anxiety. The literature also highlights that other viral illnesses leading to SARS can result in prolonged pulmonary disabilities and psychological challenges persisting up to two years post-discharge. Scholars emphasize the importance of not overlooking the enduring consequences of infectious diseases.
For symptom improvement, it is crucial for physical therapists to closely monitor patients undergoing an intensive physical rehabilitation program, which typically spans from 6 months to 2 years. Upon examining the experiences of individuals affected by COVID-19 and SARS, it becomes evident that therapeutic support may be necessary during chronic phases or even after recovery from the illness [12].
Therefore, a new realm of clinical monitoring for these patients has emerged for physical therapist professionals. The imperative to facilitate the restoration of functionality in COVID-19 recovered patients, alongside the physical rehabilitation of individuals in social isolation, will present escalating demands. This will necessitate physical therapists operating beyond hospital settings to enhance their skills in order to aid in the recovery and improvement of patients who will seek healthcare services post the initial waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
