This study sought to delineate the emotional labor of professional and technological education teachers by examining the emotions and emotion regulation strategies they employ. A total of forty-one teachers participated in eight focus groups to gather data. Data analysis utilized both inductive and deductive categorization methods. The findings revealed that teachers experience a range of emotions in response to specific emotional demands and employ various strategies, either individually or in combination, to regulate them. Notably, cognitive change strategies and situation modification from the procedural model of emotional regulation were frequently cited. The results also indicated differences in regulatory preferences among teachers based on career stage and specialization. Future research could employ diverse methods, such as observation diaries, to explore the dynamic and contextual nature of regulation processes and their outcomes, potentially leading to the development of a contextual scale for teacher emotional regulation. These findings hold implications for teacher training programs, educational management, and future research endeavors.
The field of emotion regulation has experienced significant growth in both theoretical and empirical research over the past two decades (Gross, 2015). Recently, there has been a surge of interest in this area within educational research (Taxer; Gross, 2018; Yin, 2016). Literature reviews focusing on teachers' emotions (e.g., Fried; Mansfield; Dobozy, 2015; Uitto; Jokikokko; Estola, 2015) underscore the increasing concern regarding emotion regulation as a key area of study, given the elevated levels of burnout and negative impacts on teachers' well-being attributed, in part, to emotion dysregulation and emotional demands (e.g., Chang, 2013; Yin et al., 2016). However, research also suggests that effective emotion regulation can improve professional performance (e.g., Taxer; Frenzel, 2015), mental health among teachers, and interactions between teachers and students (e.g., Chang; Davis, 2009; Taxer; Frenzel, 2015; Yin, 2015).
Bahia, Freire, Amaral, and Estrela (2013) along with Taxer and Frenzel (2015) argue that teachers' emotional lives encompass a wide range of genuinely expressed or regulated emotions. However, existing studies have predominantly concentrated on a limited number of self-regulation strategies, particularly cognitive reappraisal and suppression (Taxer; Gross, 2018). Moreover, these investigations are often detached from real-world contexts, failing to capture regulation as it unfolds in the classroom (e.g., Chang, 2013; Uitto et al., 2015), potentially resulting in superficial and premature conclusions (Gross, 2014). Therefore, it is crucial to explore how the context can impact teachers' emotional experiences and their choice of regulatory strategies, as most research tends to focus on an intrapersonal viewpoint, overlooking interpersonal and situational factors (English; Lee; John; Gross, 2017; Fried et al., 2015; Uitto et al., 2015).
Gross (2015) posits that delving into emotional regulation within distinct work environments can offer valuable insights into the process, contextual application, and immediate outcomes, such as emotional consequences, of various regulatory methods. Furthermore, the author advocates for exploring how individual strategies manifest as specific tactics and how their combination forms a chain, diverging from conventional models that view strategies in a detached, solitary, and linear manner. This nuanced approach holds promise for enhancing teacher education programs and interventions by expanding educators' emotional skill sets. The subsequent sections of this paper will delve into the theoretical and conceptual foundations, empirical support, and current inquiries that underpin and justify this research endeavor.
Emotional labor is defined as a type of emotion regulation in response to emotional demands aimed at achieving work-related outcomes (Grandey, 2000; Mallory & Rupp, 2016). Grandey (2000) proposed an integrative model of emotional labor, suggesting that events and emotion rules in the work environment trigger and direct workers' emotional regulation, influencing the choice and implementation of strategies. Emotion regulation involves adjusting various aspects of the emotional experience, including its context, intensity, valence, frequency, and expression. This process encompasses physiological, behavioral, and cognitive mechanisms (Aldao, 2013; Gross, 2015) and can be initiated automatically or intentionally when emotions are perceived as maladaptive in a particular situation (Gross, 2015).
Various theoretical models have been proposed to explain emotion regulation, with the Process Model of Emotion Regulation (Gross, 1998; Gross & Thompson, 2007) being deemed particularly relevant in educational settings (Burić, Sorić, & Penezić, 2016). This model, for analytical purposes, comprises five categories of emotion regulation strategies that span from the initiation to the expression of emotions (Gross, 2015). These categories include: a) situation selection, which involves actions that either approach or avoid stimuli that trigger emotions; b) situation modification, which entails actions that change aspects of the external environment to alter its emotional impact; c) attentional deployment, referring to efforts to focus on internal or external events to influence emotions; d) cognitive change, involving reinterpretations of internal or external situations to change their emotional impact; and e) response modulation, which involves directly adjusting physiological, experiential, and behavioral components following the full activation of emotions.
Recent studies in emotion regulation have highlighted that strategies yield varying outcomes contingent upon the context (Aldao, Sheppes, & Gross, 2015; Gross, 2015). Therefore, the effectiveness and suitability of a strategy should not be predetermined, as its adaptive nature, encompassing both costs and benefits, necessitates consideration of contextual factors (e.g., Aldao, Sheppes, & Gross, 2015; Gross, 2015). Moreover, each regulatory endeavor can instigate alterations in the regulator, the environment, and the individuals involved in the interaction. These alterations may engender fresh emotion regulation requirements, prompting the adoption of additional strategies in a haphazard and interchangeable manner until no further regulation is needed, thus establishing a feedback loop (Gross, 2015; Taxer & Gross, 2018). These developments signify recent progressions in emotion regulation research, as highlighted by Taxer and Gross (2018). Nevertheless, this model has not been consistently explored, particularly in professional settings where the predominant focus has been on investigating two primary strategies, namely cognitive reappraisal and suppression (Mallory & Rupp, 2016).
Insufficient attention has been directed towards the emotions of teachers, despite their significant relevance to the realms of teaching and student learning (Akbari et al., 2016; Burić et al., 2016; Taxer; Gross, 2018). Research on the emotional experiences of teachers, particularly in the context of Brazil, has predominantly utilized the stress and coping theoretical framework, primarily focusing on teachers' responses to stress and stressful events (Burić et al., 2016; Lipp, 2016). Emotion regulation, on the other hand, encompasses a wide array of both negative and positive emotions that arise within the normative work settings of teachers, thereby potentially expanding the investigative horizons surrounding this subject matter.
In a qualitative study focusing on professional and technological education, contextual emotional demands within the classroom were discerned and classified into three distinct categories: affective interaction events (such as conflicts with students and inappropriate behavior), technical-pedagogical challenges (including learning difficulties and student demotivation), and intrapersonal struggles (such as frustration and emotional dissonance). These components appear to elicit a range of negative emotions in educators, underscoring the necessity for effective regulation to mitigate their detrimental effects on teachers' performance and overall well-being (Morais, Gondim, & Palma, in press).
Various emotion regulation strategies are utilized in the classroom, as indicated by research (e.g., Akbari et al., 2017; Taxer; Gross, 2018). Some teachers may employ strategies to avoid focusing on student misbehavior, while others may resort to reactive measures like temporarily leaving the classroom until they regain emotional equilibrium (Akbari et al., 2017; Sutton, 2004). Taxer and Gross (2018) found that teachers predominantly utilize response modulation strategies, such as suppression. Conversely, Sutton (2004) and Burić et al. (2016) discovered a preference among teachers for cognitive change strategies, like reappraisal. However, Akbari et al. (2017) noted that teachers were more inclined towards situation selection and modification strategies. These varying results highlight conflicting perspectives on the utilization of emotion regulation strategies by teachers, potentially influenced by unexplored contextual factors in prior studies (Fried et al., 2015).
Concerns have been raised regarding research on teachers' emotions, particularly in relation to emotion regulation strategies and their outcomes. Existing studies have predominantly focused on specific tactics employed by teachers, such as the findings from Yin et al. (2016) indicating a tendency for teachers to suppress rather than reappraise their emotions in emotionally draining situations. Similarly, research by Burić et al. (2016) suggests that reappraisal tends to be more advantageous, while suppression is linked to feelings of exhaustion. These studies commonly categorize teachers' emotion regulation strategies as either adaptive or maladaptive, overlooking to some degree their fundamental purposes and the impact of individual and contextual factors.
The literature review indicates a predominant focus on teachers' emotion regulation in existing research, overlooking the specific emotions being regulated and the underlying reasons for regulation. Consequently, there is a significant gap in understanding the activation of specific emotions in various classroom scenarios. Moreover, the majority of studies have emphasized intrapersonal aspects, neglecting the influence of interpersonal dynamics and contextual factors on teachers' emotion regulation. The literature also lacks sufficient exploration of the consequences of emotion regulation and the interconnected strategies employed. Frield et al. (2015) highlight the need for further investigation into the dynamic and contextual aspects of emotion regulation within educational settings. These gaps in knowledge served as the impetus for the current study, which seeks to address the research question: how do vocational and technological education teachers regulate their emotions amidst the diverse emotional demands of the classroom? The study aims to characterize the emotional labor of these teachers by examining the emotions experienced and the strategies employed to regulate them in response to classroom emotional demands.
The current study delves into vocational and technological education, a multifaceted educational model that encompasses various levels and forms of education, spanning from basic education to higher education (including baccalaureate and graduate programs), as well as professional and continuing education courses. This model also involves research, extension activities, and initiatives linked to technological advancement (Pacheco & Morigi, 2012). It is posited that these characteristics give rise to a diverse and expansive audience with heightened emotional demands on educators (Morais, Gondim, & Palma, 2020). The recent introduction of this educational model and the dearth of research on psychosocial aspects within this framework were also taken into account.
This study employs an exploratory approach with a case study design, situated within a specific context - a Federal Institute (IF) in a northeastern state of Brazil. Data collection utilized the focus group technique to delve into teachers' emotions and their coping mechanisms with emotional demands. A total of eight focus groups were conducted, each lasting approximately one hour. Initially, four focus groups (A, B, C, and D) were carried out, followed by the remaining four (E, F, G, and H). This sequential approach was chosen to encompass the diverse training areas/occupations (basic and technical subjects) and career trajectories within the IF, distinguishing between beginners (up to five years of experience) and non-beginners (more than five years of experience). By structuring the study in this manner, we aimed to investigate how these variables influence strategy selection, enabling a comprehensive exploration of various scenarios and a detailed analysis of strategies employed (refer to Figure 1). This categorization aligns with three distinct stages: the initial phase of a teaching career in Brazil (1 - 5 years), characterized by formative experiences and adaptation challenges, the stabilization phase (5 - 8 years), and the career maturity phase (Ferreira, 2014).
The focus groups were conducted in four phases (Figure 1): I) the presentation of the research focus and the signing of the Informed Consent Form; II) the presentation of the identified demands of emotional work, which were organized into three categories: a) interactional demands stemming from relationships with students, colleagues, and managers; b) technical-pedagogical demands related to the teaching practice itself; and c) intrapersonal demands resulting from internal conflicts and dissonances (Morais, Gondim, & Palma, 2020); III) the presentation of guiding questions that explored which emotions are triggered by specific emotional demands and how teachers cope with these demands; and IV) a group discussion aimed at reaching consensus, addressing disagreements, and delving deeper into the topic. Each emotional demand (e.g., interactional, technical-pedagogical, and intrapersonal) was deliberated upon individually, with the guiding questions being presented in a sequential manner.
Teachers were assigned to groups based on two criteria in order to optimize sample characteristics and facilitate result comparisons (see Figure 1): their areas of training/occupations at the institution and their career levels. The total sample comprised 41 vocational and technological education teachers who were invited to partake in the study by IF course coordinators. The majority of participants were male, totaling 25 individuals. Further specifics regarding this sample can be found in Figure 1.
The training characteristics of the participants are noteworthy. In the Basic Group, the majority of teachers held a master's degree (n = 8), with two having PhDs and one being a specialist. Other backgrounds included social science (n = 3), pedagogy (n = 2), philosophy (n = 2), mathematics (n = 2), geography (n = 2), arts (n = 1), chemistry (n = 1), history (n = 1), and physical education (n = 1). Among the teachers in the Technical Group, most possessed a Ph.D. (n = 9), while seven had a master's degree and two were specialists. Their fields of study primarily included engineering (n = 10), followed by computer science (n = 7), gastronomy (n = 2), and agribusiness (n = 1). This research project was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Institute of Psychology of the Federal University of Bahia (CAA 92122318.1.0000.5686).
The focus groups were recorded and transcribed, resulting in a corpus of 103 pages. To categorize emotions, deductive analysis was employed using Parrot's (2001) list of primary and secondary emotions. Initially, Bardin's (2011) thematic content analysis was utilized to explore the strategies, with the assistance of emotional regulation models from the literature to develop an open coding system grouping strategies into broader categories. Following the establishment of the system, an inductive analysis, facilitated by the Atlas.ti software, was conducted to identify context-specific strategies and tactics not addressed in existing literature, aiding in the grouping, quantification, and analysis of data. A systematic comparison of coded items was carried out until data saturation was reached, exhaustively capturing the emergence of new (sub) categories or the necessity for further data reorganization. This method unveiled a diverse array of strategies and tactics employed by classroom teachers, underpinned by a theoretical model of emotional regulation found in the literature (refer to Figure 2).
To ensure the reliability of data analysis, the encodings underwent multiple comparisons and examinations until the information remained consistent and unchanged. Subsequently, content validity was employed. Following this, a Ph.D. researcher specializing in emotional regulation conducted an analysis of the corpus to validate the codes and categorization, continuing until a consensus was achieved. This meticulous process yielded a remarkable 97.2% consistency among the researchers involved.
In the research article, twenty-four emotional regulation strategies were identified, categorized into tactics that represent concrete and specific actions aiding in the operationalization of the strategy. These tactics were adopted by teachers when confronted with the emotional demands of the classroom, with the frequency of emotions and strategies detailed in Table 1. The discussion section delves into these dimensions, establishing connections, and offering insights to provide a contextual framework for understanding teacher emotional regulation.
Participants in the study reported a range of emotions in response to the emotional demands under investigation, as outlined in Table 1. While positive emotions were also mentioned, the primary focus of the research centered on negative emotions. Among these, anger, frustration, helplessness, and sadness emerged as the most frequently cited and significant. Interactional demands, such as inappropriate behavior, perceived lack of support, and over-bureaucracy, were found to predominantly elicit emotions like anger, frustration, fear, and anger. Conversely, technical-pedagogical demands, including demotivation, learning disabilities, classroom management, diversity, and academic indiscipline, appeared to evoke feelings of frustration, worry, compassion, impotence, and anguish, particularly in response to the first two demands. In summary, it appears that interactional demands tend to provoke the most intense and challenging negative emotions to regulate.
The deductive and inductive analysis of the data facilitated the development of a categorical system for teacher emotional regulation, as depicted in Figure 2. It was evident that the identified emotional regulation strategies aligned well with the five strategy families outlined in the Process Model of Emotion Regulation. Table 2 provides a comprehensive overview, including the definition of the strategies, their breakdown into tactics, the overall frequency of families and strategies, and illustrative examples. By dissecting the strategies into tactics and providing detailed descriptions, we were able to effectively characterize emotional regulation within the specific context under investigation and emphasize its unique aspects. This approach also enabled comparison between different groups. We believed that a more generalized analysis would have obscured these nuanced findings.
In terms of frequency and definition, the cognitive change strategies family (n = 135/30%) emerged as the most frequently cited and referenced approach to reassessing situations or teachers' capacity to manage them in order to alter any emotional impact they may have induced. Following closely behind, situation modification (n = 117/26%) was identified as the second most prevalent strategy, involving direct or indirect modifications to a situation (e.g., seeking external assistance or intervention) to change its emotional impact or intentionally displaying emotions (e.g., through pretense or exaggeration) to influence students and other social actors. Response modulation (n = 69/15%) ranked third in frequency, encompassing efforts to influence the experiential, behavioral, and physiological components of emotional responses. Attention deployment (n = 63/14%) was the fourth most common strategy, achieved by redirecting attention through distraction or focus to alter emotional reactions. Lastly, situation selection (N = 53/12%) entailed approaching or avoiding specific circumstances (e.g., teaching methodologies, activities, classes, students, colleagues) based on anticipated emotional triggers. Among preventive strategies, direct modification (n = 89) - a form of situation modification - was the most frequently mentioned, followed by positive cognitive reappraisal (n = 40), external causal attribution (n = 28), perspective-taking (n = 27), and cognitive modification. Suppression (n = 25) was notably highlighted among reactive strategies, with social sharing (n = 21) falling closely behind as a form of response modulation. While genuine expression (n = 19/4%) is not classified as a self-regulating strategy due to the lack of regulation over emotional experience and expression, it emerged in focus groups as a coping mechanism for managing demands and is therefore discussed in this study.
Teachers reported employing multiple emotion regulation strategies to address various emotional demands they encountered. Primarily, cognitive change emerged as the most frequently utilized strategy, often in combination with other approaches. Specifically, it was paired with situation selection (n = 16), situation modification (n = 32), attention deployment (n = 10), and response modulation (n = 14). The most commonly referenced sequences included situation selection with cognitive modification and situation modification with cognitive change.
In the study conducted by Burić et al. (2016), teachers were found to experience a broad spectrum of emotions with significant intensity while teaching, interacting with, and managing students. Their focus primarily centered on negative emotions, indicating their efforts to regulate them. Notably, primary emotions like anger and sadness were prominent, often linked to interactional challenges such as student misbehavior and peer/superior relationships, aligning with previous research (e.g., BURIĆ et al., 2016; CHANG; DAVIS, 2009; TAXER; GROSS, 2018). Technical and pedagogical demands also elicited negative albeit less intense emotions like frustration, worry, compassion, helplessness, and anguish. Furthermore, teachers were observed to regulate frustration stemming from intrapersonal challenges like internal conflicts and dissatisfaction. The study by Taxer and Frenzel (2015) indicated that openly displaying negative emotions could lead to strained teacher-student relationships and emotional burnout, emphasizing the critical role of emotion regulation in the teaching profession.
Teachers employ a diverse array of emotional regulation strategies to primarily prevent or alleviate negative emotions before, during, and after class, aligning with previous research conducted by Burić et al. (2016) and Taxer and Gross (2018). The identified strategies were effectively categorized into the five families of the Process Model of Emotion Regulation, indicating the model's suitability for the classroom setting and consistency with prior studies (e.g., Akbari et al., 2017; Burić et al., 2016; Sutton, 2004; Taxer; Gross, 2018). Among these families, cognitive change and situation modification emerged as the most prominent, mirroring the findings of Burić et al. (2016) and Sutton (2004). Conversely, Taxer and Gross (2018) observed a higher inclination towards response modulation, such as suppression, while Akbari et al. (2017) emphasized situation selection. These conflicting results underscore the existing discrepancies in the literature regarding how teachers manage their emotions within the educational environment.
The origins of these discrepancies remain unclear, but it is plausible to consider that cultural and contextual influences play a role in regulation (e.g., Sutton, 2004). For instance, the aforementioned studies involved elementary and high school teachers from Croatia and the USA (e.g., Burić et al., 2016; Sutton, 2004; Taxer; Gross, 2018), with the exception of the study by Akbari et al. (2017) which focused on Iranian teachers of foreign languages. This particular study concentrated on teachers of vocational and technological education in a specific region of Brazil, broadening the scope of situational factors examined compared to previous studies that primarily focused on student misbehavior. Specific situations can trigger distinct emotions and strategies (see Table 1), with personal factors such as training and career level also influencing strategy selection (Fried et al., 2015). The various categories of strategies are extensively discussed based on their significance.
The cognitive change family emerges as a significant aspect, indicating that teachers frequently reinterpret events or their own capacity to handle them in order to mitigate the impact of challenging circumstances and lessen emotional labor (e.g., AKBARI et al., 2016; BURIĆ et al., 2016; TAXER; GROSS, 2018). Cognitive change manifests in various ways (MALLORY; RUPP, 2016), such as teachers endeavoring to positively reframe undesirable situations like student demotivation and inappropriate behavior. They may, for instance, view unmotivated students' attempts to improve academically in a positive light (SUTTON, 2004; YIN, 2016). Furthermore, they may attribute external causality, shifting blame to factors like socioeconomic status, cultural background, or the educational system, or to student attributes like personality or age (BURIĆ et al., 2016). Teachers also seek to empathize by putting themselves in others' shoes to better understand and accept the situation (AKBARI et al., 2016; CLARÀ, 2017; TAXER; GROSS, 2018). Other forms of cognitive change encompass personalization, adjustment of expectations, rationalization, and self-blame, as outlined in Table 2.
Although these strategies are topographically distinct, they serve the purpose of aligning cognition with circumstances and emotional goals to minimize contradictions and dissonances. They aim to shift teachers' attitudes towards events (CLARÀ, 2017) in order to mitigate the emotional impact and its influence on their behaviors. For instance, teachers can actively engage in the change process by empathizing with the students' perspective. Additionally, positive reevaluation can foster closer relationships between teachers and students. Consequently, understanding the context of students can enhance teacher empathy, involvement, and adaptability, thereby challenging negative stereotypes (AKBARI et al., 2017; CHANG; DAVES, 2009; CROSS; HONG, 2012), fostering a more positive perception of the teacher-student relationship (CLARÀ, 2017), and encouraging supportive behaviors (GROSS, 2014). These insights align with research indicating that cognitive adjustments are linked to positive emotions, improved relationships, and teacher well-being (CHANG, 2013; CLARÀ, 2017).
However, cognitive change also comes with associated costs. For instance, while attributing external causality may offer a temporary reprieve from negative emotions, it can ultimately jeopardize long-term performance by absolving teachers of accountability for students' progress (PEREIRA; MARINOTTI; LUNA, 2004). Furthermore, teachers may engage in self-critical evaluations, viewing their performance and capabilities in a negative light, and attributing unpleasant circumstances to their own shortcomings. This self-blame can have detrimental effects on teachers' well-being, as they may perceive themselves as inadequate and ineffectual, leading to feelings of frustration, distress, and guilt (CLARÀ, 2017). Consequently, a cognitive shift that predominantly focuses on the negative aspects can exacerbate negative emotions, reinforce feelings of apathy and helplessness, and limit the range of strategies available to cope with challenging situations.
While this family structure appears to be the most approachable and flexible, closer examination reveals that it could potentially result in lower levels of well-being due to its intricate functions and the interpersonal and contextual factors at play. Additionally, given its reliance on more complex regulatory elements like memory and verbal representations, this structure demands increased cognitive monitoring, depleting individual resources and leading to heightened fatigue and diminished performance (e.g., Sheppes, 2014; Yin, 2016). In essence, these insights suggest that cognitive adjustment may not always be advantageous or conclusive, despite its necessity for gradual acclimatization.
This study identified the second most prevalent family of emotion regulation strategies, indicating that teachers consistently endeavor to alter situations (both physical and external) that could trigger negative emotions (Gross, 1998; Taxer; Gross, 2018). Situation modification in this context encompassed strategies such as: a) direct modification, the most prominent approach, involving (i) adapting the lesson plan to address specific classroom needs, including utilizing alternative resources to adjust the class's emotional atmosphere, motivate students, and enhance learning (Akbari et al., 2016; Sutton, 2004), and (ii) addressing students exhibiting inappropriate behavior through dialogue or reprimand to modify their behavior or remove them from the classroom (Sutton, 2004); b) indirect modification, where teachers seek intervention from school staff to manage students' inappropriate behavior; c) feigning emotion, characterized by deliberately displaying false emotions or amplifying genuine emotions to model student behavior (e.g., demonstrating either negative or positive emotions to regulate student conduct) (Gross, 1998; Yin, 2016).
In line with prior research, situation modification was predominantly utilized to address inappropriate behavior (Chang & Daves, 2009; Sutton, 2004; Taxer & Gross, 2018), demotivation, and learning challenges (Akbari et al., 2018; Sutton, 2004; Yin, 2016). It appears that teachers, in anticipation of unfavorable situations, aim to prevent or reduce negative emotions within themselves (self-regulation) and their students (hetero-regulation) (Burić et al., 2016; Taxer & Gross, 2018), thereby averting unnecessary conflicts and disruptions (Sutton, 2004).
There are potential drawbacks associated with altering the current situation. For instance, while tactics like indirect modification may offer immediate alleviation, they could potentially cultivate and perpetuate avoidance behaviors over time, consequently impeding teachers' skill set and career advancement (GROSS, 2015). Similarly, methods like exaggerating or feigning emotions might demand extra exertion and have repercussions on teaching efficacy and the mental well-being of educators (GROSS, 2015; TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015).
Response modulation emerged as the third most prevalent category of regulation strategies, indicating that educators endeavor to alter their emotional regulation tendencies even in situations where avoidance is not feasible (Gross, 2015). This form of regulation was frequently associated with significant incidents, particularly linked to students' inappropriate conduct (English et al., 2017; Sutton, 2004; Taxer; Gross, 2018; Yin, 2016), as well as conflicts with peers and superiors, potentially stemming from a perceived lack of control over such occurrences (Burić et al., 2016). Consistent with prior research, teachers employed response modulation through techniques such as suppression strategies, behavioral maneuvers, and social sharing (Akbari et al., 2016; Sutton, 2004; Taxer; Gross, 2018; Yin, 2016).
There is evidence suggesting that suppression is the predominant strategy employed by teachers (e.g., TAXER; GROSS, 2018). In this study, it emerged as the most commonly used reactive approach, primarily aimed at averting or resolving interpersonal conflicts. These results underscore the significance of suppression in the teaching domain, indicating that it may not necessarily be detrimental in this context and could prove beneficial in the short term (ENGLISH et al., 2017), potentially accounting for its frequent utilization. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that existing literature highlights the maladaptive nature of suppression, primarily due to its association with burnout (e.g., CHANG, 2013; YIN, 2016) and its potential to impede interpersonal intimacy (GROSS, 2014), a critical element in fostering quality teacher-student relationships (TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015). Furthermore, in alignment with the observations of Akbari et al. (2017) and Sutton (2004), the most commonly cited suppression tactics in this study encompassed masking (concealing genuine emotions and displaying others), expressive neutrality, maintaining silence, and temporarily exiting the room.
On the contrary, social sharing entails the sharing of experiences and emotions with fellow teachers, superiors, colleagues, friends, and family members (BURIĆ et al., 2016; SUTTON, 2004). Educators who acknowledged social support emphasized the significance of this approach in broadening their regulatory skills and mitigating negative emotions. The act of sharing emotions aids in alleviating stress, fostering resilience, enhancing teaching effectiveness, and boosting overall well-being (CLARÀ, 2017).
Finally, behavioral strategies, such as deep breathing and counting to ten, have been emphasized in research as effective methods to decrease emotional arousal (Akbari et al., 2017; Burić et al., 2016; Yin, 2016). These techniques appear to assist educators in managing their reactive emotional responses when confronted with challenging situations, thereby diminishing tension and negative emotions in the classroom setting (Chang & Davis, 2009; Sutton, 2004).
In line with Akbari et al. (2016) and Burić et al. (2016), this particular family was seldom referenced. Sheppes (2014) posited that the frequent demands necessitate adaptive strategies tailored to the context, like reappraisal or cognitive shifts. Attention deployment encompasses distraction techniques, including heightened worry and rumination, directing focus towards non-emotional facets of the scenario, or engaging with alternative thoughts and memories.
On one hand, teachers employ strategies aimed at preemptively mitigating negative emotional responses, such as disregarding minor behavioral infractions (TAXER; GROSS, 2018; YIN, 2016) or focusing on positive aspects like motivated students and academic progress (TAXER; GROSS, 2018). However, these avoidance strategies appear to impede the resolution of routine emotional events, suggesting potential long-term consequences, as highlighted by Sheppes (2014). Conversely, tactics like excessive worry, rumination, and fault-finding seem to exacerbate negative emotions by anticipating, amplifying, and prolonging unpleasant experiences, potentially leading to emotional and physical exhaustion, as observed by Nelis et al. (2011). These latter strategies, counterproductive to effective teaching, divert resources towards negative experiences rather than addressing recurring classroom issues, ultimately diminishing the adaptive and functional capacity of emotional regulation.
The concept of situation selection within the context of the focus groups was observed but not extensively discussed. This concept involves the deliberate avoidance of circumstances and events that may evoke negative emotions while actively seeking out situations that elicit positive emotions. Teachers, in particular, employ this strategy when developing lesson plans, activities, and teaching materials by incorporating alternative resources like videos, games, and music that cater to the life stage, challenges, interests, and preferences of their students. By doing so, they aim to be more responsive, effective, and reduce the emotional labor associated with unpleasant events. Despite its potential benefits for both teachers and students, situation selection appears to be underutilized, likely due to its forward-thinking nature, which necessitates a certain level of emotional intelligence and the ability to anticipate emotional responses, as highlighted by Gross (2015). Therefore, the successful implementation of these strategies may hinge on teachers' planning skills, technical and relational preparedness, and emotional awareness.
Similar to previous research, avoidance behavior was predominantly observed towards colleagues, superiors, and institutional responsibilities such as research and extension activities. This inclination can be attributed to the lack of control or absence of influence within these specific environments (Akbari et al., 2016; Burić et al., 2016). Essentially, teachers may find it challenging to physically avoid classroom duties and student interactions, but they do possess the agency to select or evade interactions with colleagues and certain tasks. Consequently, avoidance strategies may serve as a rationale for certain counterproductive behaviors exhibited by teachers.
In accordance with Yin's (2016) research, teachers were found to exhibit genuine negative emotions in response to inappropriate student behavior. These emotional displays were categorized into emotional authenticity and impulsive reactions (acting out). Emotional authenticity pertains to emotional expressions that are more contextually adjusted, typically in response to less intense events such as cell phone misuse or side-talking. However, there was a discrepancy regarding the appropriateness of such displays. While some educators acknowledged the value of moderate emotional expression for behavior regulation (Chang & Daves, 2009; Yin, 2016), others viewed it as incompatible with the ethical responsibilities of teaching (Burić et al., 2016; Sutton, 2004). Intriguingly, those who embraced emotional authenticity perceived themselves as more effective and better connected with their students (Sutton, 2004; Taxer & Frenzel, 2015). It appears that displaying genuine emotions aligned with the situational demands enables teachers to influence student behavior (hetero-regulation) and foster a sense of unity (Sutton, 2004; Yin, 2016). Therefore, authenticity emerges as a potent form of emotional labor within this educational context (Ashforth & Humphrey, 2013; Taxer & Frenzel, 2015; Yin, 2016).
The concept of acting out reaction pertains to the loss of emotional control, characterized by the use of offensive language and aggression, in response to hostile behavior and threats from students, triggering feelings of anger and impotence in the teacher (NELIS et al., 2011; CHANG; DEVIS, 2009). Taxer and Frenzel (2015) argue that expressing anger is counterproductive as it hinders the teacher-student relationship. There is a consensus among researchers that impulsive reactions are dysfunctional and have the potential to tarnish the idealized image of the teaching profession (SUTTON, 2004; SUTTON et al., 2009).
Variations in teachers' emotion regulation were observed based on their field of training or teaching and their career stage. Initially, a wider array of strategies was detected among groups in the basic area, particularly among seasoned educators, aligning with findings by Sutton et al. (2009) and Burić et al. (2016), indicating that veteran teachers exhibit more adept emotional regulation. Secondly, while both situation modification and cognitive change strategies were prominent across all groups, subtle distinctions emerged in how these strategies were employed, implying that basic area educators tend to employ approaches for managing and confronting emotional challenges, whereas technical educators lean towards strategies aimed at evading such challenges. These disparities become more pronounced when comparing novice and experienced teachers, suggesting that time in the profession reinforces these tendencies. Essentially, non-beginner teachers in the basic area appear to encounter a greater range of demands and exhibit more diverse regulation techniques compared to their novice counterparts. Conversely, for technical education instructors, the dynamic is reversed, with experience seemingly reinforcing avoidance patterns.
Paradoxically, more experienced teachers in the basic area frequently cited strategies such as excessive worry, identification of flaws, and self-blame, all of which are associated with psychological disorders (NELIS et al., 2011). These teachers were also the ones who most often mentioned active coping and an approaching attitude, possibly due to the high frequency and intensity of interaction with students, which demands significant emotional labor, leading to career-long exhaustion (YIN et al., 2017). It is plausible that the burden of excessive emotional work, unsuccessful attempts, and misdirected efforts (often through trial and error) can overwhelm and deplete emotional and cognitive resources, prompting teachers to reassess their professional competence and self-image negatively. While exposure to emotional events can be beneficial by broadening the emotional repertoire (ALDAO et al., 2015), it can also be detrimental over the course of a career if not managed and directed effectively.
While no identical empirical studies have been located, there is an inference that teachers specializing in the basic area exhibit a heightened awareness and emotional range, as suggested by existing research. This enhanced emotional intelligence appears to enable them to tackle challenges in a more deliberate and outcome-driven fashion (GROSS, 2014). This assertion is further corroborated by Castejón, Cantero, and Pérez (2010), who argue that individuals with expertise in the technology field tend to prioritize emotions to a lesser extent compared to their counterparts in disciplines like social sciences, education, and humanities.
Another potential explanation could lie in the pedagogical training that educators receive, which, despite often being deemed ineffective by many teachers, may still provide some tools to address the challenges encountered in the classroom (TAXER; GROSS, 2018). It appears that teachers in technical fields are more prone to encountering difficulties, possibly due to their background in engineering and technology, which historically have placed less emphasis on pedagogical training.
To address the deficiency in training, experienced teachers highlighted the significance of investing time in their careers to enhance their emotional and pedagogical skills. Conversely, novice teachers leaned towards seeking social support, a resource that was not universally accessible due to the lack of perceived support from peers and supervisors. These results underscore Sutton's (2004) proposition that educators primarily develop the ability to manage adverse emotions through their practical experiences in the classroom.
Similar to the findings of Taxer and Gross (2018, teachers employ multiple emotion regulation strategies simultaneously. In contrast to their emphasis on attention deployment, this study highlights cognitive change, particularly in relation to situation modification, such as relational coping. When confronted with challenging situations while interacting with students, teachers can alter the impact by influencing student emotion regulation (hetero-regulation) and reinterpret negative circumstances (self-regulation). Another significant connection observed was between situation selection (technical approach) and situation modification (technological confrontation). This indicates that teachers draw on past experiences to predict emotions, both their own and those of others, and utilize technical-pedagogical expertise to proactively plan for and address adverse situations in the classroom.
These findings suggest that teachers often integrate strategies of hetero-regulation and self-regulation to manage emotional demands and enhance emotion regulation effectiveness, highlighting the intricate and dynamic nature of teacher emotional regulation (e.g., Sutton, 2004; Taxer & Gross, 2018). It is emphasized that a combination of emotional and pedagogical skills is essential for these strategies to be successful.
In essence, the results align with existing research indicating the prevalence of negative emotions, whether authentic or managed, in the daily routines of teachers and their emotional experiences (e.g., BAHIA et al., 2013; TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015). This also supports Fried et al.'s (2015) framework, which categorizes teachers' emotions as intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual, reflecting the unique demands of the profession. Moreover, the study implies that regulating negative emotions is crucial due to their potential to hinder productivity and disrupt the learning environment in the specific context under investigation (e.g., ENGLISH et al., 2017; TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015).
Teachers engage in a variety of strategies to prevent, anticipate, and prepare for classroom events, as highlighted by Taxer and Gross (2018). Even in situations where they have limited control, teachers actively regulate their emotions to not only manage their own responses but also influence those of their students, as noted by Akbari et al. (2016). When preventive measures are no longer feasible due to resource constraints or challenging circumstances, teachers often resort to reactive strategies to curb impulsive emotional reactions and minimize their impact, as discussed by Sheppes (2014), Sutton (2004), Sutton et al. (2009), and Taxer and Gross (2018). This cyclical and dynamic regulatory process suggests that teachers employ a series of strategies to navigate emotional modulation, aligning with Gross's (2015) Process Model of Emotional Regulation. Furthermore, the regulation of emotions appears to be influenced by professional factors such as area of expertise and career stage, as well as the specific demands of the situation, as indicated by Sheppes (2014) and English et al. (2017).
The findings of this study suggest that the strategies employed by teachers are not inherently categorized as "good" or "bad," with some being acknowledged as more adaptive (Gross, 2015). However, the evaluation of these strategies is contingent upon various factors such as the context, available resources, expected outcomes, and the duration of their effects (immediate or long-term) (e.g., Aldao et al., 2015; Gross, 2015; English et al., 2017). Consequently, the form and function of these strategies within a contextual framework may fall within the realm of the second generation of studies in emotion regulation research. This implies that these strategies come with both advantages and disadvantages, highlighting the inconsistencies in preemptively labeling them as adaptive or maladaptive. Furthermore, this aligns with the perspectives of Sheppes (2014) and Aldao et al. (2015), emphasizing that effective regulation stems from the flexible selection of strategies to meet varying emotional demands.
This study sought to investigate teachers' emotions and their strategies for regulating emotions in response to the diverse emotional demands encountered in the classroom. It contributed to the field by introducing a contextual framework for understanding teachers' emotion regulation, surpassing prior qualitative inquiries that primarily focused on individual factors related to regulation. The study's methodological approach was novel as it utilized focus groups and compared various groups to identify potential differences in regulation strategies. By delineating different strategy families, the research offers practical guidance for teachers in implementing these strategies and enhancing their awareness of the potential advantages and drawbacks associated with specific approaches. Ultimately, the study posits that acquiring a range of emotional regulation techniques can enhance emotional flexibility, potentially enabling teachers to regulate their emotions more effectively.
Conducting an exploratory and qualitative study was deemed essential due to the limited existing research in this area. This methodology not only addressed gaps in international studies but also shed light on previously unexplored aspects. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of the present study, including potential challenges in generalizing the results and the reliance on behavioral memories. Moreover, the frequent use of cognitive change and situation modification strategies, typically seen as adaptive, may suggest a response bias linked to the "healthy worker" effect. Neglecting to account for demographic variables like gender and age, which can significantly impact emotional regulation, was another notable limitation that should be taken into consideration.
Future research could leverage the findings of this study to develop a contextual scale for teacher emotional regulation and explore the phenomenon in a broader and more diverse sample through quantitative methodologies. Furthermore, alternative approaches like behavioral observation, diaries, and other methods that capture the dynamic nature of regulation could enhance our comprehension of teachers' contextual emotion regulation. Additionally, delving into the underlying motivations prompting teachers to regulate their emotions and examining the resultant impacts on mental well-being could offer valuable insights for further investigation.
