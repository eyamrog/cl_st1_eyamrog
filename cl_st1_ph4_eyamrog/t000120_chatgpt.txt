Natural areas with high biological diversity are increasingly being degraded to accommodate human activities, prompting the need for ecological restoration efforts such as litter transposition to restore ecological processes and potentially enhance microbial populations. This study aimed to assess the impact of forest litter on the mycorrhizal fungi community in a natural regeneration area in Cabreúva, São Paulo State, Brazil. Ten plots, comprising five control and five treatment areas, were established for soil sampling during two distinct periods to conduct physical, chemical, and microbiological analyses. Findings revealed that the edaphic conditions in the area were conducive to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) presence. However, the introduction of transposed organic matter did not lead to an increase in species richness or facilitate plant species colonization. Instead, factors such as gravimetric humidity and grass presence appeared to influence species richness within the studied ecosystem.
Tropical forests play a crucial role in providing essential ecosystem services to humans, conserving biodiversity, and regulating the climate (Berenguer et al., 2018). Activities such as burning, complete removal of natural vegetation, inadequate soil preparation for agriculture, and exploitation without replenishing organic matter or nutrients directly impact the soil (SBCS, 2015). Deforestation can lead to soil exposure, increased susceptibility to erosive processes (Flores et al., 2019), and loss of biodiversity (Berenguer et al., 2018), although the soil retains the potential for natural regeneration (IBAMA, 2011). Ecological restoration, as a human intervention strategy, aims to initiate or hasten natural succession processes in disturbed areas (Secretaria do Meio Ambiente do Estado de São Paulo, 2014). This approach focuses on reestablishing ecological processes without traditional forestry methods, mimicking natural systems with minimal inputs to restore ecosystem health, integrity, and sustainability in specific areas known as nuclei (Bechara, 2006).
The nucleation technique aims to identify various elements, including microorganisms and seeds, in forest areas and subsequently transfer them to disturbed areas to establish small nuclear habitats that will foster environmental heterogeneity across time and space. These nuclei serve as ecological triggers for natural regeneration processes, facilitating the colonization of living organisms and the establishment of ecological interactions (Reis et al., 2010; Reis et al., 2014). Various nucleating techniques are outlined in the literature for use in restoration efforts, such as soil transposition, direct seeding, hydrosowing, branch transposition, artificial perches, and the planting of seedlings within high diversity islands (Reis et al., 2003).
The uppermost layer of forest soil, known as serapillera or forest blanket, comprises a complex system consisting of plant and animal residues at various stages of decomposition, along with living microorganisms (De Souza et al., 2016). Employing biological techniques like nucleation in area restoration proves to be a cost-effective and efficient method for promoting the restoration or recovery of these regions (Almeida, 2016). The enhancement of serapillera facilitates nutrient cycling, enhances soil fertility (Primo et al., 2018), and aids in the inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) that interact with plants, thereby improving nutrient absorption efficiency through the root system (Almeida, 2016; House & Bever, 2018). Mycorrhizae are significantly impacted by disturbances to vegetation and soil caused by natural processes or human activities (Brundrett et al., 1985; House & Bever, 2018). Practices such as complete vegetation removal, loss of topsoil, and extensive soil disturbance in agriculture are detrimental to mycorrhizae (De Souza et al., 2017). A comprehensive understanding of the relationships between shrub mycorrhizae and changes in vegetation cover is essential to comprehend the response of secondary forests to disturbances during the successional process, particularly those affecting serapillera dynamics (Maia et al., 2015).
The significance of serapillera in environmental restoration and its role in establishing endomycorrhizal fungi in soil prompted this study to investigate the impact of serapillera transposition on the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community within a disturbed area.
The experimental area for this study is a privately owned location situated in the countryside of the xxx State of São Paulo, Brazil, specifically at UTM coordinates 7420062.55 S and 285802.26 E. As per the Köppen classification, the climate in the municipality of Cabreúva is categorized as Cwa, falling under the humid subtropical classification, with an average annual temperature of 19°C and an average annual precipitation of 1,320 mm (CLIMATE-DATA 2019). The soil cover consists of red-yellow clay, characterized by a textural B horizon, high acidity, and an increased clay ratio in deeper layers (Dos Santos et al. 2018). Historically, the area was used as pasture land, and for the past two years, it has been naturally covered by Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) R. D. Webster without any management interventions.
Description of the Experiment: Twenty-five continuous 7 x 7 m plots were delineated using string and stakes. The grass within these plots was trimmed using a brush cutter and subsequently cleared from the area. Following this, ten permanent plots were selected through the Research Randomizer system (https://www.randomizer.org/), comprising five treatment plots and five control plots. Integrated soil samples were then collected from a depth of 0-20 cm, following the methodology outlined by De Arruda et al. (2014) for the analysis of physical and chemical properties. On October 12th, 2017, two composite samples were obtained from each of the ten plots at the same depth using an auger, as per the method described by De Arruda et al. (2014). These samples were intended for chemical analysis (organic matter), physical assessment (humidity), and microbiological investigations, resulting in a total of 20 samples for further examination.
In five out of the ten plots, the treatment involved the transposition of 1.2 liters per parcel of serapillera from the second organic sub-horizon of a fragment of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest in an intermediate stage of regeneration, situated seven kilometers away from the experimental site. Subsequently, after nine months post-treatment implementation (July 12th, 2018), a fresh integrated soil sample was obtained for chemical analysis, along with two samples from each plot for comprehensive analysis encompassing chemical, physical, and microbiological parameters.
In the laboratory analysis, the organic matter was assessed using the muffle furnace method as outlined by Goldin (1987) but with some adjustments. Specifically, 10 grams of each soil sample were measured and placed in porcelain crucibles, then dried in an oven at 90 ºC for a period of 24 hours. After this initial drying process, the samples were reweighed and transferred to a muffle furnace where they were incinerated at a temperature of 550 ºC for one hour. Subsequently, the crucibles containing the residual samples were weighed once more to determine the quantity of organic matter present in the samples.
To identify the glomerospores, 50 grams of each soil sample were weighed and subjected to extraction using wet sieving (Gerdemann & Nicolson, 1963) and density gradient centrifugation (Daniels & Skipper, 1982). The extracted spores were then fixed on microscopy slides using PVLG (lacto-glycerol polyvinyl alcohol) and Melzer resin (De Novais et al., 2017). Subsequently, the spores were morphologically characterized (Schenck & Pérez, 1990) and taxonomically identified through references to Morton (2018), Blaszkowski (2018), and Goto & Jobim (2019).
The total number of spores for each species was determined through microscopic examination of individual slides as outlined by De Paula (2016). Ecological indices pertaining to species richness, including total sampled individuals, absolute frequency (Fa), and relative frequency (Fr), were calculated using the following equations: <>.
The variable "ui" represents the number of plots in which the ith species is present within the experimental unit for each group, whether it be the control or treatment group.
The total number of plots per group was calculated by summing the individual plot counts within each group. This was done to determine the overall sample size for each experimental condition. The aggregation of plot numbers allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the data, ensuring that statistical comparisons could be made with sufficient power and accuracy. By consolidating the plot counts, researchers were able to establish a clear understanding of the distribution of samples across different experimental groups, facilitating the interpretation of results and drawing meaningful conclusions from the study.
Fai refers to the absolute frequency of a particular species within a given dataset or sample. It quantifies the number of times that species appears, providing a straightforward measure of its presence in the studied population. This metric is essential for understanding species distribution, abundance, and diversity within an ecosystem. By calculating Fai, researchers can gain insights into the relative importance of different species and their impact on the overall ecological dynamics of a particular environment.
The sum of the absolute frequencies of all species is a crucial metric in ecological studies, providing a comprehensive overview of the distribution and abundance of different organisms within a given ecosystem. This metric serves as a fundamental indicator of biodiversity and can offer valuable insights into the overall health and stability of an ecological community. By calculating the total number of individuals across all species without considering their relative abundances, researchers can gain a clearer understanding of the overall species richness and evenness within a particular habitat. This simple yet informative measure can help researchers assess the impact of various factors on the diversity and composition of species, making it a valuable tool in ecological research and conservation efforts.
Statistical Analysis - The statistical software R version 3.6.0 was utilized to conduct comparisons of data related to species richness, gravimetric humidity, and organic matter within dependent samples. This analysis was performed using the paired t-test with a significance level set at p < 0.05.
During the monitoring of the experimental unit, a significant increase in the growth of Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) R. D. Webster was observed across all plots from the initiation of the treatment on October 12th, 2017, to the second sample collection on July 12th, 2018. Notably, there was a lack of germination observed for seedlings of shrub/arboreal plant species and other weed species during this period.
The genus Urochloa comprises exotic invasive species that proliferate and engage in negative interactions with native species, primarily through interspecific resource competition, canopy growth, and chemical inhibition via the release of secondary compounds (Horowitz et al., 2007; Scabora, 2011). In this competitive scenario, the exotic species often outcompetes the native plants, exerting a suppressive impact that leads to the elimination of the latter from the area, thereby accounting for their absence in the experimental plots.
The physico-chemical analysis of soil integrated samples revealed that the soil particle size analysis conducted on the initial integrated sample identified the soil as sandy clay, with a higher proportion of clay present in deeper layers. This classification aligns with the categorization of "argissolo" in the Brazilian Soil Classification System, as outlined by Dos Santos et al. (2018).
The chemical properties of the two integrated samples (Table 1) were analyzed following the guidelines set forth by Instituto Agronômico de Campinas (Raij et al., 1997) and Embrapa (Sobral et al., 2015). These analyses were conducted in relation to soil characteristics in areas with perennial Urochloa cultivation.
The second sample exhibited a lower organic matter content compared to the first, indicating decomposition likely occurred due to the addition of serapillera in the treated plots. Phosphorus levels decreased by 3 mg dm-3 between the samples, a trend that can be linked to the presence of U. brizantha in the soil. This plant, known for its ability to host FMA, boasts a high photosynthetic rate and a substantial phosphorus demand during its initial growth stages (Smith & Gianinazzi-Pearson, 1988; Carrenho et al., 2010). An alternative explanation for the decline in phosphorus content is proposed by Quesada et al. (2010), who, after studying soil samples from various South American countries, including Brazil, suggested that total phosphorus levels may diminish due to the loss of dissolved organic and inorganic phosphorus. This loss can be attributed to weathering processes that lead to leaching or a reduction in soil mass, as well as the permanent occlusion of soil minerals.
The elevated potassium levels suggest the prevalence of primary minerals and minimal weathering, a common characteristic of soils in arid regions (Sobral et al., 2015). Zinc, among the micronutrients, is known to be absorbed by arbuscular mycorrhizae (De Novais et al., 2017), potentially explaining the decline in its concentration across samples. While manganese levels were initially deemed high (Sobral et al., 2015), they decreased during the dry season (July), a trend also noted in a study by Bezerra (2017). Aluminum content similarly decreased in the dry season, yet remained at levels that did not impede sporulation. Cardoso & Kuyper (2006) highlighted the enhanced uptake of these elements by plant-associated AMF, resulting in reduced soil concentrations and decreased toxicity for plants. Ultimately, the findings from the integrated soil samples in the experimental unit align with the presence of AMF throughout the study.
Species diversity was assessed across two sampling periods, revealing a total of 27 recorded species distributed among eight genera: Pacispora (1 species), Diversispora (1), Funneliformis (1), Archaeospora (2), Scutellospora (3), Dentiscutata (4), Acaulospora (5), and Glomus (10). These species belonged to six families, namely Acaulosporaceae, Archaeosporaceae, Dentiscutataceae, Diversisporaceae, Glomeraceae, and Scutellosporaceae, as outlined in Table 2.
The genus Glomus is notably prevalent in various environments, such as the Atlantic Forest (Pereira et al., 2014), agroforestry systems (Bezerra & De Mello, 2015), the Amazon (Reyes et al., 2019), and other Brazilian ecosystems (Da Silva et al., 2014). This study reveals the presence of Glomus in disturbed areas with soil pH levels ranging between 4.5 and 4.6, consistent with findings by Borba & De Amorim (2007) who highlighted Glomus dominance in similar environments. The genus demonstrates a high prevalence in both rainy and dry seasons, suggesting a robust sporulation capacity and adaptability to varying soil conditions (Caproni et al., 2003).
The second genus with the highest richness and absolute frequency was Acaulospora, predominantly found in areas with a pH range of 4.4 to 5.0, as reported by Da Silva et al. (2006). However, both genera, Glomus and Acaulospora, are not confined to the specific edaphic conditions of the experimental unit or the Brazilian climate. They exhibit a wide distribution, spanning across all seven continents: North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Antarctica, and Oceania, and are present in the four major climate zones: tropical, subtropical, temperate, and boreal/austral (Stürmer et al. 2018). Glomus and Acaulospora stand out as the most species-rich genera globally, with 54 and 52 species respectively, identified within the Glomeromycota clade (Da Silva et al. 2014; Goto & Jobim 2019).
The species Dentiscutata erythropus, Dentiscutata reticulata, Glomus aggregatum, Glomus heterosporum, Glomus macrocarpum, Funneliformis geosporum, and Archaeospora trappei have been identified on four or more continents, indicating a cosmopolitan distribution (Stürmer et al., 2018).
Among the 27 identified species, 14 were consistently present across all groups during both sampling periods. Notably, Acaulospora alpina and Glomus aggregatum were absent in the initial period, indicating a potential inclination towards sporulation during the dry season. The overall species richness exhibited a decline of six species (2, 11, 14, 20, 26, and 27) between the two sampling periods, likely attributed to sporulation inactivity in the dry season. However, given the limited number of sample plots in this study, it is suggested that a larger sample size could enhance the reliability of this hypothesis. Future research endeavors focusing on exploring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) diversity in disturbed soil, considering variations in gravimetric moisture and organic matter percentages throughout different seasons, could offer valuable insights into identifying species most susceptible to these environmental factors.
In the analysis of individual soil samples, the comparison of gravimetric humidity percentages revealed that the control group displayed no significant difference (p = 0.11) among the samples, while the treatment group exhibited a notable difference (p = 0.01) across the sampling periods, potentially linked to the presence of litter. With decreasing humidity across all plots, a decrease in species richness was observed in four out of five plots, suggesting a significant difference (p = 0.06) in species composition between the two periods, as illustrated in Figure 1.
The species richness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the control group (p = 0.91) and the organic matter percentages in both control (p = 0.32) and treatment groups (p = 0.81) did not exhibit significant differences across sampling periods (see Figure 1). Research conducted in forest areas at various successional stages in Alcântara, MA, suggests that the diverse niches and opportunities in severely degraded areas contribute to the initial higher richness of AMF species during plant succession (Reyes et al., 2019). However, the decline in AMF richness over time in the treatment group could be attributed to reduced fungal niche competition, enhanced population stability, and the prevalence of k-strategist species with sporadically low sporulation levels and superior competitive survival abilities, as noted by Pereira et al. (2014). Despite this, the quantity of litter translocated into the treatment plots was insufficient to induce a notable disparity in the overall organic matter percentage between samples.
The abundance of AMF species in the treatment group during the dry season could have been impacted by gravimetric humidity and the presence of Urochloa brizantha. To facilitate the restoration of the area, the complete elimination of Urochloa brizantha is essential; yet, manual or mechanized removal methods could alter the physical and microbiological makeup of the soil. Resorting to a chemical solution, besides polluting the soil, might disrupt the life cycle of microorganisms. Therefore, it is imperative to devise a technique that minimizes the impact on soil structure and composition.
Based on the aforementioned findings, the utilization of the genera identified in this study holds promise for enhancing agricultural practices, safeguarding soil health and quality, and notably decreasing reliance on phosphorus-based chemical inputs within the agricultural crops of the municipality.
The transposition of litter from the Semideciduous Seasonal Forest to the soil disturbed with Urochloa brizantha did not result in an increase in the richness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus species, nor did it facilitate the colonization of plant species beneficial for ecological restoration. These findings suggest that prior to initiating restoration efforts in an area, complete removal of the grass is necessary.
