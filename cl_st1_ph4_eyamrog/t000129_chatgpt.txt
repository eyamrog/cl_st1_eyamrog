This study aimed to develop a concise 2-item screening tool to identify Brazilian households with children at risk for food insecurity. Psychometric analyses, including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and ROC curves, were employed to assess various question combinations and determine the most effective screener for identifying households at risk for food insecurity when compared to a gold standard scale. The participants consisted of households surveyed in the National Demographic Health Survey on Women and Children (PNDS-2006) with valid responses on the Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale (EBIA). The sample comprised 3,920 households, representing 11,779,686 households when adjusted using PNDS sample weights. With an overall food insecurity prevalence of 21%, the Brazilian 2-item food-insecurity screen demonstrated a sensitivity of 79.31%, specificity of 92.95%, positive predictive value of 74.62%, negative predictive value of 94.50%, and an ROC area of 86.13%. This screening tool also exhibited strong convergent validity with children's nutrition and health variables when compared to the gold standard, the EBIA full scale. Given its effectiveness in identifying households at risk for food insecurity, the 2-item screening tool is recommended for widespread adoption as a screening measure across Brazil, particularly in situations where rapid decision-making is crucial, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. This tool can assist providers in accurately pinpointing families facing food insecurity and intervening promptly to prevent or alleviate the adverse health and developmental consequences associated with food insecurity, enabling swift responses to crises.
In 2004, the Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale (EBIA) was adapted to Portuguese and validated using the United States Household Food Security Survey Module (US-HFSSM) as a model. Since its adaptation, EBIA has been incorporated into several national health surveys and a limited number of smaller regional or local studies, intermittently gathering information on food insecurity.
Results obtained from national datasets enable the surveillance of population food insecurity prevalence, facilitating the examination of its correlation with socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related variables, thereby providing valuable scientific evidence to guide the formulation of public policies. It is important to note that national surveys are primarily designed to generate estimates of prevalence at a national level and are not intended to pinpoint individual food-insecure households for immediate intervention. To address this limitation, data from regional or local surveys are often utilized; however, these studies are not consistently conducted in a systematic manner.
In 2010, Hager et al. validated a screening tool aimed at identifying households with young children at risk of food insecurity. Known as the Hunger Vital Sign™ (HVS), this 2-question instrument is adapted from the US Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) and has demonstrated notable sensitivity, specificity, and convergent validity. The HVS functions akin to traditional vital sign assessments in healthcare, focusing on families' concerns regarding food access. Various professionals, including healthcare providers, social workers, educators, and community outreach workers, can utilize the HVS to pinpoint households in immediate need of food support. Endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics for integration into routine well-child visits, the HVS was also integrated into the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Accountable Health Communities Screening Tool in 2017. Subsequent validations in 2015 and 2017 extended the HVS's applicability to youth, adolescents, and adults, with suggestions for potential use among older adult populations within healthcare systems. Furthermore, the tool has been translated into multiple languages, broadening its reach and impact.
The development and validation of a Brazilian 2-item screening tool based on the EBIA would enable the identification of families currently at risk for food insecurity, serving as a local or regional risk-monitoring tool. These capabilities are particularly valuable during crises like the one presented by COVID-19, aiding in the targeted evaluation of healthcare and nutrition interventions aligned with Brazilian health service priorities. Moreover, integrating a 2-item screening tool for food insecurity into routine health center visits could enhance the Brazilian Food and Nutrition Surveillance System (SISVAN) by promptly identifying families residing in food-insecure households. If the 2-item screening tool proves as effective for the Brazilian population as it has for the US, it would complement national/regional data gathered by the extended EBIA questionnaire in a beneficial manner. By generating individual/local data, a Brazilian "Hunger Vital Sign" could facilitate the timely implementation of social policy solutions to alleviate food insecurity while more permanent changes in government-supported social infrastructures are being devised and executed. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a concise 2-item screening tool to pinpoint Brazilian households with families at risk for food insecurity, particularly those with children.
The third edition of the National Survey on Demography and Health of Women and Children (PNDS 2006/07) aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the health and nutrition status of reproductive-age women (15-49 years old) and their children under 5 years of age. In addition to health-related information, the survey also collected data on various social, economic, and cultural factors, including household food insecurity measured using the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (EBIA). The PNDS 2006/07 employed a sophisticated probability sampling design to ensure national representativeness, involving data collection in two stages: the primary sampling unit being the census area and the secondary sampling unit being the household. The sample exclusively comprised non-institutionalized private households, selected from ten distinct sampling strata derived from the combination of five geographic regions and urban/rural distinctions within each region. Eligible households were chosen randomly, taking into account the number of census areas in each region and their urban or rural classification. Detailed information on the survey methodology, encompassing sample design, selection procedures, data collection methods, data quality assurance, weighting strategies, and ethical considerations, can be found elsewhere.
The PNDS 2006/07 utilized a modified EBIA comprising 16 questions, wherein question number five was divided into two parts. The first part inquired, "In the last three months, did you or other adults in the household ever cut the size of your meals because there wasn’t enough money to buy food?" The second part asked, "In the last three months, did you or other adults in the household ever skip meals because there wasn’t enough money to buy food?" Following the PNDS guidelines, these two parts were amalgamated into a negative response ("no") if both segments received negative answers, or "do not know" for one part and "no" for the other. Any other combination of responses was considered affirmative ("yes") for analysis purposes.
The number of affirmed questions serves as an indicator of a household's food security level, forming the basis for categorizing households into one of four food security categories. In this iteration of the EBIA, households with children under 18 years are classified into Food Secure (0 questions affirmed), Mild Food Insecurity (1-5 questions affirmed), Moderate Food Insecurity (6-10 questions affirmed), and Severe Food Insecurity (11-15 questions affirmed). All questions in the EBIA pertain to the three months preceding the survey. Prevalence estimates and inferential analyses were carried out using the dichotomized food security status variable, with households not deemed at risk falling under the Food Secure and Mild Food Insecurity categories (Food Security), and those at risk encompassing the Moderate and Severe Food Insecurity categories (Food Insecurity). The composite Food Insecurity category signifies a higher degree of food scarcity within a household, potentially leading to hunger among adults and children in the three months prior to the interview. In instances where respondents answered "do not know" to questions regarding food access conditions (1st to 4th questions), the interview was ceased, and the corresponding record was excluded (n=17, accounting for 0.35% of the sample).
For this study, eligible participants were children aged ≤59 months, residing in the same household as their mothers, with the Early Childhood Development Index Assessment (EBIA) completed accurately, totaling 4,800 children. Given that the household served as the primary unit of analysis, the National Survey of Demography and Health (PNDS) replicated EBIA responses for all individuals within a specific household. Consequently, it became imperative to select a single child from each household to prevent duplication of sample unit representation during data analysis. In cases where a mother had multiple children under the age of five, the younger child/children were excluded from the sample, and only the eldest child was retained (n=784). Similarly, if there were multiple children under five years of age from different mothers residing in the same household, the younger child/children were omitted (n=61). Furthermore, in instances where twins were present, only the healthier twin, as determined by birth weight, was included in the sample. The twin with the lower birth weight, as indicated on the child's official Brazilian health record card, was excluded. If this information was unavailable, the mother's reported birth weight was utilized. If neither source was accessible, the younger twin was excluded based on the children's birth order variable (n=35). The selection criteria were guided by the principle of retaining children in the sample who had experienced a longer duration of exposure to their respective environmental conditions. Following these exclusions, 3,920 children (one per household) were included in the analysis, representing 11,779,686 households when extrapolated using PNDS sample weights.
The development of the screen involved seven key steps: calculation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values using ROC curves, accuracy, and convergent validity. Sensitivity measures the screen's accuracy in identifying food-insecure households, minimizing false negatives, while specificity gauges its ability to correctly identify food-secure households, minimizing false positives. Positive predictive value indicates the percentage of those identified as food insecure by the screen who are indeed food insecure, while negative predictive value shows the percentage of those not identified as food insecure by the screen who are actually food secure. The area under the ROC curve assesses the screen test's diagnostic ability for households with and without food insecurity, while accuracy indicates the screen's precision in describing food insecurity. Convergent validity evaluates the relationships between screening results and variables theoretically linked to food insecurity, such as socioeconomic, demographic, and health factors.
Different combinations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 questions were evaluated as potential screening tools through contingency table procedures. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as accuracy, were computed, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for each set of candidate screening items. The combination of 2 questions that demonstrated optimal sensitivity, specificity, and convergent validity was chosen as the designated screening tool.
Socioeconomic and child nutrition and health variables were utilized to assess the convergent validity of candidate screens in this study. The hypothesis that children under five residing in moderately or severely food-insecure households would exhibit significantly poorer health conditions compared to their food-secure counterparts was tested through Poisson regression analysis in two distinct sets of analyses. One set employed the gold standard, while the other utilized the 2-item screening tool. Variables with a significance level of p<0.20 in bivariate analyses with either the food security predictor or the health outcome variable were deemed eligible for inclusion as potential confounding variables in the subsequent multivariate analysis. The final model included only the most strongly associated variables, with a significance level of p<0.05, employing a backward stepwise elimination technique. Health outcome variables were selected based on their established association with food insecurity in prior research. All models were adjusted for macro-region, urban-rural classification, living conditions, economic status, participation in cash transfer programs, maternal education, marital status, number of children in the household, child's gender, and age. These covariates were selected due to their theoretical and bivariate associations with both food insecurity and the outcomes under investigation. Macro-region was dichotomized to contrast less-developed regions (North and Northeast) with more-developed regions (Midwest, Southeast, and South). Urban or rural household status was also included as a covariate. The Brazilian Economic Classification Criterion (CCEB) was used as an indicator of household economic status, with a dichotomized variable grouping economic status into wealthier classes (A1 to C2) and less wealthy classes (D/E). Living Conditions were classified as "adequate" if the household possessed all five specified items, otherwise, they were deemed "inadequate". Cash Transfer Program participation was dichotomized to indicate whether any household resident received at least one of the seven available social safety-net programs in 2006.
Maternal Education was categorized as either "≤ eight years of study" or "more than eight years," representing graduation from middle school or not, respectively. Marital Status adhered to PNDS criteria: women in formal marriages or stable unions were classified as "having a partner," while single, widowed, separated, legally separated, or divorced women were categorized as "without a partner." The Number of Children residing in the same household was divided into "1-2 children" or "≥ 3 children."
Dietary intake data was collected using the PNDS qualitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) consisting of 20 typical Brazilian foods. The mother reported the frequency of children's consumption of each food for the 7 days prior to the interview. For children aged 6 months to 5 years, variables were coded based on four types of meat selected from the FFQ to represent meat consumption (cow/pig, liver, chicken, and fish). A binary variable was established to indicate whether a child had consumed meat at least once daily in the past week (coded as "at least 1x/day") or not every day. The Fruits & Vegetables variable was constructed using three food groups from the FFQ. Daily intake of fruits and vegetables (as per the Brazilian questionnaire: "frutas", "verduras", "legumes") signified the consumption of at least three healthy foods daily, in line with recommendations from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Another binary variable was created to show whether a child had consumed fruits and vegetables daily in the past week (coded as "every day") or not every day. Infants under six months were included in the analysis by categorizing those who had not consumed fruits, vegetables, or meat on any day in the past week as being in the "every day" group, indicating that they were solely breastfed or formula-fed.
Anthropometric measurement equipment, interviewer training, standardization, supervision, and quality control adhered to PNDS procedures 17,18. Weight-for-Age categories, expressed as Z-scores (WAZ), were determined according to World Health Organization standards 19. To facilitate analysis, a binary variable termed Nutritional Status was established, classifying a child as "underweight" if WAZ < -2.0, and "not underweight" if WAZ ≥ -2.0. Hospitalization data relied on maternal reports indicating whether children had been hospitalized for diarrhea or pneumonia at least once in the 12 months preceding the interview (coded as "yes").
The merging and analysis of PNDS 2006/07 datasets were conducted using Stata/IC 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). To accurately account for the stratification and clustering effects inherent in the complex sampling design, all analyses were carried out utilizing the complex survey command (svy) to ensure a representative sample of the Brazilian population. However, in order to prevent the overestimation of associations within subgroups, sample weights were exclusively applied in descriptive analysis. Descriptive bivariate analysis of associations between socioeconomic, demographic, and biological variables with disaggregated food insecurity was performed using Chi-square tests with a second-order Rao-Scott correction. Unadjusted and adjusted multivariate analysis was conducted employing Poisson regression.
This study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo/Hospital São Paulo (080567/2016).
A sample of 3920 households was selected for analysis, representing 11,779,686 households. Table 1 delineates socioeconomic, demographic, and child nutrition and health variables based on food security status. As anticipated, food insecurity was more prevalent in the northern and northeastern regions as well as in rural areas. The majority of families residing in food-insecure households belonged to lower economic strata, faced inadequate living conditions, and were beneficiaries of safety net programs. A higher proportion of mothers in food-insecure households reported having less than 8 years of education, being single parents, and having three or more children, typically older than 2 years. Additionally, a larger number of children in food-insecure households did not consume meat, fruits, or vegetables daily. Food insecurity was linked to undernutrition (WAZ < -2.0 Z-score) and increased instances of children's hospitalizations in the year leading up to the interview.
Upon meticulous analysis of each EBIA positive response through cross tabulations, it was evident that the combination of questions 2 and 4 exhibited superior sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as ROC area in comparison to the gold standard. Question 2 in the EBIA, which inquires about food running out before being able to purchase more in the last three months, aligns with HFSSM question Q2 regarding food not lasting and lacking funds to replenish supplies over the past year. Similarly, EBIA's question 4, which addresses making do with limited food to feed individuals under 18 due to financial constraints in the last three months, corresponds to HFSSM question Q4 concerning reducing meal sizes or skipping meals in the past year due to insufficient funds for food.
The prevalence of food insecurity, as assessed by EBIA, was found to be 20.7 percent, while the Brazilian 2-item food-insecurity screen, consisting of questions 2 and 4, indicated a prevalence of 22 percent. This screening tool demonstrated a sensitivity of 79.31 percent, specificity of 92.96 percent, positive predictive value of 74.62 percent, and negative predictive value of 94.50 percent. The accuracy of this screening method was calculated to be 90.13 percent, with an area under the ROC curve of 86.13 percent, as detailed in Tables 2 and 3.
Convergent validity analyses were conducted using Poisson logistic regression models to compare the results obtained with the EBIA and the Brazilian 2-item food-insecurity screen separately. The 2-item screening tool demonstrated the ability to discriminate nutrition and health outcomes associated with living in food-insecure households in a manner similar to the EBIA 15-item gold standard. When utilizing the Brazilian 2-item food-insecurity screen, children residing in food-insecure households were found to be 1.1 and 1.5 times more likely to not consume meat or fruits and vegetables daily, respectively, compared to children in food-secure households. Furthermore, children in food-insecure households exhibited a 1.3 times higher likelihood of having weight-for-age below -2.0 z-scores and a 1.4 times higher likelihood of being hospitalized due to diarrhea or pneumonia. These findings indicate comparable results in terms of elevated nutritional and health risks when employing the Brazilian 2-item food-insecurity screen and the EBIA gold standard, as illustrated in Table 4.
The Brazilian 2-item food-insecurity screen demonstrated a sensitivity of 79.31%, specificity of 92.95%, positive predictive value of 74.62%, negative predictive value of 94.50%, and an ROC area of 86.13%. In comparison with the gold standard, the EBIA full scale, this screening tool exhibited high convergent validity concerning children's nutrition and health variables. As a result, it can be considered a valid instrument for identifying families at risk for food insecurity in various settings, including clinical environments.
Food security, defined as the consistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food for a healthy and active life, is a crucial component of an optimal environment for child rearing. However, this ideal scenario can be disrupted by various factors, such as financial constraints, environmental crises, or health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to varying degrees of food insecurity within families. Particularly during the formative years of rapid growth and brain development in children, access to nutritious food is paramount. In households facing food insecurity, strategies such as reducing food quality or quantity are often employed to stave off hunger. The concept of the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (EBIA) has been integrated into the data collection processes of national and regional surveys over time. Despite efforts to incorporate EBIA into surveys in Brazil, the high costs associated with implementation have resulted in long intervals between survey editions. Notably, EBIA was included in the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) in 2004, 2009, and 2013, the National Survey on Demography and Health of Women and Children (PNDS) in 2006, and the Family Budget Survey (POF) in its 2017/2018 edition. However, the comprehensive nature of EBIA data collection poses challenges in terms of time and effort, potentially hindering its implementation in the fast-paced routines of healthcare professionals in clinical settings.
Brazil currently benefits from concise survey versions like the adult eight-item and five-item scales. Nevertheless, the nation lacks a brief screening tool to swiftly evaluate individual households facing food insecurity. Introducing a 2-item screen would enable Brazil to promptly pinpoint families potentially residing in food-insecure homes, thereby mitigating health and developmental repercussions for both children and adults linked to food insecurity and hunger, as well as addressing urgent crises like COVID-19. To obtain a more thorough understanding of the extent and severity of food insecurity within populations, administering the lengthier version of EBIA is recommended.
To evaluate the validity, accuracy, and effectiveness of the proposed Brazilian 2-item food insecurity screen, a comprehensive analysis encompassing all seven components of its psychometric profile is essential. This includes sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, area under the ROC curve, and convergent validity.
The proposed Brazilian 2-item food insecurity screen demonstrated a sensitivity of 79.3 percent, indicating a solid foundation for the screening test. Additionally, the screen showed a specificity of 92.96 percent, suggesting its ability to accurately identify nearly all families living in food-secure households. This was further supported by a negative predictive value of 94.50 percent, indicating that households identified as negative by the screen were indeed food-secure. The screen effectively excludes families not at risk for food insecurity, thereby preventing unnecessary interventions and financial resource utilization. Furthermore, the Brazilian 2-item food insecurity screen displayed an accuracy of 90.13 percent and an area under the ROC curve of 86.13 percent, signifying its overall capability to distinguish households with and without food insecurity based on its outcomes.
The positive predictive value of 74.62% signifies the proportion of households with a positive screening result that are genuinely food-insecure, emphasizing the test's clinical utility. As the screening tool serves as a risk assessment measure, individuals screening positive will proceed to complete the EBIA full scale. Consequently, the positive predictive value of around 25% of households (false positives) suggests that a quarter of the sample will engage with the full scale despite being labeled as food secure by the gold standard. This prompts a deeper examination of the food security cut-off point established as the gold standard in this study.
EBIA's classification of households into four levels based on the sum of affirmative items is determined by cutoffs established through expert discussions, psychometric analyses, and policy considerations. The validated cut-off points for households with children in Brazil are as follows: Food Secure (0 questions affirmed); Mild Food Insecurity (1-5 questions affirmed); Moderate Food Insecurity (6-10 questions affirmed); and Severe Food Insecurity (11-15 questions affirmed). Therefore, households with up to 5 affirmative responses are considered food secure when combining Food Security and Mild Food Insecurity. This implies that some households classified as false positives are actually mildly food insecure. Consequently, these families could benefit from being identified as positive in the screening process, leading to a more accurate classification of food security or insecurity using the full EBIA scale. A study from 2016 suggested that Brazilian households endorsing only one item on the scale might be better placed in the same category as those with negative responses on all items, or considered food secure according to EBIA. This adjustment could help differentiate between food-secure and food-insecure households more effectively, ultimately reducing the number of false positives in the model.
The convergence between the food insecurity screen and health variables theoretically linked, adjusted for socioeconomic and demographic factors, demonstrated significance in four variables. These findings indicate that EBIA and the Brazilian 2-item food insecurity screen possess comparable efficacy in capturing the adverse effects of food insecurity on children's health. Children residing in food-insecure homes are at a higher risk of not consuming meat or fruits and vegetables daily, being categorized as underweight, and requiring hospitalization due to diarrhea or pneumonia. These health indicators underscore the heightened susceptibility of children in food-insecure environments, emphasizing the urgent necessity for prompt referrals to essential services.
The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered global public health and economic crises, posing significant challenges to the capacity of national, state, and local governments and policymakers to shield their populations from prolonged extreme deprivation. The constraints on resources due to the worldwide economic downturn will further exacerbate the pressures associated with addressing various forms of assistance, notably food aid. Consequently, there is an urgent requirement for a concise screening tool to pinpoint families and individuals vulnerable to food insecurity, essential for deployment in clinical environments, as well as by public health practitioners and social service providers.
In conclusion, implementing the Brazilian 2-item food insecurity screen is poised to effectively pinpoint families facing food insecurity, thereby alleviating strain on the healthcare system while offering a more accessible, cost-effective, and time-efficient solution. Moreover, this screening tool has the potential to prompt prompt and well-informed decision-making during crises like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, shedding light on the often overlooked yet detrimental issue of food insecurity.
There were limitations to this study. The authors acknowledge that while the methods employed for identifying items to be included in a screening tool were systematic and met established standards and replicability criteria from the Hunger Vital Sign™ set for this study, they were not as conservative or rigorous as item-response theory (IRT) methods. Additionally, the analyses were carried out using households with at least one child under 5 years of age, which implies that the applicability of the 2-item screening tool proposed here may not be the same in households with older children, adults, or elderly individuals. In contrast, the validation of the Hunger Vital Sign™ also utilized a similar sample, and the American tool has been validated for use in households with youth, adolescents, and adults. Therefore, further validation studies of the proposed Brazilian 2-item screening tool are necessary, utilizing samples from older populations and different household compositions.
