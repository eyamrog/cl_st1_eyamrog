In Brazil, mathematical models have been utilized to estimate and project COVID-19 cases, yet these models have been developed without incorporating data on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. To address this gap, we conducted a study to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in the State of Rio de Janeiro.
Methods: Data were collected from 2,857 blood donors between April 14 and 27, 2020. The study presents the crude prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the weighted prevalence adjusted for the total state population, and prevalence estimates adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity. Logistic regression models were employed to determine the correlates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, incorporating variables such as the period and site of blood collection, sociodemographic characteristics, and place of residence.
Results: The unadjusted proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests stood at 4.0% (95% CI 3.3-4.7%), while the weighted prevalence was slightly lower at 3.8% (95% CI 3.1-4.5%). Upon further adjustment for test sensitivity and specificity, estimates decreased to 3.6% (95% CI 2.7-4.4%) and 3.3% (95% CI 2.6-4.1%), respectively. Notably, the timing of blood collection emerged as a significant variable influencing prevalence, with later periods correlating with higher prevalence rates. In terms of socio-demographic factors, younger blood donors exhibited higher prevalence rates, while lower educational levels were associated with increased odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These trends were consistent across both unweighted and weighted prevalence analyses.
Discussion: Despite the convenience sample used in our study, our findings align with several fundamental principles. These include the observed upward trend over time, as evidenced by the continuing rise in the epidemic curve within the state. Additionally, our results indicate a higher prevalence among the younger population, who are more likely to be active in circulating within the community. Moreover, we found a greater prevalence among individuals with lower levels of education, potentially due to challenges in adhering to social distancing guidelines. Despite the acknowledged limitations of our study, it is reasonable to conclude that Rio de Janeiro is still far from achieving the necessary levels of natural herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Key words: COVID-19, Blood donors, Prevalence, Serology, SARS-CoV-2.
In December 2019, cases of severe pneumonia of unknown origin emerged in Wuhan, China. Following the initial report, the outbreak swiftly disseminated throughout the nation and globally within a brief timeframe. The identified causal agent was a betacoronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, which triggers a severe acute respiratory syndrome termed COVID-19 [1].
The rapid spread of infection and disease has reached nearly every country globally. By the end of the first week of May 2020, over 3.8 million cases had been confirmed, resulting in approximately 260,000 deaths worldwide [2]. In Brazil, as of May 6th, more than 125,000 cases had been confirmed, leading to 8,536 deaths and a lethality rate of approximately 7% [3]. The first case in the State of Rio de Janeiro was identified on March 1st, 2020, and as of May 6th, 13,295 cases had been reported, resulting in 1,205 deaths and a 9.1% lethality rate [3].
The infection can lead to mild symptoms, typically beginning with a cough, muscle pain, and anosmia, advancing to high fever and pneumonia with severe lung involvement [4], and, in certain instances, resulting in death [5, 6, 7]. Nevertheless, a majority of infections may progress with minimal or no symptoms, posing a considerable challenge in disease control as asymptomatic individuals could serve as a significant source of transmission [8].
The quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) stands as the gold standard for virus detection and confirmation of COVID-19 [9]. Several studies have highlighted a notable prevalence of false-negative results, attributed to various factors such as the type of biological sample, suboptimal sample collection, viral load fluctuations, and the time lapse between sample collection and symptom onset, all of which can significantly impact test outcomes [10]. In light of these challenges, the inclusion of serological tests becomes imperative, aiming to detect the presence of acute-phase antibodies (IgM) or memory antibodies (IgG). Given the urgency for swift outcomes, the necessity for a straightforward, sensitive, and specific test cannot be overstated, one that delivers immediate and precise results to promptly identify individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Such a test is crucial for facilitating the control of viral transmission and enabling timely public health interventions [11].
Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals holds critical importance for two primary reasons. Firstly, individuals who appear healthy in regions affected by the epidemic may carry the virus without exhibiting symptoms, serving as significant sources of transmission. In fact, during the initial stages of the outbreak in China, approximately 86% of infections went undetected, yet these cases accounted for about 79% of transmissions [8]. Secondly, the concept of herd immunity serves as a crucial metric for gauging the extent of infection spread within a community. Monitoring herd immunity levels can serve as a pivotal reference point for informing future decisions regarding the safe relaxation of social distancing measures, thereby reducing the risk of potential resurgence of epidemic outbreaks [12].
Despite the critical need for research in this area, there remains a scarcity of studies focusing on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic populations. One notable study that sheds light on this topic is the investigation conducted on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Following an outbreak on the ship, Japanese health authorities conducted RT-PCR tests on 3,063 passengers and determined that approximately 17.9% of all infected cases were asymptomatic. Similarly, a study carried out in Santa Clara County, California, USA, revealed a seroprevalence rate of 2.8% for SARS-CoV-2, after adjustments were made for test sensitivity, specificity, and population demographics.
Assessing the prevalence trends of viral infections among blood donors is crucial not only for estimating the effectiveness of blood safety strategies but also for enhancing current approaches to enhance transfusion safety and reduce the potential risk of Coronavirus transmission through blood transfusion. Additionally, determining the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors can serve as a means of monitoring the virus's circulation in healthy individuals, aiding in the implementation of strategies to mitigate transmission risks, particularly in the absence of seroprevalence surveys. However, there is a scarcity of studies focusing on prevalence among blood donors, with two unpublished studies revealing seroprevalence rates of 1.7% in Denmark and 2.7% in the Netherlands, respectively.
In the final two weeks of April 2020, a seroprevalence survey was carried out among voluntary blood donors at Hemorio, the primary blood center in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. This manuscript presents findings on the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a sample of 2,857 voluntary blood donors, with adjustments made for sex and age group. The aim of this study is to provide crucial information to health authorities for the purpose of estimating, extrapolating, and implementing health interventions. Notably, this is the initial investigation in Latin America to examine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic blood donors.
The cross-sectional study involved serological testing conducted on voluntary blood donors, coupled with an analysis of sociodemographic variables such as age, sex, donation site (fixed site or mobile vans), education level, and place of residence.
Demographic data were retrieved from the blood center's donor management software (SACS) using a unique code, ensuring donor anonymity. The study population comprises individuals who donated blood at Hemorio between April 14th and April 27th.
In Brazil, prior to donating blood, candidates are required to complete a written questionnaire and undergo a brief medical screening process. To qualify as blood donors at Hemorio, candidates must adhere to the eligibility criteria set forth by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the American Association of Blood Banks [18]. Recently, additional criteria have been introduced, specifically pertaining to COVID-19: potential donors must not have experienced flu-like symptoms within the 30 days leading up to donation; they should not have had close contact with individuals suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 in the month preceding donation; and they must not have traveled internationally within the last 30 days. Individuals presenting with a fever - with a forehead temperature exceeding 37.8oC - on the day of donation are also deemed ineligible. Consequently, all individuals approved for blood donation exhibit no symptoms of COVID-19 and lack any known epidemiological connection to the disease.
Upon acceptance and subsequent blood donation, participants were automatically enrolled in the study, contingent upon their willingness to sign the informed consent forms for blood donation and for the testing of additional pathogens beyond the mandatory list of infectious disease markers required for all blood donations in Brazil. The blood donation and sample collection procedures were conducted either at the Hemorio central facility or through mobile collections held in various locations such as churches and private condominiums within the Rio de Janeiro area.
The study received approval from the research ethics committee of Hemorio, with the assigned approval number being 4.008.095.
Inclusion criteria: The survey included all donors who were deemed eligible for donation throughout the study period.
Exclusion Criteria: Participants who declined to provide their signature on the Informed Consent Form for blood donation and subsequent testing were excluded from the study.
The serum obtained from the samples utilized for infectious disease marker tests was also employed for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. At the onset of the blood donation process, we systematically collected and barcoded these samples for each individual blood donor.
For the detection of IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, we utilized the MedTest Coronavirus 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM rapid test manufactured by MedLevensohn in Yuhang District, China. This immunochromatographic assay employs a combination of particles coated with SARS-COV-2 antigen to qualitatively detect IgG and IgM antibodies. The MedTest Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgG / IgM received licensing from the National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance/Anvisa in March 2020 (https://consultas.anvisa.gov.br/#/saude/q/?numeroRegistro=80560310056) and is capable of identifying SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in whole blood, capillary blood, serum, and plasma samples. The tests were conducted on serum samples following the manufacturer's guidelines.
Serum or plasma samples that tested positive for antibodies (IgM, IgG, or IgG + IgM) were subjected to qRT-PCR analysis for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using Molecular IDT IntegratedDNA TechnologiesSARS-CoV-2 – N1/N2/P assay from Promega, located in Madison, USA.
The tests were conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, utilizing the MDX Instrument by Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) for RNA extraction and the Applied Biosystem MDX thermocycler instrument from Thermo-Fisher (Waltham, USA). Specificity Estimates: To determine the specificity of the MedTest, we analyzed 100 plasma samples from Hemorio's blood donor repository, collected in 2018 prior to the onset of the new Coronavirus pandemic. All donors tested negative for infectious disease markers necessary for blood donation. Additionally, we examined 20 donor samples from 2018, all of which tested positive for at least one infection marker (anti-HIV, anti-HCV, HBsAg).
The data were securely stored in an Excel® spreadsheet, with demographic information and donor codes assigned to ensure the anonymity and confidentiality of individual donors. This approach was implemented to safeguard the privacy and identity of each donor, preventing any possibility of individual identification.
The estimation of the population prevalence of COVID-19 was conducted in three sequential steps. Initially, we presented the unadjusted proportion of positive tests. Subsequently, we calculated the weighted prevalence by considering the 2020 population distribution of Rio de Janeiro State, ensuring a representative sample in terms of sex and age. Finally, we adjusted the prevalence figures to account for test sensitivity and specificity, based on the manufacturer's reported values of 85% and 99% respectively. The true prevalence, along with its corresponding 95% confidence interval, was determined using a methodology outlined in a previously published study [19].
In the statistical analysis, two outcomes were considered: the unadjusted and weighted prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. Additionally, the analysis included variables such as sex, age group (18-29; 30-49; 50+), blood donation site (Hemorio, churches, condominiums), education level (no college education; college education), and place of residence (capital; other cities in the State of Rio de Janeiro). To explore a potential increasing trend, the test dates were grouped into three time periods (April 14th to 18th; April 19th to 23rd; April 24th to 27th).
In order to determine the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, logistic regression models were employed, with the odds ratio (OR) serving as the measure of association. Significance tests at the 5% level were utilized to examine the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 antibody (IgG, IgM, or IgG+IgM) prevalences and various characteristics of the blood donors, including sex, age group, educational level, place of residence, donation site, and period of donation. The statistical analysis was conducted using STATA version 13, developed by STATA Corp. in College Station, Texas, USA.
One out of the 120 true negative samples tested positive for IgM, with this positive sample originating from a confirmed anti-HCV+ donor. These findings led to specificity estimates of 99.16%, aligning closely with the manufacturer's estimated specificity of 95% CI 95.0% - 99.8%. Notably, all samples tested negative for IgG.
The study comprised 2,857 blood donors who underwent testing for IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 rapid tests. The overall prevalence of antibodies was found to be 4%, with detailed results presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3.
In terms of the type of detected antibodies, IgM-only accounted for 23.7% of positive cases, while IgG-only was present in 11.4% of cases, with IgM+IgG being detected in 64.9% of cases. Specific prevalence rates according to time periods (April 14-18th, April 19-23rd, and April 24-27th) are illustrated in Figure 1.
Table 1 presents four prevalence estimates for SARS-Cov-2. The crude prevalence, indicating the proportion of positive tests without adjustments, stood at 4.0% (95% CI 3.3-4.7%). When considering the weighted prevalence based on the Rio de Janeiro State population, this figure slightly decreased to 3.8% (95% CI 3.1-4.5%). Further adjustments factoring in test sensitivity and specificity led to even lower prevalence estimates compared to the crude figures: 3.6% (95% CI 2.7-4.4%) for the non-weighted prevalence and 3.3% (95% CI 2.6-4.1%) for the weighted prevalence.
In the logistic regression analyses presented in Table 2, several covariates exhibited significant associations with the crude prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Notably, the period of blood collection emerged as the most influential variable, with a clear trend indicating that later collection periods were linked to higher prevalence rates. Specifically, the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the third collection period were approximately two times greater than in the initial period (OR=2.05; 95% CI 1.33-3.16). Additionally, socio-demographic factors played a role in antibody prevalence, with younger blood donors and individuals with lower educational levels exhibiting higher odds of testing positive. However, no statistically significant differences were observed based on sex or municipality of residence (whether in the capital or elsewhere). Notably, the site of blood collection also demonstrated a significant association with prevalence rates, as blood donors from condominiums displayed notably lower prevalence rates compared to those from Hemorio.
The study revealed similar outcomes concerning the weighted SARS-Cov-2 antibody prevalence. The variables that exhibited significant associations with the crude prevalence were also found to be significantly linked to the weighted prevalence. Notably, the weighting of the sample led to a more pronounced statistical significance for certain demographics: the 18-29 age group (OR=1.86; 95% CI 1.12-3.08%), individuals with lower education levels (OR=2.11; 95% CI 1.35-3.28), and donors residing in condominiums (OR=0.45; 95% CI 0.23-0.86%) in comparison to Hemorio blood donors. Additionally, the time period was significantly correlated with the weighted prevalence (p<0.005), although the odds ratio was slightly higher for the crude prevalence.
In this study examining SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Brazilian blood donors, we identified a seroprevalence of 3.3% (CI: 2.6-4.1), adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity, and weighted based on the age and sex distribution of the Rio de Janeiro State population aged 18-69 years. This prevalence surpasses that reported in similar surveys conducted among blood donors in Denmark and the Netherlands (1.7% and 2.7%, respectively). Notably, we observed significant variability in prevalence across subgroups, with notably higher rates among younger individuals and those without a college education. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a consistent linear increase in prevalence over the three-week study period (2.8%, 4.5%, and 5.3%, respectively, p<0.01), primarily driven by a rise in IgG + IgM antibodies.
Two months after the first COVID-19 case was identified in the State of Rio de Janeiro, over thirteen thousand confirmed cases and a thousand deaths had been reported [3]. Despite the implementation of a variety of measures aimed at restricting social interactions and enhancing diagnostic capabilities in the initial weeks of March [20], the epidemic curve continues to escalate, with a looming threat of hospital services reaching capacity for COVID-19 care [21].
In the ongoing debate among public health researchers, professionals, health authorities, and the community, the question of when to lift or strengthen suppression measures has taken center stage. A potential guiding factor in making such decisions is the level of herd immunity achievable within the population, with estimates suggesting around 60% as a benchmark based on the basic reproduction number of the infection. Given the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, reaching this level of herd immunity would necessitate natural infection. However, in regions like Rio de Janeiro, where a collapse of the healthcare system is imminent, pursuing natural herd immunity is not a viable option as it would require easing current suppression measures, leading to a surge in COVID-19 related deaths. Conversely, maintaining stringent suppression measures can impede the development of herd immunity, complicate the implementation of exit strategies, and heighten the risk of future epidemic waves.
The findings of our study suggest that achieving an effective level of herd immunity in the short term poses a significant challenge. Therefore, any relaxation of social distancing guidelines in the near future would be ill-advised and should be approached with caution, considering the availability of critical hospital resources such as ICU beds and ventilators to ensure adequate care for severe COVID-19 cases. Additionally, the effectiveness of antibody response in preventing new infections remains uncertain. If only a small portion of individuals with antibodies exhibit neutralizing antibodies, the threshold for herd immunity would need to be raised. Consequently, it is probable that the desired level of herd immunity will not be attained until an efficacious vaccine is developed.
This study represents the inaugural large-scale seroprevalence survey for SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic individuals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While the survey's sampling method did not adhere to random population selection, it encompassed a diverse and socially varied healthy population, offering an initial perspective on antibody prevalence among asymptomatic individuals. The prevalence figures presented in our study have been adjusted for the test's sensitivity and specificity and are further adjusted based on the age and gender distribution of the population, providing a more accurate depiction of antibody prevalence at the population level.
Our results align with several fundamental premises. Firstly, the escalating seroprevalence over time was expected, given the upward trajectory of the epidemic curve in Rio de Janeiro for the past two months, showing no clear signs of abatement. Additionally, the higher prevalence among the younger demographic was foreseeable, as they constitute the primary workforce and are more prone to circulating and thus being exposed to infections, even amidst social distancing measures. The elevated infection rates among individuals with lower levels of formal education were also anticipated, as those in lower socioeconomic brackets likely face challenges in adhering to social distancing guidelines due to the need to seek sources of income. Moreover, many of them reside in overcrowded households with limited access to basic amenities like piped water, making it difficult to adopt essential hygiene practices. A study in Ceará revealed that individuals with primary education perceived themselves to be at lower risk of contracting COVID-19 and were less inclined to engage in voluntary quarantine compared to those with higher educational attainment. Lastly, it was expected that blood donors from residential complexes ("condos") would exhibit lower prevalence rates, as they donate blood within their living spaces and are likely adhering to social distancing guidelines at home. Conversely, donors at Hemorio are more likely to donate while commuting to the city center for work or other purposes.
Caution should be exercised when interpreting the results of our study. The population under study, while diverse in demographic and social characteristics, was a convenience sample. Therefore, any generalizations made to the entire population of the State of Rio de Janeiro, particularly within the age range of 18-69 years, should be approached with caution due to potential biases. Furthermore, the study population was not specifically chosen to provide estimates for various regions within the State, and it is anticipated that the prevalence of infection will vary significantly across different geographical areas of the city.
Despite the acknowledged limitations, it is evident that the establishment of protective levels of natural herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in Rio de Janeiro, under the current social distancing measures, remains a distant goal and should not be viewed as a viable target for informing immediate exit strategies. Consequently, the decision to ease social distancing measures in the short term should primarily hinge on the capacity of the healthcare system, pending a comprehensive serological survey at a larger, population-wide scale. This survey ought to be meticulously crafted to pinpoint disparities in herd immunity levels across the state, thereby facilitating the formulation of region-specific strategies that consider the varying degrees of immunity, population vulnerability, and the availability of essential resources for testing and managing severe cases of COVID-19.
