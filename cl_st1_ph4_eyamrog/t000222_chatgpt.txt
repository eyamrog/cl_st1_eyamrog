The conduct of Brazilian sports commentators amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic stands out as a significant observation. Throughout this period, despite the necessity for social distancing, these commentators persisted in their television broadcasts, aiming to alleviate the unease felt by their audience. Extensively, they engaged in discussions regarding previous matches, existing challenges, and the prospective trajectory of the sport. Notably, they refrained from delving into subjects beyond their domain of proficiency. While undoubtedly possessing viewpoints on the gravity of COVID-19, the efficacy of social distancing, or the utilization of medications endorsed by many without empirical backing, they conscientiously limited their commentary to the realm of sports, showcasing their commitment to their area of expertise.
It has been challenging to comprehend why certain physicians persist in offering opinions on unverified interventions for COVID-19 treatment. Some engage in medical proselytism, while others seem to overlook the necessity of rigorous scientific inquiry. Many opt to abstain from participating in such discussions altogether. However, the most confounding attitude is a reactionary response stemming from the fear of the unknown—a blend of desperation to care for patients and the inundation of information from social media that may sway doctors towards embracing any purportedly redemptive treatment. Regrettably, the only ailment addressed by this approach is the shared anxiety among doctors and their patients.
In this challenging landscape characterized by uncertainties, conflicting information, absence of effective leadership, and a deluge of unsubstantiated claims on social media, there exists the potential for falsehoods to be perceived as truths or at least as credible expectations, regardless of their absurdity. Regrettably, the disregard for rigorous scientific methodologies, often masked under the guise of altruistic intentions, fosters a climate of confusion and heightens the vulnerability of individuals who act upon such unfounded assertions.
The scientific and ethical integrity of research, particularly in the medical realm, has significantly advanced patient care globally, thanks to meticulous investigations conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964. Central to this Declaration is the fundamental tenet of respecting individuals, who must provide informed consent to partake in research endeavors, with their welfare taking precedence over the interests of science and society. Nevertheless, a pertinent question arises when considering the imposition of the patient's interests: how can the practice of randomization be ethically justified, especially when patients or healthcare providers harbor concerns about the potential of being assigned to a control group, potentially receiving a placebo, rather than the perceived promise of a curative intervention?
Understanding and accepting the scientific method is crucial in answering this question. While various ideas may seem effective in preliminary stages, only an objective demonstration of efficacy beyond chance warrants acceptance. A control group is essential for this purpose, enabling the determination of the benefit/risk ratio ("equipoise") of the intervention. Although participation in a control group may disappoint some patients and physicians, it is important to note that individuals involved in clinical trials generally fare better than those who are not, even if assigned to control or placebo groups. Therefore, a logical and safe approach to treating a patient in the absence of a definitive clinical answer is to enroll them in a clinical trial. This ensures they receive the best possible treatment under direct supervision while contributing to scientific progress.
The history of medicine is replete with instances of treatments once deemed "absolutely effective" by experts, only to be debunked as futile or even harmful through clinical trials. Cardiology, in particular, has seen numerous and striking cases of such futility and harm. Examples include the use of antiarrhythmic drugs to prevent sudden death in patients with ventricular extrasystoles post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI), magnesium for reducing infarcted areas, and beta-blockers for vasovagal syncope. These instances highlight the stark disparity between expectations based on perceived "common sense" and the actual therapeutic outcomes, leading to significant shifts in medical practice.
Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, various therapies, such as high doses of vitamins (C, D, and zinc), macrolides, chloroquine and its derivatives, corticosteroids, antivirals, and other medications, which have been deemed as potentially miraculous, have undergone clinical trials for other viral infections like HIV, Ebola, and H1N1. Despite initial hopes for their efficacy in these contexts, none have proven to be both safe and effective. While there is a possibility that some of these treatments could exhibit different outcomes in the current COVID-19 crisis, such assumptions must be subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny commensurate with the urgency and severity of the situation.
Regrettably, many recommendations for combating COVID-19 are grounded in pseudo-evidence. The study that brought hydroxychloroquine into the spotlight, famously endorsed by Donald Trump as potentially revolutionary in medical history, is scientifically flawed. The researchers aimed to assess the impact of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 patient outcomes. However, the study lacked the essential setup of two comparable patient groups, with only one group receiving the drug. Instead, the groups differed in terms of the drugs administered, hospital origins, age demographics, clinical statuses, and additional treatments received. Notably, the patients also exhibited varying viral loads. With such pronounced discrepancies, it becomes challenging to isolate the specific effects of hydroxychloroquine. Furthermore, the exclusion of four patients who either died or required intensive care after receiving the drug from the final analysis raises concerns about the prioritization of outcomes. This action implies a potential bias towards viral detection over patient survival. Moreover, the study's limited sample size further hinders the ability to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding the treatment's efficacy.
It is disheartening when a study falls short of addressing the intended question, but it is even more concerning when it incites social unrest. This particular article underwent peer review by colleagues and an editor, individuals who could have averted the repercussions of its publication through responsible action. The presence of a pandemic should not serve as a justification for disregarding scientific principles, as errors in research can lead to the dissemination of false expectations that have the potential to endanger lives.
There has been a range of interpretations of these data within the global medical community. While some advocate for the use of chloroquine, this perspective is not universally accepted. Many healthcare workers who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 have willingly participated in randomized clinical trials to contribute to the generation of high-quality data that could potentially benefit numerous individuals. It is noteworthy that these professionals have come together as research subjects in clinical trials to gather data on a disease they are actively combatting. This collaborative effort is the right course of action. Only meticulously designed and meticulously executed clinical studies, overseen by professionals, hospitals, and medical societies worldwide, and spearheaded by clinical research experts, can provide accurate insights. The medical community has a responsibility to overcome the obstacles posed by a lack of understanding of scientific methodologies. Relying on "common sense" and collective sentiment alone cannot justify methodological errors that could have detrimental effects on countless lives. Physicians are expected to act ethically and pragmatically, guided by the best available scientific knowledge. Let us strive to be true experts when supported by high-quality scientific evidence. Ultimately, truth prevails, and science serves as the most efficient means to approach it. As healthcare professionals and scientists, our duty is to bridge the gap between assumptions and evidence-based conclusions, benefiting both patients and the broader population seeking answers from medical science.
