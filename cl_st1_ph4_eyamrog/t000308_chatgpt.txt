A 65-year-old male patient (patient 1), previously healthy, returned from a trip to Egypt with a stopover in New York in March 2020. After 5 days, he exhibited symptoms including coryza, asthenia, myalgia, dry cough, unconfirmed fever, and mild dyspnea. His 67-year-old wife (patient 2), who had also traveled with him, developed identical symptoms the following day. Two days after patient 1's symptoms began, their condition deteriorated, prompting a visit to the Emergency Room. Upon examination, patient 1 was found to be afebrile, experiencing severe dyspnea, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation at 90%, normotensive, and acyanotic. Patient 2, on the other hand, was afebrile, breathing normally, with an oxygen saturation of 95%, normotensive, and acyanotic. Laboratory tests for both patients did not reveal any significant abnormalities.
The chest radiographs exhibited normal findings, while the chest CT scans revealed bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in both patients, some of which were accompanied by areas of consolidation (refer to Figure 1). Notably, there were no indications of pleural effusion or lymph node enlargement in either patient.
Patients exhibiting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 underwent sample collection for SARS-CoV-2 detection via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Following admission to the intensive care unit under isolation precautions, both patients tested positive for COVID-19. Patient 1 experienced a deteriorating condition characterized by respiratory and renal failure, ultimately resulting in death. In contrast, Patient 2 showed signs of clinical improvement, remaining hospitalized but no longer requiring intensive care unit support.
Radiological examinations play a crucial role in the timely identification and management of COVID-19. While chest radiography lacks sensitivity in the early stages of the disease and may present normal results during the initial phase of infection, it is not advised as the primary imaging modality for COVID-19.
High-resolution chest CT stands out as the most efficient radiological method for promptly identifying lung complications associated with COVID-19. The most extensive study conducted thus far, encompassing 3,665 confirmed cases, revealed that CT accurately diagnosed pulmonary abnormalities in 95.5% (n = 3,498) of the patients. This diagnostic tool not only furnishes crucial insights for accurate diagnosis but also aids in assessing the extent of lung damage induced by COVID-19, thereby informing clinical interventions.
