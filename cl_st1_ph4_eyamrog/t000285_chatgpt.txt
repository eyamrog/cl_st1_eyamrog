Context and Objective: With the daily increase in COVID-19 cases globally, the impact of arboviral infections on the healthcare systems of tropical countries has become a significant concern. The potential outcomes for patients and healthcare systems in the event of a syndemic remain unclear. Therefore, our objective is to conduct a systematic review of the literature to identify evidence that elucidates the clinical presentation, severity, and prognosis of coinfection involving SARS-CoV-2 and arboviruses.
Design and setting: This protocol outlines a rapid living systematic review that adheres to the recommendations set forth in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. The review will encompass prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and case series involving patients with confirmed diagnoses of SARS-CoV-2 and Arboviral infections. The search strategy will be conducted without language restrictions across various databases including Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane Library (specifically Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - CENTRAL), Portal Regional BVS - LILACS, Scopus, and WebOfScience to identify a range of published, ongoing, and unpublished studies. Selection and data extraction will be carried out by two authors, while the critical appraisal of the included studies will be conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The certainty of evidence will be assessed utilizing the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.
The global spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has led to an ever-evolving epidemiological landscape. As of April 29, 2020, data indicates that 210 countries and territories have been affected, with nearly 3 million confirmed cases and a death toll exceeding 200,000 (1).
In tropical regions, countries are grappling with the resurgence of old endemic diseases. Brazil, for instance, reported over 600,000 probable Dengue cases, nearly 18,000 probable Chikungunya cases, and more than 2,000 probable Zika cases by mid-March 2020. Mortality figures attributed to these urban arboviruses totalled 224.
Epidemiologists have raised concerns about a potential temporal correlation between the outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Dengue in Brazil during the first half of 2020. Recent progress in comprehending COVID-19 has highlighted significant similarities in the pathophysiological mechanisms, as well as the clinical manifestations, between SARS-CoV-2 infection and arbovirus infections in general, including fever and an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response.
This finding suggests a potential scenario of misdiagnosis that could result in delayed diagnosis, incorrect treatment, and inefficient allocation of resources (2,4). The implications of a possible syndemic on patients and health systems remain unclear. Therefore, our objective is to conduct a systematic review of the literature to identify evidence describing the clinical presentation, severity, and prognosis of a coinfection involving SARS-CoV-2 and Arboviruses. This review aims to offer decision-makers support in preparing for potential syndemic scenarios in the future.
This study presents a protocol outlining the rationale, hypothesis, and planned methods for our systematic review, which has been submitted for registration on the PROSPERO platform. Given the urgent demand for timely evidence in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, we aim to conduct a rapid living systematic review by streamlining the process through initial screening of titles and abstracts by a single author. Furthermore, our study will employ a living methodology, ensuring continuous updates and integration of new clinical trial registrations and pertinent data as they emerge. This systematic approach adheres to the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.
We will incorporate cohort studies, case-control studies, and case series that delineate the clinical presentation, severity, and prognostic implications of a coinfection involving SARS-CoV-2 and Arboviruses.
We will include patients of any age who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as those who have tested positive for any type of Arbovirus infection, such as Dengue, Zika, Yellow Fever, among others.
Patients coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and any type of arboviral infection are of particular interest due to the potential implications on disease severity and clinical outcomes. Arboviruses, transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes and ticks, encompass a diverse group of viruses including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and West Nile virus. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and arboviruses in coinfected individuals remains poorly understood, with limited data available on the clinical course, immune response, and treatment strategies for such cases. Given the overlapping symptoms and potential for exacerbation of disease manifestations, further research is warranted to elucidate the impact of dual infection on patient management and public health interventions. Understanding the dynamics of coinfection is crucial for optimizing diagnostic approaches, therapeutic interventions, and preventive measures in regions endemic for both SARS-CoV-2 and arboviral infections.
Patients infected solely with SARS-CoV-2.
The outcome measures used in this study were carefully selected to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. These measures included standardized tests, self-report questionnaires, and observational assessments. The standardized tests were chosen for their reliability and validity in measuring the specific constructs targeted by the intervention. Self-report questionnaires were utilized to gather subjective data from participants regarding their experiences and perceptions. Observational assessments were conducted to provide objective data on participants' behavior and interactions. By using a combination of these measures, a comprehensive evaluation of the intervention's impact was achieved.
Primary outcomes of this study include mortality rate, length of hospital stay, and disease severity.
Secondary outcomes included clinical characteristics, length of stay in the intensive care unit, the necessity for invasive mechanical ventilation, hospitalization rate, and time to clinical improvement.
We will incorporate studies conducted since November 2019, without any language or publication site limitations.
We will conduct a comprehensive search for relevant studies using various databases including Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane Library - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Portal Regional BVS - LILACS, Scopus, and Web of Science. This search will involve the use of appropriate descriptors and synonyms tailored to each database to identify a range of published, ongoing, and unpublished studies. In addition to these databases, we will explore COVID-19 specific resources such as Epistemonikos COVID-19 LÂ·OVE platform, ClinicalTrials, and The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). Furthermore, we will employ the snowballing technique by examining the reference lists of the included studies to ensure a thorough search strategy.
The search strategy will be formulated using terms relevant to SARS-CoV-2 as well as those pertaining to arboviral infections. No restrictions will be imposed based on language or publication site.
One author (KMM) will be responsible for selecting the titles and abstracts of studies to be included in this review. In cases where duplicate studies are identified, only one will be considered. If reports involve the same participants but with varying outcome measures or assessment time points, they will be treated as a single study. Following the removal of duplicates, KMM will review the study titles and abstracts, excluding those that clearly do not meet the eligibility criteria. The remaining studies will undergo a thorough assessment by two authors (APR and ACPNP) for potential inclusion in the review. Any disagreements between authors during this process will be resolved by a third author (KMM). Explanations for study exclusions will be provided, and to streamline the screening and selection process, the Rayyan software (6) will be utilized.
The data extraction will be independently carried out by two authors (CRRF and FSAR), with any discrepancies or disagreements being resolved through discussion or, if needed, by involving a third author (VFMT). A data extraction form will be created to systematically gather information from the included studies, covering aspects such as: (I) Demographic and clinical profiles of the patients; (II) Time points utilized for assessments; (III) Epidemiological features; (IV) Outcome measures; (V) Funding sources; and (VI) Potential conflicts of interest.
In evaluating the potential for conducting a meta-analysis, we will extract the subsequent data for every primary and secondary outcome measure: (a) Total patient count (per group); (b) Event count in each group (for dichotomous outcomes); (c) Average, standard deviation, standard error, median, interquartile range, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence interval (CI) (for continuous outcomes); (d) p-value.
The critical appraisal of included studies will be conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (7), while the quality of evidence will be evaluated through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) (8). Two authors (NCJ and VTC) will be responsible for performing the critical appraisal and assessing the certainty of the evidence. Any disagreements arising from these assessments will be resolved through discussion and, if needed, with the assistance of a third author (VFMT).
This systematic review protocol adheres to the PRISMA-P guidelines (9).
When two or more studies exhibit adequate homogeneity in terms of their design, participant characteristics, and outcome measurements, we will consider the feasibility of combining their findings through meta-analysis. In cases where there is a lack of information or the studies are notably heterogeneous, a qualitative synthesis will be conducted to summarize the results.
In assessing prognosis, we will adhere to the guidelines set forth by Cochrane and the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group. Our meta-analysis will be conducted using R software. When the response variable is continuous, we will analyze it in terms of mean difference (MD) or Hedgeâs/Cohenâs (SMD). For dichotomous responses, we will combine hazard ratios (unadjusted or adjusted) or odds ratios with their respective standard errors for outcomes such as hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, respiratory support for adult inpatients with COVID-19, and mortality. Other parameters like standard deviation (for MD or SMD) and the number of events (RR or OR) will also be pooled. Throughout, we will employ the generic inverse variance method with a random-effects model, utilizing the "meta" package (version 4.11-0).
In instances where studies do not furnish a mean and its corresponding standard deviation (SD), we will rely on the information and outcomes disclosed in the text or tables, employing appropriate inferential techniques. Should the predetermined parameters be absent, we will derive estimates from alternative parameters, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the information presented.
We will reach out to the principal investigators of the studies included in our research to request supplementary data or seek clarification on any issues pertaining to the studies. Should we not receive a response from the authors, we will present the data in a descriptive fashion, refraining from making any assumptions or imputations.
The Cochranâs Q test will be utilized to evaluate the presence of heterogeneity, with a threshold of a P value < 0.1 indicating the presence of heterogeneity. Furthermore, statistical heterogeneity will be evaluated by analyzing the Higgins I2 statistic based on the following thresholds: < 25% indicating no heterogeneity, 25% to 49% indicating low heterogeneity, 50% to 74% indicating moderate heterogeneity, and â¥ 75% indicating high heterogeneity.
The clinical presentation, severity, and prognostic implications of a co-infection involving SARS-CoV-2 and an Arboviral infection remain inadequately defined. Nevertheless, it is evident that a syndemic scenario would pose an added challenge and strain on the healthcare and economic infrastructures of countries endemic to arboviral diseases. It is imperative to gather robust evidence to inform the development of strategies to combat the COVID-19 crisis effectively. Therefore, this expedited living review aims to methodically evaluate the most pertinent evidence to address this complex situation and furnish decision-makers with dependable information.
