ABSTRACT – (Survey of mosses (Bryophyta) along visitor trails in the Parque Nacional do Caparaó, 
Espírito Santo State, Brazil). Bryophyta, the mosses, are an abundant plant group in humid 
environments. In the Atlantic Coastal Forest of Southeastern Brazil, they are found in great richness 
and diversity, especially in the montane regions.  In this context, the Parque Nacional do Caparaó, 
where our study was conducted, is known for its mountain environment and high altitude. Although 
a considerable number of moss collections from the western part of the park is already deposited in 
herbaria, the eastern side belonging to the state of Espírito Santo State had been undersampled until 
now. For this pioneering work, we covered the park's main visitation trails during three intensive days 
of collections. We found 59 species of mosses, belonging to 38 genera and 22 families. Nine species 
are new occurrences for the state and 14 are Brazilian endemics. Most species were found growing 
on soil. We found more species at altitudes above 1,500 m a.s.l. Sematophyllaceae was the richest 
moss family.  
Keywords: Atlantic Forest, bryophytes, cloud forest, high fields, Ombrophilous Forest 
 
RESUMO – (Levantamento de musgos (Bryophyta) em trilhas de visitação no Parque Nacional do 
Caparaó, Estado do Espírito Santo, Brasil). No Brasil, os musgos (Bryophyta) são encontrados com 
maior riqueza e diversidade na Mata Atlântica, especialmente em ambientes montanhosos e úmidos 
como o encontrado no Parque Nacional do Caparaó.  A coleta do material foi realizada durante três 
dias onde percorremos as principais trilhas de visitação do parque. Foram identificadas 59 espécies 
pertencentes a 38 gêneros e 22 famílias. Nove espécies são novas ocorrências para o Estado e 14 são 
endêmicas do país. A família mais rica em espécies foi Sematophyllaceae. As espécies terrícolas são 
as mais frequentes. A maior riqueza de espécies foi observada em altitudes acima de 1.500 m alt. 
Embora se tenha considerável número de coletas depositadas nos herbários, oriundos da porção oeste 
do parque, este é um trabalho pioneiro na região que se estende pelo Espírito Santo.

Introduction 
Bryophytes are nonvascular land plants that include mosses (Bryophyta, Goffinet et al. 2009), 
liverworts (Machantiophyta, Crandall-Stotler et al. 2009) and hornworts (Anthocerotophyta, 
Renzaglia et al. 2009). Usually, they are small in size and colonize a wide variety of substrates and 
ecosystems, except for marine habitats (Costa et al. 2010, Vanderpoorten & Goffinet 2009). They are 
dependent on humidity mainly due to the presence of flagellated gametes and the poikilohydric 
mechanism, which is why they are more frequent in humid environments, such as the Atlantic Forest. 
This domain holds almost 90% of the Brazilian bryoflora (Costa et al. 2010, Costa & Peralta 2015). 
Conservation Units (CU) have great relevance in protecting the biodiversity of forest remnants. The 
Parque Nacional do Caparaó (PNC) is an important conservation unit located in southeastern Brazil. 
It includes the third highest peak of the country, the “Pico da Bandeira”, rising to 2,892 m above sea 
level (a.s.l.). Due to its vast extent, the PNC presents a variety of environments and different 
vegetation compositions, thus possessing great biodiversity that still needs to be discovered and better 
understood. Furthermore, the park has some waterfalls suitable for swimming, attracting many 
visitors throughout the year. The last state tourism report, from 2014 to 2017, counted an average of 
10,000 visitors per year, with peaks of up to 2,500 visitors per month during high season (Jun-Aug) 
(ICMBio 2021a; OTE-ES 2018). Therefore, a great ally of conservation is to know the biological 
diversity of these environments that receive tourists and visitors, as they are as important as the 
preserved areas. 
Even though the Southeast of the country is a well-known and already studied area, there are no 
published studies related to the bryoflora of the PNC. Only a few records of occasional collections 
exist (Yano & Peralta 2008, Yano 2010, 2012). For the state of Espírito Santo, scientific works are 
still scarce and among the most recent we can only mention Costa & Silva (2003) and Yano (2005) 
in board forests, Silva & Piassi (2010) in restinga, Silva (2011), Silva & Bastos (2012) and Sousa & 
Faria (2016) and Faria et al. (2020) in Ombrophilous Forest. The aim of our study was to carry out a 
survey of mosses that occur along the PNC visitation trails beginning at the entrance of the Espírito

Santo portion in order to increase the knowledge of the bryophyte flora in the state, of the Atlantic 
Forest and to contribute to the conservation of ecologically important species, especially threatened 
ones. 
 
Material and methods 
Study site - The Parque Nacional do Caparaó (PNC, figure 1) is located in the Southeast of Brazil 
along the boundary of the States Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo (20°37' to 20°19'S and 41°43' to 
41°55'W). Its territory extends almost 32,000 ha with nearly 80% (the entire eastern portion) of it 
belonging to the municipalities of Espírito Santo State (ICMBio accessed 06/01/2021a, Coutinho 
2015). The Park is entirely immersed in the Atlantic Forest domain with predominance of Dense 
Mountain Ombrophilous Forest and Dense High Mountain Ombrophilous Forest in the study site 
(Coutinho 2015). In addition to forests, we can find high elevation grass lands at 1,600 to 1,700 m 
a.s.l with herbaceous to shrubby vegetation and rocky outcrops (ICMBio accessed 06/01/2021a; 
Coutinho 2015). The climate is described as tropical in altitude, with average annual temperatures 
around 19 °C to 22 °C and annual rainfall between 1,000 and 1,500 mm, with higher volumes from 
November to January (ICMBio accessed 06/01/2021b). 
 
Data collection, identification and analysis - Authorization for the collection of specimens was given 
by the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (number 47090-4). The data 
collection was carried out during three days in May 2015, along the main access road to the camps 
and on the trails to some waterfalls. The main road is 9 km long and partially paved, this route can be 
done by car. We visited the waterfalls “Aurélio” and “Sete pilões” along hiking trails that can be 
considered narrow and of moderate difficulty, with extensions by 1000 and 210 m, respectively 
(ICMBio accessed 12/02/2020a). The collection was conducted with the aim to capture the diversity 
of species at each site, that is, there was no exhaustive search of specimens - species repeated within 
one site were intentionally not collected again and not abundantly sampled. The plants were collected

manually or with a spatula on all available substrates. In total we collected 125 samples. The samples 
were stored in paper bags according to the methodology proposed by Yano (1984) also with 
environmental information such as degree of sun exposure and geographical coordinates. The 
colonized substrate classification is based on Robbins (1952) with modifications: corticicolous (trunk 
or living branch), epixilous (trunk, fallen branch or leaves), epiphyllous (upon leaves), rupicolous 
(upon rocks), terricolous (on soil) and others (e.g. termite mound, anthropized substrates). For 
identification we used specific literature such as Reese (1993), Sharp et al. (1994), Buck (1998), 
Gradstein et al. (2001), Vaz-Imbassahy et al. (2008), Peralta & Yano (2010), Costa et al. (2010) and 
Costa (2015). The classification adopted for the mosses in this work is in agreement with Goffinet et 
al. 2009, except by the Sematophyllaceae family, following Carvalho-Silva et al. (2017). Taxa names 
was checked and corrected using the Tropicos® database (Tropicos 2015). Data of global distribution 
and of the Brazilian states, as well as the phytogeographic domains are in accordance with the 
information available in Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021), being verified in the Global Biodiversity 
Information Facility (Gbif 2021) and Splink (Splink 2021) databases, once the collection information 
is reliable as, at least, identified by specialist and more than one collected. The information regarding 
the conservation status and the endemism of the species are in specific literature (Yano & Peralta 
2007, Martinelli & Moraes 2013, Flora do Brasil 2020 2021). 
We defined four altitudinal zones based on the predominant vegetation type: (I) < 1,500 m a.s.l.; (II) 
1,500 to 1,900 m a.s.l.; (III) 1,900 to 2,200 m a.s.l.; (IV) > 2,200 m a.s.l; in order to describe the 
distribution and richness of families along the sampled sites. 
 
Results 
Here, we report 59 species of mosses belonging to 38 genera and 22 families (table 1).  Nine species 
are new occurrences for the state, most notably Physcomitrium falcifolium Müll. Hal. ex Broth and 
Atractylocarpus brasiliensis (Müll.Hal.) R.S. Williams which are classified as Vulnerable and 
Endangered, respectively, in the last red list available for Brazil (Martinelli & Moraes 2013). In the

red list of Espírito Santo (Fraga et al. 2019), Brittonodoxa lithophila (Hornsch.) W.R. Buck, 
P.E.A.S.Câmara & Carv.-Silva, Itatiella ulei (Broth. ex Müll. Hal.) G.L.Sm. (Yano & Peralta 2007, 
Fraga et al. 2019) and Schizymenium campylocarpum (Hook. & W.-Arn.) Shaw are treated as 
Vulnerable, Vulnerable and Critically Endangered, respectively. The richest families were the 
Sematophyllaceae (8 species), Leucobryaceae (6spp.), Polytrichaceae and Bryaceae (5 spp.) (figure 
2). We found that the most species which is about 53% are unique to the Atlantic Forest and among 
the others occurrences observed, the most related biome was the Cerrado and Amazon Forest with 
37% and 35%, respectively. When considering the global distribution presented by the species, 31% 
of them have a neotropical, 15% a pantropical, 15% a cosmopolitan distribution, while 24% are 
endemic to Brazil and the others (15%) have disjunct distributions. Most of our samples were 
colonizing terricolous substrate (47%) followed by rupicolous ones (28%) (figure 3).  
Altitudinal zones II and III exhibited the largest number of families, 12 and 17, respectively (figure 
4). Some of the families were only present in one altitudinal zone: Pterobryaceae (1sp) in zone I; 
Orthotrichaceae (2sp), Calymperaceae and Rhacocarpaceae (1 sp) in zone II; Mniaceae (2 sp), 
Phyllogoniaceae, Pilotrichaceae and Neckeraceae (1 sp) in zone III; Hedwigiaceae (1 sp) in zone IV. 
The family Bryaceae was the most common, being present in all zones, but with greater richness in 
zone III with a total of four species. Below is a diagnostic characterization for endemic and new 
citations (*), listed in alphabetical order by family.

Discussion 
The diversity recently recorded for the state of Espírito Santo is 492 bryophyte species (486, Costa 
& Peralta 2015), out of which 263 are mosses (Flora do Brasil 2020,2021). However, Yano (2012) 
cataloged for the state 531 taxa of which 286 are mosses, distributed in 134 genera and 50 families. 
Despite the significant decrease in the number of species, which may come from synonymous taxa 
or misidentifications, our state remains among the 10 richest states in the country (Costa & Peralta 
2015, Flora do Brasil 2020 2021). Over the years, studies conducted in the state have demonstrated 
the bryoflora’s biodiversity potential, for example: Peralta & Yano (2011) have listed 89 moss species 
in the Mello Leitão Museum herbarium and 21 new records for the state. Silva (2011) found 126 moss 
species, with 35 new occurrences in Dense Montane and Upper Montane Ombrophylous Forest. Yano 
(2016) listed 67 moss taxa in the state “Tabuleiro” Forests, with 15 new occurrences. And recently,

Faria et al. (2020) published a work carried out in an Ombrophylous Forest, reporting 102 moss 
species with 33 species as new occurrences. In this study, we found almost 1/4 of the recorded moss 
diversity for Espírito Santo State (Flora do Brasil 2020 2021) as well as 9 new citations.  
Regarding the observed families, Gradstein et al. (2001) describe that Sematophyllaceae, 
Leucobryaceae and Bryaceae are among the richest families in the Neotropics, also in Brazil and in 
the Atlantic Forest corroborated by Costa & Peralta (2015) Sematophyllaceae is quite common in the 
Atlantic Forest (Silva Rodrigues & Valente 2015, Silva 2012, Valente et al. 2009, Costa & Lima 
2005) and is considered the fifth richest family in Brazil as well as Bryaceae. The Leucobryaceae 
family has a wide distribution in the globe and is commonly found in open environments in montane 
rain forests, especially the genus Campylopus (Gradstein et al. 2001), that have adaptations to 
luminosity and desiccation, such as hyalocysts (hyaline cells) and hair points (Glime 2007). In fact, 
there is a great diversity of bryophytes registered in the Atlantic Forest, mainly in montane 
environments.  
The composition of bryoflora in our work proved to be more related to that occurring in the Cerrado 
and in the Amazon Forest. Between the two biomes, the Cerrado is the closest to the Atlantic Forest, 
however, the Amazon Forest is the second richest biome in the country (Costa & Peralta 2015, Flora 
do Brasil 2020 2021), it also has great affinity with the flora observed in the Atlantic Forest, since 
they have an evolutionary historical relationship. Many listed taxa, with the exception of the exclusive 
ones, has distribution both in the Cerrado and in the Amazon Forest. Corroborating with other studies 
carried out in the state, such as Sousa & Faria (2016) and Faria et al. (2020). 
 A large number of species (46%) was recorded occurring on terricolous substrate, in fact, it is 
common to find bryophytes colonizing along the roadside with increasing altitude (Frahm 2003) and 
even with the increased occurrence of exposed rocks. Even though our collections were carried out 
mainly along partially open trails, we find a diversity of habitats along these paths providing us with 
a considerable representativeness of species, including diverse substrates.

Corroborating this, we found greater diversity of mosses and a higher number of families exclusive 
to one altitudinal zone between 1,500m - 2,100m altitude. As also observed in others remains of the 
Atlantic Forest, such as in Rio de Janeiro (Costa & Lima 2005), in the Serra de Ibitipoca (Siviero 
2010), an area in transition with the Cerrado, in the Serra do Cipó (Yano & Peralta 2011) and in the 
north of São Paulo (Visnadi 2005). The diversity of microhabitats and microclimates found in these 
areas favors the establishment of a high richness of bryophytes (Costa & Lima 2005). Therefore, 
studies such as this one must be continued in this domain, especially in the Espírito Santo State, which 
has a diversity of environments still unexplored. The importance of the data for the state is 
demonstrated in the high number of new records and the connected expansion in knowledge for the 
group. In the case of the PNC, it is urgent to survey the liverworts, which, like mosses, will certainly 
demonstrate a considerable taxonomic richness. Also, taxonomic revision studies, species list or new 
occurrences reports should be continuous and frequently updated. In this way, we will be able to pave 
the way for new issues and thus contribute to the group's knowledge and consequently strengthen the 
preservation of the Atlantic Forest and its remnants.
