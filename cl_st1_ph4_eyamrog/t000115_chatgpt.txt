The prevalence of intestinal parasites among indigenous populations is significantly influenced by environmental and socio-cultural factors, presenting a persistent public health concern. Mass administration of broad-spectrum drugs is a common strategy to combat these infections. A study conducted in an indigenous Guarani village assessed the prevalence of intestinal parasites in schoolchildren before and after the community-wide treatment with albendazole. Initially, 81.4% of stool samples tested positive for enteroparasites, and post-treatment, following two rounds of antiparasitic medication, the rate increased to 87.5%. While the treatment led to a reduction in infections caused by certain helminths, a substantial number of parasites persisted in the population, indicating a shift in the epidemiological landscape of these diseases. The study revealed that despite the mass administration of albendazole, the prevalence of intestinal parasites among indigenous schoolchildren remained alarmingly high.
Intestinal parasitic infections represent a significant health burden in developing nations and are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as neglected tropical diseases.
In indigenous villages, despite the implementation of sanitation measures, health services frequently struggle to contain these infections. This challenge stems from the elevated rates of parasitic transmission, which thrive in the environmental and socio-cultural contexts of these communities, presenting a persistent public health concern.
The indigenous populations residing in the State of Paraná, situated in the southern region of Brazil, are predominantly from the Kaingang and Guarani ethnic groups, with a small number of Xetá individuals still existing.
Various researchers have explored the prevalence of enteroparasites primarily among the indigenous Kaingang population, but also within the peridomiciliary soil, drinking water, and recreational water sources in the indigenous villages they inhabit. Additionally, studies have focused on identifying local high-risk areas for the transmission of these infections.
A high prevalence of enteroparasites has been documented in indigenous populations in Paraná, with rates ranging from 67% to 95% depending on the region studied. In Kaingang territories, the contamination of peridomiciliar soil samples by enteroparasites from humans or animals with zoonotic potential varied from 75.7% to 96.2%. Additionally, waterborne protozoa like Giardia spp and Cryptosporidium spp were found in water sources. These results suggest that the management of human and animal waste in indigenous areas is insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced sanitation practices, improved water treatment methods, and regular administration of antiparasitic medications to the population.
The management of geo-helminthiasis in children within school settings proves to be a viable strategy for parasite control, given that geo-helminths do not proliferate within the human body. The use of broad-spectrum medications not only diminishes the prevalence of the disease but also reduces the intensity of infection in both individuals and the communities they inhabit. When determining target areas for intervention, emphasis should be placed on regions with elevated rates of geo-helminth infections, coupled with inadequate basic sanitation facilities including water supply and sewage management systems.
Research conducted with Guarani indigenous communities in southern Brazil has revealed that the administration of antiparasitic medications has been a key strategy in combating infections, with albendazole emerging as a widely utilized treatment option within this population. (Citation 13,14)
According to the World Health Organization (2018), periodic treatment serves as a preventive and effective measure in reducing the parasitic burden and its associated consequences. To ensure successful outcomes in school-based control strategies, it is imperative to meticulously plan activities that encompass a seamless coordination between the local health and education systems, culminating in the monitoring and evaluation of the intervention.
In this study, we sought to address the dearth of data concerning parasitological health indicators among the Guarani indigenous population and the efficacy of parasitic treatment within this community. Our primary objective was to assess the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis among school-aged children residing in a Guarani indigenous village located in the State of Paraná. Specifically, we aimed to investigate the frequency of these parasitic infections both prior to and following treatment with antiparasitic medication, which was implemented as the sole intervention strategy for disease control within this population.
The research obtained approval from the National Research Ethics Committee – CONEP, under registration number 1.756.060/2016. Participation in the study was contingent upon parents or guardians signing the Free and Informed Consent Form - FICF. Additionally, the research received approval from local indigenous leaders and the Litoral Sul Special Indigenous Sanitary District (DSEI), where the indigenous village under study is situated.
The research was carried out at the indigenous school within the Ocoy Indigenous Land (IL), specifically at the Aldeia de Santa Rosa do Ocoy, situated in the Municipality of São Miguel do Iguaçu in the western region of the State of Paraná, southern Brazil. The coordinates for this location are 25° 20′ 50″ S, 54° 14′ 6″ W.
The village encompasses an area of 251 hectares and is home to approximately 900 individuals from the Guarani ethnic group. These residents are spread across 106 households, with a notable concentration in the younger age brackets.
The village is located 18.2 km away from the municipality of São Miguel do Iguaçu, with partially paved access. Some indigenous residents engage in work outside the village, particularly in agricultural and avian cooperatives. Within the village, there is access to electricity and a water supply network, although there is no paving present. Structurally, the village comprises a Crafts and Nutrition Center, a Prayer House, a school, and a Basic Health Unit (UBS). The local UBS provides daily assistance from a nurse, both indigenous and non-indigenous health agents, and weekly visits from a doctor and dentist.
Following a meeting with the local UBS team, it was determined that indigenous health agents (IHA) would directly engage with villagers to enhance the population's adherence to the study. The sampling structure under scrutiny encompassed 396 students aged between 5 and 19 years, enrolled at the local indigenous school. The sample size was computed using StatiDisk Version 8.4 software, factoring in the sampling structure, a 95% confidence level, a 10% margin of error, and a 90% prevalence rate of intestinal parasitosis in indigenous communities in Paraná. This necessitated a minimum sample size of 32 individuals for each assessment. The population sample comprised randomly selected students whose parents or guardians willingly consented to participate in the research following an active search by the local health team. Although some indigenous children were part of both data collection phases, all selections were made randomly.
Stool samples were collected by parents, guardians, or by the children and adolescents themselves, once they were deemed capable of understanding and independently carrying out the collection process. This occurred subsequent to a meeting with the research team, indigenous community members, and leaders, during which the research objectives, benefits, and proper collection procedures were elucidated. Participants were provided with labeled collection flasks and given both verbal and written instructions, with assistance from community IHAs. IHAs subsequently revisited participants' homes to retrieve the flasks, which contained stool samples preserved in cold coolers without chemical additives. These samples were then transported to the Clinical Parasitology laboratory at the State University of Western Paraná in Cascavel, where they were maintained at 5 ºC until processing within a 3-day timeframe. Careful measures were taken during transport and storage to ensure the integrity of the parasites' morphology and prevent any potential interactions.
An initial coproparasitological examination (1st examination) was conducted in November 2018, followed by a monitoring examination (2nd examination) in May 2019 to assess the impact of the implemented control measure. Each sample, collected per person, underwent processing and analysis using three parasitological stool examination methods: 1) the direct method, involving processing the sample with saline solution to prevent the loss of Blastocystis hominis species; 2) flotation after centrifugation in zinc sulfate solution; and 3) spontaneous sedimentation in water. The slides were examined by a skilled microscopist under 10X and 40X magnification.
The parasitological health indicators assessed in this study included the total frequency of enteroparasites, frequency by species, polyparasitism, frequency by gender, and age group. However, the intensity of infection was not determined as the Kato-Katz quantitative method was not employed in this particular study.
Following the initial collection of fecal material (Initial Examination), a control measure involving two antiparasitic treatments was implemented in school-age children. Albendazole (ABZ), a carbamatobenzimidazole agent known for its anthelmintic and anti-protozoan properties, was utilized to address intestinal and tissue parasites. Each student received a single 400 mg dose of ABZ administered by the local UBS health team in two doses with a 90-day interval between them, in accordance with the protocol established by the Litoral Sul DSEI to manage general parasitic infections. The treatment achieved high coverage within the population, with all children participating in the study receiving the medication. Thirty days post the second ABZ dose, the 2nd Examination was conducted by collecting fresh stool samples from the students.
The Z-test, conducted using StatiDisk Version 8.4 software, was employed to compare the laboratory analysis data of fecal samples before and after the antiparasitic treatment within the studied population. A significance level of 5% was utilized for the analysis.
The frequencies of total enteroparasites, specific species of enteroparasites, and the occurrence of polyparasitism before and after mass treatment with antiparasitic medication are presented in Table 1. Initial examination prior to antiparasitic treatment involved the analysis of 43 fecal samples, revealing that 81.4% (35/43) tested positive for enteroparasites, with 48.8% (21/43) showing evidence of polyparasitism. The most prevalent combination observed was Hymenolepis nana and Entamoeba coli. Protozoan cysts were detected in 79.1% (34/43) of the samples, while helminth eggs were found in 30.2% (13/43) of the samples.
In the second examination, conducted 30 days post the second dose of the antiparasitic agent, 32 fecal samples were gathered, with 87.5% (28/32) testing positive for enteroparasites, and 53.13% (17/28) indicating polyparasitism. The prevalence of protozoa and helminths in the samples stood at 84.4% (27/32) and 37.5% (12/32) respectively (refer to Table 1). No significant disparity was observed in the frequencies of enteroparasites (overall, specific, and polyparasitism) between the two coproparasitological assessments, except for a higher occurrence of Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar cysts post-treatment (p= 0.0039). Despite no notable variance in frequency between the two examinations, geo-helminth eggs like hookworms, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura were solely identified prior to the population's treatment.
The assessment of enteroparasite frequency among indigenous students, categorized by age group, revealed a notable rise in helminth infections among children aged five to nine years following treatment with ABZ, as indicated in Table 2.
The study assessed the prevalence of enteroparasites among students residing in a Guarani indigenous village in southern Brazil, both before and after the administration of anthelmintic medication to the villagers. Comparing the results of the initial fecal sample collection with the subsequent one conducted post-treatment with ABZ, no notable difference was observed in the overall frequency of enteroparasites. However, it is worth noting that the prevalence of E. histolytica/E. dispar cysts was found to be higher following the treatment.
During the initial examination, the most commonly identified species were the protozoa Giardia duodenalis (41.9%), Entamoeba coli (41.9%), and Endolimax nana (37.2%), along with the helminth Hymenolepis nana (23.3%). These findings align closely with those reported in studies involving indigenous populations from Paraná and other regions, although most of these studies reported a lower prevalence of H. nana. It is worth noting that the Kato-Katz method was not utilized to evaluate the parasitic burden of geohelminths, which could potentially limit the accuracy of the assessment.
ABZ was selected as the primary treatment for parasitic infections within the studied population due to its widespread use in numerous countries for geo-helminthiasis treatment, demonstrating minimal side effects and low toxicity levels. Its limited absorption by the intestinal mucosa and rapid elimination from the body contribute to its safety profile. The single-dose administration of ABZ provides a practical advantage for geo-helminth infection control initiatives, offering broad-spectrum coverage at a low cost. While effective for giardiasis treatment, the recommended dosage is 400 mg/day for a duration of 5 days. This medication, available free of charge through the Brazilian Unified Health System, is dispensed as 400 mg chewable tablets for single-dose administration in geo-helminthiasis control programs.
In this study, it is notable that following mass treatment of the indigenous population in the village, there was no significant reduction in the overall number of helminth infections; however, infections by geo-helminths were no longer detected among the evaluated students. The efficacy of the measure adopted, which aimed at controlling these pathogens through mass administration of antiparasitic drugs, can thus be considered successful. Despite this, it is important to highlight that the highest prevalence of parasitic infections among the indigenous students was attributed to protozoa, which did not decrease post-intervention. On the contrary, there was an observed increase in infections by E. histolytica/dispar. Previous studies have also indicated that protozoa such as Entamoeba spp. and G. duodenalis were more prevalent in indigenous children, while A. lumbricoides and hookworms were more common in adults. Intestinal protozoa, although some may be non-pathogenic, including E. histolytica, G. duodenalis, and Blastocystis hominis, are known to cause diarrhea, malabsorption, and malnutrition. These enteroparasites can be transmitted through water, food, or direct person-to-person contact, contributing to compromised school performance and physical development in children. The outlined public health issue is evidently significant.
The presence of H. nana eggs persisted post-treatment, resulting in an increase in the frequency of this helminth from 23.3% to 43.8%, albeit not statistically significant. These eggs exhibit minimal resistance in the peridomestic external environment, with transmission of himenolepiasis typically occurring in intradomiciliary settings. Treatment for this parasitosis typically involves praziquantel, while the efficacy of imidazole derivatives like ABZ remains uncertain. The observed results may be attributed to cultural factors among indigenous populations, such as crowded living conditions and poor hygiene practices, which could contribute to the persistence of the parasite.
Prior to mass treatment, a substantial prevalence of polyparasitism (48.8%) was observed, which persisted at a high rate (53.1%) post-intervention. These findings align with previous research indicating a prevalent occurrence of multiple enteroparasitic infections among indigenous communities, despite the implementation of control strategies as evidenced in other studies. (Citation numbers: 4, 5, 8, 20, 25)
Among the indigenous school-children in this study, the age group most affected was five to nine years, showing a significant increase (p = 0.0185) in helminth infection frequency, rising from 14% to 37.4% following mass treatment of the population. Younger children, being in constant contact with contaminated soil and still developing their hygienic habits, emerge as a crucial risk group. This underscores the necessity of implementing additional control measures beyond pharmacological interventions. While it is recommended to assess parasitological health indicators by observing effective reduction in parasitic burden, this study did not employ any quantitative method during coproparasitological examinations, thus presenting a limitation. Consequently, the impact of the intervention on the intensity of geo-helminth infections could not be ascertained.
The continued prevalence of intestinal parasitism at elevated levels post-prophylactic treatment underscores the necessity for precise diagnosis and targeted treatment, as the efficacy of medication may be compromised without species-specific direction. Administering a non-specific treatment runs the risk of inducing behavioral changes in the parasite and triggering adverse symptoms. Therefore, it is imperative to tailor treatment to the particular parasite species hosted by the individual to ensure successful eradication and prevent potential complications.
In conjunction with drug therapy, implementing the distribution and utilization of essential hygiene supplies and offering health education on the transmission and prevention of intestinal parasites, alongside enhancements in fundamental sanitation infrastructure, are recommended control strategies to be implemented concurrently. These interventions have the potential to create a more conducive environment for the physical well-being and growth of local children.
The study revealed a high frequency of enteroparasitosis among indigenous schoolchildren of the Guarani ethnic group residing in a village in the State of Paraná, Southern Brazil. Despite the implementation of mass treatment using anthelmintic medication, the prevalence of enteroparasites did not decrease significantly. The exclusive reliance on albendazole (ABZ) for mass treatment proved ineffective in combating enteroparasites among these schoolchildren. Long-term community benefits necessitate not only sanitary enhancements but also additional educational initiatives to prevent re-infection by intestinal protozoa. It is worth noting that geo-helminth infections were no longer detected following the treatment strategy's implementation.
