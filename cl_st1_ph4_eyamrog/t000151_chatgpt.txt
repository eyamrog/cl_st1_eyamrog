Objective: This study aims to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity during the school years and investigate potential links with prenatal influences.
Methodology: A longitudinal epidemiological study was conducted, encompassing children in the first to fifth grades of elementary school, aged between seven and 10 years, attending both public and private schools in Palhoça City, Santa Catarina State. Participants were selected from families who had previously taken part in the 2015 phase of the study. BMI calculations were derived from weight and height measurements obtained at the schools, while data concerning the prenatal period were gathered through interviews with mothers or guardians at their homes. Statistical analyses were carried out using Poisson Regression with a robust estimator. Variables that were statistically significant or had a p-value of ≤ 0.25 in the bivariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis.
Results: A total of 228 students were included in the study. The incidence rate of excess weight among the participants was found to be 19.3%, with 17.1% classified as overweight and 2.2% as obese. Upon conducting multivariate analysis, it was revealed that students born with an Apgar score of ≤ 7 in the first minute after birth exhibited a statistically significant risk, with a 34% higher relative risk of developing excess weight during their school years.
In conclusion, the prevalence of overweight in the studied population was found to be 19.3%. While prenatal factors did not show a significant association with the incidence of overweight, it is noteworthy that a low Apgar score in the first minute was identified as a potential risk factor. This suggests that early neonatal health indicators may play a role in the development of overweight later in life. Further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms underlying this relationship and to potentially inform preventive strategies targeting early life health outcomes.
Being overweight is a significant global health concern that impacts individuals across all age groups, including children, adolescents, adults, and older individuals. The progression from being overweight or obese during childhood or adolescence to adulthood is recognized as a pressing public health issue. The rising prevalence of overweight children poses substantial risks for mortality in adulthood and escalates the financial burden associated with treatment and management. Estimates suggest that for every two obese children, one is likely to transition into obesity during adulthood, thereby directly compromising their overall health outcomes.
According to the Pan American Health Organization, approximately 20 to 25% of individuals under the age of 19 in Latin America are affected by overweight. Data from the Family Budget Survey carried out in Brazil between 2008 and 2009 reveals a significant prevalence of overweight, with a consistent upward trend. Specifically, among children aged 5 to 9, 32% of girls were identified as overweight, while 12% were classified as obese.
Studying the etiological factors of overweight children using various approaches is crucial for early identification of this condition, facilitating interventions in the early stages of life, potentially preventing the issue from escalating. This aligns with the recommendations outlined in the Brazilian Guidelines on Obesity, which suggest a likelihood of obese children transitioning into obese adults ranging from 20 to 50%.
Obesity, akin to other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), possesses intricate etiologies and manifests early in life. A once contentious but now widely embraced etiological framework is underpinned by the Barker hypothesis, also known as the biological programming hypothesis. Barker linked nutrition and exposure to infections during fetal development to the emergence of diseases in individuals later in life. Within this framework, he underscored the potential interplay between nutritional and environmental challenges during intrauterine life and the development of chronic conditions like coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol levels in adulthood. Consequently, early life experiences, including prenatal factors, may exert a lasting impact on the health trajectory of both children and adults, suggesting that health outcomes at any given age are not solely a product of current circumstances but also reflect a cumulative effect of exposures accumulated over the lifespan, including the prenatal period.
To enhance comprehension regarding the determinants of childhood overweight and to pinpoint modifiable behaviors and circumstances, it is crucial to delve into the interplay between potential early determinants and the subsequent occurrence of overweight in children. Unraveling these interactions during this critical period holds significant importance as it can inform the development of health policies and preventive measures.
However, there is limited research that explores these concepts in the context of identifying overweight individuals at the population level. Methodologically, employing a population-based longitudinal design is intriguing, incorporating a retrospective cohort linked with prospective follow-ups, to comprehensively investigate childhood obesity.
The primary objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of overweight among school-aged children and investigate potential associations with prenatal influences.
This study, known as Coorte Brasil Sul10, is an epidemiological investigation with a longitudinal design conducted in Palhoça Municipality, situated in the metropolitan region of Greater Florianópolis City within Santa Catarina State.
The study population consisted of children in the first to fifth grades of elementary school, aged 7 to 10 in 2019. Specifically, children born in 2009, attending both public and private schools within the municipality of Palhoça, whose families resided in the area, and who had previously participated in the study's Coorte Brasil Sul phases in 2009 and 2015 were included. The detailed process of sample acquisition is illustrated in Figure 1.
The data collection teams were comprised of trained professionals responsible for executing data collection tasks, adhering to pre-established criteria, and managing the logistics of children who had signed the Free and Informed Consent Term (Termo de Consentimento Livre e Esclarecido — TCLE) and the Free and Informed Assent Term (Termo de Assentimento Livre e Esclarecido). The selection and training of evaluators were overseen by the study's researchers with the goal of reducing potential measurement biases. Two nutritionist evaluators underwent a training program for data collection. The measurement techniques and procedures followed the standards set by the National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology (Instituto Nacional de Metrologia, Qualidade e Tecnologia — Inmetro) and the guidelines established by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Data collection involved conducting anthropometric tests to calculate the body mass index (BMI). A calibrated digital scale and a wall stadiometer were utilized for this purpose. The weight and height of children were measured during school visits, following the methodology prescribed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health.
For the weight collection, the child was barefoot, dressed in light clothing, and devoid of any objects; the examiner activated the scale prior to positioning the child, allowing it to zero out, then centered the child on the equipment in an upright position, feet together, arms extended alongside the body, and proceeded with the measurement once the weight stabilized on the display. Height measurement involved instructing the child to stand erect with arms extended, head held high, gaze fixed at eye level, legs parallel with feet forming a right angle, ensuring the calves, buttocks, scapulae, and occipital region of the head were in contact with the stadiometer. The examiner then adjusted the movable part of the equipment against the head, applying adequate pressure to flatten the child's hair, removed the individual for the height reading, all while keeping the equipment in place. Subsequently, the recorded data were documented in a clinical-epidemiological form.
Data were collected in duplicate from a randomly selected 5% of the study population to facilitate the monitoring of diagnostic reproducibility during the data collection phase. The results indicated satisfactory reproducibility levels, all exceeding a Kappa value of 0.7. Instances where parents did not sign the consent form, the child did not provide consent during data collection, or the child was absent on the day of data collection at school were categorized as instances of loss and refusals.
The primary focus of the study centered on the prevalence of overweight children. The independent variables were categorized as follows: sociodemographic factors including sex (male or female), the child's ethnicity/skin color (white or non-white), father's occupational status at birth (unemployed/no income or employed/with income), mother's occupational status at birth (unemployed/at home or employed/with income), father's educational level at birth (zero to eight years completed or more than eight years completed), mother's educational level at birth (zero to eight years completed or more than eight years completed); pregnancy-related characteristics such as mother's age during pregnancy (13 to 19 or 20 years or older), planned pregnancy (no or yes), pregnancy weight gain (up to 10 kg or more than 10 kg), number of prenatal consultations (up to five or six and more), smoking habits (yes or no), alcohol consumption (yes or no), presence of diabetes mellitus (yes or no), high blood pressure (yes or no), infectious diseases (yes or no); and lastly, birth and child-related attributes including gestational age (up to 37 weeks or 38 weeks or more), mode of delivery (cesarean section or vaginal), birth weight relative to gestational age (large for gestational age or appropriate for gestational age), head circumference (< 32 and > 36 or 33 to 36), Apgar score in the first minute (≤ 7 or 8 and above), and the occurrence of birth-related complications (yes or no).
The data collected were inputted into Excel spreadsheets and subsequently transferred to the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS®) 18.0 software for analysis. Prior to the analysis, a data cleaning procedure was implemented to identify and rectify incomplete data and inconsistencies. Descriptive statistics of the variables under study were generated through frequency distribution tables. The analysis was carried out using Poisson regression with a robust estimator. All variables that showed statistical significance (p ≤ 0.05) and those with p-values ≤ 0.25 in the bivariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis to ascertain an independent relationship between them, thereby identifying potential confounding factors. Consequently, relative risks (RR) and their corresponding confidence intervals (CI) were calculated at a 95% confidence level.
The project underwent review and approval by the Research Ethics Committee with Human Subjects at Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina (UNISUL), following the protocol of the Certificate of Presentation for Ethical Appreciation (Certificado de Apresentação para Apreciação Ética — CAAE) number 04377218.1.0000.5369.
During the four-year follow-up period from 2015 to 2019, the incidence rate of overweight among students (n = 228) aged seven to 10 was found to be 19.3% (95%CI 14.2; 24.4). Specifically, the incidence of overweight was 17.1% (95%CI 12.2; 22), while the incidence of obesity was 2.2% (95%CI 0.2; 4.1).
The research findings regarding the association between prenatal factors and the incidence of overweight during the study period are outlined below. Table 1 indicates that there were no statistically significant associations found between the sociodemographic variables of the students and their parents at birth and the occurrence of overweight. However, Table 2 reveals a notable correlation between the mother's age at the time of pregnancy and the incidence of overweight (p = 0.021).
Table 3 illustrates that among birth characteristics, school children who had an Apgar score of ≤ 7 in the first minute and experienced delivery complications exhibited a higher incidence of overweight during the study period (p = 0.028 and p = 0.038, respectively).
The analysis results, as depicted in Table 4, indicate that the variables of mother's age during pregnancy and mothers' reports of delivery problems have lost their statistical significance. Consequently, children in school who were born with an Apgar score of 7 or less in the first minute exhibited a 34% increased risk, independent of their weight during school years [Relative Risk = 1.36 (95% Confidence Interval 1.07; 1.72)] (p = 0.011).
The study revealed a high incidence rate of overweight among students, with approximately one in five children developing overweight during the school years between the ages of 7 and 10. Globally, 18% of children aged 5 to 19 are overweight, with 7% classified as obese. In Brazil, the prevalence of overweight is notably high, with rates of 24.6% among children aged 10 to 19 and 35.9% among children aged 5 to 9.
Various studies have highlighted the high incidence rates of childhood obesity. For instance, a systematic review encompassing 19 articles, including three from the United States with nationally representative data, was conducted in 2016-17. One study tracked data from 1980 to 1988, revealing an annual incidence of 1.3% among children aged 4 to 10. Another study, spanning from 1980 to 1998, reported an annual incidence of 1.7% in the same age group. Additionally, a study following a cohort of children born in 1993, aged between 5.6 and 14.1, with an average follow-up of two years, found an overall obesity incidence of 11.9%, with a 3% annual incidence in the age group similar to the present study. In Vietnam, a cohort study monitored children aged three to six for three years from 2013 to 2016, estimating overweight and obesity incidence rates of 12.4% and 2.7%, respectively. Another prospective cohort study in the United States tracked children aged five to 14, revealing that 11.9% of them developed obesity. Notably, the incidence of obesity in children aged five to 14 was four times higher among those who were overweight at five years old compared to children with normal weight at the same age.
In a context marked by a high incidence rate during the school years, this study aimed to enhance comprehension regarding the factors contributing to overweight by examining the impact of prenatal influences during childhood. The rationale behind this investigation was rooted in Barker's biological programming hypothesis. While the findings presented in this study did not reveal any groundbreaking evidence, they did establish a connection between early life factors and childhood obesity, encompassing biological, environmental, and behavioral risk elements associated with events during the fetal period.
Pre-gestational maternal BMI, excessive gestational weight gain, diabetes during pregnancy, delivery, birth weight, maternal smoking, maternal dietary patterns, exposure to maternal intestinal microbiome and antibiotics, and maternal psychosocial stress factors have been identified as influencing the child's body composition. Additionally, prenatal biological risk factors can interact with environmental and behavioral factors, along with postnatal risk factors, to play a role in the development of obesity (references 23-27).
The microbiota in the human intestine plays a crucial role in adipogenesis, with evidence suggesting a connection between prenatal exposure to antibiotics and the risk of childhood obesity. These antibiotics can disrupt the normal microbial colonization of a newborn's intestine. While it is known that exchanges in the intestinal microbiota between mother and child occur at birth, whether through vaginal or cesarean delivery, via contact with vaginal/fecal and skin microbiota, this alone may not explain the prenatal link between antibiotics and childhood obesity. Recent studies have revealed the presence of microorganisms in various prenatal environments such as amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, placental membrane, meconium, and even in the fetus, challenging the notion of uterine sterility. This suggests a potential maternal-fetal exchange of microbiota before birth, raising the possibility that antibiotics administered during the prenatal period could traverse the placental barrier and enter fetal circulation, potentially increasing the risk of childhood obesity. Interestingly, the current study did not find an association between infectious diseases during pregnancy and the outcome under investigation. Similarly, another study within the same population, albeit with a cross-sectional design, did not identify statistically significant differences between nutritional status and the type of delivery.
In the context of smoking during pregnancy, research indicates a link to childhood obesity, suggesting a more pronounced direct intrauterine impact of maternal smoking in comparison to paternal or household smoking. Prenatal exposure is crucial for children to develop this issue. Moreover, smoking is intertwined with various sociodemographic factors and lifestyle choices, with smokers often having less healthy diets. While the precise impact of smoking on childhood overweight remains uncertain, fetal exposure to nicotine can have enduring effects on consumption control and eating behaviors. Nevertheless, studies on smoking cessation during pregnancy have not demonstrated significant effects on childhood overweight. Interestingly, in the current investigation, a higher frequency of smoking was not found to be correlated with an elevated risk of childhood overweight.
Previous research studies (51-53) have established a link between birth weight and childhood obesity. Contrary to these findings, the current study did not observe such an association. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that a higher birth weight could serve as a potential indicator for identifying children who are at an increased risk of developing obesity. This information could be valuable in implementing interventions aimed at modifying eating habits and managing weight gain effectively.
The correlation between diabetes and childhood obesity is linked to maternal obesity and excessive weight gain during pregnancy. Exposure to elevated levels of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids can disrupt appetite regulation, energy balance, and body weight. Research comparing obese and non-obese mothers prior to pregnancy revealed that children of obese mothers were three times more likely to be overweight, a trait that continues throughout the child's growth and development. However, in the current study, no statistically significant associations were identified.
The variables that exhibited statistical significance in relation to the outcome in the bivariate analysis included the mother's age during pregnancy, the mother's self-reported occurrence of pregnancy complications, and the Apgar score within the first minute. However, only one variable maintained significance in the multivariate analysis. Children with Apgar scores below 7 in the initial minute were found to have a 36% higher risk of developing overweight conditions during their school years. Comparable data from existing literature for comparison is lacking, although there is a potential connection to Barker's hypothesis, albeit in a preliminary and cautious manner. Further research involving diverse populations and larger sample sizes is necessary to delve deeper into this potential association. It might be more appropriate to interpret this link through the subjective perspective of mothers regarding the implications of their children being born with lower vitality. Such children could potentially receive increased care and protection from their families, which hypothetically could manifest in more permissive attitudes, possibly even towards diets high in sugars and fats.
On the contrary, chronic diseases' genetic patterns are influenced by epigenetic signals, operating through mechanisms that vary in informational content and impact cell physiology positively or negatively. Reproductive health aims to decipher the mechanisms that can activate or deactivate segments of the genetic blueprint. Organisms undergo two instances of epigenetic reprogramming during development. The first occurs in gametogenesis, a precise microenvironment facilitating the transmission of inheritable information crucial for parental-specific epigenetic data. The second reprogramming event takes place during the embryo's pre-implantation phase, involving critical decisions on cell fate early in development and sustained through multiple cell divisions. Epigenetics contributes to cellular memory formation during development, yet the environmental and metabolic conditions during pregnancy shape epigenetic reprogramming, impacting health, the child's future, and disease etiology. Consequently, transgenerational epigenetic effects inherited beyond the third generation transcend direct environmental exposures. Therefore, when investigating the incidence of childhood obesity, it is imperative to explore the various etiological factors to address the global epidemic effectively. Various processes retain the memory of environmental influences and potential interactions with other elements. An adverse environment during preconception, pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence—critical developmental periods—can permanently predispose individuals to disease risk factors in adulthood. While epigenetic marks may be reversible, alterations in morphogenesis or cellular function could lead to irreversible consequences.
The findings of this study do not strongly indicate the impact of prenatal factors on childhood overweight, thus emphasizing the significance of proximal environmental influences. The primary determinant of overweight in children appears to be the imbalance between calorie consumption and expenditure, which is influenced by dietary habits, basal metabolic rate, and levels of physical activity. These factors, in line with the Life Course Approach, underscore the cumulative effect of risks throughout an individual's lifespan, particularly emphasizing the interplay between biological and social factors at various life stages compared to contemporary lifestyle choices.
There is compelling scientific evidence (23-27) indicating the necessity of studying the life course from conception to pinpoint risk or protective environments for childhood obesity development. It is feasible to assert that unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and smoking are established risk behaviors (47,48,54-56). Conversely, the biological, psychological, and social risk factors involving both the pregnant woman and the child may play a significant role in their determination (23-27), although not definitively confirmed in the current study. These conditions, impacting both the inception and progression of life, can have enduring negative effects and influence the health of future generations (58-63). Given the global trend towards increased exposure to obesity risk factors, particularly in childhood, establishing suitable environments from early life is paramount. Effective interventions that go beyond individual risk factors are crucial. Therefore, in conjunction with existing knowledge, it becomes apparent that the determinants of overweight encompass a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, biological, behavioral, and environmental factors that can synergistically interact from the earliest stages of life.
The results of the current study must be approached with caution due to several limitations. Firstly, the sample size may have been inadequate to fully capture the phenomena under investigation. Secondly, there was a lack of data both before and after the observation period, a common issue in studies focusing on disease incidence. Thirdly, given the cohort's mixed design, prenatal data were gathered retrospectively through recall, potentially introducing measurement bias. Initial anthropometric data were only collected at age six, with no information available on weight prior to that age, thus hindering a comprehensive mapping of the children's growth trajectory. Additionally, the study may have downplayed the role of socioeconomic status in determining overweight by only considering a limited number of variables, such as parental education and occupation at birth.
During the school years, the prevalence of overweight was notably high at 17.1%, while obesity was lower at 2.2%. Prenatal factors did not show significant associations with the incidence of overweight or obesity, except for the Apgar score in the first minute after birth.
