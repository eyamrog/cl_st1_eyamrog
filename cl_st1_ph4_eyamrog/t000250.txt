Abstract 
Objective: To evaluate the associations of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 
vigorous physical activity (VPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), and sedentary behavior 
(SB) with depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms (D&A) 
during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.  
Methods: Cross-sectional online survey in self-isolating people. Self-reported MVPA, VPA, 
MPA, and SB (exposures), and depressive and anxiety symptoms (Beck Depression and 
Anxiety Inventories [BDI and BAI]) were collected. Associations of MVPA, VPA, MPA, and 
SB with prevalent depressive (BDI>9), anxiety (BAI>7), and D&A (BDI>9+BAI>7) symptoms 
were investigated using logistic regressions, presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence 
interval (95%CI). Linear regressions were performed testing associations with symptom 
severity. Models were adjusted for confounding factors. 
Results: Participants (n=937, females=72.3%) performing ≥30 min/day MVPA or ≥15 min/day 
VPA had lower odds of prevalent depressive (ORMVPA=0.71, 95%CI=0.53-0.96; ORVPA=0.60, 
95%CI=0.43-0.82), anxiety (ORMVPA=0.71, 95%CI=0.54-0.96; ORVPA=0.70, 95%CI=0.51-
0.96), and co-occurring D&A symptoms (ORMVPA=0.71, 95%CI=0.52-0.96; ORVPA=0.59,  
95%CI=0.41-0.83). People spending ≥10 h/day sedentary were more likely to have depressive 
symptoms (OR=1.39,95%CI=1.02-1.90). Each hour spent in SB corresponded to 0.22 
(95%CI=0.10-0.33) points and 0.16 (95%CI=0.02-0.31) points higher on the BDI and BAI, 
respectively. 
Conclusion:  Higher MVPA and VPA levels are associated with lower odds of depressive, 
anxiety and D&A symptoms. Higher SB is associated with higher odds of depressive 
symptoms.  
Key Words: Anxiety, COVID-19, Depression, Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviour, Self-

Introduction 
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global public health emergency. Up 
to the 13th of May, over 4 million cases and  280 thousand deaths worldwide were reported1. In 
Brazil, to that date, over 160 thousand cases and 11 thousand deaths have been notified1. To 
decrease the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
recommended the adoption of physical distancing measures by national governments1. In 
Brazil, the epidemiological report number 05 of the Ministry of Health has proposed social 
distancing measures, including self-isolation for areas with community transmission2. Self-
isolation measures are deemed to limit the circulation of the individual in society, thus limiting 
contact with other individuals. During self-isolation in Brazil, there is a “stay at home” 
recommendation, asking people going out in public only for essential activities, such as going 
to the supermarkets or pharmacies or to use essential services for subsistence, such as medical 
assistance. Yet the national recommendation is to stay at home, each one of the 27 federative 
units of Brazil can decide about the adoption and implementation of more restrictive measures 
(quarantine/lockdown).  
Prediction models suggest that the early implementation of physical distancing would 
result in averting almost 90,000 deaths in the largest metropolitan area in Brazil3. While self-
isolation measures are necessary to reduce the infection rate4, those measures, together with the 
“pandemic fear”5, 6 might be associated with a negative burden on mental health, possibly 
increasing depressive and anxiety symptoms7, 8. Therefore, strategies to mitigate the present 
and future impact of this mental health burden are necessary9. 
A substantial body of evidence suggests that regular moderate to vigorous physical 
activity (MVPA), defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that require 
energy expenditure10 performed at moderate or vigorous intensities, is associated with a lower 
 
5 
prevalence of depressive11, 12 and anxiety symptoms12, 13 in the general population, including 
low-middle income countries. Also, MVPA is linked to a lower likelihood of incident 
depression and anxiety globally14, 15. On the other hand, high levels of sedentary behavior (SB), 
defined as any waking behaviour characterized by an energy expenditure ≤1.5 METs while in 
a sitting, reclining or lying posture16, are associated with an increased risk of depressive17, 18 
and anxiety symptoms19.  
Physical distancing and self-isolation measures result in reduced opportunities for 
MVPA practice since stadiums, parks, and gyms are closed. Moreover, multiple leisure 
activities available for those in self-isolation at home include sedentary activities, such as 
watching television, and seated computer activities. Given the potential influence of the 
COVID-19 crisis on lifestyle behaviours, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and the known 
association between depressive and anxiety symptoms, it is essential to understand the potential 
relationship between MVPA and SB with depressive/anxiety symptoms in the context of 
COVID-19.   
To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the associations between MVPA, 
and SB with depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring depressive and anxiety (D&A) symptoms 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed to 1) examine levels of MVPA, and 
SB during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil; 2) examine the presence of depressive, anxiety, 
and D&A symptoms in Brazil; 3) explore associations between MVPA, and SB with depressive, 
anxiety, and D&A symptoms; and 4) explore associations of different intensities (vigorous 
physical activity [VPA] or moderate physical activity [MPA]) with depressive, anxiety, and co-
occurring D&A symptoms. 
 
Methods 
 
6 
This paper presents data from a cross-sectional study collected via an online survey. The 
study was approved by the Federal University of Santa Maria Research Ethics Committee and 
by the National Commission of Ethics in Research [CONEP] (30244620.1.0000.5346). 
Participants were recruited through social media and by distributing an invitation to 
participate through existing researcher networks. Brazilians adults (≥18 years), currently 
residing in Brazil and in self-isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were eligible to 
participate. By self-isolation, we mean those that decided to stay-at-home and only left for 
essential activities such as food shopping, visit the pharmacist or other health professionals. 
Participants were directed to an encrypted data website (www.qualtrics.com) where they 
indicated their consent to participate after reading an information sheet.  
 
Variables 
 
Co-primary outcomes 
The co-primary outcomes were symptoms of depression and anxiety and/or these co-
occurring together.  
 
Depressive symptoms 
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The 
BDI is composed of 21 items. Each item consists of a series of four statements based on the 
severity of depressive symptoms. The score of each item varies from 0 (minimum score) to 3 
maximum score).  The overall score of the instrument range from 0 to 63. Scores ranging from 
0-9 indicate minimal/no depressive;  10-18 indicate mild to moderate depressive symptoms; 
19-29 indicate moderate to severe depressive symptoms,  and  30-63 indicate severe depressive 
 
7 
symptoms20. For this study, depression was dichotomized into no depressive symptoms (0-9) 
or prevalent depressive symptoms  (10-63)20. 
 
Anxiety symptoms  
Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The BAI is 
composed of 21 items. Each item consists of a different anxiety symptom in which the 
participant scores how he/she felt in relation to that symptom during the last month, on a scale 
that varies from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Severely, it bothered me a lot). The overall scores range 
from 0 to 63. Scores ranging from 0-7 indicate minimal/no anxiety symptoms;  8-15 indicate 
mild anxiety symptoms; 16-25 indicate moderate anxiety symptoms, and 26-63 indicate severe 
anxiety symptoms21. For the study purpose, anxiety was dichotomized into absent anxiety 
symptoms (0-7) or prevalent anxiety symptoms (8-63)21. 
 
Co-occurring depressive and anxiety (D&A) symptoms 
Those with prevalent depressive symptoms (BDI>9) and prevalent anxiety symptoms 
(BAI>7) were classified as having co-occurring D&A symptoms. Prevalent co-occurring D&A 
symptoms was treated as a dichotomous variable. 
 
Exposures 
 
Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) 
Time spent in MVPA was assessed by two questions: 1) “How much time on an average 
day have you spent in vigorous physical activity since self-isolating?”; and 2) “How much time 
on an average day have you spent in moderate physical activity since self-isolating?”. The 
questions were accompanied by the following explanations: “Think about all the vigorous and 
 
8 
moderate activities that you do on average daily during self-isolating. Vigorous physical 
activities refer to activities that take hard physical effort and make you breathe much harder 
than normal. Moderate activities refer to activities that take moderate physical effort and make 
you breathe somewhat harder than normal”. For the logistic models, MVPA, moderate physical 
activity (MPA), and vigorous physical activity (VPA) when self-isolating were treated as 
dichotomous variables. MVPA and MPA were dichotomized into 1 = <30 minutes per day, or 
2 = ≥30 minutes per day. VPA was dichotomized into 1 = <15 minutes per day, or 2 = ≥15 
minutes of VPA per day). These cut-offs were chosen to be in line with the public health 
recommendations of 150 minutes of MVPA, or 75 minutes of VPA per week22.  
 
Sedentary Behavior (SB) 
Time spent in SB was assessed using the question: “Since self-isolating, how much time 
have you spent sitting daily?”. SB was treated as a dichotomous variable (1= <10 hours spent 
sitting per day; 2 = ≥10 hours or more spent sitting per day), as used in previous studies23, 24.  
 
Covariates 
Demographic data were collected, including sex (male or female), age (in 10-year age 
bands), ethnicity (asian, black, caucasian, mixed, other), marital status (single, 
separated/divorced, widowed or married/in a domestic partnership), employment 
(Unemployed, Student, Military, Self-employed or Retired), and household income (i.e., 
<R$1254, R$1255-R$2004, R$2005-R$8640, R$8641-R$11261, >R$11262), and Brazilian 
state they lived in. Participants were asked whether they are in self-isolation and to report the 
number of days in self-isolation. Substance consumption, such as current smoking status (yes 
or no), and current alcohol consumption (yes or no) were evaluated. Self-reported previous 
diagnosis of chronic physical conditions (e.g.: obesity, hypertension, myocardial infarction, 
 
9 
angina pectoris and other coronary diseases, other cardiac diseases, varicose veins of lower 
extremities, osteoarthritis, chronic neck pain, chronic low back pain, chronic allergy [excluding 
allergic asthma], asthma [including allergic asthma], chronic bronchitis, emphysema or chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, 
cataract, peptic ulcer disease, urinary incontinence or urine control problems, 
hypercholesterolaemia, chronic skin disease, chronic constipation, liver cirrhosis and other 
hepatic disorders, stroke, chronic migraine and other frequent chronic headaches, 
haemorrhoids, cancer, osteoporosis, thyroid disease, renal disease, and injuries), as well as, 
previous diagnosis of psychiatric conditions (e.g.: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, 
schizophrenia or others) were also evaluated through self-reported questions. For these 
questions, a list with all the above-mentioned conditions was shown.   
 
Statistical analyses 
Sample characteristics were displayed for the whole overall sample and stratified 
according to the time spent in MVPA (≥30 minutes vs. <30 minutes per day), and time spent in 
SB (<10 hours vs. ≥10 hours per day). Descriptive data are shown using mean (standard 
deviation), or median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. Categoric 
variables are shown as the total number of cases (%). The differences in the median depressive 
and anxiety symptoms between MVPA or SB levels were tested using Mann-Whitney U tests. 
The associations between MVPA or SB with the prevalence of symptoms of mental health 
outcomes (depressive, anxiety, or D&A) were tested with models of logistic regressions and 
95% CI. We also tested the associations across different intensities (VPA and MPA) with 
prevalent depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring D&A symptoms. First, the models were tested 
without adjustments (crude). Second, the models were adjusted for age (categoric, 10-year age 
band) and sex (men/women) (adjusted 1). Third, the models were adjusted for age, sex, 
 
10 
ethnicity (categoric), marital status (categoric), family income (categoric), days in self-isolation 
(continuous), current smoking (yes/no), current alcohol consumption (yes/no), previous 
diagnosis of chronic diseases (yes/no), previous diagnosis of psychiatric disorders (yes/no), 
time spent sitting per day (continuous; for MVPA, VPA and MPA models) or time spent in 
MVPA (continuous; for SB models) (adjusted 2). Results from the logistic regression analysis 
are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The adjusted mean 
differences (AMD) in depressive and anxiety symptoms according to MVPA (≥30 minutes vs. 
<30 minutes per day) or SB (≥10 hours vs. <10 hours per day) levels were calculated using 
analyses of covariance (ANCOVAS), adjusting for the same variables used in the logistic 
regression models. Linear regressions were performed using continuous data for MVPA, VPA, 
MPA, SB, and depressive and anxiety symptoms. Models tested for linear regressions were the 
same used in logistic models. We adopted a statistical significance level at p <0.05. The 
statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corporation).  
 
Results 
A total of 937 adults were included in the study. The sample was predominantly 
composed by women (72.3%), young adults (52.6%) of participants aged 18-35 years, 
Caucasians (76.0%), singles (50.1%), currently employed (50.1%), with a monthly household 
income ranging from R$2005-R$11261 (56.9%). Most participants were non-smokers (94.9%) 
but were consuming alcoholic beverages during the self-isolation (68.8%). The overall cohort 
reported engaging in a median of 30 (IQR=60.00) minutes of MVPA per day, and spending an 
median of 10.0 (IQR=5.0), hours per day in SB. A total of 500 participants (53.4%) spent ≥30 
minutes of MVPA per day, and 311 (33.3%) spent ≥10 hours in SB per day. The prevalence of 
self-reported previous diagnosis of chronic physical conditions (any disease) was 93.3%. The 
prevalence of self-reported previous diagnosis of psychiatric disorders (any disorder) was 
 
11 
41.0% (depression=20.0%, any anxiety disorder=24.4%, bipolar disorder=2.0%, schizophrenia 
or other psychotic disorders=0.1%).  The full details of the overall sample, and according to the 
time spent in MVPA and SB are detailed in table 1. 
The median of depressive symptoms in the overall sample was 9.00 (IQR=10.00), 
mean=9.98 (7.60), points in the BDI scale. Those that reported ≥30 minutes in MVPA per day 
reported lower depressive symptoms than those that spent <30 minutes per day in MVPA 
(AMD= -0.707; 95%CI= -1.160 to -0.253, p=0.002). Also, those that spent <10 hours in SB per 
day reported lower depressive symptoms than those that spent ≥10 hours in SB per day (AMD= 
-1.736, 95%CI= -2.704 to -0.768, p<0.001).  
The median of anxiety symptoms in the overall sample was 6.00 (IQR=11.0), mean 
=9.01 (9.12) points in the BAI score scale. Those that spent ≥30 minutes in MVPA reported 
lower anxiety symptoms than those that spent <30 minutes per day in MVPA (AMD= -0.759; 
95%CI= -1.312 to -0.206, p=0.007). Also, those that spent <10 hours in SB per day reported 
lower anxiety symptoms than those that spent ≥10 hours in SB per day (AMD= -1.665; 95%CI= 
-2.869 to -0.461, p=0.007).  
The prevalence of symptoms of depressive, anxiety, and D&A in the cohort were 43.6%, 
43.3%, and 31.9%, respectively. The prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and comorbid D&A 
symptoms, per MVPA and SB group can be seen in figure 1. 
Those reporting ≥30 minutes in MVPA had a decreased odds of prevalent depressive 
(OR=0.71, 95%CI=0.53-0.96), anxiety (OR=0.72, 95%CI=0.54-0.96), and co-occurring D&A 
(OR=0.71, 95%CI=0.52-0.96) symptoms when adjusting for potential covariates. Those 
spending ≥10 hours per day in SB were more likely to present prevalent depressive symptoms 
(OR=1.39, 95%CI=1.02-1.90) in the most adjusted analyses. The detailed results of the logistic 
regression models are presented in table 2. Linear associations, adjusting for relevant 
covariates, demonstrate that each hour spent in SB is associated with 0.22 points higher on the 
 
12 
BDI (95%CI=0.104-0.338) and 0.16 points higher at the BAI (95%=CI=0.021-0.313). The 
linear models for MVPA and SB are shown in table 3. 
When we look across different MVPA intensities, spending ≥15 minutes per day in VPA 
is associated with lower odds of prevalent depressive (OR=0.60, 95%CI=0.43-0.82), anxiety 
(OR=0.70, 95%CI=0.51-0.96), and co-occurring D&A (OR=0.59, 95%CI=0.41-0.83) 
symptoms. Spending ≥30 minutes per day in MPA is associated with a lower prevalence of co-
occurring D&A symptoms (OR=0.72, 95%CI=0.53-0.98) (Table 4). Linear regression models 
found that every 10 minutes spent in VPA is associated with 0.18 (95%CI=0.041-0.335) points 
lower on the BDI, and -0.21 (95%CI=0.034-0.400) points lower on the BAI scales, respectively 
(table 5).  
 
Discussion 
This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study assessing the association between 
MVPA, VPA, MPA, and SB and prevalent depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring D&A 
symptoms among self-isolating adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, 
nearly half of participants reported performing ≥30 minutes MVPA per day, and one third 
reported spending ≥10 hours in SB per day. The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms 
was approximately 40%, while one third reported co-occurring D&A and anxiety symptoms. 
We observed a relationship suggesting that people reporting ≥30 minutes in MVPA per day 
were approximately 30% less likely to present depressive, anxiety, and D&A symptoms, even 
when we adjust for relevant covariates. Those reporting ≥15 minutes of VPA per day were 
approximately 40% less likely to present with prevalent depressive and D&A symptoms, and 
30% less likely to present prevalent anxiety symptoms. Those spending ≥10 hours a day in SB 
were 39% more likely to present prevalent depressive symptoms in the adjusted models.  
 
13 
The present study found a high prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and comorbid D&A 
symptoms in a sample of the Brazilian population during COVID-19 pandemic. Although the 
average severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms of the sample falls within the range of 
mild symptoms, the prevalence of depressive symptoms is about four times higher than those 
found in previous studies in Brazil using similar screening tools25. Other studies also found high 
prevalences of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the general population during the COVID-
19 pandemics in Paraguay (depression=59.6%, anxiety=47.2%)26, Turkey (moderate to severe 
depression=18.6%, moderate to severe anxiety=26.5%)27, China  (depression=48.1%, 
anxiety=22.6%, D&A=19.4%)8, and Basque region of Spain (depression=20.8%, 
anxiety=29.0%). Our study is not representative of the general population and the results should 
be interpreted taking the potential for self-selection bias into account, also, we have used a 
screening tool that is not able to diagnose depressive or anxiety disorders25 . However, the high 
prevalence of symptoms found is suggestive that the pandemic and the self-isolation are 
impacting mental health5, 6. Accordingly, epidemiological studies to precisely estimate the real 
mental health burden in the population are required. In the meanwhile, even not being 
representative, and potentially overestimated, the findings indicate that governing bodies 
should take initiatives to reduce the mental health burden during periods that the general 
population is requested to isolate themselves.  
In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a cross-sectional study found that 
nearly 60% of participants did not meet the PA recommendations (<150 minutes of MVPA per 
week). Moreover, they have found an association of PA levels with fewer negative affect28. Our 
findings are in line with the association found in China, suggesting that over 30 minutes of daily 
MVPA is associated with reduced co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms. In our study, 
15 minutes or over of VPA per day was associated with a lower prevalence of depressive, 
anxiety, and co-occurring D&A symptoms. Also, we found a linear association with depressive 
 
14 
and anxiety symptoms severity, suggesting a dose-response association. However, no linear 
associations were seen in the present study between MPA or MVPA with depressive and 
anxiety symptoms when we adjust for covariates. A potential explanation is that during the 
pandemics, time spent in MPA might be heavily influenced by time spent in household 
activities as most household activities fall within this intensity range29. In turn, VPA might 
more closely reflect leisure-time physical activity. According to previous evidence, leisure-time 
PA is more likely to be associated with positive mental health outcomes12 than household 
activities and those expending long periods in household activities might not be experiencing 
the same benefits. 
We found significant associations between increased time spent in SB and depression 
and anxiety symptom severity when adjusting for covariates such as time spent in MVPA. 
Moreover, those spending over 10 hours in SB per day were more likely to present prevalent 
depressive, but not anxiety or co-occurring D&A symptoms18, 30. This difference might be 
explained by the fact that periods longer than 10 hours per day of SB are needed to impact 
significantly in the presence of significant anxiety symptoms17.  
While our data are cross-sectional and directionality is unclear, previous longitudinal14, 
15, mendelian randomisation31 and randomised trials32 support the notion that MVPA protects 
against and improves depressive and anxiety symptoms. Assuming that MVPA is protective 
against depressive and anxiety symptoms, these effects can be explained by some underlying 
mechanisms. First, MVPA can increase the release of endocannabinoids, which has 
antidepressant and anxiolytic effects33. Second, MVPA improves neuroplasticity and functions 
on the brain, reflected by the increase of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived 
neurotrophic factors (BDNF)34. The changes in BDNF levels seem to be associated with the 
antidepressant effects of exercise35. Third, evidence suggests that MVPA can fortify the anti-
inflammatory and antioxidant systems, which are increased in depressive and anxiety 
 
15 
disorders36. On the other hand, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that inducing 
SB increases depressive symptoms, and this effect is partially mediated by an increase in 
inflammatory markers37.  Fourth, there is a large body of literature about the risks of infection, 
casualties and other anxiogenic content available being consumed during the self-isolation38, 
so the time spent in MVPA can also work as a distraction when participants are focusing in the 
activity, and not ruminating that specific information. Fifth, psychosocial mechanisms 
including social connectivity may be key mechanisms that contribute to the antidepressant 
effect of exercise. For example, those who are more physically active may engage in more 
social interaction when participating in group exercise classes as using social media/online 
social interaction is associated with positive affect during the COVID-19 pandemic39. Lastly, a 
body of evidence suggests that there is a bidirectional relationship between MVPA and SB with 
depressive symptoms and anxiety, so it is expected that people with depressive and anxiety 
symptoms are less likely to be active and more sedentary40. 
Strategies to promote MVPA practice should be adapted to this context, in terms of both 
the current response to COVID-19 and the amelioration of it’s future impacts on mental health. 
Besides, exercise seems to reduce the severity of acute respiratory symptoms in the general 
population41, however, there is yet no study evaluating the protective effects or safety of 
exercise in people with COVID-19 infection. At this moment, we suggest that exercise 
professionals should be alert to the potential signs of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, a brief 
screening of COVID-19 symptoms might be necessary before engaging in MVPA42. When 
signs and symptoms of infection are detected, the participant should refrain from MVPA and 
follow the local health department recommendations.   
The present study has some limitations. First, the cross-sectional design does not allow 
to draw any directionality in the relationship. Further longitudinal data can further clarify the 
potential protective effects of MVPA against the development of depression and anxiety during 
 
16 
the self-isolation. Second, the sample was mostly composed of females and young adults 
recruited by social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and emails sent to a network of 
researchers. Although there is data of participants from 24 of the 27 Brazilian states, about 62% 
of participants are from Rio Grande do Sul, 14.8% from Rio de Janeiro, and 6.5% from Ceará 
states. Therefore, the representativeness of this sample is limited. Third, we could not rule out 
a sampling bias as those who are experiencing more depressive and anxiety symptoms might 
be more interested in participating in the study (self-selection bias), causing an exaggerated 
prevalence. Fourth, all data was collected using a self-report online survey. Self-reported data 
can suffer from recall bias, as well as, by social desirability. Last, we could not explore whether 
PA was performed during leisure-time or in other domains. Further studies should evaluate the 
role of the different domains that PA is performed in the associations between MVPA and 
depressive and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
Conclusion 
People engaged in higher levels of MVPA and VPA are less likely to present depressive, 
anxiety, and D&A symptoms during self-isolation. Those reporting higher levels of SB are 
more likely to present prevalent depressive symptoms. Strategies targeting to increase MVPA 
and VPA and reduce SB at populational levels might be important to mitigate the mental health 
burden during the COVID-19 pandemics. Public health recommendations should make clear to 
the general population how to exercise safely.
