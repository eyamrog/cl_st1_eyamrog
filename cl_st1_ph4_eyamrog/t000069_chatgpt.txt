This cross-sectional survey delved into the impact of the pandemic on dental practice in May 2021, during the second wave in Brazil. The study encompassed an exploration of COVID-19 incidence and severity among participants, their vaccination status, and their level of confidence in vaccines. Additionally, the survey delved into the medications employed for preventing or treating COVID-19, including contentious drugs/substances such as vitamin D, ivermectin, zinc, and chloroquine. Dentists were enlisted via email and provided responses to a pretested questionnaire until May 31, 2021, resulting in a total of 1,907 responses (with a return rate of 21.2%). Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted at a significance level of α=0.05. Prevalence Ratios were computed to examine the correlation between professional attributes and two key outcomes: the reporting of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the utilization of controversial drugs. Notably, a third of dentists expressed moderate levels of confidence in the safety and efficacy of vaccines, yet 96% had received at least one vaccine dose, predominantly CoronaVac. The survey revealed that 46% of respondents rated the impact of the pandemic on dental practice as lower or much lower compared to the preceding year (first wave), with 27% confirming a positive COVID-19 test. Approximately half of the dentists disclosed having relatives or friends who had been hospitalized or succumbed to COVID-19. A significant portion (59%) of respondents reported using at least one medication, with 43% utilizing two or more drugs and substances. Vitamin D (41%), ivermectin (35%), and zinc (29%) emerged as the most commonly used drugs/substances. Interestingly, more seasoned dentists (with ≥21 years of experience) were 42% more inclined to use controversial medications compared to their less experienced counterparts. Dentists with residency or advanced training exhibited a 30% higher prevalence of controversial medication use than those holding MSc/PhD degrees. Participants with low confidence in vaccines were 2.1 times more likely to resort to controversial medications than those with very high confidence. The overall results of this survey underscore the severe impact of the pandemic in Brazil and prompt reflection on the extent to which dentists rely on scientific evidence when opting for controversial COVID-19 medications.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges to the field of dentistry globally. Dentists have reported experiencing heightened levels of anxiety and fear due to the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in their workplaces. A study conducted during the initial wave of the pandemic in Brazil revealed a correlation between regional COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and the fear of contracting the virus in dental settings. Criticism has been directed towards the Brazilian government for its perceived disregard for scientific evidence and its failure to effectively contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. By January 2022, Brazil had recorded over 620,000 COVID-19 related deaths, resulting in one of the highest mortality rates globally, with approximately 290 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.
During an epidemiological crisis, the global focus has shifted towards the utilization of ineffective or controversial drugs and substances for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. This issue was subject to investigational hearings in the Brazilian senate, highlighting the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, among other medications. Recent findings have indicated that a limited number of poorly conducted studies on these drugs significantly contributed to misinformation during Brazil's initial COVID-19 wave, a period when vaccines were not yet accessible. In this uncertain and turbulent environment, compounded by the heightened risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in dental settings, dentists may be tempted towards self-medication or the use of unproven treatments against COVID-19. Concurrently, global vaccine hesitancy has emerged as a significant concern, with confidence levels in COVID-19 vaccines potentially influencing the adoption of unverified medications. Notably, a survey in Italy revealed that 18% of dentists expressed hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccination, contrasting with a study indicating greater willingness to receive the vaccine in South America compared to the USA and Russia.
The aim of this research conducted with dentists in Brazil was to examine the effects of COVID-19 on dental practices in May 2021, a time marked by the ongoing second wave and one of the most critical phases of the pandemic in Brazil, which saw 148,000 deaths between March and April 2021. This report delves into the prevalence and seriousness of the disease among dental professionals who took part in a nationwide survey, as well as the medications employed for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, the study explored data on vaccination status and the level of confidence in vaccines among participants during this period.
This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Brazil in May 2021, following a similar survey carried out with dentists practicing in Brazil during the peak of the pandemic's first wave in 2020. The study protocol received approval from our institutional review board, and all research methods adhered to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The primary aim of the survey was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on dental care routines and related factors, such as COVID-19 incidence, severity, medication usage, and vaccination status among the participating dentists. A previously developed and validated questionnaire was utilized for data collection. Respondents were required to provide consent before accessing the questionnaire, with instructions to either print or save the first page for their records. In line with principles of open science, the research project, original questionnaire, and response dataset are publicly available on an open platform (doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/DNBGS). An English version of the questionnaire is included in the Appendix. This report adhered to the Consensus-Based Checklist for Reporting of Survey Studies (CROSS) guidelines.
Details regarding the development and pretesting of the initial questionnaire have been documented in previous publications. The tool utilized was a self-administered electronic questionnaire that underwent slight modifications for the current study. These adjustments involved removing 11 questions and incorporating 5 new ones, primarily focusing on aspects such as the severity of COVID-19, medication usage, and vaccination status, which were absent in the earlier iterations of the instrument. The formulation of these additional inquiries was guided by feedback from three researchers, gathered through three distinct rounds of review.
The questionnaire, developed and hosted on SurveyMonkey (Momentive Inc., San Mateo, CA, USA), commenced with a section outlining the study's title and objectives, specifying that participation was exclusive to dentists. This segment elucidated the terms of informed consent, emphasizing the voluntary and unpaid nature of participation, along with a disclosure of potential risks and benefits. Participants were assured of the anonymity and confidentiality of their responses, with the survey system preventing multiple submissions from the same individual and safeguarding against unauthorized access. Sequential question presentation ensured a seamless flow without discrete screens, encompassing 25 mandatory items - one open-ended and 24 closed-ended queries. These items covered demographic and professional details (n = 6), professional experiences and challenges during the pandemic (n = 13), and inquiries regarding COVID-19 vaccination, prevalence, severity, and medication (n = 6). The questions were not randomized, and adaptive questioning methods were not employed. Participants could review and modify their responses using back buttons before final submission. To mitigate response errors and biases, options such as 'I'd rather not say,' 'I don't know how to answer,' and 'Does not apply' were universally available in all closed-ended questions.
A source population of 24,392 registered dentists was recruited through email invitations sent via SurveyMonkey (convenience sampling). This list, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in 2020, encompassed professionals from all Brazilian states engaged in public and/or private dental care networks, including those who had participated in the initial survey in May 2020. Previous studies have indicated that these sources yield sample variability and align with the general population of verified dentists in Brazil. The email invitation, sent on May 13, 2021, was concise, outlining the study's objective, average response time (5 minutes), and the university conducting the research. We assessed the questionnaire's readability on various devices such as computers, tablets, and cell phones. Reminder emails were dispatched seven and 11 days later to mitigate non-response bias. With an estimated population of approximately 350,000 dentists in Brazil, we determined that 1,530 responses were needed to achieve a 95% confidence interval and a 2.5% margin of error. Data collection continued until May 31, 2021.
To mitigate non-response error, questionnaires were required to be fully completed (completion proportion = 100%). Certain questions were tailored to a specific subset of the population, such as dentists directly involved in patient care during the survey administration. Responses indicating 'I'd rather not say', 'I don't know how to answer', or 'Does not apply' were treated as missing data. No methodologies involving item weighting, propensity scores, or sensitivity analysis were employed. In the examination of medication use data, substances like vitamin D, ivermectin, zinc, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine were classified as controversial drugs. Descriptive statistics were utilized to outline the frequencies and distributions of variables, accompanied by their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). Bivariate and multivariate Poisson regression analyses were conducted, with Prevalence Ratios (PR) calculated to assess the relationship between professional attributes and two COVID-19-related outcomes: reporting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the utilization of controversial drugs or substances among dentists. The selection of variables for the multivariate models followed a stepwise backward approach, retaining only those from the bivariate analysis with p < 0.25. All statistical analyses were carried out using Stata 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) with a significance level set at α = 0.05.
Out of the 24,392 invitation emails dispatched to dentists, 1,347 emails bounced, resulting in a loss of 5.5%. Among the recipients, 9,010 emails were opened by unique visitors, as recorded by the surveying system, indicating a view proportion of 36.9%. From the opened emails, a return rate of 21.2% was computed, leading to a total of 1,907 valid responses. These responses were collected from dentists across all 26 Brazilian states and the federal district.
The research findings revealed variations in the length of work experience and levels of postgraduate education among the respondents, as outlined in Table 1. The majority of responses came from females and dentists working in the public sector. A significant proportion, nearly 90%, of the participants were based in the South, Southeast, and Northeast regions. Notably, by May 2021, 96% of the surveyed dentists had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, with CoronaVac being the most commonly administered vaccine at 65%. The data also highlighted a prevalent high and very high confidence level in the COVID-19 vaccines among participants (58%), although a notable one-third of the sample expressed intermediate levels of confidence in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.
During the second wave of the pandemic, 46% of respondents rated the impact on dental practice as lower or much lower compared to the first wave one year prior. Despite this, 39% expressed feeling poorly or unprepared to treat COVID-19 patients, while 49% reported moderate to high levels of fear regarding potential SARS-CoV-2 infection at work. At least 60% of respondents consistently used N95 masks and face shields during dental appointments, with 27% admitting to having treated patients with confirmed COVID-19.
In total, 27% of the dentists surveyed reported testing positive for COVID-19 by May 2021, with the majority being asymptomatic or experiencing mild symptoms (88%). Nearly half of the respondents had relatives or friends who had been hospitalized or died from the virus. Among the seven medications or substances listed, 58.9% of the participants reported using at least one for preventive or treatment purposes. Vitamin D was the most commonly used (41%), followed by ivermectin (35%), zinc (29%), and azithromycin (27%). The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine was less common (4%). A total of 42.7% of the dentists claimed to have used two or more drugs or substances, with the most frequent combinations involving vitamin D + zinc, sometimes with ivermectin.
Table 2 illustrates the prevalence ratios concerning the correlation between professional characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 infection among dentists. Factors such as sex, work sector, and years in practice did not exhibit any significant association with the infection prevalence. However, dentists operating in the Northern region displayed a 58% higher likelihood of reporting COVID-19 compared to their counterparts in the South. Furthermore, individuals with residency/advanced training as their highest postgraduate education level were 26% more prone to contracting the disease than those holding MSc or PhD degrees. Interestingly, the confidence level in COVID-19 vaccines did not show any correlation with the infection history. Conversely, respondents who expressed no fear of contracting the virus at work were 48% more inclined to have had COVID-19 compared to those who reported high levels of fear.
Table 3 illustrates the prevalence ratios concerning the correlation between professional characteristics and the utilization of contentious medications for COVID-19 in the multivariate analysis. The participants' gender and sector of employment did not exhibit any significant association with the use of such medications. However, dentists with over 21 years of experience were 42% more inclined to have employed controversial medications for COVID-19 compared to their less experienced counterparts. Individuals from the Central-west, North, and Northeast regions displayed a 29-37% higher likelihood of using controversial medications in contrast to those from the South. Dentists with residency or advanced training as part of their postgraduate education exhibited a 30% higher prevalence of controversial medication use than those holding MSc or PhD degrees. Furthermore, the confidence level in COVID-19 vaccines played a pivotal role in medication usage. A surge in the prevalence of controversial medication use was linked to a decline in confidence levels regarding vaccines. For instance, participants with low confidence in COVID-19 vaccines were 2.1 times more prone to have utilized controversial medications compared to those with a very high level of confidence in the vaccines.
This study revealed a significant prevalence of COVID-19 among Brazilian dental professionals, along with a frequent incidence of hospitalizations and fatalities among their family members or friends during the second wave of the pandemic in the country. Furthermore, 59% of the participants reported using one or more substances as preventive or therapeutic measures, such as vitamin D, zinc, and ivermectin, despite the limited evidence supporting their clinical efficacy against COVID-19.
Studies conducted with dentists in several countries revealed varying prevalence rates of COVID-19 during different pandemic periods: 1.1% in Brazil (May 2020), 9.1% in Belgium (July–September 2020), 2.6% in the USA (June–November 2020), 4.9% in 11 Spanish-speaking Latin American countries (September–December 2020), 10.9% in Italy (December 2020–January 2021), and 1.1% in Canada (July 2020–February 2021). A multi-country survey encompassing 36 countries in 2020 indicated that approximately 15% of participating dentists reported symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. The sole study found in the literature, which mirrored the occurrence of COVID-19 as reported here, was conducted in the Czech Republic in June 2021, revealing a 25% prevalence of positive tests among dental professionals. Generally, these rates were notably lower than the prevalence documented in the present study (27%), possibly attributed to variations in public health and social measures in response to the pandemic, differing COVID-19 transmission rates in the respective countries, and the distinct assessment periods. Notably, in our study, the prevalence of COVID-19 among dentists in the Northern region surpassed that of those in the South, potentially linked to the government's failure to adhere to science-based guidance and the sudden surge in COVID-19 cases in Manaus (Amazonas state) during early 2021. It is important to highlight that the high prevalence of dentists testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in our study could also be linked to the prolonged period of elevated contamination rates in Brazil. Unlike other countries where COVID-19 epidemic curves exhibited peaks and declines, Brazil maintained high levels of virus transmission throughout 2020 (first wave) and experienced a surge in cases in the first half of 2021 (second wave) due to the absence of an effective national prevention strategy and the anti-scientific stance adopted by the Brazilian government. The heightened demand for healthcare services during the pandemic heightened the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly among dentists in close contact with patients.
The study population exhibited a high prevalence of COVID-19, with many dentists reporting that individuals close to them had also contracted the virus. A survey in Italy indicated that 55% of dentists had relatives or friends with COVID-19, while around 50% of our study participants disclosed having a family member or friend who had been hospitalized or succumbed to the disease. This alarming finding underscores the gravity of the pandemic in Brazil, where COVID-19 emerged as the primary cause of mortality in the country's public health system in 2020 and the initial months of 2021. Despite a perceived decrease in the impact on dental practice by May 2021 compared to the previous year, respondents frequently expressed feelings of inadequacy in handling COVID-19 cases and harbored moderate to high levels of fear regarding contracting the virus at work. Notably, those who reported no fear of acquiring the disease were more likely to have been infected themselves, prompting inquiries into the potential influence of varying degrees of adherence to preventive measures among the interviewed dentists. The combination of a heightened risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in dental settings and the frequent occurrence of COVID-19 within their social circles may contribute to elevated levels of anxiety and psychosis, potentially explaining the prevalent use of off-label drugs for COVID-19 prevention or treatment among the surveyed individuals.
Misinformation has emerged as a significant challenge during the ongoing pandemic, contributing to public confusion and controversy. A study conducted in Vietnam at the onset of the pandemic revealed that over 91% of healthcare workers obtained information about COVID-19 through social media platforms, which serve as digital spaces where misinformation can freely circulate without content regulation, potentially inciting panic among the population. It is imperative for healthcare professionals to stay abreast of accurate information to effectively educate and treat their patients. Scientific literature assumes a crucial role in this regard, as evidenced by our study, which found that dentists holding MSc or PhD degrees were less inclined to prescribe controversial medications compared to those with lower levels of postgraduate education. Conversely, healthcare workers have been noted for engaging in self-medication practices. A study involving healthcare workers in Togo during the pandemic reported a 34% prevalence of self-medication for COVID-19 prevention, with vitamin C being the most commonly used product. Various professional attributes can impact medication usage patterns, with our findings indicating that more experienced dentists were more likely to have taken controversial medications than their younger counterparts, potentially due to the heightened risk older adults face in developing severe COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, participants exhibiting low confidence in COVID-19 vaccines were 2.1 times more prone to using controversial medications compared to those with high confidence levels, a novel association uncovered in our study.
Numerous factors impede evidence-based healthcare practice during the pandemic, notably the abundance of low-quality studies yielding conflicting results on COVID-19 treatment. Challenges in implementing optimal evidence arise from time constraints, insufficient knowledge, and a lack of basic skills for literature evaluation. Consequently, the efficacy of contentious substances discussed may vary depending on the selected article and its interpretation. For example, contrasting findings on vitamin D supplementation emerge from systematic reviews, with some suggesting reduced ICU admissions, mechanical ventilation needs, and mortality, while others indicate no impact on these outcomes. Similarly, meta-analyses present conflicting results on the effects of zinc, vitamins C and D, and ivermectin in COVID-19 treatment. Methodological shortcomings persist in primary studies, prompting calls for more robust randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and reduced bias, imprecision, and heterogeneity. The ongoing debate on controversial drugs and substances for COVID-19 suggests that definitive conclusions may remain elusive. Dentists are advised to rely on evidence from high-quality randomized trials, meta-analyses, and evidence-based guidelines to navigate the complex landscape of COVID-19 treatment options.
A notable discovery in the current study was the high vaccination rate for COVID-19 among the surveyed dentists. In Brazil, healthcare professionals were given priority for vaccination after the elderly, resulting in dentists being among the first to receive vaccines in the initial stages of the immunization program, utilizing the first vaccines made available in the country. This accounts for the prevalent use of CoronaVac among dentists, as it was the initial vaccine approved for emergency use by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency in January 2021. Developed by the Brazilian Institute Butantan in collaboration with the Chinese laboratory Sinovac, CoronaVac's swift deployment among the elderly in Brazil was linked to a notable decrease in mortality rates compared to younger individuals. Regrettably, President Bolsonaro and his allies criticized the vaccine during its testing phases in 2020, with studies indicating that mentioning the vaccine's country of origin led to decreased acceptance among Brazilians. Notably, supporters of President Bolsonaro exhibited strong resistance to vaccines from China. By January 2022, Brazil had four vaccines available for use, with dentists nationwide eligible for booster shots. Future research could explore the willingness of dental practitioners to participate in subsequent COVID-19 vaccination phases and the continuation of preventive measures to determine if 'pandemic fatigue' might impact their adherence to risk reduction strategies.
The present study acknowledges limitations that warrant caution when extrapolating the observed results. Respondents had the freedom to accept or decline the survey invitation, potentially introducing self-selection bias favoring dentists more concerned with the pandemic and more open to medication. Data on doses and frequency of controversial drug usage were not collected, likely leading to significant variations among participants. While self-reported medication use may be influenced by social desirability bias, the anonymous nature of the questionnaire could mitigate this effect. A notable strength lies in the recruitment of a substantial sample of dentists during a challenging period of the pandemic. Moreover, this study appears to be the first to evaluate COVID-19 incidence, severity, medication use, and vaccination within the dental community. Future research could delve into the reasons behind the utilization of controversial drugs and substances, as well as explore the socioeconomical factors at play.
The survey conducted with dentists revealed a significant body of evidence during the second wave of COVID-19 in Brazil, indicating a high incidence of the disease among professionals, frequent hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 among their family members or friends, and a widespread use of medications as preventive or treatment measures. These findings underscored the severity of the pandemic in Brazil and raised concerns regarding the reliance on scientific evidence by dentists when considering the use of controversial COVID-19 drugs and substances like vitamin D, zinc, and ivermectin.
