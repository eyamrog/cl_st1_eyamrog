ABSTRACT 
 
Background: Sarcopenia and low quality of life (QOL) are widely found among hemodialysis 
(HD) patients. We aimed to verify whether risk of sarcopenia can predict QOL level in patients 
submitted to HD. 
Methods: The sample was formed by 147 chronic kidney disease patients undergoing HD in 
October 2020 at a single dialysis center.  Demographic and clinical data were collected. Risk 
of sarcopenia was classified using the SARC-F questionnaire. QOL was evaluated by the 
Brazilian version of the SF-36. QOL scores were compared between patients with and without 
risk of sarcopenia. Multivariate linear regression was performed to test risk of sarcopenia as an 
independent predictor of QOL scores. 
Results: There were 62 (42.2%) patients classified as having risk of sarcopenia. In the 
comparison of QOL scores between patients with and without risk of sarcopenia, scores of 
seven dimensions were significantly lower among patients with sarcopenia risk, the only 
exception being role-emotional. Risk of sarcopenia was an independent predictor of six 
dimensions of QOL, except for role-emotional and mental health. 
Conclusion: We found risk of sarcopenia to be an independent predictor of QOL among HD 
patients. Our results point to the possibility of improving patients’ QOL by intervening to 
minimize the risk of sarcopenia.

RESUMO 
 
Introdução: Sarcopenia e baixa qualidade de vida (QV) são amplamente encontradas entre 
pacientes em hemodiálise (HD). Nosso objetivo foi verificar se o risco de sarcopenia prediz o 
nível de QV nesta população. 
Métodos: A amostra foi formada por 147 pacientes em HD em outubro de 2020 em um único 
centro de diálise. Dados demográficos e clínicos foram coletados. O risco de sarcopenia foi 
classificado pelo questionário SARC-F. A QV foi avaliada pela versão brasileira do SF-36. Os 
escores de QV foram comparados entre pacientes com e sem risco de sarcopenia. A regressão 
linear multivariada foi realizada para testar o risco de sarcopenia como preditor independente 
dos escores de QV. 
Resultados: Havia 62 (42,2%) pacientes classificados como tendo risco de sarcopenia. 
Comparando os escores de QV entre pacientes com e sem risco de sarcopenia, os escores de 7 
dimensões foram significativamente menores entre os pacientes com risco de sarcopenia, 
exceto aspectos emocionais. O risco de sarcopenia foi um preditor independente de 6 dimensões 
da QV, exceto para aspectos emocionais e saúde mental. 
Conclusão: O risco de sarcopenia é um preditor independente de QV entre os pacientes em 
HD. Nossos resultados apontam para a possibilidade de melhorar a QV dos pacientes intervindo 
para minimizar o risco de sarcopenia.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is related to a high rate of morbidity and mortality and a high 
cost to the health system, so it is an important public health problem. It is estimated that the 
number of patients undergoing renal replacement therapy in Brazil is greater than 133,000 and 
that more than 90% of these patients are on hemodialysis (HD). The prevalence and incidence 
of these patients per million inhabitants (PMP) is 665 and 218, respectively, and has been 
increasing due to the increase in hypertensive and diabetic patients, in addition to the aging of 
the population1-2. 
 
Sarcopenia is also considered to be an important public health problem, since it is related to 
unfavorable clinical outcomes such as decreased quality of life (QOL), risk of falls, functional 
disability, depression, limited mobility, hospitalization and increased mortality3-6. Sarcopenia 
is a muscle disease associated with low muscle strength, low muscle quantity/quality and low 
physical performance. It can be acute or chronic and can be classified as primary, when only 
associated with aging and no other cause is evident; or secondary, when causes other than aging 
are present. Some factors involved with the development of sarcopenia are inflammatory 
processes, physical inactivity and inadequate intake of energy or protein. All these factors may 
be present in individuals undergoing HD6-9.  
 
The risk of sarcopenia in CKD patients is multifactorial and is worse in the advanced stages, 
mainly in patients undergoing HD. Some factors involved with sarcopenia in CKD patients are 
aging, inflammation, uremia, hormonal imbalance, malnutrition, anemia, metabolic acidosis, 
electrolyte disorder, lifestyle changes and muscle fiber atrophy. Of these, inflammation is a 
main risk for the development of sarcopenia9.

CKD complications such as anemia, cardiovascular disease, osteodystrophy, depression and 
sarcopenia are associated with low QOL in patients on HD10. Compared to other chronic 
diseases, like heart failure, chronic lung disease, arthritis and cancer, patients with CKD on HD 
present the worst QOL level11. Besides the impact on patients’ QOL coming from common 
symptoms such as fatigue, itching, anorexia, pain, sleep disorders, anxiety and nausea; CKD 
patients on HD experience powerful stressors: severe dietary restrictions, sexual dysfunction, 
time loss that influences employment, dependence on a machine and high mortality10,12,13. 
Unfortunately, several of these factors that decrease QOL are unmodifiable. 
 
The association between sarcopenia and QOL is not well studied among Brazilian patients on 
HD. Due to the extreme difficulty and lack of consensus about how to improve QOL among 
HD patients, it is crucial to seek modifiable variables associated with lower QOL level. Risk of 
sarcopenia can be minimized by well-known interventions. Thus, risk of sarcopenia can be a 
potential target for medical interventions in order to improve patients’ QOL.  
 
We aimed to verify if risk of sarcopenia can predict the QOL level among CKD patients 
submitted to HD. 
 
METHODS 
 
Study design 
The study was analytical, cross-sectional and observational, carried out in a single dialysis 
center located in the city of Sobral, northern region of Ceará state. This dialysis center is a 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3352
reference for CKD patients from several cities covering an area of 35,560 km2 (37.3 
inhabitants/km2). 
 
Study population 
The study population was 200 CKD patients who were undergoing HD in October 2020. The 
sample was formed by 147 patients. The criteria for exclusion were: 3 patients with age below 
18 years; 4 who were hospitalized; 7 with presence of advanced neurologic disease and/or 
cognitive deficit that prevented filling out the questionnaire; 17 with active infection; and 22 
with less than 3 months on HD. All patients were undergoing conventional HD (three sessions 
of 4 h per week) with polysulfone dialyzers (maximum number of reuses = 12). The study 
protocol and informed consent were approved by the ethics committee of Federal University of 
Ceará (CAAE 31240420.5.0000.5053). 
 
Demographic and clinical data 
We used the dialysis center’s medical records to obtain the demographic data, length of time 
on dialysis, type of vascular access and underlying etiology of CKD. The underlying renal 
disease was classified according to clinical criteria instead of by histopathology. Classification 
of economic class was according to criteria of the form issued by the Brazilian Association of 
Research Institutes14. This validated instrument grades economic class into five subgroups: A 
(best status) through E (worst status). Besides income level, its criteria include educational level 
of the head of household and ownership of household appliances. Each patient was assigned a 
low, medium or high risk index based on comorbidity using Khan’s comorbidity index, which 
takes into consideration the age in three classes and nine comorbidities: diabetes, myocardial 
infarction, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, obstructive pulmonary 
disease, systemic collagen disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and visceral malignancy15.

Measurement of quality of life (QOL) 
The QOL was evaluated by the validated Brazilian version of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-
Item Short Form Health Questionnaire (SF-36). This questionnaire generates scores from 0 
(worst) to 100 (best) for 8 dimensions of QOL related to physical, psychological and social 
functioning: physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health 
(GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE) and mental health (MH). PF 
measures the patient’s performance regarding daily activities; RP analyzes the impact of 
physical health on life; BP evaluates pain level and its impact on normal daily activities; GH 
evaluates the subjective perception of the present and future health status and resistance to 
illness; VT measures the patient’s feelings about his/her energy level, vitality, and moments of 
fatigue; SF measures the impact of health on routine social activities; RE measures the 
influences of emotional status on daily activities; and MH assesses humor and well-being, 
including depression and anxiety16. 
 
Risk of sarcopenia 
We used the validated SARC-F questionnaire as a diagnostic test for risk of sarcopenia. This 
questionnaire is composed of five components (strength, assistance with walking, rising from 
a chair, climbing stairs, and falls), ranging from 0 to 10, with a maximum of 2 points for each 
component. The presence of risk of sarcopenia is classified with a score greater than or equal 
to 417-19. 
 
Statistical analyses 
Shapiro’s test was used to test the normal distribution of the continuous variables, which were 
expressed as mean ± SD or median (min-max), respectively, if they presented normal or 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3352
abnormal distribution. Categorical variables are denoted by absolute number and percentage. 
Comparisons were performed by the Student-t and Mann–Whitney tests for continuous 
variables, respectively, with or without normal distribution. We performed multivariate linear 
regression to find independent predictors of QOL scores (dependent variables) considering as 
independent variables: male gender, age, comorbidity index, and risk of sarcopenia. Statistical 
significance was considered to be a p-value < 0.05. All the statistical analyses were performed 
using the SPSS version 22.0 program package. 
 
RESULTS 
 
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are reported in Table 1. There were 62 
(42.2%) patients classified as having risk of sarcopenia. The comparison of QOL scores 
between patients with and without risk of sarcopenia is reported in Table 2. Only the dimension 
RE did not differ in the comparisons. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of risk of 
sarcopenia was an independent predictor for the scores of six among eight dimensions of QOL, 
the exceptions being RE and MH (Table 3).

DISCUSSION 
 
The characteristics of our sample were similar to those related to living in underdeveloped 
areas: low average age, low economic class, only 26.5% classified as having high comorbidity 
index, and predominance of glomerulonephritis as cause of CKD instead of diabetes. Despite 
the low average age and low comorbidity level, we found a high percentage (42.2%) of patients 
with risk of sarcopenia.  
 
Sarcopenia is a condition associated with aging and chronic diseases due to the increased 
catabolism that exists in these conditions. Patients on HD have even greater catabolism, which 
increases the risk of sarcopenia20-22. The sarcopenic state has been associated with worse QOL 
dimensions, especially with regard to physical aspects, as found in our study. This is due to the 
fact that it is related to greater physical frailty, greater risk of falls and greater dependence on 
others for daily activities6,23. A multicenter study carried out among elderly patients on HD 
showed that sarcopenic patients had worse QOL compared to non-sarcopenic patients, with SF-
36 scores below 50 among sarcopenic patients22. In our sample of patients with mean age of 
55.4 years, we found the same result: sarcopenia was associated with lower QOL in the majority 
of QOL dimensions. It is noteworthy that the dimensions of QOL that were not associated with 
sarcopenia were the dimensions characterized as mental: RE and MH. As expected, physical 
aspects of QOL were more affected in patients classified as at risk of sarcopenia. 
 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3352
In addition, a literature review evaluated six studies on sarcopenia and QOL. Of these studies, 
five used the same instrument to evaluate QOL as ours, the SF-36. This review shows the 
association of sarcopenia with an important decline in QOL6. However, it will be necessary to 
evaluate particularities in specific groups, such as women and younger patients. At least one 
study evaluated the relationship between sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity and QOL in elderly 
women and did not find a significant relationship between sarcopenia and QOL23. Based on our 
study, male gender was not a predictor of lower QOL level. In a population-based sample of 
healthy young people, Kull et al.24 also found that individuals with sarcopenia presented lower 
scores in the dimensions RP and VT, two typical dimensions related to physical aspects.  
 
Among the types of renal replacement therapy, HD is highlighted as the one that affects most 
patients’ QOL. The QOL of patients with CKD has been found to be worse in those undergoing 
HD than those undergoing peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation25-28. There is growing 
interest in considering QOL of patients undergoing HD, but there is no consensus about how to 
improve these patients’ QOL. This difficulty is certainly due to the fact that the main factors 
negatively affecting QOL are unmodifiable. Our interest in sarcopenia is based on the fact that 
sarcopenia is a modifiable factor. There are many strategies to minimize the risk of sarcopenia 
in HD patients, comprising adapted exercise programs, nutritional approaches and 
pharmacologic interventions. Formal exercise prescription designed to increase muscle strength 
can be achieved by resistance exercises that can be performed even during dialysis sessions. 
Nutritional supplementation with Polycose and oral branched-chain amino acids seems to be 
promising to increase lean body mass. Also, anabolic strategies are effective at minimizing 
sarcopenia, including the use of anabolic steroids, growth hormones and testosterone8,29-33.

In our multivariate linear regression, the risk of sarcopenia was a statistically significant 
predictor of virtually all dimensions of QOL, except for the RE and MH. Concerning the other 
variables used in the multivariate analysis, age was a predictor only for the dimension of GH; 
and higher comorbidity index was predictor of PF and VT scores.  
 
The high percentage of patients with risk of sarcopenia in a sample of relatively young 
individuals is noteworthy. We have no doubt that a simple questionnaire, quickly applied, such 
as SARC-F, can be useful in screening patients at risk of sarcopenia in dialysis centers. In that 
respect, classifying patients with risk of sarcopenia can be a first step to recommend 
interventions to minimize sarcopenia, as well as the hard but necessary task of improving 
patients’ QOL. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
We found risk of sarcopenia to be a strong and independent predictor of QOL among HD 
patients. Since sarcopenia risk can be diminished by several interventions, we propose 
conducting routine screening of sarcopenia risk as a way to help improve patients’ QOL.
