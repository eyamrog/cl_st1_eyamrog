In this study, a statistical analysis of COVID-19 mortality rates in selected European countries is presented. The comparison is made between the countries' mortality rates and their corresponding number of tests over time since the first death. The findings indicate that countries like Italy, France, and the UK, which either delayed mass testing or did not fully implement it, experienced significantly higher mortality rates compared to Germany, which implemented widespread and early testing. Conversely, countries like Portugal, following Germany's testing strategy, have shown relatively lower mortality rates.
As of April 17, Germany continues to exhibit significantly lower mortality rates for COVID-19 compared to other European countries like Italy, France, and the UK. Currently, Germany's crude death rate (CDR), representing the number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, and case fatality rate (CFR), defined as the percentage of deaths in relation to confirmed cases, stand at 5.2 and 3.1% respectively. This stands in stark contrast to Italy (37.6, 13.1%), France (27.9, 12.5%), and the UK (22.0, 13.3%). The origins of Germany's lower mortality rates have sparked significant debate since this anomaly was first observed in mid-March 2020. Some have suggested that Germany's lower CFR could be a statistical artifact due to the extensive testing it has conducted, which typically lowers the CFR. It has also been proposed that early estimates were premature and that mortality rates were expected to rise as the epidemic progressed.
The mortality data utilized in this study were sourced from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center [1], last updated on Friday, April 17, 2020, at 08:52 PM EDT. The data concerning the number of COVID-19 tests conducted were extracted from the website Our World In Data [4]. As elucidated in Reference [4], there exists a disparity in reporting practices among countries, with some reporting tests performed and others reporting the number of individuals tested. However, in this analysis, we do not differentiate between these units, as we posit that regardless of these discrepancies, these test figures serve as a valid metric for evaluating a country's testing strategies.
Germany has experienced a steady increase in mortality rates since the beginning of the outbreak, albeit with a lower acceleration compared to many other European countries, making it a persistent anomaly. The widening gap in mortality rates is particularly evident when comparing Germany to Italy, which has now reached a testing rate similar to Germany's. A notable difference in testing approaches between the two countries is highlighted in Figure 1, depicting the total number of tests per thousand inhabitants for selected European countries over time since the first death. The data reveals that Italy took over 30 days to reach 5 tests per thousand, a milestone Germany achieved within 10 days of the first death. France surpassed this mark only after 50 days, and the UK has recently crossed it after more than 40 days since the first death.
The slower rate of testing is consistent across countries with high mortality rates, including Belgium (45.2, 14.3%), Netherlands (20.1, 11.3%), and Sweden (13.7, 10.6%), as depicted in Fig. 1. Switzerland (15.6, 4.9%) presents an intriguing case, now testing at a higher proportion than Germany, despite implementing mass testing much later, as illustrated in Fig. 1. It is reasonable to infer that Switzerland's delayed mass testing likely contributed to its relatively higher mortality rates compared to Germany. Conversely, countries like Portugal (6.4, 3.5%) and Austria (4.9, 3.0%), which have emulated Germany's strategy of extensive and early testing, have thus far experienced lower mortality rates. This analysis underscores the importance of countries adopting a proactive approach to testing early on to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. This aligns with recent mathematical findings [5] indicating a narrow window for effective non-pharmacological interventions.
