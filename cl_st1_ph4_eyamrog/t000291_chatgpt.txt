This edition of the journal 'Saúde em Debate' presents contributions aimed at enhancing the comprehension of collective health dynamics during the critical juncture of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2) and subsequently named Covid-19. In a preceding editorial, 'Saúde em Debate' had anticipated that the efficacy of the Chinese approach would inevitably prompt scrutiny of the Western model, characterized by mitigation strategies and vertical state interventions devoid of direct popular engagement.
In the latter part of March 2020, the concept of city-wide lockdowns was deliberated upon in Brazil, contrasting with the approach taken in China and Korea, where epidemiological surveillance was conducted through community mobilization, organized dissemination of information, selective closures, and the continued operation of essential services like healthcare, food supply, and other critical services.
China emerged victorious in the battle against the Coronavirus as evidenced by the release of the first bulletin on March 3rd, 2020, reporting no new cases of contagion. In stark contrast, Italy faced a grim reality on the same day with the announcement of over 600 deaths, signaling the country's trajectory towards the peak of the epidemic that had initially surfaced in Lombardy, centered around Milan.
Numerous films produced in China during the period of surveillance and control depicted the monitoring of individuals entering and exiting condominiums, subways, buses, and shopping venues in Wuhan by members of the Chinese Communist Party and Local People's Committees. These committees functioned as local governing bodies operating under a centralized command, issuing permits for essential outings such as purchasing supplies and engaging in necessary contacts. It is crucial to acknowledge that the definition of essential needs or services is a subjective concept, where what may seem insignificant to a minority could be deemed crucial for a larger portion of the population.
In China, the management of departure, route, and arrival was facilitated through the utilization of social networking applications like 'WeChat', the scanning of standard identification 'QR' codes via mobile phones, and the centralization of information and analysis. The Chinese government's service offered substantial data and computing infrastructure to gather, store, process, and analyze information crucial for epidemic control.
If an individual in Wuhan exhibited symptoms or signs of infection after using a particular subway car or visiting a supermarket, they would be promptly identified for tracing purposes. This process would involve determining the time of exposure, the route taken, contacts made, and close associates who would need to undergo examinations and surveillance. The level of surveillance and control implemented in this scenario could be likened to a pervasive form of oversight that even George Orwell, in his dystopian visions, might not have envisioned—a system with a capillary structure designed to monitor individuals potentially carrying a dangerous virus.
During this period, mortality in Korea stood at 7.9 per thousand (0.79%), primarily impacting the elderly and conglomerate groups residing in elderly care facilities. Italy, on the other hand, experienced a mortality rate exceeding 9%, with infants also succumbing to the virus. The escalating trends in cases and mortality rates observed in European nations and Brazil led to the anticipation that a similar pattern to Italy's spread of Covid-19 could potentially unfold in these regions.
The similarities between Brazil and Italy stem from the implementation of the neoliberal model, which led to the dismantling of public health services and surveillance in Italy post-2010. The origins of the Italian tragedy surrounding the Coronavirus in 2020 can be traced back to a decade of budget cuts. Italy faced a shortage of approximately 56,000 doctors and 50,000 nurses, alongside the closure of 758 health establishments between 2015 and 2020, including clinics, polyclinics, health centers, and hospitals. This erosion of the public healthcare system in Italy was a direct result of fiscal and budgetary austerity measures imposed by the ECB-EEC-IMF 'Troika' (European Central Bank, European Economic Commission, and the International Monetary Fund). These measures compelled governments to allocate a significant portion of the public budget towards servicing bank interest and public debt, thereby restricting investments, public services, and social security rights.
The austerity measures that crippled the Italian public health system bore resemblance to the subsequent policies implemented in Brazil following the collapse of the coalition government (2010-2015), the controversial legal and parliamentary coup d'état in 2016, and the contentious election of the far-right in 2018.
During the same period, comparable ultraliberal initiatives unfolded in Chile, Peru, Argentina, Paraguay, Ecuador, Colombia, and Bolivia. These measures were instigated either in response to international financial and diplomatic pressures, media-driven propaganda campaigns during electoral periods, parliamentary coups, or what is commonly referred to as 'hybrid warfare', resulting in the ousting of democratically elected administrations.
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, also known as the 'new' Coronavirus of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2019, significantly impacted the ultraliberal model and intensified the capital accumulation crisis. This led to a substantial setback in the implementation of austerity measures in countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.
The Covid-19 pandemic prompted European governments to expedite measures aimed at assisting vulnerable populations, including the impoverished, informal workers, individual entrepreneurs, the sick, the elderly, and children. In contrast to ultraliberal ideologies advocating self-reliance, these governments shifted towards distributing income to prevent fatalities resulting from starvation, acute illnesses, and potential social unrest characterized by pillaging and plundering.
The US government exerted pressure on Brazil to uphold ultraliberal policies while simultaneously making significant changes to its domestic Minimum Citizen Income policy, pledging to provide a minimum monthly income to all impoverished Americans amidst the pandemic. This contradictory political maneuver unfolded in Brazil amidst turmoil as the pandemic reached its peak, with 400,000 cases globally and 2,200 cases in Brazil as of March 25, 2020.
There are individuals online who continue to advocate for the closure of borders and the deportation of travelers from epidemic areas, a stance deemed inhumane, cruel, and epidemiologically ineffective. Such measures are not only ineffective but also authoritarian, serving political and economic interests rather than public health. It is widely acknowledged that fascism does not impede the spread of bacteria, viruses, toxic agents, smuggling, or authoritarianism; in fact, it exacerbates these issues. The recommended course of action involves the recruitment of trained health personnel for surveillance and increasing direct public participation in the notification, monitoring, investigation, and dissemination of case outcomes. The focus should be on admitting, treating if necessary, notifying, investigating, and avoiding border closures.
Travel restrictions are policies that involve both departure and arrival control, necessitating careful monitoring of essential requirements. Individuals with a compelling need to travel for state missions, instances of death, or logistical necessities related to essential trade activities are permitted to travel, provided they adhere to health protocols. This includes undergoing symptom checks upon departure and arrival, agreeing to screening tests if deemed necessary, and committing to a quarantine period of up to 14 days to cover the maximum incubation period. Under controlled circumstances, only individuals seeking repatriation, returning to their country of origin, engaging in international cooperation efforts, pursuing educational opportunities, migrating, or participating in essential work activities are allowed to travel.
At the onset of the pandemic, Italy underwent a series of policy shifts regarding social distancing measures. Initially, the country opted to confine its residents to their respective old burghs, primarily in the Northern small towns. This strategy evolved to isolating the elderly and impoverished populations, only to later realize the necessity of a nationwide lockdown, permitting individuals to venture out solely for essential needs like food and medication. Subsequently, there was a relaxation of travel restrictions without the prior selective limitations, followed by a return to advocating for social distancing measures. Instructing citizens to remain indoors for extended periods while allowing essential goods to circulate differs significantly from the ineffective approach of city closures, migrant detentions, and clandestine law enactments.
The social control model developed by statisticians and computer science scholars begins with assessing the varying degrees of effectiveness in practices such as 'social distancing' and 'staying home to prevent harm to others or oneself'.
Brazil aimed to persuade its population to stay at home, emphasizing the potential success in altering the prevailing model and slowing down the epidemic through protective measures and the concept of 'flattening the curve'. The populace's comprehension hinges on the ability to attain outcomes akin to those witnessed in China and South Korea, while steering clear of the dire situation experienced in Italy. There is a collective hope that the burden of risk, particularly in densely packed buses and subways, will not disproportionately fall on the working-class and impoverished individuals, who should not bear the brunt to cater to the whims of a more privileged class that may idealize the notion of quarantine.
Social distancing measures and widespread testing of asymptomatic contacts have been attributed to South Korea's success in preventing the emergence of new COVID-19 cases and significantly reducing mortality rates to nearly 100 times lower than those observed in Italy.
Testing IgM levels five days after suspicious contacts, signs, or symptoms is deemed ineffective. Rapid testing is essential for detecting carriers of viral particles. Brazil possesses the scientific and technological capabilities necessary for manufacturing diagnostic kits. Despite the development of kits by the Federal University of Bahia and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation at the laboratory level, they have not secured funding for production in industrial facilities. The lack of public funding can be attributed to the constraints imposed by Constitutional Amendment 955, which has been described as 'austere'.
The success of universal testing has spurred action among North American health workers. The online public health forum 'spiritof1848' has been advocating for universal testing in the USA since late February 2020, along with the recommendation for individuals with the virus or those who are ill to wear facial masks, thereby reducing the transmission to the estimated 86% who will remain asymptomatic (95% CI: [82% -90%]). Korea's implementation of universal testing has enabled the identification and isolation of positive asymptomatic patients, who are found to be responsible for 55% of new case transmissions (95% CI: [46% -62%]). The key factor in curbing transmission was the isolation of positive asymptomatic patients, in conjunction with basic hygiene practices such as handwashing with water and soap.
South Korea exhibited ingenuity by crafting makeshift masks to mitigate human contact with aerosols of saliva and other bodily secretions in public transportation, including vehicles operating at reduced capacity. Faced with inadequate industrial production, individuals resorted to utilizing a variety of materials such as tights, cloth remnants, paper towel scraps, and even bra cups fashioned into face coverings. While initially met with international amusement, these unconventional solutions proved effective in safeguarding public health.
As of March 2020, Brazil lacks a comprehensive mobilization and contingency plan for implementing social distancing measures and ensuring collective and individual protection. The implementation of a Minimum Citizen Income program could potentially prevent the economic collapse of the popular economy, mitigate starvation, and reduce instances of violence. Failure to take action may result in individuals avoiding the Coronavirus but succumbing to the economic repercussions, referred to as the 'Guedesvirus', characterized by bankruptcy, poverty, and a lack of financial resources for essential needs such as rent, food, electricity, water, and other services that ultraliberals have either privatized or aim to privatize.
While Brazil lacks a specific epidemiological health control model, be it vertical or participatory, the nation does possess a collection of authoritarian epidemiological laws. These laws grant the federal government the power to enforce stringent measures without seeking consultation and without providing avenues for defending regional or local interests.
The most comprehensive compilations outlining the fundamental requirements and entitlements of the workforce during periods of quarantine and social distancing can be found in the manifesto released by the ten Brazilian Union centrals and the '16 questions from the slums' document published by the urban periphery movement.
The Brazilian Center for Health Studies (Cebes) has directed its research and translational scientific exchange towards the integration of various sectors including health, economy, law, popular education, and others. This collaboration is formalized through participation in forums such as the National Health Council and the National Fronts, which have been established to advocate for health and life.
The discussions within the Cebes instances and the content featured in its journal, 'Saúde em Debate,' are focused on highlighting the ineffectiveness of the strategy of herd immunity in Iran and Italy. The significant loss of human lives can be attributed to the exceptionally high rate of reproduction (Rzero or Ro), resulting in severe cases among infants, children, young adults, and the elderly population, often with underlying health conditions. This experience was not prevalent in January, as the severity rate and the proportion of asymptomatic patients were not well understood at the beginning of 2020.
Personal protective equipment has been found to either be ineffective or necessitate multiple layers of protection, rendering them impractical for use within the primary care network. This is primarily due to the exorbitant costs associated with disposal and cleaning, as well as their unavailability stemming from the overwhelming demand resulting from the surge in cases. The magnitude of this demand was not fully understood until January 2020, when the Coronavirus outbreak hit the Middle East and Europe, solidifying the reality of the situation. The repercussions were starkly evident in the form of alarmingly high mortality rates among nurses, assistants, and doctors in Italy, leading to a shortage of hospital staff and the subsequent closure of medical facilities. The tragic outcome included a significant number of healthcare professionals falling ill and succumbing to the virus.
Upon comprehending the rapid rate of reproduction (Ro = 2.5), the significant proportion of asymptomatic carriers (86%), and the virus's ability to persist on various surfaces such as furniture, hospital waste, and communal objects (referred to as 'fomites' in medical terminology), coupled with the inability to alleviate the acute inflammatory state in critically ill patients within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) even after prolonged mechanical ventilation for up to 20 consecutive days, a notable shift has occurred in the European landscape. These factors have rendered the strategies of leaders like Trump and Bolsonaro, who advocated for allowing a substantial number of deaths to prevent economic stagnation, equally untenable.
We strongly condemn the approach of prioritizing the reopening of non-essential trade and activities, viewing it as reckless and endangering the working population. This strategy, which hinges on the belief that the epidemic will naturally subside, overlooks the stark reality of increased mortality rates among marginalized communities. Many individuals from the peripheries will be left without access to life-saving resources, including critical care in the limited number of well-equipped hospitals available.
The strategy of planned suppression was implemented following the dissemination of scientific knowledge regarding the experiences of China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The model adopted in the US, which faces significant resistance even domestically, represents a brutal form of colonialist imperialism that enforces mitigation measures alongside commercial and banking deregulation. Since the start of 2020, the Brazilian government has endeavored to emulate such approaches. Should the 'liberate all' strategy prevail in Brazil, it is evident that the consequence will be sacrificing lives for the sake of economic gains, benefiting investors and financiers, as has historically been the case.
