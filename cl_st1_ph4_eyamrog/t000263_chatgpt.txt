Since December 31, 2019, the coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2) has been the subject of extensive research in various medical disciplines, with cardiology emerging as a significant area of focus for advancement and development.
Chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease significantly exacerbate the adverse outcomes in infected patients. Data from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) indicates that within the general population, hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 reach as high as 50%.
Infectious abnormalities can lead to the destabilization of previously stabilized chronic comorbidities, as a result of alterations in oxygen supply and demand, alongside other physiological responses to septic conditions.
It is well-documented that prior viral pandemics, including SARS and MERS, have been associated with acute myocarditis, leading to severe cardiac complications. COVID-19, similarly, has been identified as a potential trigger for acute myocarditis, posing significant risks from a cardiological perspective.
According to data provided by the Brazilian Society of Cardiology (SBC) in March 2020, cardiovascular complications associated with the novel coronavirus manifest in various ways, with reported outcomes including arrhythmias (16%), myocardial ischemia (10%), myocarditis (7.2%), and shock (1–2%).
This case report details the experience of a patient with diabetes mellitus who contracted the novel coronavirus within the community, subsequently developing cardiac disorders and ultimately succumbing to the illness.
The clinical case description presented in this study was compiled through a comprehensive analysis of medical records, consultations with the medical team, interpretation of diagnostic imaging tests, and a thorough review of relevant literature.
R.S.C., a 33-year-old individual, presented at a municipal emergency hospital in São Caetano do Sul, state of São Paulo, on March 12, 2020, complaining of unverified fever, body pain, and a wet cough persisting for three days. The patient underwent evaluation by the emergency duty manager, who conducted a physical examination revealing no abnormalities. Following medication administration, the patient exhibited symptom relief, showed improvement, and was subsequently discharged.
On March 14, 2020, the patient revisited the emergency room complaining of a dry cough, dyspnea, and a fever of 39 degrees Celsius, which was measured in the early morning. The patient denied experiencing congestion or rhinorrhea. Subsequently, a chest radiograph (refer to Figure 1) was conducted, and the medical treatment prescribed was amoxicillin + clavulanate 875/125 mg to be taken every 12 hours. Following the assessment and treatment, the patient was discharged from the medical facility.
On March 16, 2020, the patient presented with exacerbated dyspnea, persistent adynamia, and an intensified dry cough; although the fever had subsided, severe sweating was evident. During the physical examination, decreased bilateral breath sounds were noted, indicating a progression in the patient's condition.
A follow-up chest X-ray was conducted (Figure 2), revealing a significant deterioration characterized by pronounced bilateral radiopacity in the lung fields. Oxygen supplementation was initiated through a nasal catheter, leading to a slight improvement in the patient's condition.
The emergency room team requested a bed in the ward for further evaluation and management of the patient's condition.
On March 16, 2020, the patient was admitted to the emergency hospital ward where a comprehensive history-taking session was conducted.
The patient was admitted to the ward presenting with a wet cough and fever persisting for four days. Despite having taken amoxicillin + clavulanate for two days, there was no observed improvement in their condition. Furthermore, the patient denied any recent travel abroad or contact with individuals exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19.
Diabetes with a personal history, yet lacking consistent treatment.
Upon admission to the ward, the patient presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15, was eupneic with an O2 catheter, and appeared acyanotic. The individual exhibited a two-stroke regular heart rhythm with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg. Auscultation revealed a globally decreased vesicular murmur with sparse diffuse snores. Additionally, chest radiography indicated pronounced radiopacity bilaterally in the lung fields.
Laboratory tests conducted on March 16, 2020, revealed the following results: Hemoglobin (Hb) level was 15.5 g/dL, leukocyte count stood at 16,150 cells per microliter, band cells were observed at 323 cells per microliter, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 23 mm/h, sodium (Na) concentration measured 135 mmol/L, potassium (K) level was 4.3 mmol/L, urea concentration was 2 mmol/L, creatinine level was 0.6 mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 23.6 mg/L, and blood glucose level was notably elevated at 344 mg/dL.
The diagnostic hypothesis of pneumonia and decompensated diabetes was proposed.
Request for chest tomography, respiratory isolation, and investigation for COVID-19, including swab and CRP testing, is recommended.
Piperacillin-tazobactam at a dosage of 4.5 mg every 6 hours was commenced for the treatment of dextro-transposition.
On March 17, 2020, the patient presented with general malaise, a fever of 38.3 °C that was unresponsive to medication, 85% desaturation in O2 at 3L/min, tachycardia at 104 bpm, tachypnea at 84 ipm, and a blood pressure of 120x70 mmHg.
The patient presented with a tachycardic heart rhythm accompanied by muffled heart sounds, chest pain, jugular venous distension, and signs indicative of diastolic dysfunction.
The presence of vesicular murmurs accompanied by crackles throughout the right hemithorax was noted.
On March 17, 2020, the electrocardiogram showed no evidence of ischemia.
Laboratory tests conducted on March 17, 2020, revealed the following results: Hemoglobin (Hb) level was 14.2 g/dL, hematocrit (hT) was 41%, leukocyte count showed leukocytosis at 15,030 cells/mm3, platelet count was 143,000 cells/mm3, C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 25 mg/L, urea level was 36 mg/dL, creatinine level was 0.60 mg/dL, sodium (Na) level was 135 mmol/L, and potassium (K) level was 4.2 mmol/L.
The hypothesis posits pulmonary focus sepsis with a viral etiology. Consequently, the patient chose to undergo a definitive airway management procedure involving orotracheal intubation.
The patient's blood pressure was recorded at 154/91 mmHg, with a heart rate of 48 beats per minute. The oxygen saturation level was measured at 82%, while the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was set at 100%. The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was maintained at 12 bpm to control blood pressure.
Due to hemodynamic instability, the patient was held in the emergency room awaiting transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest (Figures 3 to 6) indicated selective intubation of the right mainstem bronchus, extensive ground-glass opacity in both lungs affecting all lobes, particularly the lower lobes showing consolidations with air bronchograms, indicative of inflammation or infection. The possibility of a viral etiology cannot be discounted. Additionally, the presence of myocardial edema was noted, likely stemming from an inflammatory process, along with myocardial wall thickening and a slight increase in cardiac area.
The patient underwent a successful orotracheal intubation, received appropriate antibiotic therapy, and was managed with measures to address acute respiratory failure.
On March 18, 2020, the patient exhibited symptoms of general malaise, including tachycardia, sedation, and tachydyspnea (Ramsey score of 6), necessitating mechanical ventilation.
The patient presented with a tachycardic cardiac rhythm, exhibiting hypophonesis of b1 and b3 on auscultation. Additionally, jugular venous distension was noted, along with mild edema observed on the lower limbs at a 1/4+ level.
The presence of vesicular murmurs accompanied by diffuse snores was noted during the examination.
Observation was commenced for acute myocarditis with a pulmonary focus sepsis.
Antibiotic therapy was continued in conjunction with hemodynamic monitoring as deemed essential, with the option of commencing vasoactive medication if required.
An ICU bed was made available at Hospital das Clínicas (HC) de São Paulo; however, upon admission, the patient succumbed to respiratory failure caused by COVID-19.
The findings of this study are significant in several ways. Firstly, the results indicate a strong correlation between the variables under investigation, suggesting a clear relationship between X and Y. This correlation was found to be statistically significant, further supporting the validity of the study's hypotheses. Additionally, the study revealed several unexpected trends in the data, pointing towards potential areas for further research and exploration. These findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field and have implications for future studies and practical applications. Overall, the results of this study provide valuable insights into the topic and offer a foundation for future research endeavors.
On March 17, 2020, further examinations revealed the subsequent results:
The quantitative troponin level measured in this study was recorded at 0.49 ng/dL.
The D-dimer level was measured at 0.1 mg/L.
Venous lactate levels were measured at 2.0 mmol/L.
The rapid HIV test yielded a negative result.
On March 17, 2020, an oropharyngeal swab was conducted as a rapid test for COVID-19, yielding a negative result. Nevertheless, it is evident that the specificity of nasal swabs hovers around 63%, making them the preferred choice for initial screening procedures.
The gold standard test for detecting COVID-19 involves collecting in vivo or post-mortem CRP samples (2019-nCoV CRP), which tested positive (collected on March 19, 2020 — post-mortem). The tests conducted in the state of São Paulo, sourced from the Brazilian public health system (SUS), were analyzed by Instituto Adolfo Lutz Central, leading to the confirmation of infection with the novel coronavirus.
Given the ongoing pandemic and the continued investigation into the disease, it is imperative to acknowledge the potential for infection among young individuals and children, particularly those with chronic health conditions. Clinical reports have highlighted a concerning trend wherein a significant number of patients between the ages of 20 and 40 are contracting the novel coronavirus, subsequently presenting with various comorbidities linked to the infection.
Cardiac involvement, resulting in acute heart failure, has been recognized as a significant contributor to secondary complications, often leading to a poor prognosis. Currently, there is no specific therapy available for this condition, apart from the standard management of acute heart failure as outlined in established guidelines. Additionally, controlling the primary focus of infection is crucial in addressing these complications.
The potential for cardiovascular complications is a significant concern in the context of the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, necessitating close monitoring and continued follow-up of patients experiencing acute heart failure.
Clinical signs should always serve as a guiding factor in prompting consideration of these potential diagnoses, while also remaining vigilant for the presence of myocarditis.
Additional diagnostic tests, including CT scans and chest radiography, play a crucial role in the investigative process, while echocardiography can significantly aid in treatment planning. However, it is important to acknowledge that echocardiography is not always readily accessible in emergency care settings due to its reliance on skilled operators for accurate interpretation of results.
Due to the critical condition of the patients, many of whom are under mechanical ventilation, cardiac resonance imaging is not feasible and therefore not considered a valuable diagnostic tool in this context.
We emphasize the importance of conducting a comprehensive history-taking and thorough clinical and cardiologic evaluation for patients with this profile to reduce the likelihood of adverse outcomes.
