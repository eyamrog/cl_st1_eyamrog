This paper presents a technique for detecting regularities within the complete genome of Coronavirus 2 by utilizing the concept of intervals in the RNA chain and comparing them with the known sequence. The Maximum Regularity Index was employed for this analysis. The findings reveal the identification of regions with high regularity, notably in ORF10, Gene N, and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. Particularly noteworthy are the intervals around 3500 and 11000, which exhibit high regularity values but do not align with extensively documented elements, both within the Gene: Orf1ab. This suggests the importance of further investigation into these regions. Detecting such regularities could potentially lead to the development of biochemical or genetic techniques aimed at deactivating specific functions of Coronavirus 2 or controlling its effects.
The Coronavirus 2 genome comprises a sequence of 29,902 nucleotides as of April 10th, 2020 [1]. Its taxonomic lineage is as follows: Viruses; Riboviria; Nidovirals; Cornidovirineae; Coronaviridae; Orthocoronavirinae; Betacoronavirus; Sarbecovirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, with its GenBank acronym being SARS-CoV-2.
A method was employed wherein chains of RNA of a specific length were extracted and compared with chains of the same length found within the entire genome. This technique has been previously utilized in studies involving other microorganisms [2], [3], [4].
The index of maximum regularity, denoted as 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟, was initially introduced in reference [5] and has been extensively discussed in other scholarly works, including [4].
In summary, a string or interval, denoted as lc, is defined to encompass the new sequences that emerge when a shift is made, altering one nucleotide at a time resulting in 𝑙𝑐−1 sequences. Each ordered pair is a component of the set 𝐵× 𝐵, where 𝐵 is defined as {𝐴, 𝐺, 𝑇, 𝐶}. This process is iterated by including the original sequence and its reverse order in the analysis.
The maximum likelihood ratio test, denoted as 𝑟, was employed on the entire genome of Coronavirus 2. The following section presents the outcomes in terms of concurrence with genes previously identified through alternative methodologies (NCBI, 2020) and potential avenues for further investigation and exploration.
A visualization depicting the components of Coronavirus 2 is presented through the configuration provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, 2020).
In the specified regions, there exist intervals that exhibit elevated values as illustrated in Table 1.
It is evident that high values are observed in the areas near the intervals around 21578, 29876, 29390, 3952, and 11076. Upon consulting the database, this observation is deemed positive as Gene S, Gene N, and ORF10 were identified. Further detailed research is necessary to understand the occurrences around the 11078 interval (20 nt). It is crucial to note that Gene: Orf1ab spans the range [269, 21 558], covering 71% of the entire genome, indicating a wide scope. The notation 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟 suggests significance around 11000 that warrants further investigation.
The complete genome was analyzed using a 16 nucleotide sequence, as depicted in Graph 2 and Table 2.
In this sequence, Gene S (start) and Gene ORF10 have been identified. Furthermore, the 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟 denotes a significant region encompassing the 11000 interval.
When computing using a length interval of 28 nucleotides, it is evident that the regions around positions 3500 and 11000 exhibit notably elevated values. Longer sequences are excluded from the analysis due to the diminishing likelihood of their occurrence, attributed to the increasing number of possible combinations involving the four nucleotide options.
During the analysis, Gene S, Gene N, and ORF10 were identified. The intervals around 3500 and 11000, respectively, exhibit high levels of regularity, which do not align with documented elements within Gene: Orf1ab. It may be worthwhile to emphasize the significance of this particular region.
The strategy devised in this study has the potential to provide valuable insights into Coronavirus 2. With further extensive research and increased sophistication, it is plausible that a viable treatment could be discovered in the future.
