ABSTRACT – (Fern flora of Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil: Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae 
and Saccolomataceae). As part of an ongoing project treating the ferns and lycophytes from the region 
of Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, we here present the taxonomic treatment of the early divergent 
lineages of the leptosporangiate ferns: the families Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae and 
Saccolomataceae. We have been sampling the remnant forest patches since 2012; we also fully 
reviewed the collection of herbarium VIC and other online collections: F, IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, 
UPCB, US, and WTU. In the region of Viçosa, six taxa belonging to those families occur 
Dennstaedtia cicutaria and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Dennstaedtiaceae); 
Lindsaea lancea var. lancea, L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta var. stricta 
(Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma elegans (Saccolomataceae). Among these taxa, only L. 
quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic 
Rainforest; the remaining are widespread in the Neotropics. We present keys, descriptions, 
illustrations, examined specimens, and comments.

Introduction 
 
At the end of the era in which the plant Classification Systems were mostly based on 
morphological data, Dennstaedtiaceae was considered a big family, comprehending three subfamilies 
(or tribes) and about 17 genera (Tryon & Tryon 1982, Kramer 1990). With the advent of molecular 
data, those subfamilies were raised to family-level, some families were created, and now the early-
diverging leptosporangiate ferns are represented by Cystodiaceae (one genus), Dennstaedtiaceae with 
a stricter circumscription (11-12 genera), Lindsaeaceae (seven genera), Lonchitidaceae (one genus), 
Saccolomataceae (one or two genera), as well as the great Pteridaceae (+50 genera) (Smith et al. 
2006, PPG I 2016, Shang et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2020). 
Brazil is represented by Dennstaedtiaceae with eight genera and 26 species, Lindsaeaceae with 
one genus and 34 spp., Lonchitidaceae with one genus and one sp., and Saccolomataceae with one 
genus and nine spp., leaving Pteridaceae apart (which is subject to another paper) (Kramer 1957, Pena 
et al. 2020, Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd & Pena 2020). In general, these plants present 
characters considered plesiomorphic that are typical of the early-diverging lineages of Polypodiales, 
such as solesnotelic rhizomes clothed with hairs or primitive scales, large, highly dissected leaves, 
the sori that are truly marginal and protected by inner and outer indusia, and trilete spores (Tryon & 
Tryon 1982, Kramer 1990, PPG I 2016, Schwartsburd et al. 2020). 
Pteridium is spread all across the globe (except for Antarctic) and may be the one most 
important to mankind by if directly affects the local human populations: it behaves as a pioneer weed 
invading croplands; it spreads its underground rhizomes making it hard to be removed; it intoxicates 
the cattle and horses; and it also intoxicates humans, when ingested - some studies also pointed out 
the transmission of its toxins (the psilatoquinis) via cow milk (e.g., Tryon 1941, Evans 1976, Page 
1976, Marrs et al. 2000, Martini-Santos et al. 2010, Oliveira et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2018). 
In the State of Minas Gerais, Dennstaedtiaceae is represented by 14 species, Lindsaeaceae by 11 
spp., and Saccolomataceae by three spp. (Pena et al. 2020 Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd & Pena 2020, 
Schwartsburd 2022). Here, we present the taxonomic treatment of these families for the region of Viçosa, 
Minas Gerais State, Brazil, as part of the ongoing project on the Fern Flora of this region with fascicles in 
preparation and others already published: Miranda & Schwartsburd (2016 - Salviniales), Rabelo & 
Schwartsburd (2016 - Schizaeales), and Gonçalves da Silva & Schwartsburd (2017 - Polypodiaceae).

Material and methods 
 
 
In the region of Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, the remaining forest patches are classified 
as Semi-Deciduous Seasonal Forest (IBGE 2012). The local elevation ranges from 600 to 900 m.a.s.l. 
(pers. obs.), and the annual temperatures range from 5° to 30°C (INMET 2021). 
We have been sampling the remnant forest patches since 2012. Specimens were collected and 
dried according to usual methods for fern collections (Windisch 1992) and then incorporated in 
herbarium VIC (acronyms following Thiers, continuously updated), with duplicates to be sent to other 
herbaria. We also fully reviewed the collection of herbarium VIC and collections of other herbaria 
online: F, IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. Although the classification system adopted 
for the previous fascicles was based on an adaptation of Kenrick & Crane (1997) and Smith et al. (2006), 
we here adopt the system of PPG I (2016). Morphological terms are according to Lellinger (2002). 
 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
 
Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and Saccolomataceae, presented a total of four genera and 
six species occurring in the region of Viçosa. Four of those species have also infra-specific 
classifications, which were adopted here. The six taxa are: Dennstaedtia cicutaria (Sw.) T. Moore, 
and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Kaulf.) J.A. Thomson (Dennstaedtiaceae); Lindsaea 
lancea (L.) Bedd. var. lancea, L. quadrangularis Raddi subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta (Sw.) 
Dryand. var. stricta (Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma elegans Kaulf. Among them, only L. 
quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic 
Rainforest; the remaining taxa are widespread in the Neotropics. Differently from the other studied 
families: Salviniaceae (Miranda & Schwartsburd 2016); Anemiaceae (Rabelo & Schwartsburd 2016); 
Polypodicaeae (Gonçalves da Silva & Schwartsburd 2017), we have not recollected half of the taxa 
involved in this paper, which were collected on the 1930s and never again. Probably, they went locally 
extinct due to forest fragmentation and disturbance. We have not recollected D. cicutaria, L. lancea 
var. lancea, nor L. quandrangularis subsp. quadrangularis.

Dennstaedtiaceae 
Rhizomes generaly long-creeping, solenostelic or rarely dictyostelic or polycyclic, bearing hairs 
or rarely with primitive scales. Leaves monomorphic; stipes often with epipetiolar buds, usually with a 
omega-shaped vascular strand; laminae 2-5-pinnate, rarely less dissected; veins free or rarely 
anastomosing and then without included veinlets; indument formed by hairs or glandular hairs, or absent. 
Sori marginal or submarginal, linear or discrete, introrse or extrorse, protected by outer and/or inner 
indusia or rarely not protected; spores tetrahedral and trilete, or reniform and monolete (Smith et al. 2006). 
 
The family is cosmopolitan, composed of eleven genera and ca. 270 species (PPG I 2016, 
Shang et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2020). The clade containing Dennstaedtia, Leptolepia, 
Microlepia, and Oenotrichia still needs recircumscriptions, due to a polyphyletic Dennstaedtia 
(Schwartsburd et al. 2020). 
 
Dennstaedtia Bernh. 
Rhizomes short to long-creeping, glabrous or with catenate hairs. Leaves large, to 4 m long; 
laminae 2-4-pinnate; veins free; indument formed by catenate hairs, acicular hairs, or absent; sori 
marginal, discrete, at the tip of single veins; inner and outer indusia fused into purse- or cup-shaped 
or hemi-globose indusia (Smith et al. 2006).

Dennstaedtia is polyphyletic in current circumscription (Schwartsburd et al. 2020), with about 
70 species. In Brazil occur six species (Schwartsburd & Pena 2020), but there are probably about 
eight to ten species (pers. obs.).

recognized as infra-specific entities, such as subspecies, varieties, forms, or combinations of more 
than one rank (e.g., Tryon 1941, Page 1976, Thomson 2012, Schwartsburd et al. 2018). In Brazil, the 
following taxa are currently recognized: Pteridium caudatum (L.) Maxon, P. esculentum subsp. 
arachnoideum, P. esculentum subsp. campestre (Schrad.) Schwartsb. & J. Prado, P. esculentum

subsp. gryphus Schwartsb., P. esculentum var. harpianum Schwartsb. & A. Yañez, and P. esculentum 
var. paedomorficum Schwartsb. & J. Prado (Schwartsburd 2020). The most common taxon in 
southeastern Brazil is P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, which invades crops and is toxic for cattle, 
horses, and human ingestion (Schwartsburd et al. 2018).

Rhizomes erect or rarely short-creeping, sometimes forming small trunks, dictyostelic, 
bearing peltate scales. Leaves monomorphic; stipes with an omega-shaped vascular strand; laminae 
1-4-pinnate; veins free; indument formed by caduceus scales or rarely by scattered catenate hairs. 
Sori marginal or submarginal, discrete, extrorse, protected by outer (not modified) and inner 
(modified) indusia; spores tetrahedral-globose and trilete (Smith et al. 2006). 
 
One pantropical genus with about 24 species (Rojas-Alvarado 2010, Luong et al. 2015, 
Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd 2022). The adoption of genus Orthiopteris for the Paleotropical 
species is phylogenetically justified, but lacks morphological support; thus, regarding only 
Saccoloma in Saccolomataceae is more convenient (Schwartsburd 2022). In Brazil, nine species are 
currently recognized (Schwartsburd 2022).

Figure 1 e-l 
Plants terrestrial. Rhizomes erect to decumbent, stout to trunk-like, glabrescent; leaves 1.2-
2.2 m long; petioles proximally burgundy, stramineous above, 40-80 cm long, proximally wrinkled 
to minutely spiny; petiolar scales peltate, blackish, with or without lighter, dentate margins; laminae 
1-pinnnate 80-140 cm long; rachises stramineous, glabrous; basal pinnae 15-25 × 2.5-3.5 cm; costae 
abaxially and adaxially glabrous; veins commonly 1-furcate, rarely simple or 2 or 3-furcate (at the 
base of pinnae), abaxially and adaxially glabrous; sori marginal, discrete, born at the tip of single 
veins, placed side by side, opening extrorsely; outer indusia not modified; inner indusia hemi-
umbonate, commonly forming wings connecting adjacent sori. 
Geographical distribution: Endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, from Pernambuco to Santa 
Catarina.
