The precautionary principle, an integral component of evidence-based healthcare, is often subject to scrutiny due to its reliance on evidence that may not always be the most robust. The emergence of the highly contagious and deadly Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), characterized by acute respiratory symptoms, prompted healthcare professionals to urgently seek effective strategies to combat the escalating morbidity and mortality rates. Consequently, the precautionary principle was invoked as a crucial tool in both preventive and therapeutic contexts, particularly in managing life-threatening conditions. This communication aims to critically examine the application of the precautionary principle within the dental profession in the context of COVID-19. It is essential to acknowledge the dynamic nature of guidelines, protocols, and strategies in response to such a rapidly evolving disease, necessitating continuous evaluation and adaptation of policies.
Evidence-based healthcare has become the prevailing paradigm across all health professions, originating from evidence-based medicine and extending to various health approaches. This approach emphasizes the utilization of the best available evidence in the treatment of individuals, challenging the traditional authority-based healthcare model. Dentistry, however, presents a notable distinction from Medicine as the majority of cases in this field do not culminate in death, which is an unequivocal outcome. In Dentistry, the loss of a tooth stands out as one of the most common definitive outcomes, with exceptions. Patient-related outcome measures, such as masticatory function, esthetics, and oral health-related quality of life, also constitute true outcomes that must always be taken into account.
The concept of evidence-based dentistry integrates three key components: the highest quality evidence, the expertise of the practitioner, and the values and preferences of the patient. It is imperative that all these elements are carefully considered in the decision-making process.
However, there are instances where the available evidence is of low quality or nonexistent. In 2020, the world faced a pandemic with the emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting in a significant global death toll. Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to a severe respiratory syndrome, particularly fatal for older adults and individuals with underlying health conditions. Consequently, various preventive and therapeutic interventions have been proposed, some lacking robust evidence and others lacking any support. These recommendations often rely on the precautionary principle. This article delves into an in-depth analysis of the precautionary principle in dental care, with a specific focus on the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The precautionary principle is a preventive concept rooted in epidemiological studies that pinpoint potential risk factors and, despite lacking complete proof, become integrated into preventive policies [4]. This principle is invoked when evidence neither definitively supports nor refutes a hypothesis. Any action taken within preventive policies must undergo constant and vigilant monitoring until evidence either validates or dismisses the measure. Figure 1 provides a concise overview of the precautionary principle within the realm of evidence-based healthcare.
One crucial aspect in applying the precautionary principle involves the inclusion of adverse events in the assessment [5]. Additionally, the severity and impact of the situation being evaluated, particularly in terms of morbidity and mortality, play a significant role. The precautionary principle proves especially valuable in scenarios where morbidity and mortality rates are elevated, as exemplified by the current COVID-19 pandemic [4].
In addition to preventive measures, the precautionary principle proves valuable in therapeutic strategies. For instance, in certain cancer treatments, therapy may commence prior to the emergence of statistically significant differences when compared to a control group. Nevertheless, akin to preventive interventions, vigilant monitoring of both beneficial and adverse effects remains imperative in such scenarios.
It is crucial for those who comprehend, promote, or scrutinize the precautionary principle to recognize that uncertainty exists in varying degrees in such scenarios [4]. Evidence-based healthcare endeavors to mitigate uncertainty using the most effective methods available, yet in situations where life is at risk, greater levels of uncertainty must be accepted.
One crucial aspect that requires reinforcement is the concept that the "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." This principle underscores that the lack of evidence in a particular scenario does not indicate that the scenario is ineffective or irrelevant. Widely recognized in epidemiology, this notion must consistently inform decision-making processes and the design and oversight of research endeavors. It is imperative to acknowledge that refraining from conducting a study solely due to the absence of evidence, influenced by personal beliefs, may not always be ethical. Therefore, the precautionary principle is often invoked, suggesting that proposals should be either validated or disproven through continued monitoring.
On the contrary, a critical consideration arises with the application of the precautionary principle, particularly in determining the potential outcomes of a problem, disease, or condition. When the potential outcome involves death, severe disability, or comparable grave circumstances, lower-quality evidence may be deemed acceptable to support interventions until a definitive resolution is attained. Conversely, when the issue at hand does not result in significant harm, relying on inferior evidence is insufficient. Within the field of Dentistry, the scope of the precautionary principle is notably restricted. A common argument that surfaces is the question of "if it poses no harm, why not utilize it?" Such a stance is incompatible with evidence-based healthcare unless there are specific justifications presented for invoking the precautionary principle.
Various perspectives are crucial in assessing the precautionary principle, particularly in light of its potential misuse. Certain reports have even framed it as a scientific fallacy or inconsistency. It is evident that this issue is multifaceted and cannot be viewed unilaterally. A thorough comprehension of the principle is essential, necessitating a critical examination of all instances where it is applied.
The COVID-19 pandemic likely originated in China and has since rapidly spread globally [7]. This highly contagious disease presents significant challenges for healthcare professionals due to the considerable levels of uncertainty it introduces. The novelty of the disease, coupled with a lack of comprehensive understanding, further complicates the situation, exacerbating the difficulties faced by healthcare providers.
The present study was conducted between May 20th and June 5th, 2020, a period of particular significance given the rapidly evolving nature of the global situation. Throughout this two-week timeframe, numerous developments occurred, with information being updated frequently, sometimes multiple times a day. It is widely acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all continents, with the United States of America and Brazil standing out for their high numbers of fatalities [8, 9]. By the end of May 2020, it was estimated that over 370 thousand individuals had succumbed to the virus worldwide, while the number of confirmed cases exceeded 6.2 million [10].
Research from various countries suggests that maintaining social distance is a crucial measure in reducing infectivity [11, 12]. This is significant as it could potentially lead to flattening the curve, enabling health systems to better prepare for the situation. However, the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of different approaches highlights the necessity for global governmental investment, sparking intense debates and controversies.
The World Health Organization is spearheading efforts to enhance understanding of the pandemic and has officially declared it a public health emergency, emphasizing the necessity for collective action from individuals worldwide. In light of the precautionary principle, given the absence of specific evidence for this disease, various protective measures have been implemented based on collateral evidence in an attempt to safeguard populations. The ongoing assessment of these measures represents the most up-to-date and reliable evidence currently available.
In evidence-based healthcare, the evaluation methods employed are crucial. However, data on prevalence is often lacking in this context. This deficiency arises from variations in testing protocols across countries, discrepancies in how causes of death are recorded, and other factors. It is likely that a considerable number of COVID-19-related deaths went unreported, primarily due to under-notification or the absence of post-mortem testing on deceased individuals.
In countries with well-established healthcare systems, superior notification systems are in place. For instance, the United States of America has initiated a public-private partnership for community-based testing, while Germany has established private partnerships for testing. Patients in these countries have the option to undergo testing at hospitals, and in times of increased demand, medical students in universities are also equipped to conduct these tests.
One aspect requiring examination involves the associations between certain measures and the elevation or flattening of the disease curve. Research has shown that social isolation can be an effective strategy [11]. While the use of masks has been suggested [13], it is important to note that the World Health Organization does not advocate for the general use of masks among healthy individuals, except for healthcare workers or those in direct contact with an infected person [14]. The CDC, on the other hand, recommends the utilization of cloth face coverings in conjunction with thorough hand washing or the use of hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, maintaining social distancing of at least 1.8 meters, and ensuring the cleanliness and disinfection of surfaces [15].
Another noteworthy scenario that must be acknowledged is the initial hypothesis suggesting a potential positive impact of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis, while intriguing, unfortunately led to a misinterpretation within certain sectors of the healthcare community. While there appeared to be a promising effect, the supporting evidence was notably weak, primarily relying on observational data. As time progressed and individuals who believed in the potential benefits began using these medications, subsequent studies failed to validate such advantages. Instead, emerging data indicates that the associated risks are considerably high. Consequently, within a brief timeframe, more robust evidence swiftly debunked the notion of these drugs as a viable treatment option.
The current situation presents us with a novel disease characterized by a high mortality rate, for which there is a lack of direct, conclusive evidence regarding prevention and treatment strategies. Given this uncertainty, it is essential to adopt a precautionary approach, implementing measures based on indirect evidence that require ongoing assessment. If these measures consistently demonstrate benefits, they can be integrated into established protocols. Conversely, if they fail to show efficacy or reveal significant adverse effects, they should be promptly discontinued from the strategies being employed.
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the field of Dentistry is encountering a novel challenge. Much like healthcare professionals involved in the intubation of infected patients, dental practitioners are confronted with a significant issue concerning aerosol transmission. Saliva, which is often contaminated, poses a risk of infection for both healthcare workers and other individuals present in the same environment. Furthermore, existing literature indicates that salivary glands may serve as a potential reservoir for the virus [17].
It is imperative to acknowledge that elective procedures should be restricted during this phase of the pandemic, leading to the postponement of maintenance visits, among other non-essential medical activities. However, it is noteworthy that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States rescinded its recommendation to delay elective procedures on May 18th. In Brazil, divergent guidelines exist, with recommendations differing across states. Healthcare providers must stay informed about the prevailing local regulations, which are contingent upon the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and the healthcare system's capacity.
It is crucial to emphasize to the population the importance of oral hygiene practices to prevent the need for immediate dental intervention or the deterioration of oral health [19].
On the other hand, there are instances where in-office dental care is necessary, particularly for individuals experiencing pain, spontaneous bleeding, dental trauma, and similar conditions [19]. In such scenarios, prioritizing biosafety is crucial. Dentistry stands as a discipline that can offer valuable insights to other professions in this regard. However, relying solely on traditional biosafety measures may not suffice. Therefore, it is advisable to opt for evidence-based approaches. Additionally, some decisions may not be entirely evidence-based or may lack the highest quality evidence. Nevertheless, it is imperative to make informed decisions by considering the best available direct or collateral evidence, ultimately leading to the construction of guidelines.
Various organizations have addressed this topic, and as of the current article, they have put forth several recommendations. The recommendations from the CDC and ADA entail prior communication with patients for COVID-19 screening, the avoidance of non-emergent dental procedures when patients exhibit COVID-19 symptoms, the reduction of companions accompanying patients whenever feasible, the minimization of patient numbers in waiting areas, and the assessment of patient temperatures before administering dental care [18, 20].
One suggested procedure involves rinsing with H2O2, although direct evidence supporting this recommendation is currently lacking. The potential of H2O2 in reducing viral load exemplifies the application of the precautionary principle, emphasizing caution in the absence of definitive data. Nevertheless, the efficacy of this approach requires ongoing assessment and scrutiny.
Given the reliance of evidence-based Dentistry on patient participation, it is crucial to effectively communicate with individuals seeking dental care, ensuring they are fully informed about the entire situation and obtaining their signed written informed consent.
At the time of writing this article, there was a scarcity of high-quality evidence regarding the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Consequently, it is imperative to apply the precautionary principle. Nevertheless, it is essential to exercise caution and maintain ongoing surveillance. Scientific endeavors must exhibit maturity by advancing and retracting as needed, all with the overarching goal of prioritizing healthcare and the overall well-being of humanity.
