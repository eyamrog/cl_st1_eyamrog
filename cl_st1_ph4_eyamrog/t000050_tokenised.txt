Our two datasets 4 reported here are comprised of occurrence data for sand flies from the Suruwaha Indigenous 5 Land in the state of Amazonas collected between 2012-1013, and the Wajãpi Indigenous Land 6 in the state of Amapá collected between 2013-2014. Sand flies were collected using unbaited 7 CDC-like light traps at various sites within each study area and were identified to species-level 8 by taxonomists with expertise in Amazonian fauna. A total of 4,646 records are reported: 9 1,428 from the Suruwaha and 3,218 from the Wajãpi. These records will contribute to a better 10 understanding of ACL transmission dynamics, as well as the distribution of insect vectors, in 11 these areas. 12

In Brazil, American cutaneous 18 leishmaniasis (ACL) is an endemic disease, but little is known about its impact on indigenous 19 human populations, especially those living in more remote areas with little contact with non- 20 indigenous people living outside their territorial lands. In order to investigate the sand fly 21 fauna present during outbreaks of ACL among the Suruwaha and the Wajãpi indigenous people 22 that occurred between 2012-2014, we carried out fieldwork to collect these insects and 23 identify potential vectors. Insects were identified by keys available in the literature [3,4] by 24 experienced taxonomists. 25 Our datasets are comprised of sand fly occurrence data from: (i) the Suruwaha 26 Indigenous Land (SIL) in the south of the state of Amazonas collected between 2012-1013; and 27 (ii) the Wajãpi Indigenous Land (WIL) in the state of Amapá collected between 2013-2014. The 28 data sets reported here are the metadata for each individual sand fly specimen collected 29 during the fieldwork and include 41 Darwin Core Standard (DwC) terms [5] available for the 30 Suruwaha dataset and 39 for the Wajãpi dataset. All mandatory fields are present and have 31 gone through screening in the FIOCRUZ IPT, metadata fields are also available on the online 32 pages. 33

49 Context 50 ACL is a serious public health problem in Brazil, with 203,406 cases were recorded 51 between 2010 and 2020, with the administrative North Region of the country, which includes 52 the Amazon biome, currently accounting for 42% of all cases recorded within Brazil [6]. 53 Health and disease conditions among indigenous people in Brazil are poorly known. 54 There is a huge gap in government databases on morbidity, mortality, disease notification, etc, 55 which prevent the construction of the most basic socio-demographic and health indicators. 56 However, the few studies on the public health of populations of indigenous people in Brazil 57 show a situation of marginalization and vulnerability, which translate into low quality of life, 58 difficulty in accessing services in general, and low health indicators [7]. 59 In addition, the different transmission patterns of ACL make the disease difficult to 60 control, and understand, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, which has the greatest diversity of 61 the species of parasites of the genus Leishmania, their insect vectors and vertebrate hosts, in 62 the Neotropical region [1]. 63 Auto-generated PDF by ReView GigaByte Indigenous1submitted.docxMainDocument GigaScience Review Copy Only 6 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3879
Our two datasets are comprised of sand fly occurrence data from fieldwork 64 undertaken by the authors during the ACL outbreaks in) the SIL and WIL. 65
66 Suruwaha dataset 67 Transmission of ACL south of the Amazon River system is poorly understood [8,9]. 68 Although it has often been stated that human Leishmania infection is either rare or absent 69 south of the Negro and Amazon Rivers [8,10], the incidence of leishmaniasis in humans in 70 some of these areas is equivalent to the incidence at north of the Negro and Amazon Rivers 71 [9,11]. Guerra et al. (2011) [12] described the epidemiology of mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) 72 south of the Amazon River, and not only found a high prevalence of this form of the disease, 73 but also a distribution of Leishmania species similar to the distribution found north of the 74 Amazon River. However, the etiologic agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has not been 75 identified, and the source of sylvatic infection and the vectors involved in transmission are not 76 known south of the Amazon River system [8,13]. 77 The Suruwaha are comprised of a population of approximately 170 people [14] whose 78 only contact with non-indigenous people is through health workers and members of FUNAI 79 (the Fundação Nacional do Índio; the Brazilian government agency responsible for protecting 80 indigenous people). The Suruwaha live in a very remote location, far from urban areas and 81 they manufacture of utensils, being agriculture and hunting the main activities of this people. 82 Entomological research within the SIL was carried out by us in order to contribute to 83 the understanding of the transmission dynamics of ACL as there was an increase in the number 84 of cases of ACL recorded among the Suruwaha between 2010 and 2012. Our investigation 85 found that this increase was likely related to the distribution to the entire community of 86 flashlights in late 2010, as requested by the Suruwaha themselves. This seems to be the main 87 cause of the increase in ACL, as it led to changes in the hunting habits of the Suruwaha from 88 Auto-generated PDF by ReView GigaByte Indigenous1submitted.docxMainDocument GigaScience Review Copy Only 7 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3879 strictly diurnal to nocturnal, and coincides with the generally crepuscular and nocturnal biting 89 activity of the blood-feeding female sand flies that transmit ACL. 90
The SIL is very remote and our entomological survey was performed by different teams 91 to take advantage of routine operations by FUNAI. A total of 1,428 sand fly specimens were 92 identified to either genus or species-level. Ten genera and 33 species were collected, of which 93 the genera Trichophoromyia was predominant (57%), followed by Psychodopygus (20%) and 94 Nyssomyia (5%). Among the most abundant species were T. ubiquitalis (25%), T. octavioi (9%) 95 and Ps. davisi (8%). 96
97 Wajãpi dataset 98 The Wajãpi are a group of about 1,200 people [15], distributed in 80 small villages 99 scattered throughout their territory. All families subsist by agriculture, fishing, hunting and 100 gathering, periodically changing the location of their villages to allow the ecological recovery of 101 the areas they have occupied. Access to the villages can be via the road, rivers and streams 102 that cross their territory, as well as open trails through the forest. The resumption of the 103 traditional model of Wajãpi occupation and dispersal for territorial exploitation, which 104 maintains the quality of life of the people and, at the same time, guarantees territorial 105 surveillance was essential to guarantee the pattern of abundance that the Wajãpi consider 106 adequate [16]. In the last 10 years, the activity of large mining companies, and the building of 107 hydroelectric plants, in the environment surrounding the WIL threatens the quality of life of 108 the Wajãpi, through forest degradation, environmental contamination, and the insertion of the 109 community in a context of great social vulnerability, which coincides with the increased 110 incidence of pests in crops and endemic diseases, such as malaria and leishmaniasis. 111 Our dataset is comprised of sand fly records that resulted from the activities of a 112 project aimed to evaluate the main risk factors for the disease, using an interdisciplinary 113 Auto-generated PDF by ReView GigaByte Indigenous1submitted.docxMainDocument GigaScience Review Copy Only 8 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3879 approach. In 2012, there was an outbreak of leishmaniasis in the WIL affecting more than 20 114 people in 7 different villages [17]. This outbreak triggered a broader investigation that was 115 conducted between 2012-2015 in order to understand the causal processes related to the local 116 epidemiological context, to propose measures to prevent and control the disease among the 117 Wajãpi. The investigation unfolded in a multi-institutional project with the partnership of 118 institutions related to health services, such as: Distrito Sanitário Especial Indígena (DSEI) 119 Amapá e Norte do Pará, Secretaria Municipal de Saúde de Pedra Branca do Amapari, 120 Coordenadoria de Vigilância em Saúde do Amapá, Laboratório Central de Saúde Pública do 121 Amapá, Instituto René Rachou (Fiocruz-MG), Universidade Federal do Amapá, Universidade de 122 São Paulo, and Universidade Federal do Oeste do Pará. Teams with different expertise were 123 formed: entomologists, biologists, veterinarians, laboratory technicians, anthropologists, 124 epidemiologists, nurses, etc. 125 From the beginning, researchers were faced with a complex environmental and 126 intercultural context, in which the simple intensification of standard measures recommended 127 by health services proved to be insufficient or even antagonistic in relation to the health 128 principles and concepts of the indigenous group. Difficult access to villages made it difficult to 129 map and record possible transmission sites. The long incubation period of the ACL, the 130 complex mobility profile through their territory of the Wajãpi and the limitations of the health 131 services, i.e. lack of trained personnel, lack of proper funding and infrastructure, made the 132 search for transmission foci, according to the surveillance standards recommended by the 133 Ministry of Health – based on the search for individual risk factors, an unpromising task. 134
The need for a broader and more sensitive assessment from the ecological, cultural 135 and ethnic point of view of this epidemiological context unfolded in a review not only of the 136 objectives and methods of providing services in indigenous health and of epidemiological 137 research and conduct, but also of an epistemological reconstruction of the process of 138 Auto-generated PDF by ReView GigaByte Indigenous1submitted.docxMainDocument GigaScience Review Copy Only 9 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3879 understanding causality in health-disease and its inseparable relationship with social and 139 ecological processes, their different scales and dimensions of perception. Therefore, data on 140 ACL vectors’ occurrence was paramount. 141 A total of 3,218 specimens were identified to either genus or species-level. The most 142 abundant genera were Trichophoromyia (20%), Nyssomyia (13%) and Psathyromyia (11%). And 143 the most abundant species were T. brachipyga (14%), followed by Pa. dreisbachi (9%) and 144 Nyssomyia pajoti (6%). 145
146 Methods 147 Specimens were georeferenced with the aid of a Garmin® 62sGPS. 148
149 Study area 150 Suruwaha Indigenous Land (SIL) 151 The municipality of Tapauá is located on the banks of the Purus River and has a 152 population of 16,876 inhabitants and a total area of 84,946 km2 [11]. The main economic 153 activity is agriculture (cassava, jute and beans) and extractivism (nuts, rubber, wood, copaiba 154 oil and andiroba), livestock has become the main product in the last 10 years. 155 The Middle Purus region is located in the southern region of the Amazon rainforest 156 and includes several conservation units, in addition to various indigenous lands, several of 157 which are already officially recognized by the federal government while others are currently in 158 the process of formal legal demarcation. 159 According to the SIASI (Sistema de Informação da Atenção à Saúde Indígena), operated 160 by the Secretaria Especial de Saúde Indígena (SESAI), the indigenous population of the Middle 161 Purus is estimated at around 8,117 inhabitants, divided into 13 ethnic groups and distributed 162 Auto-generated PDF by ReView GigaByte Indigenous1submitted.docxMainDocument GigaScience Review Copy Only 10 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3879 in 24 demarcated indigenous lands and another 6 non-demarcated (unidentified and/or 163 delimited), the total territorial extension of the demarcated indigenous areas corresponds to 164 189,870.964 ha. 165 The Suruwaha Indigenous Land (SIL) is located in the municipality of Tapauá. The SIL 166 area comprises a total of 239,070 hectares and is located between the Riozinho River and the 167 Coxodoá stream, both tributaries of the Cuniuá River, which in turn is a tributary of the Tapauá 168 River that flows into the Purus River [18]. The SIL is surrounded to the west by the Deni 169 Indigenous Land and to the east by the Hi-Merimã Indigenous Land, of isolated indigenous 170 peoples. The population consists of 171 people who were living in isolation and were 171 contacted in the 1980s by missionaries [14]. The productive activities of the Suruwaha include 172 agriculture, hunting, fishing, gathering and tool making [19]. Hunting is the most prestigious 173 activity, and a good hunter not only kills many animals but must also have killed many tapirs, 174 the most coveted game because of its size that can feed many people [19]. 175
176 Wajãpi Indigenous Land (WIL) 177 The Wajãpi Indigenous Land (WIL) extends between the basins of the Jari (to the west), 178 Amapari (to the east) and Oiapoque (to the north) rivers. Official recognition by the Brazilian 179 government occurred in 1996, with a territorial extension of 6,070 km2. The area is of dense 180 tropical forest and in rugged relief, integrating the Tumucumaque Mountains complex. 181 Currently, the Wajãpi number about 1,221 people, distributed in more than 80 villages [15]. 182
The Wajãpi organize themselves into autonomous local groups, called "iwanã-ko", 183 which are represented by a local group that has its origin in a specific region, where there are 184 several villages. But not all the people of an “iwanã-ko” live in the same region, because when 185 marriages between people from different groups take place, one of the spouses starts living in 186 the other's region [20], which may represent only a temporary physical settlement. The 187 different groups occupy three spatial categories: the places of concentration – rural villages / 188 Auto-generated PDF by ReView GigaByte Indigenous1submitted.docxMainDocument GigaScience Review Copy Only 11 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3879 dwellings; intermittent dispersal/settlements (mainly during the dry season – hunting, fishing 189 and gathering camps) and "koo kwerã" sites which are wildlife reserves and are left 190 undisturbed for wild animals to use and therefore, be hunted. This combination of social, 191 political and ecological factors that determine the movements of concentration and dispersion 192 of the Wajãpi in its territory seems to accompany the patterns of disease distribution in the 193 TIW, so that the tendency to concentrate families close to the Perimetral Norte highway, 194 which reaches TIW, seems to be related to the increased incidence of infectious diseases 195 [16,21]. 196
197 Sand fly collection and processing 198
Sand flies were collected with unbaited CDC-like light traps operated between 5:00 pm 199 and 6:00 am. The traps were placed in areas used by the indigenous people, such as swiddens, 200 forest areas, hunting grounds, access trails and homes. 201
The insects were stored in microtubes containing 70% alcohol and sorted from the 202 other insects collected either in the field or under a dissecting microscope in the laboratory. 203 The insects were clarified and mounted on a slide to identify the species, using the 204 identification key of Galati (2003) [2]. A subsample of the insects will be deposited in the 205 Coleção de Flebotomíneos of the Instituto René Rachou/FIOCRUZ-Minas (COLFLEB/FIOCRUZ). 206 The collection licenses and permits for our studies were as follows: in the SIL, SISBIO 207 collecting license, issue by the Sistema de Autorização e Informação em Biodiversidade 208 (IBAMA) (39337-1) and FUNAI (08620.040969/2013-51); and in the WIL, SISBIO collecting 209 license (37935-4), FUNAI (08620.030843/2014-59), Ethics Committee approval (CONEP - CAAE: 210 20188213.9.0000.5091), and IPHAN access to associated traditional knowledge for scientific 211 research purposes (01450.008806/2014-14). 212

The dataset is in Darwin Core format 41 terms are available for the Suruwaha 216 dataset and 39 for the Wajãpí dataset. All mandatory fields are present and have gone through 217 screening in the FIOCRUZ IPT, metadata fields are also available on the online pages. 218
219 RE-USE POTENTIAL 220 The data are of importance because they describe the distribution of sand flies collected 221 at different sites in two indigenous lands located in the Brazilian Amazon. The data can be used 222 by different sectors of academia, government, civil society, NGOs. However, the data can be of 223 particular importance to balance scientific knowledge and indigenous knowledge so that health 224 surveillance activities are improved and adapted to different eco-social contexts with the 225 participation of indigenous people, who better know their territories. 226 These data can be used to address challenges in leishmaniases control and to a better 227 understanding of the epidemiology of this disease. Since control measures in Brazil are based 228 on disease surveillance and monitoring in territorial units, which include biological and 229 environmental characteristics, our dataset can contribute to a broader knowledge. Our data 230 provide occurrence records from previously unknown which would not normally be surveyed by 231 the public health system ACL control programmes from the Brazilian government. These data 232 can be used for modelling of both vector and disease distribution in space and time as well as 233 provide clues on priority areas for ACL surveillance and control in these areas. 234 Auto-generated PDF by ReView GigaByte Indigenous1submitted.docxMainDocument GigaScience Review Copy Only 13 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3879 Our data are an expert-validated and list of sand fly species in which names are up to 235 date and can be a valuable source of high-quality data on sand flies from remote areas in the 236 Brazilian Amazon. 237
