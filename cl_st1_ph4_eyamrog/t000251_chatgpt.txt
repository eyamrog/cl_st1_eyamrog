However, these practices raise concerns about the necessary type and volume of data, as well as ethical, legal, and technical challenges that surround data collection, access, sharing, and utilization.
Apple and Google have recently unveiled a collaborative effort to develop a tool for tracking COVID-19 infections, with the primary goal of ensuring seamless interoperability between iOS and Android operating systems. Users are given the option to voluntarily participate, although there is no mention of a mechanism for withdrawing consent once given. The tool, as outlined in published specifications, shares similarities with existing contact tracing solutions, drawing inspiration from initiatives already in place in Singapore and ongoing proposals in Europe like DP-3T (Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing), PEPP-PT (Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing) project, and the MIT Safe Paths Platform. These endeavors are all geared towards enhancing privacy protection measures.
These mobile system solutions, broadly categorized as contact tracing systems, operate by exchanging anonymous identifiers through Bluetooth technology over short distances. Depending on the specific solution, users may need to install an application provided by national health authorities, or the technology might be integrated directly into operating systems. When a user tests positive for COVID-19, they update their status in the application, which then notifies the relevant health authorities. Close contacts from the past 14 days are also alerted. Given that these technologies are still in the development phase and evolving, differences in implementation could have significant implications over time. For instance, the centralized approach of PEPP-PT contrasts with the decentralized strategy of DP-3T.
The ongoing situation regarding the Coronavirus epidemic suggests that, as society transitions into the subsequent phases of coexisting with the virus, the utilization of personal data, applications, and devices will be crucial. These tools will not only be essential for tracking contacts but also for verifying adherence to isolation or quarantine protocols. Additionally, they may be utilized for probabilistic contagion assessment and regulating permissions for individuals to venture into public spaces, among various other functions.
It is crucial to acknowledge that data collection via applications and smartphones necessitates access to these technologies, with users being proficient in their usage. Consequently, the data gathered will reflect specific demographic groups. Therefore, implemented strategies should address health disparities and account for variations in how interventions affect various population segments.
In addition to location tracking, encouraging users to self-report symptoms, and automatically sending alerts about possible contact with infected individuals, personal data, such as patient health information, is being utilized in various other capacities. In the UK, for instance, government agencies have collaborated with technology firms to establish a COVID-19 repository that houses patient data. These companies were contracted by the National Health Service (NHS) to aid in the development of predictive models leveraging artificial intelligence and patient data. The rationale behind this initiative was the necessity for real-time information on the strain placed on healthcare services, including data on hospitalizations, availability of intensive care beds, as well as equipment and supply requirements.
The NHS has stated that the data within this repository is confidential, anonymized, and housed in a government database. It will continue to be under the NHS's control and subject to stringent restrictions outlined in data protection legislation. Despite these assurances, the initiative has sparked public mistrust concerning the ethical, privacy, and data protection implications surrounding the private information of these citizens.
Questions and challenges have been raised concerning the public's trust in institutions, both governmental and private, tasked with handling personal data. This skepticism and inquiry do not seek to hinder the utilization of data in pandemic response efforts but underscore the necessity of implementing safeguards to maintain a harmonious equilibrium between individual and collective interests. Additionally, there is a pressing need to enhance societal trust in the entities responsible for processing data for public health objectives.
In Brazil, the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), approved and sanctioned in 2018, is set to come into force in August 2020, although this timeline may be subject to change pending bills currently being deliberated in the Brazilian congress that aim to postpone implementation until 2021. The LGPD signifies a significant advancement in the oversight of personal data, as it encompasses all activities related to the processing of personal data, encompassing digital media, whether conducted by individuals or public and private entities. The primary objective of this legislation is to safeguard the fundamental rights of freedom and privacy.
Informed self-determination is a crucial consideration when it comes to the utilization of personal data, alongside ensuring transparency, security, and minimizing data usage. However, exceptions exist in emergency situations and matters of public interest, such as during a public health crisis, where personal data may be used without explicit consent, provided that appropriate safeguards are in place, the data is used for specific purposes, and the entities processing the data adhere to the regulations outlined in the Brazilian General Data Protection Law and the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union. The LGPD includes provisions that facilitate the use of personal data in policymaking and systems aimed at addressing challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be implemented once the law is enforced.
Anonymization, involving the application of technical measures to eliminate any direct or indirect link between data and an individual, and pseudo-anonymization, which typically involves the substitution of identifiers with unique key codes, are data protection strategies mandated by law. In most cases, anonymized data is not classified as personal data, whereas pseudo-anonymized data retains its personal data status due to the risk of reidentification through a key code, necessitating stringent security measures. Given the potential for reidentification of anonymized data, a combination of methods is essential to safeguard individual privacy, especially in the context of integrated databases.
Compliance with general data protection laws necessitates the utilization of technology, infrastructure, and specialized personnel to ensure the lawful, fair, and responsible processing of personal data. Additionally, accountability must be upheld through the oversight of data processing activities by designated authorities with the power to impose sanctions in cases of non-compliance. In certain nations, collaborations between government entities, universities, and research institutes have led to the establishment of data centers. These centers are tasked with processing and granting access to anonymized data in a secure and regulated manner, thereby facilitating investigative research in the public interest.
Anonymized or aggregated data, as per data protection laws, are not classified as personal data as they safeguard the identification of individuals. Nevertheless, even in the absence of direct references to specific persons, groups may face harm from the amalgamation of data concerning location, ethnicity, health status, and socioeconomic factors. This underscores the need for ethical evaluation concerning the potential advantages derived from such data.
Linnet Taylor has highlighted the absence of safeguards against irresponsible technologies, noting that data protection laws primarily concentrate on safeguarding personal data without extending to the freedoms and political rights of collective entities. She advocates for the inclusion of civil society groups in technology governance processes, emphasizing the necessity for technology firms to operate transparently and be accountable to society to establish their credibility as agents acting on behalf of the government and populace. Particularly in the context of the pandemic, where certain companies have collaborated with governments and are now involved in overseeing citizens' data, Taylor stresses the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability in these partnerships.
In light of the fact that data can be utilized and exchanged by various individuals and entities concurrently, the primary concerns that necessitate attention revolve around responsible data governance founded on transparency and citizen empowerment. These measures are crucial for enhancing trust and fostering equitable and harmonious relationships between individuals and organizations.
The legitimacy of collecting, processing, sharing, and utilizing personal data does not stem solely from access to this data, but rather from the trust placed in the entity that possesses it, ensuring transparency and adherence to legal frameworks. In the context of utilizing personal data for addressing challenges like COVID-19 and potential future public health crises, it is imperative that such practices are underpinned by principles of transparency, verification, and accountability. This should commence from the point of data collection, extending through processing procedures, and encompassing the intended utilization of the data, along with specifying the entities involved and the duration for which the data will be retained.
Clear and transparent terms and conditions are imperative in governing the access, sharing, and utilization of data gathered in the context of public health, particularly when involving private entities or public-private collaborations. It is essential to define the mechanisms through which data will be accessed, processed, and employed, as well as to establish protocols for storage, potential reuse, or disposal once primary objectives are met. Safeguards for data protection must be clearly outlined, and accountability measures need to be in place to address instances of misuse or negligence. It is crucial that these inquiries and concerns are explicitly addressed to ensure ethical and responsible data practices.
Another regulatory aspect that warrants consideration is intellectual property rights, as the selection, organization, or availability of data stored within databases is safeguarded by intellectual property rights. Databases that can be amalgamated with data from various sources to support the advancement of new technologies, such as treatment and prevention technologies for COVID-19, will be governed by ownership rights and may involve expenses associated with access.
Collaborations among governments, technology firms, and academic institutions are essential for effectively extracting dependable insights from vast data sets. Agreements governing these partnerships should unambiguously outline the responsibilities of each party and delineate the utilization of anticipated and actual outcomes. It is imperative to establish protocols with clear directives that facilitate the swift and efficient processing of data, particularly in scenarios of shared concern like the ongoing health crisis. This becomes increasingly crucial given the widespread collection and utilization of personal data by corporations on both national and international scales.
Responsible data governance involves detailing data processing and analysis methodologies, as data serves as evidence in decision-making for public policy and scientific endeavors. It is crucial to recognize that any machine learning algorithm reflects the patterns it was designed to capture. Algorithms are significant tools that should not be divorced from causal explanations, as relying solely on automated outcomes poses risks in decision-making. The primary function of the scientific method is to validate and enhance the reliability and utility of findings. Science is fundamentally concerned with challenging assumptions, values, and biases to differentiate between opinions and empirical evidence.
Regulations serve as the primary means to set boundaries on the handling of personal data by both governmental bodies and private enterprises, even during times of health crises, to prevent adverse consequences stemming from temporary leniency that could potentially become permanent, as exemplified by the aftermath of the September 11th attacks in the United States in 2001. In response to the events, public surveillance measures were implemented utilizing both established and emerging technologies, rationalized by the need to monitor individuals deemed suspicious and to prevent future terrorist threats, leading to legal modifications driven by societal fear.
The implementation of fair, accountable, and sustainable data governance frameworks, aimed at upholding ethical and regulatory standards, plays a crucial role in enhancing the trust of individuals and communities in the utilization of personal data to address genuine public concerns. Concerns regarding privacy rights, personal data protection, and group rights should not hinder the utilization of personal data, particularly in the context of a pandemic response. The current public health crisis triggered by SARS-COV-2 underscores the urgent requirement for innovative approaches to personal data management that involve civil society, with the aim of fostering equitable advantages for the broader society.
