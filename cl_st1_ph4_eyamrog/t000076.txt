ABSTRACT 
Objective: Three pelvic osteotomies (Salter, Dega, Pemberton) are widely used in walking 
patients under 7 years old for DDH treatment. We’ve proposed a modified Salter Pelvic 
Osteotomy (SPO), which has the advantages of the abovementioned osteotomies. 
Methods: Short- and mid-term results were assessed in 19 patients after modified SPO 
application. Patients were examined before and after the surgery, at 6 months 
postoperatively and at follow-up. Results: Acetabular Index (AI) before the surgery was 39.5 
± 7 °, after the surgery - 24.4 ± 5.5 °, at 6 months - 20.4 ± 5 ° (9-28), at follow-up - 14.5 ± 4 
°; AI correction - 14.9 ± 5.5 °. Lateral Centre-Edge Angle at follow-up - 22.7 ± 4.7 °. Clinical 
results at follow-up were I / II McKay grade in 18 patients (94.7%); radiological results were  
I / II Severin class in 18 patients (94.7%). Conclusion: Modified SPO allows to improve the 
FH coverage in any direction; results after modified SPO are excellent and good in the vast 
majority of patients.

Introduction: 
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) is one of the most common pathologies of 
the hip joint in children 1. The age of DDH detection is critical - non-surgical treatment is 
effective only in case of early diagnosis (in non-walking patients) 2. In case of DDH late 
detection (in walking patients) or after the failure of non-surgical treatment (in case of 
residual acetabular dysplasia or femoral head redislocation), surgical treatment is indicated 
3. There are different types of surgeries for DDH management, but the best results were 
observed after pelvic osteotomies application 4.  
Three different pelvic osteotomies (Salter, Dega, Pemberton) are commonly used in 
patients with DDH younger than 7 years old 5. Each of these osteotomies has certain 
advantages and disadvantages. Thus, Salter osteotomy is easier to perform, but it is 
possible to improve only the anterolateral femoral head (FH) coverage and provides lower 
acetabular deformity correction degree compared to Pemberton and Dega osteotomies 6, 7. 
Using Dega osteotomy it is possible to improve the FH coverage in all directions and to 
achieve a higher correction degree but is technically demanding in patients under 4 years 
(due to the smaller iliac bone thickness) 7. Pemberton pelvic osteotomy also allows to 
achieve higher correction degree, but using it it is possible to improve only the anterolateral 
FH coverage; another disadvantage after this surgery is a possible triradiate cartilage injury 
6, 8, 9
. 
Today it is well-known that DHH presents itself not purely as an anterolateral 
acetabular deficiency; three types of acetabular deformities were found 10. Thus, there is a 
need for a pelvic osteotomy that would be able to improve FH coverage in all directions. 
Other prerequisites for pelvic osteotomy are: to ensure a sufficient level of acetabular 
deformity correction; to be easy to perform regardless of the patient's age; have no risk of 
triradiate cartilage injury. In our hospital, we use a modified Salter Pelvic Osteotomy (SPO) 
that meets the abovementioned requirements. 
The purposes of this article were:  
1) to describe our modification of SPO 
2) to show short and middle-term results after this technique 
Methods: 
Institutional ethics board committee approval (protocol №4 dated 10.12.2021) was 
obtained for publishing the results of this investigation. 
In our institution modified SPO is used from 2015. It is applied in patients older than 2 
years old with acetabular dysplasia (acetabular index(AI) values ≥ 30°); the upper age limit 
for this technique was 6 years old.  
The differences of our SPO modification from the classically described one 11 are the 
following: 1) a curved line of the osteotomy going horizontally up to the terminal line, then it 
turns downwards (towards the top of the greater sciatic notch) – Figure 1, A/D; 2) more 
proximal start point of the osteotomy line – Figure 1, B/E; 3) chisel’s blade outer side is

turned at 45 ° upward laterally (according to the principle of Dega pelvic osteotomy) – 
Figure 1, C/F. The abovementioned features of our modification are shown in Figure 1.  
This modified SPO allows to improve the FH coverage in all directions (due to the 
curved osteotomy line - see Figure 2) and achieve a higher degree of AI correction (due to 
the turned chisel blade position and, consequently, larger bony contact between iliac bone 
fragments during acetabular deformity correction). At the same time, our modification is 
technically easy to perform regardless of the patient's age (since it’s itself a complete iliac 
bone osteotomy and doesn’t depend on iliac bone thickness); also, the risk of triradiate 
cartilage injury is absent (the osteotomy line is far from it). An example of a modified SPO 
application is shown in Figure 3. 
To evaluate the results after modified SPO, we’ve selected 19 patients who 
underwent this surgery for the period 2015-2020.  
Among these patients 18 were girls (94.7%) and 1 was a boy (5.3%); the left hip joint 
was affected in 12 cases (63.2%), the right - in 7 cases (36.8%); the mean patient’s age 
was 3.6 ± 1.5 years (2-6); the mean follow-up period was 2.7 ± 1.6 years (1-5).  
During the pelvic osteotomy, we’ve improved the FH coverage in that direction where 
it was a deficiency according to X-rays. The deficit of anterior coverage was estimated 
according to the anterior center-edge angle (CEA) values on the false profile view (in 
comparison with “healthy” hip). The posterior FH coverage deficit was determined by 
comparing the anterior and posterior acetabular walls contours on anterior-posterior X-ray 
(medial position of the posterior wall relative to the anterior was considered as a posterior 
acetabular wall deficit - as an analog to posterior wall sign in adults). In the case of both 
anterior and posterior acetabular deficiency, we've improved the FH coverage in a more 
defective direction. Lateral FH coverage was routinely improved in all patients.  
Additionally to modified SPO in all cases, we’ve performed femoral varus derotational 
osteotomy (FVDO) to decrease femoral anteversion and valgus deformity. Femoral head 
open reduction was added in case of impossible concentric closed reduction of the FH; 
femoral shortening was mandatorily performed in these patients. A combination of FH open 
reduction, pelvic and femoral osteotomies is known as One-Stage Surgery  (OSS) 3. A 
combination of modified SPO and FVDO was performed in 8 patients (42.1%), OSS was 
performed in 11 patients (57.9%).  
Patients were examined clinically and radiologically before, immediately after 
surgery, at 6 months postoperatively, at follow-up. Before the surgery, we had determined 
DDH Tonnis grade and AI values. The day after surgery, we’ve measured AI values and the 
amount of AI correction. At 6 months postoperatively, we’ve measured AI values and 
detected any signs (if present) of the FH avascular necrosis (AVN). At follow-up, we’ve 
determined AI values, Wiberg lateral CEA values; femoral head AVN sequels were 
assessed according to Bucholz and Ogden 12. Long-term radiological results were 
evaluated according to Severin classification 3, long-term clinical results were evaluated 
according to McKay's criteria 13. 
For statistics calculations we’ve used JASP Team (2020). JASP

Results: 
According to DDH Tonnis classification, the II grade was in 6 patients (31.5%), III 
grade - in 1 patient (5.3%), IV grade - in 12 patients (63.2%).  
The AI values before the surgery were 39.5 ± 7 ° (30-53). 
The next day after surgery AI values were 24.4 ± 5.5 ° (15-33).  
The amount of AI correction was 14.9 ± 5.5 ° (8-28). 
At 6 months AI values were 20.4 ± 5 ° (9-28). Signs of femoral head AVN were 
present in 8 patients (42.1%).  
At follow-up AI values were 14.5 ± 4 ° (6-23); lateral CEA values were 22.7 ± 4.7 ° 
(15-29). Femoral head AVN sequels type I according to Bucholz and Ogden were present in 
5 patients (26.3%), type II in 0 patients, type III in 1 patient (5.3%), type IV in 2 patients 
(10.5%). Clinical results according to McKay's criteria were the following: grade I in 12 
patients (63.2%), grade II in 6 patients (31.5%), grade III in 1 patient (5.3%), grade IV in 0 
patients (0%). Radiological results according to Severin criteria were the following: class I in 
14 patients (73.7%), class II in 4 patients (21%), class III in 1 patient (5.3%), class IV-VI in 0 
patients. 
Patients’ preoperative characteristics, postoperative clinical and radiological results 
are presented in Table 1. 
The long-term result after the modified SPO application is presented in Figure 4. 
Comparison of results after our SPO modification with other authors’ results after 
standard SPO (or their modifications) is presented in Table 2.  
Discussion: 
Non-surgical management of DDH is effective in case of early diagnosis 2, but in 
neglected cases or after non-surgical treatment failure, surgery is mandatory 3. Pelvic 
osteotomies are proved to be the most effective surgical option for DDH treatment 4. Each 
pelvic osteotomy that is used for DDH treatment in patients younger than 7 years has its 
strong sides and drawbacks 5-9. Also, it is known that in DDH there is not only a deficiency 
of anterolateral FH coverage, three types of acetabular deformity were described 10. Thus, 
the ideal pelvic osteotomy should improve FH coverage in all directions and should not have 
known drawbacks. In this paper, we have described our modification of Salter pelvic 
osteotomy, which meets all the above requirements. Also, the short-term and mid-term 
results after the modified SPO application were described. 
Our modification of SPO differs from the classically described one in that it has a 
curved line of osteotomy, a more proximal start point of osteotomy and an upward-directed 
lateral edge of the chisel blade. 
Short-term and mid-term clinical and radiological results after modified SPO 
application (follow-up period from 1 to 5 years) were good and excellent in 94.7% of 
patients; there were no unsatisfactory results. Results after our modification are similar to 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3407
other authors’ results after the application of standard SPO or their modifications 1-3, 13-20. 
However, we believe that it is necessary to individually assess the direction of femoral head 
deficiency and to consider this during preoperative planning. 
Shortcomings of this work are: short follow-up period, absence of control group, 
patients’ age is limited to 2-6 years old, no results were described after isolated SPO 
modification (each patient in this study had has additional procedures). 
Conclusion:  
Modified Salter Pelvic Osteotomy make it possible to improve femoral head coverage 
in any direction in walking patients with DDH under 7 years old; it is technically easy to 
perform modified SPO independently on the patient’s age; this technique provides good 
Acetabular Index correction; results after modified SPO are excellent and good in the vast 
majority of patients.

Legends to figures:  
Figure 1. The differences of our SPO modification from the classically described one. 
In the upper raw (A-C) our modification is shown, in the lower raw (D-F) the classically 
described SPO is shown.  
Figure 2. FH coverage improvement in anterior (A), posterior (B) and lateral (C) 
directions during modified SPO according to applied forces (white arrows). 
Figure 3.  An example of modified SPO application in 3 years old female patient. A – 
before the surgery, B – after Single Stage Surgery. White arrow points to the upper iliac 
fragment’s sharp angle which is due to curved osteotomy (this is a radiological feature of 
our modification that is absent in classically described SPO). 
Figure 4. X-rays of 3 years old female patient. A – before the surgery, B – after the 
Single Stage Surgery (white arrow points to the upper iliac fragment’s sharp angle), C – 4 
years postoperatively.
