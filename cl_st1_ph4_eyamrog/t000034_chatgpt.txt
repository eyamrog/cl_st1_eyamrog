The Gini coefficient, also known as the Gini index or Gini ratio, is a parameter commonly utilized in economics to assess income distribution within a country or globally, although its applicability extends to various types of distributions. This study introduces a novel approach to utilizing the Gini coefficient in analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a psychophysiological indicator of mental stress.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of the Gini coefficient as a psychophysiological marker for measuring mental stress.
Methods: Thirteen healthy individuals, with an average age of 19 ± 1.5 years, participated in the study. Heart rate monitoring was conducted continuously for a duration of 5 minutes both at rest and during a mental stress task. Various linear and nonlinear methods were employed to analyze heart rate variability (HRV). Additionally, two novel indicators, Sequential and Non-Sequential Gini, were introduced and computed to quantify the differences in HRV between the two states being compared.
Results: A significant decrease in traditional indicators of HRV was observed when comparing rest and mental stress conditions (p<0.05). Additionally, there was a notable increase in heart rate (p=0.004), Sequential Gini (p=0.004), and Non-Sequential Gini (p=0.04) under the mental stress condition.
Conclusions: The findings indicate that the temporary inequality of RR intervals, as analyzed through the Gini coefficient, may serve as a suitable indicator of sympathetic activity during mental stress. This metric shows promise in assessing the implications of psychosomatic conditions and anxiety disorders.
Stress in young individuals significantly influences both physical and psychological functions by impacting various physiological processes within the human body. Psychological stress initiates with an emotional reaction, the intensity of which is interconnected with diverse psychosocial factors that render individuals vulnerable. This emotional response triggers what is commonly referred to as the "stress response" [1].
Acute psychological stress triggers a neural response involving the release of hormonal and humoral factors activated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the hypothalamus. This stress response is linked to developmental and psychopathological disorders [2] and serves as a risk factor for numerous chronic non-communicable diseases [3]. The adaptive functions of stress responses have evolved over time, leading to both detrimental and beneficial outcomes. Consequently, interventions targeting stress are crucial for comprehending how individuals without underlying health issues react to stressful stimuli [4, 5].
Various methods are utilized in medical literature to assess acute mental stress, including circadian rhythm dysregulations, the Stroop test, and arithmetic tests. Previous studies have demonstrated a physiological connection between stress and the physical and cognitive performance of young individuals. Maladaptive responses to acute stress have been associated with physiological changes, such as endocrine, autonomous, and neural responses. These changes include cortisol release under induced psychological stressors, alterations in brain activity, and adaptive modifications in heart rate.
Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to the variation in time intervals among consecutive heartbeats. Various terms have been employed in the literature, such as cycle length variability, heart period variability, and R-R variability. Nevertheless, HRV is the term that has gained the most widespread acceptance. The autonomic regulation of heartbeats is commonly utilized to evaluate the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, with methods including time and frequency domain HRV analysis for both short and long-term recordings. The analysis of signal fluctuations scales with the number of samples of that signal, making it applicable to HRV analysis for RR interval time series. This approach has found applications in diverse research fields, including psychophysiological studies focusing on the autonomic modulation of heart function.
Acute stress models have yielded significant findings in HRV analysis across various populations where they have been employed. Research on young adults indicates a correlation between stress and a reduction in the irregularity of intervals, as well as a decrease in entropy and multiscale entropy [10]. Stress states have also been linked to alterations in HRV, such as heightened sympathetic activity and diminished parasympathetic function [8].
In their spectral analysis of HRV, the authors have identified a notable inequality in the distribution of slow heart rate fluctuations under mental stress, demonstrating a higher sensitivity compared to the conventional spectral density methods commonly employed in HRV analysis [18]. While the Gini coefficient is typically utilized in economics to gauge income inequality within a country, its versatility allows for application in various distribution assessments. Recent exploration has extended the use of the Gini coefficient to biological phenomena, encompassing analyses of EEG traces [19], functional magnetic resonance imaging [20], gene expression [21], and the evaluation of inequality in power spectral density of RR intervals [18]. Notably, the application of the Gini coefficient to assess the inequality in the time domain distribution of RR intervals remains unexplored in previous research.
The hypothesis posited that the temporal inequality of RR intervals may be more closely linked to autonomic changes in heart rate variability (HRV) during stress compared to traditional HRV indexes. This potential association could offer significant value in gauging the adaptive and maladaptive responses of autonomic cardiac modulation to stressful stimuli, serving as a reliable indicator of autonomic alterations amidst mental stress. Consequently, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of the Gini coefficient as a psychophysiological marker of mental stress.
A non-observational crossover study was conducted with thirteen healthy individuals, comprising 6 males and 7 females, with an average age of 19 years (±1.5) and a BMI of 22.3 kg/m2 (±1.3). These participants were non-smokers and had no prior history of heart disease, systemic hypertension, or any other conditions that could potentially impact heart rate variability (HRV) changes. Additionally, they were not taking any medications and were instructed to be satiated, refraining from consuming caffeine, drugs, or alcohol for at least 12 hours prior to the experiment.
This study received approval from the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Santiago de Cuba under protocol number 22/2017. All procedures conducted in this research adhere to the guidelines outlined in the 1975 Helsinki Declaration, which was revised in 2013. Prior to their participation, informed consent was obtained from all individuals involved in the study.
Upon providing informed consent, participants were scheduled for specific measurement sessions at designated days and times. These sessions took place between 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. in a dimly lit room with controlled environmental factors such as noise levels and humidity, maintaining a temperature range of 24 to 27 degrees Celsius. To ensure minimal interference, there were no interactions or distractions permitted among the volunteers. Prior to the measurements, participants were given a 15-minute rest period to acclimate to the local conditions, with no circulation of individuals within the designated environment. Additionally, participants were required to disclose any substance ingestion or physical activities undertaken before the recording sessions, ensuring they were adequately satiated (having consumed breakfast approximately an hour prior) and had not consumed any caffeinated products.
The PowerLab Acquisition System 8® (ADInstruments) was utilized for the collection of electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings, with a sampling rate set at 1000 Hz for data acquisition. ECG measurements were conducted using a standard Lead II configuration. Following the cleansing of the skin with an alcohol wipe, ECG electrodes (Ag/AgCl) were affixed to the participant's right midclavicle and the lowest left rib (with the left wrist serving as the ground), allowing subjects to relax for a 10-minute period to acclimate to the local conditions. Recordings were taken at rest and during spontaneous breathing for 5 minutes while seated; subsequently, subjects engaged in an arithmetic calculation test for an additional 5 minutes. An algorithm [22] was employed to identify the QRS-complexes within the ECG signal, enabling the determination of RR-intervals. The Heart rate variability analysis software (HRVAS) by John T. Ramshur, Copyright© 2015 [23], was utilized for the initial processing of the RR interval series. Ectopic intervals were detected using a standard deviation (SD) filter set at SD=3 and a percentage filter at 20% from the preceding interval [24]. Ectopic intervals were replaced using cubic spline interpolation through the application of Cubic Spline Replacement [23]. Traditional time domain indexes of Heart Rate Variability were computed in accordance with HRV recommendations [14]. Additionally, an ECG-derived Respiration Rate (EDR) was calculated from raw ECG data throughout the procedure using the built-in algorithm of Kubios HRV Premium® 3.0.2 software, which analyzed variations in the amplitude of the R-peak induced by chest movements during each respiratory cycle.
The standard arithmetic calculation test, as outlined in previous studies [25, 26, 27], was conducted to elicit cardiovascular reactivity through the induction of mental stress, as supported by existing literature [9, 10, 28, 29, 30]. Participants were tasked with subtracting 17 from 1000, with an emphasis on accuracy. Each subtraction attempt was limited to 5 seconds, signaled by an auditory cue. Following their response, participants received immediate verbal feedback ("right" or "wrong") before proceeding to the next calculation, even in the case of an incorrect answer. Throughout the task, participants maintained silence between verbalizing their responses.
The Gini coefficient serves as a metric to gauge the unequal distribution of incomes among various social groups. A coefficient of zero signifies that all subgroups possess identical income per capita, indicating a lack of income disparity; conversely, a significantly high coefficient would indicate a scenario where all incomes are concentrated within a single subgroup while the remaining groups have no income. As the total population size nears infinity, with all incomes consolidated in a single individual, the Gini coefficient tends towards 1.
The absolute delta histogram of pairs of adjacent normal R-R intervals |NN-(NN+1)| was utilized, measured on a discrete scale with bins of 1/128 s (7.8125). Additionally, a non-sequential Gini Histogram of normal R-R intervals (NN) was employed, also measured on a discrete scale with bins of 1/128 s (7.8125).
The sequential and non-sequential histograms can be created by utilizing bins with a length of 7.8125 milliseconds. If n represents the number of classes, let A denote a sequence a1, a2,…,an where ai signifies the number of elements within the i-th class, and let B be a sequence b1, b2,…,bn where bi represents the mean of the limits of the i-th class. Consequently, A can be understood as a sequence depicting the population sizes of various subgroups, while B signifies the income per capita within these distinct subgroups.
The Brown Formula, utilized for approximating the Gini coefficient, is articulated as: 𝑖∋ ∑(𝑝𝑖−𝑞𝑖) ∑𝑝𝑖, where 𝑝𝑖= 𝑎1+𝑎2+⋯+𝑎𝑖 𝑎1+𝑎2+⋯+𝑎𝑛 and 𝑞𝑖= 𝑏1𝑎1+𝑏2𝑎2+⋯+𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑖 𝑏1𝑎1+𝑏2𝑎2+⋯+𝑏𝑛𝑎𝑛, with i ranging from 1 to n-1. Here, 𝑝𝑖 represents the cumulative proportion of the population variable, while 𝑞𝑖 signifies the cumulative proportion of the variable. In the context of Non-Sequential Gini, 𝑝𝑖 denotes the cumulative proportion of the NN intervals within distinct bins of the RR Histogram, whereas 𝑞𝑖 reflects the cumulative proportion of values within the various bins of the RR Histogram. Conversely, in Sequential Gini, 𝑝𝑖 represents the cumulative proportion of the absolute delta NN intervals within different bins of the absolute delta RR Histogram, and 𝑞𝑖 indicates the cumulative proportion of values within the diverse bins of the absolute delta RR Histogram.
The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for related samples was utilized with a significance level set at p<0.05. Data were presented as Mean, Standard Deviation (SD), and Coefficient of Variation (CV %). Statistical significance was attributed to p values < 0.05. Effect size was determined using Cohen's d, where values of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.9 were classified as small, medium, and large effects respectively. Pearson Correlation was employed for normally distributed data, while Spearman’s correlation was used for data that did not adhere to normal distribution. The normality of the data was assessed through the Shapiro-Wilk test. The distributions of bins scaling histograms were illustrated. All statistical and mathematical computations, as well as signal processing, were conducted using Matlab 2012b and SPSS 22 statistical software.
In Table 1, it is evident that mental stress induced alterations in heart rate and RR intervals. The conventional HRV indices affected by cardiovascular hyperactivity were found to be pNN50, RMSSD, and SD1. Additionally, mental stress led to a notable increase in Sequential Gini and Non-Sequential Gini. Sequential Gini exhibited the least inter-individual variation in both resting and stressful conditions.
Figure 1 displays the Lorenz curves illustrating the temporal distribution inequality of the Gini indexes during periods of rest and mental stress in a randomly selected subject. The Lorenz coefficient is derived from the area between the colored zone and the diagonal line, with the highest values observed during mental stress for both the Sequential Gini and Non-Sequential Gini indexes.
Table 2 presents the Pearson’s correlations between Gini temporal HRV indexes and traditional HRV indexes. The analysis indicates a lack of correlation between Non-Sequential Gini and the other indexes across all conditions. However, during rest, Sequential Gini exhibited a significant negative correlation with respiratory rate, suggesting that lower Sequential Gini values correspond to higher respiratory rates. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between Sequential Gini and pNN50. Furthermore, Sequential Gini during mental stress displayed correlations with TINN, while in the overall sample, it correlated with SDNN, HRVTi, TINN, and SD2.
Table 3 presents the evaluation parameters of the discriminatory capacity of both traditional and Gini temporal HRV indexes in relation to stress status, as provided by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The Sequential Gini index demonstrates a limited discriminatory capacity in relation to stress, suggesting that its peak values are linked to periods of rest. Conversely, the Non-Sequential Gini index exhibits a strong discriminatory capacity in relation to stress, indicating its potential as an indicator of mental stress when a specific cut-off point is considered for evaluation.
In Figure 2, the class intervals (bins) of Gini temporal HRV indexes in both psychophysiological states are depicted to assess the unequal distribution of elements. It is evident that during periods of stress, both Gini temporal HRV indexes exhibit higher concentration, whereas during rest, they demonstrate greater dispersion. Upon analyzing each index individually, it is observed that Sequential Gini increases with larger bin sizes, whereas Non-Sequential Gini remains stable regardless of bin sizes.
The current study investigated the efficacy of a novel temporal indicator of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) utilizing the Gini index, a metric not previously documented, and its potential as a fresh psychophysiological marker for mental stress. This approach enabled the quantification of temporal disparities between consecutive normal R-R intervals and the identification of variations between baseline and stress-induced mental states triggered by an arithmetic calculation task.
The response of the cardiovascular system to acute stress involves the activation of the autonomic nervous system, which aims to match energy supply with increased metabolic demands, resulting in changes such as elevated blood pressure, heart rate, and vascular peripheral resistance. This response plays a crucial role in elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying various cardiovascular conditions. Extensive research has been conducted on the impact of stress on heart rate variability (HRV), revealing alterations in traditional parameters like increased heart rate, SD2/SD1 ratio, short-term fluctuations α, low frequencies, multiscale entropy, and the sympathetic index. Conversely, there is a significant decrease in parameters such as the RR interval, SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, sample entropy, and the parasympathetic index. These fluctuations reflect the adjustments made by the parasympathetic branch to adapt to changing organismic demands in response to different life situations, as well as signals from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis triggering acute catecholamine and subsequent cortisol release. These adjustments elucidate the concurrent increase in variables like blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral vascular resistance.
In recent years, there has been a proliferation of indicators designed to measure Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in both the time and frequency domains, a trend that has gained momentum since the turn of the century [16]. Sassi et al. [15] conducted a comprehensive analysis of these novel methodologies, emphasizing their role in enhancing the technical comprehension of HRV and their capacity to quantify the intricate regulatory mechanisms of heart rate that conventional approaches fail to capture. However, the Gini index, a statistical metric, has only been explored in a prior investigation concerning its utility in assessing HRV under conditions of acute stress induced by a mental stimulus [18].
In the current study, a notable increase in the inequality of heartbeat variations (Sequential Gini) during mental stress was observed, surpassing the statistical significance of other traditional HRV indicators in bivariate analysis. This finding aligns with previous research by Sánchez-Hechavarría et al. [19], which assessed the effectiveness of the Spectral Gini coefficient (SpG) of each traditional HRV indicator in comparing baseline and mental stress. Their study revealed a significant increase in SpG (LF) (p = 0.009) and SpG (LF2) (p = 0.033), outperforming the traditional indicators. However, the significance of the Sequential Gini in our study surpasses that of SpG, indicating more pronounced differences with the proposed index. Additionally, the coefficient of variation of the Sequential Gini suggests greater homogeneity compared to other studied indexes, enhancing the robustness of this outcome. Notably, the Non-Sequential Gini analysis (distribution of beats) yielded statistically significant results surpassing most traditional HRV indexes.
The results obtained demonstrate that the new proposed indicators lead to a higher level of data homogeneity in the examination of HRV across different stimuli. This is evidenced by the increased coefficient of variation, indicating stronger results. Consequently, the enhanced homogeneity enhances the validity and practicality of utilizing this indicator for evaluating mental stress compared to other existing indicators.
The Lorenz curve, in conjunction with the Gini coefficient, serves as a graphical tool to assess the inequality within numerical data distributions and to depict the relative distribution of a variable within a given domain. An ideal data distribution would yield a slope of one and a Gini coefficient of zero, while pronounced data inequality is indicated by higher Gini values approaching one. This study reveals a greater inequality in the Sequential Gini compared to the Non-Sequential Gini, as evidenced by the higher coefficient. Furthermore, it was observed that data distribution exhibited more irregularity during periods of mental stress than during rest. This finding is particularly noteworthy as it introduces a novel application of the Lorenz curve in evaluating inequality in spectral values of HRV, particularly in comparison to mental stress, a unique aspect explored for the first time in this study.
The examination of HRV has revealed it to be a cost-effective, non-invasive, and painless measurement, rendering it widely accessible to researchers [16]. However, a significant challenge lies in the high correlation among most studied HRV indicators, complicating their interpretation and potentially introducing bias when correlating them with external stimuli, as certain values are heavily influenced by factors like heart rate and respiratory rate [35]. Furthermore, the abundance of indicators and their interrelationships pose another obstacle in the study and practical application of HRV, as in many instances, it is feasible to predict one indicator from another, leading to a lack of valuable information and rendering interpretation challenging.
In this study, a limited correlation was observed between the proposed indicators and the conventional variables, presenting novel insights not previously documented. The Non-Sequential Gini exhibited no correlation with any of the traditional indicators; conversely, the Sequential Gini displayed correlations with certain geometric HRV indicators, suggesting a potential classification of this new indicator as geometric due to its calculability and geometric representation, as well as its utilization of Data binning, a characteristic shared by numerous geometric HRV indicators [36]. The study highlights the advantages of enhanced homogeneity and the ability to visually capture prominent changes induced by mental stress on the heart.
In the analysis of the discriminatory capacity of traditional indexes and the Sequential and Non-Sequential Gini, it was observed that the area under the Sequential Gini curve demonstrated poor discriminatory ability in distinguishing mental stress. Conversely, the Non-Sequential Gini exhibited a strong discriminatory capacity in relation to stress, displaying high sensitivity and specificity values.
The assessment of discriminatory capacity has been a common practice in prior studies on HRV, with established cut-off points for different variables intended to predict cardiovascular function or adaptation to stressors [37; 38]. This study proposes the exploration of a new cut-off point for future research endeavors.
The study revealed that the new indicators exhibit distinct characteristics as the sizes of the bins vary. Specifically, in the Sequential Gini, which signifies the inequality of clustered variations in heartbeats, it was noted that with larger bin sizes, there are fewer class intervals, resulting in fewer groups within the distribution and an increased likelihood of concentration of beat variations within these intervals. These disparities are particularly prominent during induced mental stress, as research indicates a tendency for slow oscillations to concentrate. This underscores the importance of employing a standardized bin size when computing the Sequential Gini. In this investigation, 8-second bins were utilized, a value closely aligned with recommendations for geometric methods. Furthermore, it was observed that the Non-Sequential Gini, which measures the inequality of beat distribution, exhibits consistent performance regardless of bin size, indicating that the limitations associated with the Sequential Gini do not apply to the Non-Sequential Gini. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the mathematical properties of the indicators proposed within the sample under study.
The results of this investigation indicate that the Gini index, both in its Sequential and Non-Sequential categories, demonstrated a stronger association with mental stress in the individuals under study compared to traditional HRV indexes. Temporal inequality, as measured by the Gini index, was notably higher during periods of mental stress, suggesting that the proposed indexes may offer valuable insights in examining cardiovascular autonomic responses to various stimuli. The temporary inequality of RR intervals, as assessed by the Gini coefficient, could serve as a suitable indicator of sympathetic-adrenal activity during mental stress, showing promise in evaluating the impacts of psychosomatic conditions and anxiety disorders.

The study's sample size of 13 may impact the effectiveness of methods used for qualitative sample comparison and the distribution of parameter values within the population. While this sample size meets the minimum recommended size for biomedical experiments [40], the effect size was evaluated in each analysis through the calculation of Cohen's kappa coefficient.
