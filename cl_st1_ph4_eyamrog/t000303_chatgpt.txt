As of March 22, 2020, Paraguay has reported a total of 22 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with two cases currently under investigation to determine their epidemiological links. In response to this situation, the country's authorities have implemented essential sanitary measures aimed at curbing the potential for widespread transmission. Understanding the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the population regarding COVID-19 is crucial for informed decision-making in the management of this public health crisis.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted starting from March 20, 2020, which marked the week following the closure of Paraguay. The survey was administered online utilizing a Google Forms (c) platform, disseminated through "WhatsApp" groups. Eligible participants included Paraguayan citizens aged 18 and above, who were briefed on the study's objectives and intent, and provided their consent to partake in the research by accessing and completing the questionnaire via the provided link.
Results: The survey questionnaire was completed by a total of 3141 participants. The average age of the participants was 29.55 years (SD: 10.7), with 2139 (68.10%) being women and 2073 (66) identifying as Interior. The average COVID-19 knowledge score was 7.45 (SD: 1.51), indicating an overall correct rate of 62% (7.45/12*100) on the knowledge test. A majority of respondents expressed agreement that COVID-19 will eventually be successfully controlled (66.28%), with a significant portion reporting that they had not visited crowded places (88.35%) and had been wearing masks when going out (74.31%) in recent days.
In conclusion, the level of knowledge regarding COVID-19 within the Paraguayan population during the outbreak was deemed acceptable, with predominantly favorable attitudes and mostly adequate practices observed. Nevertheless, there is a pressing need to initiate extensive educational campaigns aimed at enhancing the overall understanding of COVID-19 among the populace in order to effectively curb its transmission.
Since December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases emerged in Wuhan, China, prompting rapid responses from the Chinese government and researchers to contain the outbreak and conduct etiological investigations. By January 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) provisionally labeled this novel virus as the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV). Subsequently, on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. By February 11, 2020, the WHO officially designated the illness caused by 2019-nCoV as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Simultaneously, the coronavirus study group of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy classified 2019-nCoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of February 23, 2020, China had confirmed 77,041 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In the Americas region, a cumulative total of 663 cases of COVID-19 have been documented across 12 countries and four French overseas territories/regions. Furthermore, the United States has confirmed 49 cases of COVID-19 among individuals returning from Wuhan, China, and the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
As of now, a total of 23 fatalities due to COVID-19 have been documented in both the United States of America and Argentina. The single death in Argentina was classified as an imported case, involving a 64-year-old individual residing in Buenos Aires with various underlying health issues and a recent travel history to Europe. In the United States, the 22 reported deaths were distributed across California, Florida, and Washington, with a significant portion of fatalities in Washington State linked to a long-term care facility.
As of March 22, 2020, Paraguay has reported a total of 22 cases, two of which are currently under investigation for their epidemiological links. In response, the country's authorities have implemented essential sanitary measures to mitigate the potential for widespread transmission.
In order to ensure ultimate success, the adherence of individuals to control measures is crucial, a factor significantly influenced by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19, as outlined in KAP theory (9–11). Given these considerations, the present study was designed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of individuals in Paraguay during the COVID-19 outbreak.
A cross-sectional study was conducted starting from March 20, 2020, which was the week following the closure of Paraguay. The survey was administered online using a Google Forms (c) form that was distributed through "WhatsApp" groups.
Paraguayan individuals, aged 18 and above, who received a detailed explanation of the study's objectives and purpose, and who provided their consent to participate, were invited to complete the questionnaire by accessing the provided link.
Participants were required to respond to a binary yes or no query to affirm their voluntary participation. Following the confirmation, participants were directed to fill out the self-administered questionnaire.
The Bao-Liang et al. (12) instrument, translated into Spanish, served as the model for this study. The questionnaire comprised two sections: demography and KAP. Demographic variables encompassed age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, and current place of residence. The questionnaire featured 12 questions: 4 on clinical presentations, 3 on transmission routes, and 5 on prevention and control of COVID-19. Respondents answered these questions as true/false, with an additional "I don't know" option. A correct response earned 1 point, while an incorrect or unknown response received 0 points. The total knowledge score ranged from 0 to 12, with a higher score indicating a better understanding of COVID-19.
Attitudes towards COVID-19 were assessed through two inquiries regarding the final control agreement on COVID-19 and the level of confidence in successfully combating the virus. The assessment of respondents' behaviors encompassed two specific actions: visiting crowded locations and adhering to the practice of wearing a mask when venturing outside in recent days.
A pilot study involving 10 subjects was conducted, resulting in a Cronbach's Alpha coefficient of 0.8 (13).
The research article detailed the frequencies of accurate knowledge responses alongside various attitudes and practices. A comparison of knowledge scores, attitudes, and practices among individuals based on demographic characteristics was conducted using independent samples t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or Chi-square tests as deemed suitable. To identify factors linked with knowledge, a multivariate linear regression analysis was carried out, utilizing all demographic variables as independent variables and the knowledge score as the outcome variable. Likewise, binary logistic regression analysis was employed to pinpoint factors associated with attitudes and practices.
Data analysis was conducted using STATA version 15.0, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05.
A survey questionnaire was completed by 3141 participants, with a mean age of 29.55 years (SD: 10.7). Of the total, 2139 (68.10%) were women, and 2073 (66) identified as Interior. Additional demographic details can be found in Table 1.
The average COVID-19 knowledge score stood at 7.45 (SD: 1.51), indicating a 62% correct rate on the knowledge test. Notably, there were significant variations in knowledge scores observed among different genders, age groups, marital statuses, education levels, and residential locations (P<0.001) as detailed in Table 1.
The results of the multiple linear regression analysis indicated significant associations between several variables and the outcome. Specifically, being male as opposed to female (β: -0.283, P: 0.000), being married compared to other marital statuses (β: -0.370, P: 0.000), having a secondary education rather than a university education (β: 3.346, P: 0.000), and residing in Asuncion instead of the interior (β: 0.347, P: 0.000) were all found to have statistically significant impacts on the outcome variable, as shown in Table 2.
The majority of respondents (66.28%) concurred that COVID-19 will ultimately be effectively controlled. A small percentage reported disagreement (6.78%) while a larger portion indicated uncertainty (26.93%). Significant variations in attitudes were observed across gender, age group, marital status, education level, occupation, current place of residence, and COVID-19 knowledge scores, as detailed in Table 3.
In the multiple logistic regression analysis, it was determined that male gender (compared to female) had an odds ratio of 1.50 with a significance level of P = 0.000, while COVID-19 knowledge score had an odds ratio of 0.78 with a significance level of P = 0.000. Conversely, female gender (compared to male) had an odds ratio of 1.3 with a significance level of P = 0.000, age-groups of 18-29 (compared to 30-49) had an odds ratio of 1.55 with a significance level of P = 0.000, and COVID-19 knowledge score had an odds ratio of 1.18 with a significance level of P = 0.000 as shown in Table 4.
The study revealed that a significant proportion of participants, 88.35%, had refrained from visiting crowded places, while 74.31% reported wearing masks when venturing outside in the recent past. Noteworthy variations in these practices were observed across different demographic categories such as gender, age-group, marital status, education level, occupation, place of residence, and COVID-19 knowledge score, as indicated in Table 3.
The results of the multiple logistic regression analysis revealed significant associations between various factors and behaviors related to COVID-19 precautions. Specifically, male gender (OR: 0.53, P: 0.000), belonging to the age group 18-20 (compared to 30-49, OR: 0.68, P: 0.000), and possessing higher levels of COVID-19 knowledge (OR: 0.81, P: 0.000) were found to be significantly associated with visiting crowded places. Conversely, being male (compared to female, OR: 1.01, P: 0.000) and having greater COVID-19 knowledge (OR: 1.13, P: 0.000) were significantly linked to not wearing a mask outdoors, as indicated in Table 6.
An exploration of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices can incorporate both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The primary objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the target demographic. Therefore, initiating the process with a focus group discussion to delve into the subject matter is recommended. Subsequently, utilizing the insights gathered from this initial phase, a survey can be formulated, a sample can be selected, and the research can be conducted. However, given the current challenging circumstances in the country, conducting traditional research methods is proving to be difficult. Consequently, due to the urgency of the situation, an expedited online survey was conducted, marking the inaugural investigation into KAP regarding COVID-19 in Paraguay.
This study builds upon the research conducted by Bao-Liang Zhong et al. (12), who investigated the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding COVID-19 among Chinese residents during the initial surge of the outbreak. The instrument used in their study was translated into Spanish and validated through a pilot study involving 10 participants. Subsequently, the instrument was disseminated widely through WhatsApp groups. To the best of our knowledge, no other study resembling this particular investigation has been identified in the existing literature.
The study participants primarily consisted of young adults, university students, and residents from various regions within the country, including Concepción, San Pedro, Cordillera, Guaira, Caaguazú, Itapúa, Alto Paraná, Presidente Hayes, and Boquerón, with only a small representation from Asunción and the Metropolitan Area, where the initial cases of COVID-19 were reported. Despite a global knowledge rate of 62%, which is deemed acceptable, it is still considered relatively low, given that the study delved into fundamental aspects of COVID-19 and protective measures. This is particularly noteworthy as a majority of the participants were university students, where higher levels of knowledge might be expected. While the average knowledge score on COVID-19 was similar across all groups, statistically significant differences were observed in relation to gender, age group, marital status, education, occupation, and place of residence. The findings of this study indicate lower knowledge levels compared to those reported by Bao-Liang Zhong et al(12), although the average was higher than that observed in our study, with similar statistical associations being noted.
The majority of attitudes towards effectively controlling and triumphing over COVID-19 were positive. However, it is noteworthy that a segment of participants expressed uncertainty regarding the successful containment of the virus. Additionally, a notable proportion believed that Paraguay did not emerge victorious in the battle against COVID-19, potentially influenced by misinformation disseminated through social media platforms. This phenomenon may be linked to the prevalent fear and anxiety surrounding the pandemic, underscoring the importance of promoting a culture of accurate information dissemination. Furthermore, male participants exhibited a higher likelihood of displaying positive attitudes, particularly those with elevated levels of knowledge concerning COVID-19.
In terms of practices, the majority were deemed satisfactory, with a significant portion indicating they had not visited crowded venues. The association between attending crowded places and demographic factors revealed a minimal risk, whereas the risk associated with not wearing a mask was 1.01 times higher in men compared to women, aligning closely with the findings of Bao-Liang Zhong et al(12).
The strength of this study lies in its large sample recruited during a critical period, the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, it is important to note that this sample primarily consisted of individuals with good academic training who were more adept at using social networks for completing online surveys. Additionally, the sample was skewed towards women, who generally exhibit a higher willingness to participate in studies, and individuals from rural areas. As a result, this study provides an approximation of the knowledge state within this specific population. To achieve more comprehensive insights, it is imperative to conduct another study with adjusted methodology targeting individuals with lower academic backgrounds and older age groups, who are at higher risk. The limitations of this study primarily revolve around the sample selection process, which was not based on random sampling, and the data collection method, which required respondents to have access to the Internet, smartphones, or computers to complete the survey.
In conclusion, it is evident that the level of knowledge regarding COVID-19 within the Paraguayan population during the outbreak was deemed acceptable, with predominantly favorable attitudes and generally adequate practices. Nevertheless, there is a pressing need to launch extensive educational campaigns to enhance the overall understanding of COVID-19 and curb its transmission. By mobilizing both the populace and health authorities, it is feasible to effectively mitigate and reduce the number of COVID-19 cases across Paraguay.
