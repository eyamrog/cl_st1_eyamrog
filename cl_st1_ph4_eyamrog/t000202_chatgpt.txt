This study represents a partial advancement of an ongoing research initiative aimed at creating, contributing to, and analyzing cultural indicators within the Ecuadorian university context. Specifically, the focus of this work lies in presenting a series of indicators related to the equipment, usage, and consumption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) among students at the National University of Education of Ecuador (UNAE). The methodology employed is quantitative and of a descriptive-analytical nature, relying on data gathered through a survey administered to a sample population comprising 438 students from various disciplines and academic levels at UNAE. The sample boasts a 95% reliability margin with a 5% margin of error. The findings revealed a notable prevalence of technological device ownership, usage, and consumption among the student body. Furthermore, it was observed that this university demographic dedicates significant daily hours to activities involving cellphones, television, videos, and the internet.
The quest for cultural indicators has followed a significant trajectory since the mid-twentieth century, spurred by international organizations and government institutions. In recent decades, this objective has been extensively pursued in various Latin American countries. Nevertheless, Ecuador stands out as a territorial entity that continues to lack its own set of indicators, studies, and analyses pertaining to the cultural sector.
Two significant works have been conducted thus far: the Latin American Survey of cultural habits and practices in 2013, which was prepared by the Organization of Ibero-American States in collaboration with the Ibero-American Observatory of Culture (OIBC) and Latino Barómetro, focusing on Ecuador; and the analysis of habits and cultural practices in the Machala canton in 2014, the capital of El Oro.
In another analytical context, there exists a vast bibliographic collection on cultural subjects that draws upon theoretical-methodological frameworks and empirical investigations, stemming from the foundational works of the Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birmingham and Bourdieu's research. Within the Latin American social landscape, it is essential to acknowledge the significant contributions of Canclini (2006) and Sunkel (2006), alongside other scholars in the field.
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in this subject within the university context, as evidenced by the works of Ben (2006) and De Garay (2016), although their research output remains limited. However, the majority of these contributions tend to concentrate on specific and distinct aspects, employing various objects of study and methodological approaches.
In the realm of territorial studies within university settings, it is essential to underscore the noteworthy contributions from scholars in Mexico such as Rosas (2002), Flores et al. (2009), Bañales (2014), as well as the relatively lesser extent of research on university populations in Chile by Güell, Morales, and Nuñez (2011); Colombia by Arango, Castañeda, and Ramírez (2016); and Cuba by Gómez, Riverón, Griñan, León, and Yarenis (2017), among other notable researchers.
The analysis topics predominantly focus on the consumption of new technologies, as evidenced by the studies conducted by Aguilar-Barceló and Ramírez-Angulo (2006); Hinojosa-Córdova and Silva-Corpus (2008); Santamaría and Yurén (2010); Pini, Musanti, Kaufman, and Amaré (2012); Osorio, Molero, Pérez, and Mercader (2014); Fernández-Villa et al. (2015); Sanvicén and Molina (2015); Casillas, Ramírez, and Ortega (2016); Gisbert and Esteve (2016); López (2016); Romero-Rodríguez and Aguaded (2016); Ruano, Congote, and Torres (2016); Paspuel and Palacios (2018); and Rojas, Jiménez-Fernández, and Rodríguez (2018).
This particular research avenue within the university domain has thus far failed to significantly influence Ecuadorian scientific output. Consequently, this study is warranted as a component of a broader initiative seeking to furnish insights into cultural customs and behaviors within the Ecuadorian university milieu. Furthermore, these metrics not only delineate student profiles but also have the potential to enhance holistic development and furnish pertinent data for institutional decision-making regarding cultural programming, as highlighted by Hinojosa-Córdova and Silva-Corpus (2008) and Flores et al. (2009).
This research aims to gather indicators and evaluate the primary consumption habits and cultural practices of university students at UNAE, constituting the main objectives of the study. The theoretical foundation is based on the initial framework proposed by Canclini (2006) and Bigott (2007), taking into account the socio-historical changes resulting from new forms and modes of consumption driven by the integration and advancement of new technologies. In this context, prior conceptualizations are essential. Firstly, the process of appropriating and utilizing technological and cultural devices is not viewed solely through an economic lens but rather through the construction of meanings that can elucidate social behaviors. Additionally, a habit is defined as the recurring cultural behavior in certain cultural activities, which may not necessarily be linked to the actual practice of these activities, while the term practice is specifically applied to sectors such as recorded music, video, television, radio, computer, and the Internet.
In our research, we explore various time frames to gauge the prevalence of a habit without necessarily implying its active engagement, as previously noted. When examining a particular cultural activity within a specific timeframe, the intensity of participation, denoting the frequency or duration dedicated to it, is considered a cultural practice.
The methodology employed in this study is quantitative and follows a descriptive-analytical approach. Data was gathered through a survey administered to a sample population consisting of 438 students enrolled in various programs and academic cycles at UNAE.
A proportional stratified sampling method was utilized to select the population of undergraduate students from the five academic programs at the National University of Education for the period spanning September to February 2018. This sampling approach was conducted with a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error.
The sample consisted of 438 students, selected to mirror the gender distribution of the university's total enrollment, with 63% female and 37% male. These students were divided into five undergraduate courses and subgroups based on different cycles: Basic Education (six cycles), Intercultural Bilingual Education (six cycles), Initial Education (six cycles), Special Education (four cycles), and Education in Experimental Sciences (two cycles). The population size varied across degrees, leading to varying sample sizes: 234 students from Basic Education, 78 from Initial Education, 50 from Intercultural Bilingual Education, 53 from Special Education, and 26 from Experimental Sciences.
The methodological and technical considerations outlined in surveys conducted by the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sport of Spain, the Ibero-American Observatory of Culture, and the Satellite Accounts of Culture have been thoroughly examined and integrated. This process has led to the development of a foundational tool tailored to the university setting, which has undergone pilot testing and ongoing validation.
The survey is organized into three main modules: students' identification data, cultural facilities, and interest in cultural activities. Additionally, there are twelve sectorial modules covering various aspects such as museums, art galleries, archives, arts and craft fairs, House of Culture, monuments, archaeological sites, reading and library, ballet or dance, opera and theater, concerts of classical and modern music, film and video, music, television, radio, computer and Internet, use of free time practices related to leisure and culture. Finally, there is a section dedicated to the cultural actions and programs implemented by UNAE and the participation and interest of the student population.
In this study, the focus lies on identifying the extent to which students have access to and utilize various forms of technological support such as computers, the Internet, and mobile phones. Additionally, the research aims to investigate the patterns of usage, characteristics, frequency, intensity of engagement, motivations, preferences, and habits related to different modes of technology acquisition. Furthermore, the study seeks to understand the time allocated to these activities by students.
The data collection process involved administering a survey comprising a total of 194 questions organized into fifteen sections focusing on cultural habits and practices. Specifically, 39 questions related to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) were dispersed throughout all sections of the survey.
The survey was conducted both face-to-face and online using the Google Forms platform, administered in the university's computer labs with the support of the research team. Data collection took place throughout February 2018. The intervention was structured in cycles, with students dedicating approximately 30 to 40 minutes to complete the survey.
The diverse characteristics of the surveyed students align closely with the overall UNAE university population. In terms of territorial origin, there is a notable prevalence of students hailing from the provinces of Azuay (56%) and Cañar (24%), with the remaining seventeen provinces making only minor contributions, as indicated by the data presented in Table 1.
In terms of gender distribution, women constitute the majority at 63%, while men make up 37% of the student population. Regarding age demographics, the data reveals that slightly over a quarter of the students fall into older age brackets compared to the typical university student age range. Specifically, 71% of students are aged between 18 and 22, 22% fall within the 23 to 27 age group, 5% are aged between 28 and 32, 1.4% fall in the 33 to 47 age range, and 1% are over 38 years old.
The distribution of marital status among the participants indicates a predominant percentage of singles (90%), with a significantly lower proportion being married (6%), in free unions (2%), or separated (2%). Additionally, a notable portion of students (13%) bear family responsibilities, with 10% being parents to one child, 2% to two children, and 0.5% to three children.
In terms of ethnic self-identification, the majority, constituting 96%, identify themselves as mestizos, while 2% identify as indigenous, 1% as montubio, and 1% as afro-Ecuadorians.
In terms of the classes they are enrolled in, it is noteworthy that 53% are in Basic General Education, 18% in Initial Education, 12% in Special Education, 11% in Intercultural Bilingual Education, and 6% in Experimental Sciences Education. When considering their distribution across semester cycles, 34% are in the first cycle, 20% in the second, 18% in the third, 10% in the fifth, and 9% in the fourth and third cycles, respectively.
It is important to highlight that 75% of the surveyed students receive scholarship grants from both the University and the Institute for the Promotion of Human Talent. Additionally, 62% of the students examined are financially dependent on their families, with 80% belonging to the most economically vulnerable quintiles, as illustrated in Figure 1.
The data analysis is segmented into two sections: the first pertains to the technological equipment accessible to students (refer to Figure 2), while the second focuses on their utilization (refer to Figure 3).
The research findings indicate that a significant proportion of the students under examination possess Internet connectivity, with 92% reported to have access. However, it is noteworthy that a substantial portion of these individuals lack a mobile data plan for internet usage, with over half (50.6%) falling into this category. Only a small fraction, amounting to 15.1% of the total sample, have access to this service, with a higher percentage among women (9.4%) compared to men (5.7%).
In the study, it was found that 36.1% of the university students analyzed possessed a desktop computer, while a larger proportion, specifically 84.7%, owned a laptop. These statistics indicate a noteworthy trend where a substantial percentage of students have access to both types of devices.
Among the young individuals surveyed, 24.9% possess digital book readers, while 52.7% own digital music devices. In terms of specialized software, 30.1% have editing and video programs, closely followed by educational software at 26.5%. The distribution of these software types is relatively even across genres. Game programs rank third at 22.1%, with a notable discrepancy in distribution between males (23.3%) and females (13.9%).

In the past month, participants acquired press or magazine readings primarily in free paper format, with 16% obtaining information from the press, 3% from sports publications, 9% from cultural reviews, and 6% from other journals.
The most frequently read sections in the press on a daily basis include those related to culture (17%), science and technology (15%), TV criticism (7%), music criticism (5%), film criticism (3%), and art and exhibition reviews (2%). In terms of expenditure on newspapers over the past year, 50% of respondents spent between 0 to 20 dollars, 8% spent between 21 to 30 dollars, 3% spent between 31 to 40 dollars, and 2% spent more than 51 dollars. As for spending on magazines in the same period, 55% spent between 0 to 20 dollars, 6% spent between 21 to 30 dollars, 2% spent between 31 to 40 dollars, and 1% spent between 41 to 50 dollars.
In the study, it was found that 61% of students typically listened to the radio, with this distribution being 37% among females and 23% among males. Among these listeners, 28% tuned in daily, 26% listened at least once a week, and 7% listened at least once a month. Furthermore, 47% of university students surveyed reported dedicating between one to two hours a day to radio listening from Monday to Friday, while 8% listened for three to four hours, 4% for five to six hours, and 2% for more than six hours daily. The most popular radio programs were found to be musical ones (27%), followed by news and information shows (12%), entertainment programs (8%), music concerts (6%), sports broadcasts (3%), cultural programs (1%), and talk shows (1%) as illustrated in Figure 5.
In the examined population, 72% engage in watching TV, with 46% of women and 26% of men participating. Among women, 21% watch TV daily and 20% do so at least once a week, while for men, these figures are 13% and 10%, respectively. The primary media used for watching TV include television (80%), computers (14%), cell phones (5%), and tablets (1%). Regarding daily TV viewing time from Monday to Friday, 54% spend one to two hours, 14% spend three to four hours, 3% spend five to six hours, and 1% watch for more than six hours. On weekends, 36% watch for one to two hours, 27% for three to four hours, 6% for five to six hours, and 2% for more than six hours. Preferences for TV content include movies (24%), series and novels (17%), sports (8%), entertainment programs (7%), news and information (5%), children's programs (4%), documentaries (4%), and music concerts (1%). In terms of frequency, 34% watch TV daily, 30% at least once a week, 5% at least once a month, and 2% never or almost never.
Approximately 21.7% of university students examined dedicate three to four hours daily to smartphone usage, with 19.6% spending over six hours and 16.9% between five and six hours. This time is almost evenly split between academic pursuits (67.8%) and social media engagement (69.6%) as depicted in Figure 6. Noteworthy among leisure activities on smartphones are taking photos or videos (92.9%) and listening to music (74.9%). While these rates fall below 50% for activities like watching videos on traditional television and radio, where 71.2% watch TV and 61% listen to the radio, the same activities on smartphones are below 10%.
The vast majority of students (96.80%) access the internet on a daily basis. Their leisure activities predominantly involve watching videos and listening to music through online platforms. Specifically, 86.3% of students consume videos, with 50% utilizing streaming services and 36.3% resorting to illegal online sources. In terms of music consumption, 85.2% opt for free downloads from the internet. When it comes to acquiring books, 58.2% of students prefer online sources, with distribution methods including free downloads (28.8%), paid downloads (14.8%), and online purchases (14.6%).
The utilization of computers for academic pursuits on a daily basis is predominant, accounting for 91.1% of respondents, in contrast to daily usage for non-academic activities, which stands at 60%. A smaller proportion, 35.4%, engages with computers at least once a week.
In the analysis conducted, it was found that 47.3% of the university students had acquired a computer within the past year. Among these students, 34.5% cited academic reasons as their motivation for the purchase, while 12.8% mentioned other reasons. Therefore, it can be concluded that the predominant factor driving the acquisition of computers among university students is their academic needs.
In the realm of leisure and free time activities conducted through computers, watching videos (42.2%) and television (19.6%) emerge as prominent choices, with the participation rates for other activities like listening to music and radio falling below 5%.
All university students, totaling 100%, engage in video consumption, with a breakdown showing 63% of women and 37% of men, typically viewing videos on a daily basis at a rate of 77%. The content preferences are diverse, with musicals being the most popular at 31%, followed by series at 23%, documentaries at 15%, and educational programs at 5%. In terms of devices used for viewing, the cell phone is the most commonly utilized at 47%, followed by computers at 42%, and tablets at 3%. Sources of video content vary, with illegal internet downloads being the primary method at 50%, followed by streaming services at 6%, and video stores at 5%.
In the study, it was found that 63% of the university students examined had accessed an online library within the last quarter, with 14% doing so within the last year, 6% more than a year ago, and 17% reporting never or almost never accessing an online library. When considering the frequency of online library access, 47% of the participants accessed it between one to ten times, 19% between eleven and twenty times, 3% between twenty-one to thirty times, and 6% between forty-one to fifty times.
A significant proportion of university students, amounting to 82%, utilize the technological resources available at the UNAE library. Among these users, 11% access these resources on a daily basis, 42% do so at least once a week, 21% at least once a month, and 8% at least once a year. Furthermore, 26% of university students specifically access digital databases, with 3% doing so daily, 9% weekly, 9% monthly, and 5% annually.
The student body at the National University of Education of Ecuador possesses a significant amount of technological equipment, with cell phones being the most prevalent, followed by internet access and laptops. Interestingly, this ownership of new technological devices does not appear to be influenced by individual or family socioeconomic status, as 82% of university students belong to the lower income brackets (56% in quintile 1 and 26% in quintile 2). These devices serve as the primary tools for information and communication among UNAE students, with a notable trend of spending a substantial amount of time on activities such as watching videos, using the internet, engaging with cell phones, and watching television on a daily and weekly basis. Moreover, there is a balanced usage pattern across genders, with a nearly equal distribution in the utilization of these devices for both academic purposes and social networking.
