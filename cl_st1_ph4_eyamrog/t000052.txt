In the framework of the study of Siluriform fish monogeneans of Lake Tanganyika, we 
described two new species of Bagrobdella from Auchenoglanis occidentalis, Bagrobdella 
vanhovei sp. nov. is characterized by the morphology of its MCO which is unique (terminal 
opening) and Bagrobdella vansteenbergei sp. nov. characterized by the size of its hooks, which 
are almost all of the same size, and its male copulating organ with a unique shape: sub-terminal 
opening and no membrane surrounding. 

Lake Tanganyika is, with 12 million years,  the oldest of the East African Great Lakes, 
(Cohen et al. 1993). It stands out from the rest of the world’s lakes by its richly diverse 
ichthyofauna, which make it an important hotspot for the world’s freshwater lacustrine 
biodiversity (Coulter et al. 1986). The 3200 km2 of Lake Tanganyika’s surface area is unevenly 
distributed among four countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the West 
(14800 km2 or 45%), Tanzania in the East (13500 km2 or 41%), Burundi in the North (2600 
km2 or 8%) and Zambia in the South (200 km2 or 6%) (Cohen et al., 1993; Fermon, 2007) (Fig. 
1).  

The fish fauna of Lake Tanganyika has received particular attention from evolutionary 
biologists, mostly because of its phenotypically, ethologically and genetically highly diverse 
cichlid fauna which consider it as a ‘natural laboratory’ (Martens 1997, Langenberg et al. 2003, 
Albrecht & Wilke 2008, Cristescu et al. 2010). Indeed, its cichlid species are phenotypically, 
ethically and genetically highly diverse (Nishida 1991, Salzburger et al. 2002, 2005), they show 
the highest degree of endemism compared to other great lakes in Africa and the Americas 
(Salzburger et al. 2014), with 239 endemic species out of the 241 described (an endemism rate 
of 99%) (Ronco et al. 2020, 2021). In addition to evolutionists, Lake Tanganyika Cichlids have 
also attracted the attention of parasitologists primarily in host biogeography, systematics and 
parasite evolution (e.g. Bates, 1997, Grégoir et al. 2014, Pariselle et al. 2011, 2015, 
Raeymaekers et al. 2013, Steenberge et al. 2015, Vanhove et al., 2013, 2015, 2016). 

The non-cichlids of Lake Tanganyika, less diversified than the Cichlidae, have attracted 
very little attention of scientists. However, they are represented by 75 species belonging to 11 
families, and have a rate of endemicity of 59 %. It is true that species of some of these families, 
such as Clupeidae and Latidae, have already been the subject of some ecological (Coulter 1976, 
Mannini et al. 1999), parasitological (Kmentova et al. 2018, Kmentova et al. 2020) and 
genomic (De Keyzer et al. 2019) studies. However, the Siluriformes, while representing on 
their own 5 (Bagridae, Claroteidae, Clariidae, Mochokidae and Malapteruridae) of these 11 
families, making Lake Tanganyika the most diverse lake in Siluriformes than any other lake in 
the world (Fermon 2007, Peart et al. 2014), have been totally left behind. Thus, the present 
study set out to investigate the Monogenea of the latter group. 

The history of the Lake Tanganyika parasitic fauna begins with the description of 
Ancyrocephalus limnothrissae Paperna, 1973 from the gills of Limnothrissa miodon 
(Boulenger 1906). This species was redescribed under the name Kapentagyrus limnothrissae 
by Kmentova et al. (2018). The second description of Lake Tanganyika’s monogenean species 
was one belonging to Gyrodactylus by Vanhove et al. (2011). Since then, the number of studies 
in Lake Tanganyika monogeneans has increased, with particular attention given to 
Cichlidogyrus monogenean of Cichlid fish, which currently has 30 published and 10 other 
undescribed species (Rahmouni 2017, 2020, 2021). 

This is the first study that describes Bagrobdella species in Lake Tanganyika. To date, 
four species are described from Ghana, Uganda, Mali and Cameroon, belonging to this genus: 
Bagrobdella auchenoglanii Paperna, 1969, B. fraudulenta Euzet & Le Brun, 1990 and B. 
anthopenis Euzet & Le Brun, 1990 (Euzet & Le Brun 1990) from Auchenoglanis occidentalis 
(Valenciennes, 1840) and one, B. parauchenoglanis Akoumba, Pariselle, Tombi & Bilong 
Bilong, 2017 from Parauchenoglanis monkei (Keilhack 1910) (Akoumba et al. 2017). 

The parasites described in this study were collected from 11 specimens of 
Auchenoglanis occidentalis (Claroteidae, Siluriformes). They were captured in the North-
Western part of the lake, a few meters from the orthodox church in Uvira (Northern part) and 
at the Mouth of River Mutambala (Southern part) (Fig. 1). They were killed by severing their 
chordal spines, and identified on site as Auchenoglanis occidentalis using the Fermon et al. 
(2012) keys. The gills and a small section of the pectoral fins were stored in 96% ethanol. 

Fish DNA isolation was carried out according to the protocol of Aljanabi & Martinez 
(1997): approximately 50 μg of pectoral fin fragment was sheared into small pieces before 
being digested at 55 °C overnight with 20 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) in 180 μl of extraction 
buffer solution (1M Tris, 0.5M Na Cl2, 1 % SDS). The extracted DNA was suspended in 150 
μl sterile double distilled water and stored at −20 °C until amplified by PCR (Louizi et al., 
2019). The partial mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase (COI) gene was amplified using 
FishF1/F2 and FishR1 universal primers (Ward et al. 2005). Each amplification was performed 
in a volume of 50 μl containing 0.25 mM of MgCl 2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 mM of each 
primer, 5 μl buffer (10×) and 10 units of Taq polymerase. The replication cycle was as follows: 
94 °C (3 min), 48 °C (30 s), 72 °C (5 min) for 30 cycles with a final step at 72 °C for 10 min 
(Louizi et al., 2019). The sequencing step was performed at the genotyping-sequencing 
platform of the “Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution of Montpellier” (ISE-M) in France. The 
sequences are obtained with a Genomix sequencer (MGX), following the manufacturing 
recommendations and, using the same forward and reverse primers as for PCR. Cleaning and 
alignment of the sequences was done with MEGA X software (Kumar et al., 2018). Vouchers 
(Fig. 2) were kept in the collection of CRH-Uvira (DRC). 

The gills were examined under a Wild Heerbrugg® M8 binocular. The monogeneans 
were recovered using an entomologist needle and some individuals were mounted in a drop of 
Hoyer’s medium (Anderson 1954) on a slide, then covered with a coverslip to ‘flatten’ the 
specimen. The slides were left to dry for 24 hours in horizontal position before sealing the 
coverslip with Glyceel (Bates 1997). Other individuals were mounted using tap water and 
identified under a Leica® DM 2500 microscope equipped with a digital camera (Leica DMC 
4500), after identification, the monogeneans were individually stored in Eppendorf® tubes in 
96% ethanol for subsequent genetic studies. 

Measurements based on Euzet & Le Brun (1990), were taken using LAS version 4.12.0 
software (Fig. 3), and given in µm as average followed by the range in parentheses, number of 
individuals. Drawings of the sclerotized parts of the Monogeneans were made with 
CorelDRAW 2019 software using pictures taken from the camera. All analyses were performed 
using R 4.1.2 software (R core Team 2022). 

Data from 45 individuals of one new species, 10 individuals of the other and 10 
individuals of Bagrobdella parauchenoglanii, were subjected to a Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA). This analysis was done using the FactoMineR (Husson et al. 2020) and 
factoextra (Kassambara & Mundt 2020) packages in R. Bagrobdella auchenoglanii, B. 
fraudulenta and B. anthopenis, each one represented by the mean values of the analyzed 
parameters obtained in Euzet and Le Brun (1990) were added to the analysis as supplementary 
individuals. 

To comply with the regulations set out in article 8.5 of the amended 2012 version of the 
International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), details of the new species were 
submitted to ZooBank. The Life Science Identifier (LSID) of the article is XXXX. For each 
new species, the Life Science Identifier (LSID) is reported in the taxonomic summary. 

Types were deposited in the Helminth collection of the Royal Museum for Central 
Africa (MRAC, Tervuren, Belgium). 

Note that the authors of the new species are different from the authors of this article 
(International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature 2015).  

The identification of host species was confirmed by the molecular analysis, and the 
sequences were deposited in Genbank (Identification number XXX). Gills of eleven 
Auchenoglanis occidentalis specimens were examined for parasite infection. Seven out of 
eleven hosts were found be parasitized. The most parasitized fish host is the sole specimen 
caught at the Mouth of Mutambala River. 

Description. The anatomy is that of Bagrobdella. Length 681.2 (521.7–964.9) 72; 
greatest width 200.4(139.8–273.2) 72; pharynx 70.6(49.4–97) 61; Dorsal anchor: a = 
81.6(64.7–94.1) 78, b = 66.1 (52.7–75.9) 78, c = 8.9(3.0–17.2) 78, d = 20.9 (12.9–29.6) 78, e 
= 18.5 (13.3–22.4) 78, no visible filaments. Dorsal bar x = 86.9 (62.2–111.6) 72, w = 14.7 (9–
22.6) 71, median projection posteriorly oriented: Y = 59.4 (33.2–81.9) 61. Ventral anchor 
slightly drilled at the blade beginning: a = 65.3 (38–73.9) 78, b = 70.9 (60.1–79.2) 78, c = 10.5 
(4.5–16.3) 78, d = 17.5 (12.6–24.0) 78, e = 6.2 (3.0–9.1) 77, no visible filaments. Ventral bar 
x = 111.9 (75.6–146) 75, w= 16.3 (9.4–27.4) 74 extends in the form of an outgrowth, BL = 
10.6 (4.6–19.8) 60, Bl = 5.8 (3.2–13) 60, median projection posteriorly orientated, cross-
shaped, Cx = 72.3 (57.8–91.3) 77, Cy = 20.4 (14.3–28.5) 76. At median projection posterior 
extremity is attached another sclerotized piece trapeze-shaped. Fourteen hooks arranged in 
seven symmetrical pairs of different sizes: I (medio-ventral) the largest and longest: 51.6 (34.3–
64.2) 77, II (medio-ventral) the smallest hooks: 16.8 (12.9–20) 69, III and IV (latero-dorsal and 
almost identical in size): 38.6 (26.6–47.5) 74 V to VII (latero-ventral and almost identical in 
size) 25 (16.5–35.4) 72. A medium-ventral trapezoidal plate (Fig. 6), slightly sclerified, is 
located between hooks I measures TL: 37.3 (28.4–49.8) 15, Tl: 27.6 (21.7–34.6) 16. The penis 
(MCO): 60.5 (50.7–67.3) 71 started by a well-developed basal bulb: AL = 15.3 (9.9–22.4) 41, 
Al = 9.7 (3.4–20.3), followed by a thick-walled tube of constant diameter, folded at 30° at the 
middle, the distal half is surrounded by a membrane; at the distal extremity of the tube (level 
of opening) a portion of the wall formed a triangular part tapering at is end, its length being a 
quarter of that of the tube. Lidded eggs 92.8 (82.7–109.9) 12 are ovoid, slightly arched (Fig. 
7), at the pole opposite to the operculum is a filament finished by a small disc, exactly as 
described by Euzet et Le Brun (1990) in the diagnose of Bagrobdella. 

Remarks. Bagrobdella vanhovei has seven pairs of hooks of different sizes, and has a 
trapeze-shaped piece associated with the median projection of the ventral bar (Fig. 6, latter 
visible in 15 of the 78 studied specimens), both characters have been mentioned in the 
descriptions of the four already known species in this genus. Its dorsal anchors have a long 
point, while its ventral anchors have a very short one, like in Bagrobdella auchenoglanii and 
B. fraudulenta (B. parauchenoglanii and B. anthopenis having points of the same size for both 
ventral and dorsal anchors). Bagrobdella vanhovei could be easily distinguished from all 
species already described by the morphology of its MCO which is unique (sub-terminal 
opening) (Fig. 5).  

Description. The anatomy is that of Bagrobdella. Total length 621. (542.8–748.7) 12, 
greatest width 182.2 (112.8–262.1) 13; pharynx 63.8 (42.3–79) 10. Dorsal anchor a = 70.6 
(66.7–77.3) 13, b = 64.4 (58.6–70.2) 13, c = 0.7 (0.0–4.9) 13, d = 9.9 (6.8–12.6) 13, e = 22.9 
(21.2–26.1) 13. Dorsal bar x = 87.7 (76.9–99.5) 10, w =13.5 (9.5–18.3) 10, median projection 
posteriorly oriented: Y = 55.1 (50.6–69.5) 6. Ventral anchor slightly drilled at the blade 
proximal extremity: a = 63 (60.7–67.1) 13, b = 61.9 (59.5–64.3)12, c = 6.0 (3.6–8.1)12, d = 
12.2 (9.4–16.6) 12, e = 25.9 (22.3–27.5) 13. Ventral bar: 92.3 (77.5–103.2) 10, w = 13.7 (11.1–
17.9) 8, extends in the form of an outgrowth: BL = 7.4 (5.1–10.5) 7, Bl = 4.9 (4.5–6.2) 8. This 
bar has a median projection posteriorly cross-chapped cx = 76.6 (68.9–84.5) 12, cy = 25.3 
(20.8–31.4) 12. All hook pairs have almost the same size: I = 26.1 (23–31.1) 11, II = 16.9 
(13.9–19.4)10, III and IV = 22 (18.9–26.7) 10, and V up to VII = 18.8 (17.7–21.5) 12. Penis 
66.1 (58.1–71.0) 11, began by an asymmetrical bulb AL = 15.5 (10.7–20) 9, Al = 9.3(5.2–12.1) 
9, is a curved tube with thick wall and constant diameter; as for B. vanhovei a part of the wall 
extend the penis extremity of about 25%; contrarily to other species of this genus, no membrane 
had been seen surrounding the penis. 

Remarks. Bagrobdella vansteenbergei differs from all other species already described 
by the size of its hooks which are all of almost the same length (pair I being only slightly longer 
than the others), when they are of different size in all the previously described species 
(including B. vanhovei sp. nov.) (Fig. 10). More, the trapezoidal piece was not observed in the 
17 individuals (15 Hoyer’s mounted and 2 preserved in ethanol), it may be thought to be absent 
in this species, even if it is usually slightly sclerotised and hard to observe. The ventral anchors 
are slightly holed. Its male copulating organ has a unique shape within Bagrobdella spp. (sub-
terminal opening and no membrane surrounding) (Fig. 11).  
 
Figure 10. Haptors of the six species belonging to Bagrobdella. 1. Bagrobdella vanhovei, 2. Bagrobdella 
vansteenbergei, 3. Bagrobdella auchenoglanii, 4. Bagrobdella fraudulenta, 5. Bagrobdella anthopenis, 6. 
Bagrobdella parauchenoglanii. (Akoumba et al 2017; Euzet, Le Brun 1990). Scale bar: 20 μm. 

Our dataset contained 68 individuals with 21 quantitative variables (Fig. 3). Among the 
68 individuals, three were considered as illustrative (#66 corresponds to B. auchenoglanii, #67 
corresponds to B. fraudulenta and #68 corresponds to B. anthopenis). The first two dimensions 
of the PCA represent 71.73% of the total dataset inertia. Individuals are clustered into three 
groups which correspond to the three species included in the analysis (Bagrobdella vanhovei, 
B. vansteenbergei and Bagrobdella pauchenoglanii) (Fig. 12 & 13). The dimension 1 opposes 
most individuals belonging to the group B. vanhovei (to the right of the graph, characterized 
by a positive coordinate on the axis) to individuals belonging to the groups B. vansteenbergi 
and B. parauchenoglanii (from Cameroon), to the left of the graph, characterized by a strongly 
negative coordinate on the axis). 

The individuals belonging to the group B. vanhovei (characterized by a positive 
coordinate on the axis) are sharing: 

- 
high values for III_IV, Hd_d, Bd_w, I, Hv_b, Hd_a, Bv_x, Hv_a, Hv_d and Hd_b 
(variables are sorted from the strongest). 

- 
low values for Hv_e and Pe (variables are sorted from the weakest). 

The individuals belonging to B. parauchenoglanii (characterized by a negative coordinate 
on the axis) are sharing: 

- high values for the variables Pe, Hv_c, Hd_c and Bv_w (variables are sorted from the 
strongest). 

- low values for the variables Hd_b, Bd_.x, Bv_x, cx, Hv_a, Hd_a, Hv_b, Hd_e, III_IV 
and Hd_d (variables are sorted from the weakest). 

In the group of Bagrobdella vansteenbergei (characterized by a negative coordinate on the 
axis) individuals share: 

- high values for the variables Hv_e and Hd_e (variables are sorted from the strongest). 

- low values for the variables V_à_VII, Hd_c, Hv_c, I, Bd_w, Hd_d, Hv_d, Bv_w and 
III_IV (variables are sorted from the weakest). 

The dimension 2 opposes individuals belonging to B. parauchenoglanii (to the top of the 
graph, characterized by a strongly positive coordinate on the axis) to individuals belonging to 
Bagrobdella vansteenbergei.  

On the graph, Bagrobdella auchenoglanii (#66) and B. anthopenis (#68) are isolated 
from the other species, when B. fraudulenta (#67) grouped with B. parauchenoglanii, even so 
these two latter species being easily distinguishable (at least by their penis morphology (Fig. 
11). 

Among the 11 studied host specimens, the most parasitized was the one caught at the 
Mouth of Mutambala River. This individual hosted a total of 286 Monogeneans, 269 
Bagrobdella vanhovei and 17 B. vansteenbergei. The other ten individuals that were captured 
off the Orthodox Church of Uvira possessed only Bagrobdella vanhovei individuals. Among 
them, four had no monogeneans, three had one individual, and the other three hosts had, five, 
six and 35 individuals respectively. This non-homogeneous distribution is very common in 
populations of parasite from host fishes (Dold & Holland 2011), for example it has been 
observed very recently in the Brachyplatystoma vaillantii Valenciennes, 1840 (Siluriformes, 
Pimelodidae) in the Amazon (Brito-Junior & Tavares-Dias 2021).  

As there is sometimes a correlation between water quality and helminth infections (e.g. 
in the Cyprinid fish (Zargar et al. 2012)), overdispersion of Bagrobdella vanhovei and the 
absence of B. vansteenbergei in the other six host individuals captured off the Orthodox Church 
of Uvira could be due to different water qualities at the level of these two sampling sites. Thus, 
Bagrobdella vansteenbergei could be adapted to the conditions found at the Mouth of 
Mutambala River, while Bagrobdella vanhovei could be more resistant to variations of abiotic 
conditions.  

Bagrobdella vanhovei and B. vansteenbergei are both new to science and endemic to 
Lake Tanganyika. However, the 4 species of Bagrobdella already known have been described 
in different localities: B. auchenoglanii has been described in Ghana (with it’s redescription 
done on individuals sampled in Mali and Togo), B. anthopenis in Mali, B. fraudulenta in 
Uganda and Mali (see Euzet and Le Brun 1990) and recently B. parauchenoglani in Cameroon 
(Akoumba et al. 2017). 

Except for individuals of Auchenoglanis occidentalis sampled by Euzet and Le Brun in 
Bamako (Niger River), which harbor three species of Bagrobdella (B. auchenoglanii, B. 
fraudulenta and B. anthopenis), in other localities: Lake Albert, Uganda (Paperna 1971); Kara 
River, Togo (Kritsky & Kulo 1999); Oti River (Euzet & Le Brun 1990) and Volta Lake 
(Paperna 1969), Volta Basin; Sassandra in RCI (Euzet & Le Brun 1990), and on 
Parauchenoglanis monkei in Cameroon (Akoumba et al. 2017), it seems that only one species 
is present (B. fraudulenta in Uganda, B. parauchenoglanii in Cameroon, B. auchenoglanii in 
the other localities).  

So, among the five Bagrobdella species described from A. occidentalis, three are found 
in the watershed of the Nilo-Sudanian province, when the two others new one are from the 
Tanganyika province. As a consequence, either these monogenean species are specific of their 
ichtyofaunal provinces, or we are in the presence of two different host species (the systematic 
status of A. occidentalis remain debated (see for example Geerinckx & Vreven (2013)). 

Bagrobdella vanhovei shows a high variability in its morphometrical characters (Fig. 
12), with small, medium and large measurements for similar hard parts. These differences, 
apart from a great variability of specimens from a single species, may be due to two likely 
reasons: 1) presence of different species, 2) the use of different medium to prepare the slides 
(see Fankoua et al. 2017). Knowing that we did not see morphological differences between 
“large” and “small” specimens, and that both were found together on same slides (in the same 
medium), we are most probably in the presence of a species with a great variability in the size 
of its haptoral hard parts.  

During the study of these two new species, two small hard parts that were never been 
reported before in the description of Bagrobdella species, were seen. These are: 1) a structure 
in the shape of a button between the bar and ventral anchors (Fig. 14), 2) a semi-circular 
structure toping the extremity of the ventral bar median projection (Fig. 15). In order to 
properly define their fine morphology and function, we need to observe fresh material or to use 
scanning electron microscopy. For this reason, we did not mention these structures in the 
description of the two new species.
