We derive formulas for the regularized determinant of the Laplacian and twisted Laplacian on forms over even-dimensional real projective spaces, utilizing them to explicitly compute the analytic torsion of these spaces with orthogonal and unitary representations of their fundamental group. This calculation presents the initial instance demonstrating the non-trivial nature of this torsion for cyclic complexes linked to even-dimensional non-orientable manifolds. Additionally, addressing a longstanding query left unanswered by various proofs of the Cheeger-Müller Theorem over the years, we provide a resolution specifically tailored to this category of space.
The concept of analytic torsion, introduced by Ray and Singer [19], serves as an analytic counterpart to Reidemeister torsion (refer to section 5 for a detailed discussion on this topic). The authors postulated that these torsions were equivalent for odd-dimensional orientable manifolds with orthogonal representations of the fundamental group, a result previously established for lens spaces in [18] and for even-dimensional orientable manifolds as a consequence of Theorem 2.3 in [19].
The authors in question adhered to Milnor's definition of Reidemeister torsion as outlined in section 8 of reference [12], but they expanded upon this definition by including cyclic cases, a departure from Milnor's focus solely on acyclic complexes, which are complexes with trivial homology. Additionally, both references [12] and [19] emphasized the importance of homology in the context of Reidemeister torsion. Reference [19], in particular, underscored the necessity of Poincaré duality for defining the bases utilized in homology groups within the cyclic case.
In 1978, Werner Müller [14] presented a proof for Ray-Singer's conjecture, now known as the Cheeger-Müller Theorem, focusing solely on orientable manifolds. Müller introduced a slight modification to the original problem posed by Ray and Singer by examining the Reidemeister torsion of the cohomology complex associated with a manifold instead of homology. In 1979, Cheeger [5] independently provided a proof for the same conjecture, also utilizing cohomology in his theorem proof, albeit without the necessity of orientability.
The Cheeger-Müller Theorem was investigated by Bismut and Zhang in 1992, where they also explored cohomology in the context of Reidemeister torsion, building upon prior works [5] and [14]. These scholars further expanded this theorem to encompass odd-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds with unimodular representations of the fundamental group. They developed an integral formula that elucidates the connection between the two torsions in the case of even-dimensional manifolds.
In 1993, Müller revisited the conjecture initially proposed by Ray and Singer, this time employing homology to investigate Reidemeister torsion. He demonstrated that both torsions yield identical values on odd-dimensional manifolds with a unimodular representation of the fundamental group, a scenario that does not hold true in even-dimensional cases, as illustrated on page 732 of the same text. However, Müller's approach in dealing with cyclic complexes necessitated orientability, as the description of volumes in the cyclic instance, as outlined in the first paragraph of page 729, relied on Poincaré duality. The absence of guidance on substituting this concept in a non-orientable setting remains a notable gap. The specific selection of volumes is pivotal for Theorem 2.15 and Corollary 2.16 in the same text, originally established by Ray and Singer for orthogonal representations in a previous work and later extended by Müller to the unimodular scenario. In section 3, which constitutes the crux of the proof of the Cheeger-Müller Theorem, the precise choice of volumes assumes a crucial role, particularly evident on page 745.
The Cheeger-Müller Theorem has been revisited in previous works such as [3], [4], and [10]. However, these authors also delved into the realm of cohomology while exploring Reidemeister torsion.
In this study, we demonstrate the validity of the Cheeger-Müller Theorem for even-dimensional real projective spaces as discussed in [15], by explicitly computing their analytic and Reidemeister torsions, as stated in Theorem 5.1. To compute the analytic torsion, we initially derive formulas for the regularized determinant of the Laplacian, as presented in Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.3, and subsequently utilize these formulas to determine the desired torsion, as outlined in Theorem 4.2. Our approach was influenced by [22], despite the absence of regularized determinant formulas in their work. For the computation of the Reidemeister torsion, we first establish homology bases for orientable odd-dimensional projective spaces, which serve as a reference for our specific selection in the even-dimensional scenario. It is noteworthy that the torsions for RP2m are non-trivial, in contrast to orientable even-dimensional manifolds, as indicated in Proposition 2.9 of [15]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior reference demonstrating this phenomenon for even-dimensional non-orientable manifolds with a cyclic representation of the fundamental group.
Our study is structured as follows: Section 2 establishes the notation to be used throughout the text and presents fundamental preliminary results for our determinant formulae. Key components include the decomposition of spaces of forms into SO(n + 1)-modules, Table 2, and the derivative at zero of a specific Dirichlet series, as outlined in Lemma 2.1. Section 3 focuses on establishing the formulae for regularized determinants, which will be applied in Section 4 to compute the analytic torsion of RP2m. In the final section, Section 5, we define the Reidemeister torsion of real chain complexes and explain the process of fixing bases for the homology groups of RP2m-1, following M¨uller’s methodology as referenced in [15]. Subsequently, we utilize this information to identify specific bases for calculating the Reidemeister torsion of odd-dimensional projective spaces and adapt these bases for the even-dimensional scenario to determine the Reidemeister torsion of RP2m with respect to this particular choice of bases. Given that the outcomes in Sections 4 and 5 align, we establish the validity of the Cheeger-M¨uller Theorem for RP2m within the context discussed in this text.
The initial step in formulating our regularized determinants formula involves identifying the spectrum and multiplicity of eigenvalues of the Laplacian on forms across even-dimensional real projective spaces. To accomplish this goal, we refer to a portion of the research conducted by Ikeda and Taniguchi [9].
In section 6 of their study, the authors provide a definition for the spaces of harmonic polynomial forms.
The research leading to this paper was conducted during my time as a Ph.D. student at Universidade Federal de São Carlos. I am grateful to Picme/Capes for providing a scholarship that enabled me to fully dedicate myself to the program. Special thanks are due to my course advisor, L.R. Hartmann, and to M. Spreafico for their invaluable technical support throughout the research process. It is worth noting that Hartmann and Spreafico shared a preliminary version of [8] with me, intending for me to follow their methodology and compute the analytic torsion of RP2m while Hartmann was in Germany and Spreafico was in Italy. However, due to my lack of comprehension of their approach at the time, Hartmann suggested that we publish our findings separately. I am grateful for this decision, as I am aware of Hartmann's enthusiasm for this research project, and he generously proposed that I publish it independently. Additionally, I must acknowledge that the data presented in Table 2, along with the corresponding data for n = 2m - 1 in [16], were included in their preliminary version of [8].
I would like to express my gratitude to the students of UFSCar, as well as to several professors and, most importantly, my family, for their unwavering support throughout the challenges I faced during the course.
