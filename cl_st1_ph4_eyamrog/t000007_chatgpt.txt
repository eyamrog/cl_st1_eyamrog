Pain, a subjective phenomenon, can evoke innate fear and anxiety, making pain control a crucial aspect of dental treatment, particularly for children. While pain management is typically well-handled pre and intraoperatively, challenges may arise postoperatively. Pre-emptive analgesia administration emerges as a potential method for managing postoperative pain. This systematic review seeks to assess the efficacy and safety of pre-emptive analgesia in primary tooth extractions for children.
Methods: PubMed, Ovid SP, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched for relevant papers published between 1980 and July 2020 using specific MeSH terms and predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, with two reviewers independently conducting the screening process. The focus was on studies comparing preemptive analgesic administration with placebo for primary tooth extractions in children. The outcomes of interest included self-reported post-operative pain (patient-perceived pain) and the total number of rescue analgesics consumed during the post-operative follow-up period.
Results: The final evaluation incorporated a total of six studies. The majority of these studies indicated lower self-reported post-operative pain scores (n=3) and reduced rescue analgesic consumption (n=3) in the pre-emptive group when compared to the placebo group.
Conclusions: The administration of pre-emptive analgesics may potentially yield positive effects on the aforementioned parameters during primary tooth extraction in children. However, further evidence is required to substantiate this claim and justify its widespread application.
Pain, fear, and anxiety are three dimensions that can significantly impact a child's behavior during dental procedures. Pain, in particular, can trigger innate feelings of fear and anxiety, making effective pain management a crucial aspect of any dental treatment, especially for children. It is essential to address pain control both before, during, and after the procedure. Even if the dentist successfully manages pain before and during the procedure, the occurrence of acute post-operative pain that does not respond well to analgesics can negatively affect the child's cooperation in future appointments. To prevent such episodes, various methods are being explored, including the administration of local anesthesia, preemptive analgesic administration, minimally invasive procedures to reduce tissue damage and inflammation, and the proactive administration of preventive analgesics.
The concept of pre-emptive administration of analgesics is a widely studied topic in the fields of medicine and dentistry. Pre-emptive analgesia involves administering analgesic agents before the start of a surgical procedure. It is believed that by initiating analgesic interventions prior to surgery, it can help reduce intraoperative and post-operative nociception to the central nervous system, offering greater benefits compared to administering the same analgesic post-operatively. Studies by Woolf have already validated the impact of surgical injury on peripheral and central sensitization of pain responses. It is hypothesized that peripheral and central sensitization can lead to allodynia and hyperalgesia, which may be alleviated through the administration of pre-emptive analgesia.
Pre-emptive analgesic administration in children undergoing general pediatric surgery, specifically tonsillectomy and orthopaedic surgeries, has yielded conflicting results, with some studies reporting positive outcomes (2, 3) while others have shown negative results (4-6). In the realm of dentistry, systematic reviews primarily focused on adults have demonstrated promising results for pre-emptive analgesic administration, particularly in procedures like third molar extractions (7, 8).
To date, no systematic review has assessed the effectiveness of pre-emptive analgesic administration in dental procedures for children. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the efficacy and safety of pre-emptively administered analgesics for primary tooth extractions in pediatric patients.
Protocol: This study, registered in the Prospero database under CRD42020206878, adhered to PRISMA guidelines for reporting. The search strategy was conducted utilizing the Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) framework, focusing on the question "Efficacy and safety of pre-emptive analgesic agents for primary/deciduous tooth extractions in children." The PICO search strategy for this systematic review included: [P] population: children; [I] intervention: pre-emptively administered analgesics; [C] comparison: no administration or preventive analgesic administration of placebo or any other active agent (analgesics administered post-operatively); [O] outcome of interest: post-operative pain, analgesic consumption, and any potential adverse effects.
An electronic search was conducted across three databases, namely PubMed, Ovid SP, and Cochrane, covering publication years from 1980 to 2020. The final search was executed on July 1, 2020, with a specific inclusion criterion for articles published in English. The search strategy was structured around a predefined question utilizing relevant MeSH terms. In PubMed, a comprehensive search was performed using a combination of MeSH terms such as (((((pre-emptive) OR (preoperative)) OR (pre-operative)) OR (children)) AND (dental). Similarly, searches were conducted for pre-emptive, children, and dental topics in Ovid SP and Cochrane.
Eligibility criteria: This study included randomized clinical trials that assessed pre-emptive analgesia for primary tooth extraction compared to post-operative analgesic administration (preventive analgesia). Non-randomized trials, comparative studies, short communications, technical notes, opinions, case reports, narrative reviews, systematic reviews, and articles not published in English were excluded. Studies identified through a comprehensive MeSH terms search were imported into the citation software Zotero (www.zotero.org) from all databases. Duplicates were removed, followed by a screening of titles and abstracts. Relevant articles were selected for a full-text review. Data analysis, segregation, and recording were conducted by two independent authors. The outcomes assessed included post-operative pain or discomfort, side effects, etc.
Data synthesis involved the qualitative analysis of the chosen studies.
Risk of bias (RoB) assessment: The methodological quality assessment of the included articles was independently conducted by two review team members using the Cochrane Collaboration's criteria. Risk of bias was evaluated for all seven parameters, including random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data, selective reporting of outcomes, and other potential sources of bias.
In total, 858 records were identified across all databases, with 6 duplicates subsequently removed. Following this, 852 records underwent screening based on their titles and abstracts. The full texts of 17 potentially relevant papers were then assessed, leading to the exclusion of 11 studies (9-19). The reasons for exclusion are detailed in Table-1. Consequently, six studies met the criteria for inclusion in this final systematic review (20-25). A visual representation of the search process can be found in Figure-1.
Characteristics of the included studies are detailed in Table-2. The six studies encompassed in this analysis were published between 1995 and 2020, with all but one adhering to a randomized design. The exception, the study by Oâ€™Donnell et al. in 1995, deviated from randomization due to its multi-center trial nature, where each center followed a specific drug protocol. Risk of bias was assessed in accordance with Cochrane guidelines, as depicted in Figure-2. Randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, as well as blinding of outcome evaluation, were explicitly addressed in five studies (20-23, 25), while clarity on these aspects was lacking in the study by O'Donnell et al. in 2005 (24). Attrition bias and selective reporting bias were not documented in any of the studies. The presence of other bias, specifically unequal distribution of study participants, was solely noted in the study by Kharouba et al. in 2019 (21).
Among the six studies included in the final review, four adhered to a double-blind design (21-23, 25), while the study conducted by Santos et al. in 2020 followed a triple-blind design (20). Notably, blinding procedures were not implemented in the study by O'Donnell et al. in 1995 (24). The age range of the children in the included studies spanned from 2 to 12 years. This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of preemptive analgesic agents for primary/deciduous tooth extractions in children. The majority of the studies (n=5) focused solely on primary tooth extractions (20, 21, 23-25), with the exception of the study by Kharouba et al. in 2017, which mentioned additional rehabilitation procedures such as restorations, stainless steel crowns, and space maintainer placement. This particular study was included under the assumption that extractions were carried out under general anesthesia before the placement of space maintainers (22). Primary tooth extractions were conducted under local anesthesia in the studies by Santos et al. in 2020, Baygin et al. in 2011, and Primosch et al. in 1995 (20, 23, 25), under local anesthesia and conscious sedation in the study by Kharouba et al. in 2018 (21), and under general anesthesia in the studies by Kharouba et al. in 2017 and O'Donnell et al. in 2007 (22, 24).
Pre-emptive drugs were consistently utilized in the six studies examined, with paracetamol and ibuprofen serving as the primary analgesic medications and being compared against a placebo. In the study conducted by O'Donnell et al. (2007), Diclofenac sodium was employed as a pre-emptive analgesic for children, contrasting its effects with those of paracetamol. The route of administration varied across the studies: oral administration was employed in the investigations by Santos et al. (2020), Kharouba et al. (2018), Baygin et al. (2011), O'Donnell et al. (2007), and Primosch et al. (1995), while intravenous administration was utilized in the study by Kharouba et al. (2007), and rectal administration was observed in the study by O'Donnell et al. (2007). The protocol for pre-emptive analgesic administration also exhibited diversity: paracetamol and ibuprofen were orally administered fifteen minutes prior in the studies by Primosch et al. (1995) and Kharouba et al. (2017), thirty minutes before the procedure in the investigations by O'Donnell et al. (2007), and up to one hour before the surgical procedure in the study by Santos et al. (2020). The timing of administration was not specified in the studies by Kharouba et al. (2018) and Baygin et al. (2011). Regarding follow-up duration, it was not indicated in the study by O'Donnell et al. (2007), while a 7-hour post-operative follow-up was conducted in the study by Primosch et al. (1995), and a 24-hour follow-up post-operatively was carried out in the remaining four studies (n=4).
The behavior of children during medical procedures was assessed in studies conducted by Santos et al. (2020) and Kharouba et al. (2018). Santos et al. (2020) utilized the Venham Behavior Rating Scale to evaluate children's behavior during treatment, while Kharouba et al. (2018) employed the Taddio Behavior Scale for the same purpose.
Post-operative pain was assessed in five studies (n=5) (20-24). Primosch et al. (1995) did not provide a quantitative measure of self-reported pain by the child; instead, they noted the presence or absence of pain (25). Various scales were utilized to quantify self-reported pain by children in the different studies: the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was employed by Santos et al. (2020) (20), the Visual Analog Scale Of Faces (VASOF) was used by Kharouba et al. (2017) (22), the Wong Baker Faces Pain Scale (WB-FPS) was utilized in the studies by Kharouba et al. (2018) and O'Donnell et al. (2007) (21, 24), and the Five Point Face Scale was employed by Baygin et al. (2011) (23).
Out of the five studies assessing self-reported postoperative pain following extraction, three studies indicated significantly lower pain scores within the 24-hour postoperative period compared to the placebo group (22-24). Conversely, two studies found no significant difference between the preemptive analgesia group and the placebo group (20, 21). The variability in outcomes could be attributed to methodological disparities among the studies, as well as the challenges associated with accurately reporting pain in children. Additionally, factors such as the condition of primary teeth prior to extraction and the number of primary teeth being extracted may also impact a child's pain experience. Notably, only the study conducted by Santos et al. in 2020 utilized a multiple regression model for pain analysis, while other studies did not employ this approach, potentially leading to variations in the quality of the results obtained.
Rescue analgesic medication: The mean consumption of rescue analgesics was assessed in four studies (20-22, 25). The majority of these studies indicated a significantly lower mean consumption of rescue analgesics in the pre-emptive analgesic group compared to the placebo group during the 24-hour postoperative period (20-22). However, the study conducted by Primosch et al. in 1995 did not observe any significant difference between the pre-emptive analgesic group and the placebo group during the initial seven hours postoperatively. This discrepancy could be attributed to the shorter postoperative follow-up period of 7 hours compared to the 24-hour period in other studies. Additionally, a flaw in the pre-emptive analgesic administration was noted: the drugs were administered based on age rather than weight, and they were given orally only 15 minutes before the extraction. Ideally, pre-emptive administration should aim to achieve peak plasma levels of the analgesic just before surgery, necessitating oral administration 30 minutes to one hour prior to the procedure. Regarding side effects of pre-emptive analgesic drugs, no major adverse effects were reported in any of the included studies. Minor side effects such as postoperative bleeding (which resolved spontaneously), vomiting, headache, swelling, and fever were reported (20-23).
Limitations of this review include the following: Firstly, the scope of the study was limited to a specific time frame and geographical area, potentially restricting the generalizability of the findings. Secondly, the reliance on secondary sources may have introduced bias or inaccuracies into the analysis. Additionally, the lack of access to certain primary data sources may have limited the depth of the review. Finally, the methodology employed in this review may not have accounted for all relevant variables or potential confounding factors, impacting the overall robustness of the conclusions drawn.
Most of the studies encompassed children aged 2 to 12 years; however, younger children, particularly those under 4 years old, often struggle to effectively articulate their pain experiences, rendering self-reported pain scores less dependable, particularly within this age cohort.
The condition and status of the primary tooth, including whether it is symptomatic or asymptomatic, mobile or firm, resorbed or partially resorbed or un-resorbed, and the presence or absence of pus before extraction, as well as the type of primary tooth (whether it is a primary incisor or primary molar), can significantly impact pain-related behavior. Surprisingly, these factors were not addressed in the studies included in the analysis.
The behavioral and anxiety traits exhibited by both the child and the parent have the potential to impact the child's reported pain levels. However, it is important to note that these factors were not standardized across the studies included in the analysis.
Differences in alertness may vary between children who have undergone extractions under general anesthesia compared to those who have had extractions under local anesthesia, potentially influencing their pain reporting.
Future research directions in this area necessitate well-designed randomized trials, a current deficiency in the field. To enhance the quality of studies, it is imperative to standardize and match the type, state, and stage of primary teeth to be extracted, establish a protocol for pre-emptive drug administration, compare different administration routes (oral versus IV), evaluate the safety and efficacy of various drugs for children, and consider factors such as age and anxiety levels. Conducting comparative analyses between pre-emptive and preventive analgesic administration via different routes (oral, IV) and exploring the distinctions between pre-emptive and preventive strategies in the pediatric population are crucial research avenues that warrant further investigation.
Based on the preceding discussion, it can be inferred that preemptive analgesic administration may yield a favorable impact on post-operative pain alleviation and could potentially decrease the average intake of rescue analgesic medication following primary tooth extraction in children. However, the existing evidence supporting this assertion is notably limited. To substantiate these findings, a greater number of meticulously planned and implemented randomized controlled trials are imperative.
