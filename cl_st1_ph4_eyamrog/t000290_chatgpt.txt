In recent decades, 3D printing has emerged as a promising paradigm for manufacturing, even garnering attention in the civil construction industry from companies and researchers worldwide. However, the properties of materials used in additive manufacturing remain understudied. A key challenge lies in balancing high bearing capacity without the need for confining measures, while also maintaining fluidity for an adequate duration to prevent cold joints between layers. Viscosity enhancing admixtures (VEAs) offer a potential solution by promoting flocculation, increasing viscosity and yield strength, thereby reducing deposition time between layers and minimizing cold joint formation. This study assessed the rheological parameters of four VEAs, revealing their potential to enhance cohesion and buildability of 3D-printed concretes. Results indicated that the effectiveness of these admixtures varied based on type and quantity, with bentonite clay outperforming other polymeric VEAs by exhibiting structuration rates up to 62% higher than the reference mixture.
The technology of additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, originated in the 1980s primarily for prototyping purposes. Over the past two decades, there has been a notable surge in interest regarding the additive fabrication of large-scale components for civil construction. This technique offers the potential to streamline timelines, lower expenses, enhance project flexibility, minimize waste production, and construct structures without the need for formwork or falsework.
In the additive manufacturing process using concrete, a persistent challenge lies in ensuring that the layers are tightly attached to one another. If the layers overlap too rapidly, they may lack the necessary strength to withstand deformations induced by their own weight. Conversely, if the ideal waiting period between depositions is surpassed, there is a risk of diminished interlayer adhesion and the formation of cold joints, ultimately undermining the structural integrity and mechanical performance of the final product [3, 6].
The stability of the printed structure relies on two key factors: the vertical stress exerted on the previously deposited layers and the material's yield strength. These factors are time-dependent, with the former being influenced by the construction rate, which denotes the pace at which each new layer is added after the preceding one, and the latter being associated with the concrete's structural integrity when at rest [3, 6].
In recent years, 3D printing systems have been effectively utilized in constructing structural elements and architectural components, employing various cementitious compositions. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of consensus within the technical-scientific community regarding the formulation of cementitious mixtures suitable for additive manufacturing. Key areas of investigation in this field include properties in the fresh state of the material, particularly focusing on extrudability and buildability.
Extrudability pertains to the material's capacity to flow continuously through the tubes and nozzles in the print head, gauged by the distance concrete can be printed without nozzle blockages, cracks, or separations. Buildability, on the other hand, refers to the material's ability to uphold the extruded shape under its weight and upper layer stresses, quantified by the maximum number of printed layers before collapse [2, 4, 6]. The preservation of desired properties can be achieved through chemical admixtures that adjust the mixture's workability. It is crucial for the material to be adequately fluid for extrusion while maintaining enough firmness for structural stability. Consequently, the impact of various admixtures on such materials has been the focus of numerous recent studies [4, 8].
The duration of rest between the application of consecutive layers in casting significantly influences the microstructure formation of cementitious materials. This temporal interval is primarily governed by two key factors: (a) a reversible physical mechanism stemming from colloidal particle flocculation, and (b) an irreversible chemical process driven by hydration reactions within the cement paste. These phenomena, as documented in previous studies [9, 10, 11], contribute to enhancing the material's yield strength while concurrently reducing its workability over the resting period [12, 13, 14, 15].
In this context, the yield strength refers to the capacity of the cementitious material to endure the stresses arising from the attractive interparticular forces between cement and the other particles in the mixture. Consequently, in order to guarantee the stability of the printed structure, it is imperative that the fresh concrete yield strength progressively rises over the resting period and surpasses the applied stresses [9].
The evolution of yield strength of materials over resting time during the flocculation period of cementitious matrices follows a linear regimen known as the structuration rate (Athix). This rate can be estimated using the equation from [13]: Athix = (τ0(t) - τ00) / t, where Athix represents the structuration rate in Pa/s, τ0(t) is the yield strength after a certain time in Pa, τ00 is the initial yield strength in Pa, and t is the elapsed time in seconds.
One method of managing the rheological characteristics of cementitious matrices involves the incorporation of viscosity enhancing admixtures (VEAs), typically utilized in concretes to mitigate segregation and exudation risks [16, 17, 18]. By augmenting the viscosity and yield strength of the mixtures, these admixtures have the potential to be employed in printable concretes as well [7].
Various types of VEAs exist, including mineral compounds like silica fumes and nanoclays, natural polymers such as xanthan gum and agar, and synthetic or semi-synthetic polymers like polyacrylates and polyvinyls ether derivatives. The actuation mechanism of these additives can also vary. The extent of viscosity increase is influenced by factors such as the type and concentration of the admixture, its adsorption capacity by the cement particles, anionicity, molecular weight, and the shear rate applied to the concrete. According to sources, the main polymeric VEAs operate through different modes of action.
Adsorption refers to the phenomenon where long-chain polymer molecules bind to water molecules, thereby immobilizing a portion of the water and causing an expansion in the volume. This process leads to an increase in the viscosity of the liquid medium within the mixture.
Association: Polymer molecules exhibit intermolecular attractive forces that lead to their aggregation, hindering the free movement of water within the mixture. This phenomenon ultimately facilitates gel formation, resulting in a notable rise in viscosity.
Intertwining: At elevated concentrations, polymeric molecules have the propensity to intertwine and entangle, thereby augmenting the viscosity of the system in which they are contained. This phenomenon can be mitigated at sufficiently high shear rates as the polymer chains align themselves in the direction of flow, resulting in a characteristic behavior termed pseudoplasticity.
The incorporation of these admixtures has the potential to enhance the yield strength of concrete, thereby potentially enhancing the structural integrity of mixtures designed for 3D printing. However, due to the diverse range of types and operational methods, particularly concerning polymeric VEAs, it is crucial to assess the different commercially accessible products.
Mineral compounds, specifically in the form of fine powders, are widely utilized as viscosity enhancing admixtures in concrete. Nanoclays, particularly bentonite clays, although not as commonly employed, have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive characteristics. These include the ability to generate thixotropic gels and expand up to 20 times their initial volume upon contact with water.
Due to the high concentration of adsorbed cations on the clay particle surface, dispersion in a liquid triggers a diffusion phenomenon aimed at equalizing the concentration throughout the fluid. The ease with which this occurs is contingent upon the electromagnetic field surrounding the particle's surface and the unique ion-surface interactions specific to each exchangeable cation. The interplay of these opposing forces gives rise to the diffuse double layer phenomenon [22, 23]. Montmorillonite particles are characterized by their extremely small, flat, and floc-shaped structure, measuring 1nm in thickness by 220nm in length, with dual charges on their surfaces. The particle's face bears a negatively charged surface due to isomorphic replacements internally with cations on the crystal lattice. Conversely, the particle's edges exhibit a pH-dependent surface resulting from the protonation and deprotonation of OH- groups, transitioning from positive to negative as the solution's pH shifts [24, 25].
Figure 1 illustrates the behavior of clays upon dispersion in a fluid. Under forced flow conditions, the particles exhibit a tendency to align themselves in accordance with the direction of the flow. Upon cessation of the flow, the particles undergo rearrangement due to the attraction between the negatively charged faces and the positively charged extremities. This interaction leads to the formation of a three-dimensional structure within the fluid, as outlined in previous research [26].
The distinctive formation of thixotropic gels in these materials is a result of a combination of factors. The electro-viscous effect, occurring under low ionic forces due to the well-established diffuse double layer, plays a significant role. This effect is further sustained by the immobilization of particles on the three-dimensional network that is formed. Additionally, particles with charges opposite to those of the clay minerals, such as the oxides found in iron and aluminum hydroxides, contribute to the thixotropic behavior of the solutions by creating connection points between them. These mechanisms, as outlined in previous studies [21, 25], collectively contribute to the unique thixotropic properties observed in these materials.
When bentonite clays and cement interact, they can influence the properties of the mixture through three main mechanisms. Firstly, the substantial rise in pH levels (approximately 12-13 due to the cement) can trigger the formation of thixotropic gels by altering the charges at the ends of the bentonite particles. Secondly, the supersaturation of Ca2+ ions can either enhance or hinder cation exchange, depending on the nature of the bentonite, while also leading to increased water retention between the layers of particles. This compression of the double diffuse layer due to the high ion concentration can result in heightened flocculation, alongside a notable presence of K+ ions. Collectively, these factors contribute to water retention and a significant increase in the viscosity of the mixture [27].
In this study, we investigate the impact of various viscosity-enhancing admixtures on the extrudability of concrete and their role in determining the material's yield strength over time. The goal is to enhance the structuration rate (Athix) of the materials, thereby improving the buildability of printable mixtures.
In this study, nine distinct mixtures were generated as outlined in Table 1: one reference mixture devoid of any VEA content, and eight other mixtures incorporating four different types of VEA in varying quantities (comprising three polymeric commercial VEAs and one variant of bentonite clay). All mixtures were formulated using Portland cement with pozzolanic addition, categorized as CP-IV in accordance with ABNT NBR 5736/1991. The chemical composition of the powder materials utilized is detailed in Table 2. The granulometric distribution of the dry materials was assessed using a Microtrac S3500 laser granulometer, with the results depicted in Figure 2.
All mixtures were prepared utilizing a polycarboxylate-based high-range water reducer admixture (HRWR). In addition to bentonite clay, three commercial viscosity-enhancing admixtures, identified as VEA1, VEA2, and VEA3, were examined. The main characteristics of these admixtures are detailed in Table 3.
To achieve a reference mix that aligns with the necessary extrudability standards, several batches underwent testing following the methodology outlined by [29]. This involved extruding concrete filaments ranging from 1 to 2cm in width and extending to a minimum length of 30cm. The material's ability to maintain cohesion and form during extrusion determined its extrudability, as depicted in Figure 3a. The printing procedure for a specific sample is illustrated in Figure 3b.
The standardized mixing protocol remained consistent across all mixtures: initially, the dry components were manually blended before mechanical mixing commenced. Subsequently, within the first minute of mixing, these components were incrementally introduced to the pre-diluted high-range water-reducing admixture (HRWR) in the mixing water. Following this step, the materials underwent mixing for an additional 5 minutes, followed by a brief 1-minute pause to incorporate viscosity promoters, if necessary, before concluding with a final 2 minutes of mixing. The mixing speed was set at a constant 25rpm using a Tedemix ML-03 mixer, featuring an Ø80mm cowls disc.
Following the completion of sample preparation, the mixes underwent rheological tests to assess the impact of viscosity-enhancing admixtures on the materials' yield strength over time and structuration rate.
Yield strength measurements were conducted for all mixtures at 10, 45, and 90 minutes following the introduction of cement to the water. Rheological assessments were carried out using a Thermo Scientific HAAKE MARS III rheometer equipped with Vane geometry.
The rotor was immersed in the mixes immediately after the mixing procedure was completed and allowed to rest until the specified measurement times were achieved. A fresh batch was prepared for each measurement taken. The tests were conducted at a consistent shear rate with an angular velocity of 0.25rpm. Results were derived from the average value of a set of data points at each designated resting time and graphed to illustrate the relationship between yield strength and time.
Following the rheological tests, the consistency index was determined in accordance with ABNT NBR 13276/2016 [30] at the specified resting intervals of 10, 45, and 90 minutes to assess the gradual decrease in fluidity of the materials over time. The procedure involved placing the material in the test container and allowing it to rest until the designated time intervals were achieved for analysis.
The reaction kinetics of the mixtures were assessed using an isothermal calorimeter model TAM AIR (TA Instruments) with eight channels, maintaining a controlled temperature of 23ºC for a duration of 60 hours. Additionally, measurements were conducted to determine the specific weight in the fresh state and the compressive strength at 28 days, following the guidelines outlined in ABNT NBR 13278/2005 [31] and ABNT NBR 7215/1997 [32], respectively.
Figure 4 illustrates the yield strength acquired for all mixtures with resting periods of 10, 45, and 90 minutes. The observed rise in values over time primarily stems from the flocculation processes arising from the interaction of colloidal particles within the mixtures. This phenomenon is further supported by the results of calorimetry tests, as detailed in section 3.3, and the presence of calcium silicate hydrates at the contact points between cement particles, a common occurrence in cementitious materials [9, 14].
In relation to the blends containing polymeric VEAs, it can be asserted that these mixtures exhibit unique characteristics.
VEA1 and VEA2 did not exhibit an increase in yield strength compared to the reference mixture across all measured resting times.
In the mixture containing VEA3, there was no significant variation observed compared to the reference mixture for up to 45 minutes, with a slight increase noted at the 90-minute mark.
This behavior may appear contradictory to expectations, as the inclusion of viscosity-enhancing admixtures should theoretically elevate the viscosity and yield strength of the mixtures. However, the effectiveness of these admixtures is influenced by both the applied shear rate and the water-to-cement ratio. Concerning the former, the incorporation of polymeric VEAs occurred without adjusting the water content of the solution, with their solid content at approximately 10%. Consequently, mixtures containing VEA1, VEA2, and VEA3 exhibited a slightly higher water-to-cement ratio compared to the reference mixture, potentially resulting in reduced viscosity and decreased yield strength. This indicates that the anticipated formation of a three-dimensional polymeric structure due to the presence of these VEAs was insufficient to enhance the yield strength under the specific shear rate and water-to-cement ratio conditions.
It is important to acknowledge that the suitability of polymeric VEAs for enhancing the yield strength of printable concretes can vary depending on the shear rates experienced in different applications. Additionally, the water content of the polymeric solution can be adjusted within the mixture if necessary. In terms of chemical composition, there is a wide range of commercially available polymeric VEAs, each with distinct mechanisms of action as previously outlined in this paper (refer to section 1.3). This diversity implies that certain VEAs may be more appropriate for specific applications than others.
In contrast to the mixes utilizing VEAs, those incorporating bentonite in their composition, at both lower (0.3%) and higher (0.6%) percentages, exhibited an increase in yield strength compared to the reference mixture across all measured resting times. The enhancement was particularly pronounced, reaching up to a 70% increase for longer periods (90 minutes of rest). It is important to note that the addition of bentonite clay raises the solid/liquid ratio of the mixture, thereby enhancing its viscosity and yield strength. This behavior is not solely attributed to the fine nature and high surface area of bentonite clay but also to its tendency to form a thixotropic gel when dispersed in a liquid phase, thereby altering the rheological response of the mixture, as observed in prior studies. The findings of this study confirm the formation of a three-dimensional network facilitated by the presence of bentonite, even within a cement-based matrix. This discovery holds significant value for 3D printing with concrete, as it greatly improves buildability.
Table 4 displays the structuration rate values (Athix) of the examined mixes. It is evident that the inclusion of VEA1 and VEA2 did not enhance the Athix value, leading to a decrease of up to 32.6% from the original value (REF). Conversely, mixes containing VEA 3 and bentonite clay exhibited structuration rates up to 61.23% higher than the REF mix. A prior investigation [34] on VEA in cement pastes tested three different dosages of the admixture, revealing that higher VEA amounts enhance both the material's yield strength and structuration rate. The Athix values obtained in that study were slightly lower than those reported here, primarily due to the study's focus not being on printability and the presence of aggregates enhancing material robustness, resulting in increased yield strength. Improved structuration rates are crucial for 3D printing applications, as rapid structuration post-layer casting is essential to prevent cold joints. The speed at which the mixture structurates during rest must be maximized to facilitate printing subsequent layers, varying based on the printer used. While there isn't a specific target value, higher Athix values are generally preferred. Another recent study [35] confirmed the efficacy of clays in enhancing structuration rates, referred to as material robustness, compared to mixes with silica fume and viscosity modifying admixtures. In cases where clays led to significantly higher yield strength, superplasticizer was employed to achieve comparable properties for printability. Nonetheless, as per [12], all produced mixes exhibited high thixotropy, with the BENT 0.6% mix displaying the highest thixotropic behavior and VEA 1.2% the lowest.
Figure 5 illustrates the heat flow released by the mixtures over time, indicating that the induction periods, as determined by the slope of the curves during the acceleration period, and the maximum heat release peaks exhibit similar behaviors across all mixtures. It is apparent that the various types and quantities of viscosity modifiers employed did not result in significant changes in heat flow within the initial hour. This suggests that these modifiers neither accelerated nor retarded the hydration process of the mixtures during this period. Consequently, any potential alterations in structuration rates, as determined by rheometry tests, were not attributed to modifications in the cement hydration process.
Figure 6 illustrates a consistent decrease in the consistency index across all mixes over time (at 10 minutes, 45 minutes, and 90 minutes of resting time), as anticipated. This decline can be attributed to particle rearrangement, the impact of viscosity modifiers, or the influence of hydration products from the cement, albeit to a minimal extent. The findings indicate that VEA mixes initially exhibited enhanced flowability, likely due to alterations in the water/cement ratio stemming from the water content in the VEAs. However, this improvement was not sustained for longer resting periods (90 minutes), with all mixes displaying increased consistency compared to the REF mix. Prior research on printable concretes has suggested that incorporating VEAs should lead to reduced fluidity in the fresh state and a gradual increase in consistency over time, aligning with the current observations. The REF mix experienced a 14% decrease in the consistency index from 10 to 90 minutes, while VEAs and bentonites demonstrated reductions of up to 38% and 40%, respectively. Notably, the percentage changes within the same materials did not exhibit significant variations across the mixes. These results highlight that incorporating various VEAs rendered the mixtures less prone to deformation over time, a valuable trait for additive manufacturing applications.
The mass density and entrained air values were measured for the fresh state of the mixes, with Table 4 displaying these results. It is evident that most values closely resembled those of the REF mix, except for mixes VEA1 at both levels, which exhibited a notable decrease in mass density due to a high percentage of air entrapment. For VEA1 mixes, the entrained air values were up to 40% higher than those of the REF mix, while mixes BENT displayed similar or slightly lower values compared to REF. Typically, the action of VEAs does not always lead to an increase in air entrainment in cementitious mixtures, although it can occasionally occur as a secondary effect depending on the type of VEA used, such as methylcellulose viscosity modifiers. In this scenario, the air entrainment could explain the inferior performance of VEA1 mixes in terms of yield strength, structuration rate, and compressive strength when compared to REF. While some air incorporation can benefit the flowability of the mixture in 3D printing, it is crucial that it does not compromise its mechanical performance. Notably, mixtures with higher levels of entrained air (VEA1 0.6 and VEA1 1.2) exhibited poorer results in the yield strength assessment.
Figure 7 illustrates the compressive strength results obtained from the 28-day test. The statistical analysis was conducted using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Fisher variation test. With the exception of mix VEA1, all other mixes demonstrated statistically similar values to the REF mix, which stood at 37.7MPa. Mix VEA1 1.2 exhibited the lowest result, being 21% lower than the REF mix, registering only 29.6MPa, potentially attributed to increased air incorporation. The compressive strength of a concrete mixture for 3D printing is contingent upon its intended application, thus lacking a specific target range. In this study, the primary objective was to assess whether the inclusion of VEAs would compromise mechanical performance, a concern that was largely unfounded across the majority of the mixtures.
In this study, viscosity-enhancing admixtures were employed to enhance the structuration rate of the materials and improve buildability by boosting the yield strength of the mixes. The consistency index test revealed that the modifiers effectively increased the cohesion of the mixture. Interestingly, bentonite exhibited a more pronounced effect in enhancing cohesion in both trials compared to polymeric VEAs.
It is crucial to emphasize that the findings clearly demonstrate the absence of a direct numerical correlation between the consistency index and rheometry results. This is due to the fact that a similar range of consistency values can encompass different flow voltages.
The enhanced cohesion and yield strength, predominantly exhibited by BENT mixtures, may be attributed to an expedited formation of cement hydration products. Nevertheless, the calorimetry test indicates that all measurements were conducted during the mixes' dormant phase, suggesting that the primary influence stemmed from the physical flocculation phenomenon through internal particle arrangement, irrespective of the modifier employed. The inclusion of Bentonite clays in the mixtures also implicates the thixotropic effect as a contributing factor to the structural response.
In terms of the quantities of tested VEAs, it was observed that the higher availability of the product in the mixture did not lead to an increase in cohesion and yield strength gain, with the exception of bentonites, where a higher content did result in improved buildability. Several factors could contribute to this phenomenon, including the saturation of VEAs in the mixture, differences in adsorption with cement particles, the anionicity of the VEAs, their molecular weight, potential changes in the water/cement ratio (as liquid admixtures were added without adjusting the water content of the mixture), and an increase in entrained air within the mixture, as seen with VEA1 0.6 and VEA1 1.2.
Moreover, the inclusion of viscosity modifiers did not alter the compressive strength results of the mixtures, with the exception of VEA1. The elevated air content present in VEA1, as validated by the fresh mass density examination, accounts for the decrease in compressive strength and the inferior performance of the product in comparison to VEA2 and VEA3 across all other tests.
The yield strength and structuration rate values were found to be higher in bentonite mixtures compared to the other mixtures examined. Calorimetry testing further confirms that the enhanced stiffness of the cementitious matrix resulting from the presence of clay is not solely due to increased formation of cement hydration products. Instead, the structuration phenomenon is linked to internal arrangement, particularly the development of a thixotropic gel, a three-dimensional network, retention of free water, and the ionic attraction of particles associated with this material.
The findings suggest that incorporating viscosity modifiers can enhance the load-bearing capacity of concrete intended for 3D printing by improving cohesion. It is important to acknowledge that not all types of viscosity-enhancing admixtures (VEAs) may yield the same results, with bentonites emerging as the most effective option, exhibiting superior performance compared to other modifiers.
The study aimed to investigate the impact of three commercial viscosity-enhancing admixtures and bentonite clay on the structuration rate of 3D printable concretes. The findings of the study lead to the conclusion that...
Volumetric Expansion Agents (VEAs) demonstrate promise in enhancing the cohesion and constructability of concrete materials intended for 3D printing.
It proved challenging to establish a direct correlation between the rate of structuration, the cohesion of the mixture, and its buildability.
The inclusion of bentonite clay in concrete for 3D printing, when carefully controlled, does not have a detrimental effect on the compressive strength values.
