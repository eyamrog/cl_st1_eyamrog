The ongoing global pandemic, triggered by the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), stands as one of the most significant health crises in recent world history, profoundly affecting not only the economy but also public health and mental well-being across society. São Paulo has emerged as the epicenter of the epidemic within Brazil. In this critical scenario, Brazilian university hospitals, renowned as hubs for professional development, expertise, and research, play a pivotal role in the collective efforts to combat and mitigate the impact of this epidemic.
Coronaviruses, part of a vast virus family, have been recognized for six decades as culprits behind respiratory infections in both humans and animals. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged as the cause of a flu-like illness with severe pulmonary complications, now known as COVID-19. The exact origin of this virus remains uncertain, but it is likely linked to a mutation in a coronavirus that typically infects bats, allowing it to breach the genetic barrier and adapt to a new host species. The initial point of transmission was traced back to a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China, where the first cases were identified among individuals who had visited the market. Subsequently, the virus spread rapidly among family members and then to neighboring provinces, eventually reaching multiple countries across all continents in a rapid and exponential manner.
The virus is highly contagious through droplets and contact, with estimates suggesting that an infected individual can transmit the virus to two to four people. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), located in the lower respiratory tract of humans, has been identified as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, playing a crucial role in the pathogenesis and transmission of the virus. The S-glycoprotein present on the surface of the coronavirus has the ability to bind to the ACE2 receptor on cell surfaces, particularly in lung cells abundant in ACE2 receptors. Upon entry, the viral genome's ribonucleic acid (RNA) is released within the cell, initiating the synthesis of structural and accessory proteins, leading to the production of new viruses. This process triggers the release of cytokines, causing a robust inflammatory response that can result in respiratory failure, shock, and thromboembolic events associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Children may exhibit milder and oligosymptomatic clinical presentations possibly due to lower maturity and binding ability of ACE2 in comparison to adults. This poses a significant concern from an epidemiological standpoint as children could potentially serve as crucial reservoirs, thereby contributing to the spread of infections.
The average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is five days, with a range of two to 14 days. The majority of adults or children infected with the virus exhibit flu-like symptoms (90%) with mild severity. However, certain individuals, particularly older adults and those with underlying health conditions like cardiovascular or lung diseases, diabetes, and hypertension, may develop severe complications such as respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and even death. The fatality rate ranges from 2 to 5%. While children can contract the infection, they generally have a favorable prognosis and seldom experience complications.
No country was adequately prepared to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had significant adverse effects on the economy, healthcare systems, and mental well-being of entire societies. Brazil, specifically São Paulo, declared a state of emergency and has implemented appropriate preventive measures in alignment with the prevailing epidemiological conditions.
Stringent adherence to social distancing protocols is imperative, alongside educational initiatives promoting proper hygiene practices and mask usage. Continuous assessment of these distancing measures is essential to prevent premature relaxation, which could trigger a resurgence of infections before community transmission ends, leading to a spike in cases. The temporary halt of academic calendars, encompassing institutions like medical schools, necessitates a reevaluation of college entrance exams and medical residency assessments, with far-reaching consequences.
The primary challenges faced by hospitals, particularly university hospitals, include the need to reorganize care delivery, expand the capacity of intensive care units, ensure the availability of personal protective equipment, notably masks and gowns that are currently scarce, and secure an adequate supply of diagnostic tests. The increasing number of healthcare professionals falling ill and being unable to work poses a significant risk of overwhelming hospital services, as evidenced in countries like Italy and Spain. Vital research support is crucial for developing effective medications, currently in the clinical trial phase, and a potential vaccine, likely to be accessible only post-2021, following the conclusion of the ongoing pandemic.
As healthcare professionals, it is imperative that we brace ourselves for the challenges that lie ahead in the upcoming weeks, ensuring our own protection, maintaining a sense of optimism, and actively engaging in the forefront of this crucial and unprecedented battle against the novel coronavirus.
