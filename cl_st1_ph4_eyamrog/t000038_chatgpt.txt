An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to empirically derive the factor structure of the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) based on data related to peri-traumatic stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data utilized in this study were sourced from the Physical and Psychological Reactions as Health Indicators Research (Virtual Laboratory of Affective, Cognitive and Behavioral Neuropsychometry – LAVINACC). EFA was carried out using a Polychoric Matrix and the Robust Diagonally Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method. Parallel Analysis with random permutation was employed, and the Robust Promin rotation technique was utilized. Model adequacy was assessed using the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) fit indices. The Ratio Communality Index (RCI) indicated a high level of common variance between the subsamples (RCI = 0.998452). Bartlett's sphericity test (21116.6, df = 276, p < 0.00001) and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy (0.939) confirmed the adequacy of the polychoric correlation matrix. The overall assessment metrics (UniCo = 0.918, ECV = 0.85, MIREAL = 0.200) suggested that the CPDI could be conceptualized as a two-factor structure, with the first factor representing internal stressors and the second factor external stressors. Further replication studies are recommended to validate and establish the reliability of these findings.
The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic stands as one of the most significant health challenges globally in this century. By 2022, marking two years since the outbreak in China in late 2019, the global death toll from COVID-19 had surpassed 62 million. Given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic's trajectory, individuals may continue to grapple with prolonged stress, fear, and anguish (Danese et al., 2020). Prior studies have underscored the extensive and profound psychosocial impacts experienced by individuals during the infection outbreak (Abad et al., 2020). Common responses include heightened fears of illness or death, feelings of helplessness, and the burden of social stigma (Wang et al., 2020).
During 2020 and 2021, the Virtual Laboratory of Affective, Cognitive, and Behavioral Neuropsychometry (LAVINACC) undertook research titled "Physical and Psychological Reactions as Health Indicators throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic." One aspect of this study focused on peri-traumatic stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The researchers utilized the Peri-Traumatic Distress Scale (CPDI) as outlined by Qiu et al. (2020) to assess a sample of 1844 participants, as reported by Abad et al. (2020).
Qiu et al. (2020) conducted a study where the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) was utilized to assess the frequency of 22 factors including Anger, Anxiety, Negative Mood, Irritableness, Exhaustion, Sluggishness, Helplessness, Avoidance, Indecisiveness, Sleeplessness, Poor Appetite, Distrust, Physical Symptoms, Bladder and Bowel issues, Obsessive Behavior, Insecurity, Fear, Sadness, Spreading Negative News, Social function, Lack of Judgement, and Attention Deficit. Psychiatrists from the Shanghai Mental Health Center confirmed the content validity of the CPDI, with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.95 (p<0.001) as reported by Qiu et al. (2020). The primary objective of this research is to empirically determine the factor structure of the CPDI in relation to COVID-19 peritraumatic distress.
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to empirically establish the factor structure of the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) as outlined by Qiu et al. (2020). The analysis was conducted using FACTOR, a software designed to accommodate the EFA model through a range of procedures such as determining the number of factors/components to be retained, factor and component analysis, and rotation methods (Lorenzo-Seva & Ferrando, 2013). As an initial step, the program executed SOLOMON, a technique involving the division of a sample into subsamples for factor analysis, to evaluate the similarity in the common variance between the two subsamples (Lorenzo-Seva, 2021).
In conducting our study, we employed Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) utilizing a Polychoric Matrix and the Robust Diagonally Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method, recommended particularly for cases where the univariate distributions of ordinal items exhibit asymmetry (Asparouhov and Muthén, 2010). To evaluate dimensionality, we adopted the Parallel Analysis with random permutation as an enhanced approach. Our determination of dimensionality was guided by the percentage of common explained variance (Timmerman and Lorenzo-Seva, 2011). For rotation purposes, we utilized the Robust Promin technique (Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva, 2018).
The model's adequacy was assessed through the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) fit indices. As per Brown (2015), RMSEA values should be below 0.08, with confidence intervals not exceeding 0.10. TLI and CFI values are expected to surpass 0.90, ideally reaching 0.95.
In assessing the representation of a common factor, we employ the H index, as outlined by Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2018). This index, ranging from 0 to 1, serves to indicate the strength of the latent variable across various studies. Higher H values, exceeding 0.80, indicate a well-defined latent variable, whereas lower values suggest an ill-defined latent variable (Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva, 2018).
In this preliminary analysis, the sample consisted of over 400 observations (n = 1844), and the SALOMON splitting method was applied using FACTOR (Lorenzo-Seva, 2021). The Ratio Communality Index (RCI) was calculated to be 0.998452, indicating that both subsamples share a similar amount of common variance, with values closer to 1 suggesting greater comparability between subsamples (Lorenzo-Seva, 2021). The presence of kurtosis (p < 0.05) in our data signifies a departure from normal distribution. Consequently, the Diagonally Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method is deemed appropriate for categorical data that exhibit non-normal distribution (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2010).
The adequacy of the polychoric correlation matrix was assessed using Bartlett's sphericity test (χ2 = 21116.6, df = 276, p < 0.00001) and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy, yielding a value of 0.939. These tests indicated the suitability of the items' correlation matrix for interpretation. Additionally, parallel analysis indicated that two factors were most representative of the data, as shown in Table 1.
In Table 2, we present the item factor loadings alongside the estimates of replicability of factor scores, denoted by the H-index. This index, as outlined by Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2018), serves to assess the extent to which a set of items accurately represents a common factor. A high H-value, typically exceeding 0.80, indicates a well-defined latent variable that is more likely to remain stable across various studies. Conversely, low H-values suggest a poorly defined latent variable that is prone to fluctuations across different research contexts (Ferrando & Lorenzo-Seva, 2018).
The Unidimensional Congruence (UniCo = 0.918) indicates that the data may not be treated as entirely unidimensional (Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva, 2018). However, the Explained Common Variance (ECV = 0.85) falls within an acceptable range, as values exceeding 0.85 suggest the data can indeed be considered essentially unidimensional. Furthermore, the Mean of Item Residual Absolute Loadings (MIREAL = 0.200), below the threshold of 0.300, supports the notion that the data is essentially unidimensional. Moreover, the adjustment indices evaluating the suitability of the factor structure for the dataset demonstrate strong criteria, affirming the validity of the model: Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA = 0.067) and Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI = 0.976).
The Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) suggested removing one item (21 Recently, I rarely talk to my family) with an MSA value of 0.55089 (Lorenzo and Ferrando, 2021). However, Pratt's relative importance indicator, which assesses the extent to which each factor explains the variance of the item, indicated that item #21 is crucial for the first factor. Consequently, the decision was made to retain the item.
The study by Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2018) on the quality and effectiveness of Factor Score estimates revealed a Factor Determinacy Index (FDI) of 0.982 for factor 1 and 0.933 for factor 2. Additionally, the ORION marginal reliability indicated values of 0.964 for factor 1 and 0.871 for factor 2 as factorial score reliability indicators. Furthermore, the Sensitivity ratio (SR) scores were 5.200 for the first factor and 2.597 for the second factor.
The study by Qiu et al. (2020) revealed a two-factor structure of the CPDI, which aligns with the notion of stress as a physiological or psychological response to internal or external stressors (VandenBos, 2015). The first factor, internal stressors (items 1, 4, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, and 24), captures manifestations such as palpitations, sweating, dry mouth, shortness of breath, fidgeting, accelerated speech, heightened negative emotions, and prolonged stress fatigue (VandenBos, 2015). The second factor, external stressors (items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 22), encompasses events, forces, or conditions that induce physical or emotional stress (VandenBos, 2015). It may be beneficial to reconsider the wording of items 5, 6, and 21. Given the preliminary nature of our findings, it is recommended that further studies be conducted to replicate and validate the results for reliability.
