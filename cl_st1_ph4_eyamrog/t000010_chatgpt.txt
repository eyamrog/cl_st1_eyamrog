The aim of this study was to investigate the cultural disparities in the administration of neuropsychological assessments among a cohort of typically developing preschoolers in Cienfuegos and Sancti Spíritus provinces in Cuba, while also pinpointing the neuropsychological functions impacting intellectual capabilities. A total of sixty-seven children were chosen and divided into distinct groups for analysis. The Raven's Progressive Matrices Intelligence Test and the Luria Initial Neuropsychological Battery were employed as the primary assessment tools. The findings revealed notable variations in intelligence levels and diverse neuropsychological functions across the two provinces. Furthermore, the neuropsychological factors influencing intellectual performance exhibited discrepancies based on the cultural context. In summary, the outcomes suggest that cultural distinctions necessitate a range of cognitive abilities that uniquely shape the development of intelligence and neuropsychological aspects during early childhood.
The impact of culture and education on neuropsychological test outcomes has been a subject of interest for several years, particularly in relation to the differences observed among culturally diverse groups in areas such as language, memory, visuospatial abilities, and intelligence (Fog, 2021). The variability in results obtained from neuropsychological assessments holds significant importance within the scientific community, as it directly influences the validity and standardization of these tests, aids in the accurate identification of neuropsychological impairments, and informs therapeutic and educational strategies in nations with substantial immigrant populations, such as the United States and the European Community (Mercado et al., 2019).
In response to this challenge, various proposed solutions have surfaced. One approach suggests utilizing a combination of tests drawn from different neuropsychological batteries (cross-battery) (Franzen, et al., 2022). Another proposal advocates for the use of non-verbal neuropsychological tests (Ben et al., 2021). The cross-battery method presents examiners with a valuable opportunity, enabling them to select tests that are more tailored to the individual's cultural and educational background (Franzen, et al., 2022; Daugherty, et al, 2017; Puente, et al, 2017). These authors recommend employing this method to reduce diagnostic errors stemming from cultural or educational influences, potentially even preventing death sentences in cases brought before the US Supreme Court. They argue that the classification criteria for an individual of American descent may not be applicable to a Hispanic American, despite both groups sharing the same cultural environment. The diagnosis of a neurological condition or a court ruling can be significantly impacted by the individual's cultural and educational background. Therefore, an error in diagnosis based on classification standards could have life-altering consequences, as individuals with mental disabilities or neurological disorders may be spared from the death penalty (Daugherty, et al., 2017; Puente, et al., 2017).
Another proposed solution involves utilizing various visual-based tests, which are anticipated to pose a lower cultural and educational burden. Individuals responding to these tasks are encouraged to employ strategies that require minimal specialized knowledge, such as comparisons in terms of up-down, right-left, shallow-deep, size, and color. Despite this, nonverbal tests are not entirely devoid of cultural biases, given that cognitive frameworks differ across cultures. Nonetheless, within the child population, this approach is deemed suitable.
While existing solutions are available, certain authors acknowledge that the variability of neuropsychological tests within the pediatric population is more intricate than previously assumed. Solovieva et al. (2021) emphasize that sociocultural factors have been pinpointed as determinants that elucidate the variability in neuropsychological development, whereas other reviews underscore the impact on psychometric intelligence (Rea-Sandin et al., 2021).
Limited neuropsychological research in children has indicated that performance can be notably influenced by cultural, educational, and socioeconomic factors. Specifically, existing findings have highlighted disparities in cognitive and socioemotional development among preschoolers (Lohndorf et al., 2019). Nevertheless, recent studies by Porto et al. (2021) and Rea-Sandin and Causadias (2021) emphasize that the variability is particularly pronounced in executive functions, largely attributed to the educational attainment of parents.
The results presented above all draw from the insights of Ardila (1995), who advocates for a comprehensive examination of neuropsychology in conjunction with culture and education through six distinct units of analysis. Firstly, Ardila emphasizes the necessity for the standardization of current fundamental neuropsychological tools to account for cultural and educational shifts within the target population, as well as the cultural milieu in which standardization occurs. Secondly, he underscores the importance of developing and validating neuropsychological assessments that are tailored to specific cultural contexts. Thirdly, Ardila highlights the significance of considering educational variables and subcultural differences when evaluating test performance. Fourthly, he stresses the need to analyze cognitive impairments resulting from brain pathologies within diverse cultural and educational settings. Fifthly, Ardila suggests exploring similarities in neuropsychological performance across various human groups. Lastly, he proposes an investigation into the origins of cognitive processes.
Researchers have utilized these recommendations to enhance the design, validation, and standardization of psychometric and neuropsychological tests across diverse cultural settings. Moreover, this framework has been applied to conduct comprehensive analyses of neuropsychological assessments in nations with significant migrant populations (Daugherty et al., 2017; Puente et al., 2017).
However, there is a scarcity of scientific studies that have investigated neuropsychological performance in children from the same country of origin (Burneo-Garcés, et al., 2018). Furthermore, the existing studies primarily rely on descriptive statistics for comparative analysis between groups, with limited use of more robust methodological tools like Cohen's d.
In Cuba, efforts have been directed towards characterizing preschool children with typical development and in clinical populations (Prieto, et al., 2020). However, there is a scarcity of studies that specifically compare neuropsychological performance across various provinces. Such comparative analyses could offer valuable insights for tailoring stimulation strategies based on the unique characteristics of each province and its cultural context.
In light of these constraints, the current study seeks to achieve two primary objectives: (1) Assess the variability of neuropsychological test results among a cohort of preschoolers exhibiting typical development in the provinces of Cienfuegos and Sancti Spiritus, both situated in Cuba, and (2) Determine the neuropsychological functions that impact intellectual performance, considering the distinct cultural attributes of these provinces despite sharing a similar educational framework.
In this study, a cross-sectional comparative analysis was carried out from January to December 2019. Seventy-seven children, aged 5 and 6 years with typical development, were chosen and categorized based on their province of residence within the country, specifically Sancti Spíritus and Cienfuegos (refer to Table 1). The groups were meticulously balanced to ensure methodological parity, particularly concerning gender distribution across the provinces under investigation. The distribution analysis revealed a statistically normal equivalence between the two groups (χ2: 0.633).
The children were randomly chosen from various classrooms using a list provided by the school teachers. Selection criteria were established by the researchers: (1) Children had to score at or above the 50th percentile on the Raven's Matrices intelligence test, based on a Cuban cut-off point (Ramírez, et al. 2017); (2) Children had to be native to the provinces of Cienfuegos and Sancti Spíritus from urban areas. All participants in the study were typically developing children without any medical or neurological issues.
The Raven's Progressive Matrices Intelligence Test comprises 36 problems presented in a paper notebook, each featuring an incomplete figure for the child to complete, serving as a classic measure of fluid intelligence. The study utilized the Cuban norms established by Ramírez et al. (2017), demonstrating satisfactory levels of reliability within the Cuban context. An analysis revealed that 91% of the items exhibited good discrimination indices (items - total) as reported by Ramírez et al. (2017).
The Luria Initial Neuropsychological Battery assesses four cognitive domains in children aged 4 to 6 years: executive, linguistic, speed, and memory, along with a manual lateralization test (Ramirez, et al., 2015). Comprising 14 tests, the battery is categorized into specific domains: the executive domain (tests 1 to 5 focus on manual dexterity, right-left orientation, manual gestures and orofacial praxis, verbal control of motor acts, and reproduction of visuospatial patterns), the linguistic domain (tests 6 to 10 cover visual perception, phonemic hearing, vocabulary, verbal reasoning, and numerical operations), the processing speed domain (tests 11 and 12 involve rapid naming of pictures and colors), and the learning and memory domain (tests 13 and 14 assess verbal and visual memory). Additionally, a manual laterality test is included to determine cerebral hemisphere specialization. The study adhered to Cuban regulations (Ramírez, et al., 2015).
The research's objective was first elucidated to school principals, followed by the dissemination of information regarding the distinct characteristics of various neuropsychological tests to preschool teachers. Additionally, parents were contacted and engaged in interviews. Consent from parents was acquired, allowing them the necessary time to complete the neuropsychological screening battery.
The research conducted at the Center for the Study of Educational Sciences, Faculty of Pedagogical Sciences of the “José Martí Pérez” University of Sancti Spíritus, Cuba was approved by the Research Ethics Committee.
The research comprised three sessions lasting between 45 to 60 minutes each, with 5-minute breaks provided as needed by the children. The initial session involved the administration of the Raven test to the children, while the subsequent two sessions involved the administration of the Luria Initial Neuropsychological Battery. This distribution was implemented strategically to prevent mental fatigue and demotivation among the children due to the testing instruments.
After the collection of primary data, a database was established incorporating the study variables, utilizing the SPSS statistical package for Windows version 11.5 to streamline the statistical analysis process. The study variables were delineated through the calculation of the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and contingency table.
Initially, the Chi-square test was employed to assess parity among certain demographic variables, including sex. Subsequently, the t-test, specifically the mean comparison test for independent samples, was utilized to compare the mean values of the study groups across various neuropsychological variables and intelligence. To gauge the extent of differences in the variables under scrutiny, the effect size was calculated. In this context, Cohen's d was employed, with values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 denoting small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.
A simple linear regression analysis was conducted utilizing the neuropsychological test values from two provinces within the country. The neuropsychological variables served as predictors (independent variable), while the dependent variables were the intellectual performance values assessed using the Raven test (nonverbal) for preschoolers. To visually represent the results and illustrate the neuropsychological profiles based on strengths and weaknesses between the provinces, a radial graph was employed. Significance was determined by a threshold of 0.05, indicating the presence of significant differences whenever the test results fell below this value.
In the analysis of demographic variables, no significant differences were observed in terms of sex and age between the two provinces in the country, as indicated in Table 1.
Table 2 presents the findings regarding variances in neuropsychological development and intelligence among preschoolers from two provinces within the country. As per the analysis, significant disparities were observed in intelligence, manual dexterity, manual gestures and praxis, verbal regulation of motor actions, visual object and figure naming, phonemic auditory processing, image-based vocabulary, numerical processing, and rapid color naming, all favoring the cohort from Sancti Spíritus. Conversely, notable distinctions in picture naming and visual memory were evident in favor of the cohort from Cienfuegos, as illustrated in Figure 1.
No significant differences in manual laterality were observed between the two provinces of the country. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d and are presented in Table 2.
When examining the predictive capacity of neuropsychological variables on intelligence levels, contrasting and overlapping results emerged in the provinces of Sancti Spíritus and Cienfuegos.
Firstly, the processes of right-left orientation, verbal regulation, spatial orientation, naming objects and drawings, as well as numerical operations were identified as predictors of intellectual performance in preschool children from Sancti Spíritus and Cienfuegos provinces, as shown in Table 3.
In both provinces, neuropsychological variables overlap, yet there are notable distinctions that hold significance in this study. For instance, in Sancti Spíritus, fine motor skills (t= 2.059; p= 0.048), drawing denomination (t= -2.890; p= 0.007), and speed with the right upper limb (t= 3.477; p= 0.001) have been identified as neuropsychological variables that significantly forecast intellectual performance in preschoolers within this region. The predictive power of each variable ranged from 0.089 to 0.252 (refer to Table 3). Conversely, the performance of these same neuropsychological tasks within the Cienfuegos cohort did not serve as predictors for intelligence development in children.
On the contrary, gestures and praxis (t= 6.229; p= 0.000), phonemic hearing (t= 7.974; p= 0.000), picture vocabulary (t= 8.187; p= 0.000), and color naming (t= 3.228; p= 0.003) were identified as significant predictors of intellectual performance variability in children from Cienfuegos province, with prediction levels ranging from 0.217 to 0.660 (Table 3). In contrast, the results of the same neuropsychological tests conducted on children from Sancti Spíritus did not yield significant predictions regarding the variability of intelligence performance.
The current study unveiled that the neuropsychological performance of individuals from Sancti Spiritus was significantly superior to those from Cienfuegos in assessments focusing on executive functions (including manual motor skills, gestures, praxis, and verbal regulation), language abilities (such as naming objects and figures, phonemic hearing, image vocabulary, and numerical operations), speed in color naming, and verbal memory. Conversely, preschoolers from Cienfuegos exhibited better performance in speed of naming pictures and visual memory tasks. Moreover, notable disparities were observed in intellectual performance between the two cohorts.
In the realm of executive functions and frontal lobe development, Ardila et al. (1995) have demonstrated that parental socioeconomic status could potentially impact group disparities. Contradictory findings exist, with studies suggesting that this factor does not affect Cuban child development (Jiménez-Colín, et al., 2018), while others propose the contrary (Mora & Anangonó, 2016).
Porto et al. (2021) underscored the significance of parental language and its impact on a child's neuropsychological development. The authors posit that the educational attainment of parents serves as a reliable indicator for predicting a child's developmental trajectory and distinguishing them from peers with varying circumstances. While this assertion holds merit, it was not the primary focus of the current study. Notably, in Cuba, data from the latest population census reveals that 7 out of 10 adults are professionals. This demographic characteristic may not be sufficient to account for the disparities observed between the Cienfuegos and Santi Spíritus cohorts. Nevertheless, it warrants further examination, as highly educated or professional parents may delegate their child's education to non-professional caregivers due to their demanding schedules.
Emerging from the study by Fernández-Hernández et al. (2022) is the notion that parents who engage minimally in recreational and sports activities with their children may detrimentally impact the development of executive functions in their offspring. This prompts an inquiry into the frequency of parental involvement in play activities among residents of Cienfuegos and Espiritu, as well as the types of games they typically engage in. These inquiries pose intriguing questions that could potentially shed light on the findings of the aforementioned study. Moreover, they have the potential to pave the way for new avenues of scientific research focused on preschool-aged children.
In examining the disparities between groups, it is crucial to also consider the similarities as a focal point for analysis. Within both groups, factors such as age, sex, urbanity, and adherence to the educational model (specifically the Cuban program in preschool education) were meticulously controlled for. Consequently, these variables do not account for the observed neuropsychological variability between the groups. Furthermore, variables including right-left orientation, similarity and differences perception, and manual laterality did not exhibit any significant differences across the groups.
These results can be attributed to the varying levels of educational stimulation in both groups. The similarity observed could be linked to the intense stimulation present, as most preschool games involve activities that require children to compare objects (identifying similarities and differences) and engage in motor tasks that necessitate the use of their preferred hand. Conversely, the lack of stimulation or slower development in these neuropsychological variables could also be a contributing factor. Previous research conducted in Cuba has highlighted similarity-difference and right-left orientation as skills that tend to develop slowly in preschool children relative to their chronological age (Ramirez et al., 2015).
In terms of intellectual development within the groups, it was evident that the espirituanos outperformed the Cienfuegueros group significantly in the Raven test. These findings underscore the idea that nonverbal tests are not entirely devoid of cultural influences (Ben et al., 2021), indicating that nonverbal tasks involve intricate reasoning processes that differentiate individuals. While Raven's Matrices typically involve straightforward solution strategies like up-down and right-left patterns, they also encompass more implicit strategies such as induction-deduction, inference comparison, classification, hypothesis formulation and assessment, relationship identification, and image extrapolation.
The study revealed that performance on a range of neuropsychological tasks influences the variability in IQ, aligning with findings from prior research (Muchiut et al., 2021). Specifically, within the cohort of children from Sancti Spíritus province categorized as having higher IQ levels, there was a notable observation that fine motor and manual skills emerged as significant neuropsychological predictors linked to enhanced intellectual performance during the preschool years.
Frontal lobe development is known to support the growth of motor and fluid intelligence, both of which benefit from the maturation of these brain structures (Khng & Ng, 2021). This suggests that intelligence can be enhanced not only through reasoning tasks but also through game scenarios and activities that engage perception and motor skills, ultimately leading to improved reasoning and analysis. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Fernández-Hernández et al. (2022), which highlights the role of a child's physical well-being in fostering the development and execution of higher cognitive functions. Despite limited control over educational and cultural variables, the current study demonstrates significant neuropsychological and intellectual variations among groups of children, even within the same country. This underscores the importance of considering three key factors when administering cognitive and neuropsychological assessments in children: first, ensuring the standardization and validity of tests based on regional characteristics; second, establishing norms for classification and diagnosis; and third, conducting an evaluation of the child's sociocultural context, including parental involvement, stimulation, and the educational environment.
The current study posits that the neuropsychological and intellectual development during preschool years is contingent upon sociocultural influences. These factors necessitate a nuanced examination across various categories to elucidate their effects, including family dynamics (structure, roles), parental attributes (educational attainment, parenting style, engagement in stimulating activities), and educational settings (curricula, educator type, frequency and nature of activities). Future investigations could benefit from scrutinizing these variables through a sociocultural lens, exploring their interplay with the development of neuropsychological functions.
