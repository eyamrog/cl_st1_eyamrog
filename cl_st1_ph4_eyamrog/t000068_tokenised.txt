We performed a secondary analysis using a database 56 generated by the University of Maryland and Facebook (Facebook, Inc). We 57 included adult (18 and over) Facebook users residing in LAC who responded to 58 the survey between May 20, and November 5, 2021. We included 59 sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, mental health, economic and 60 food insecurity, compliance with mitigation strategies against COVID-19, and 61 practices related to vaccination against this disease. We estimated crude (cPR) 62 and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios with their respective 95%CI. We analyzed 63 a sample of 44,678 adults from Colombia and 24,302 from Peru. The prevalence 64 of parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against 65 COVID-19 was 7.41% (n=3,274) for Colombia and 6.64% (n=1,464) for Peru. In 66 Colombia, age above 35 years old, compliance with physical distancing, use of 67 masks, having economic insecurity, anxiety symptoms, having a chronic 68 condition or more comorbidities, and being vaccinated were associated with a 69 lower prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children and adolescents against 70 COVID-19. In Peru, gender, compliance with physical distancing, use of masks, 71 having economic insecurity, anxiety symptoms, having a chronic condition or 72 more comorbidities, having had COVID-19, and being vaccinated were 73 associated with a higher probability of vaccinating children against COVID-19. 74 Living in a town, a village, or a rural area was associated with a higher prevalence 75 of non-intention to vaccinate children and adolescents against COVID-19. About 76 9 out of 10 parents in Colombia and Peru intend to vaccinate their children and 77 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 adolescents against COVID-19. This intention is associated with some factors 78 which are similar between the two countries, as well as other factors and 79 variations among the different regions of each country. 80 Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19 Vaccines; Vaccination Refusal; 81 Vaccination; Child; Adolescent; Parents; Colombia; Peru. 82

83 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 Highlights 84  About 9 out of 10 parents in Colombia and Peru intend to vaccinate their 85 children and adolescents against COVID-19. 86  In Colombia, being between 35 and 54 years old, adherent to maintaining 87 physical distance, using masks, having economic insecurity, having 88 symptoms of anxiety and comorbidities, and being vaccinated were 89 associated with a higher probability of vaccinating children against COVID- 90 19. 91  In Peru, being female, an adherent to maintaining social distancing, using a 92 mask, having economic and food insecurity, having comorbidities, having 93 been vaccinated, and having had COVID-19 was associated with a lower 94 probability of not having the intention to vaccinate children. On the contrary, 95 living in a town or rural area was associated with a greater intention not to 96 vaccinate. 97  Despite good general acceptance of vaccination against COVID-19, the 98 health authorities of each country must propose individualized strategies 99 depending on the context if the vaccination campaigns in this population group 100 are to achieve their objectives. 101

102 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 INTRODUCTION 103 The most cost-effective strategy for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is to 104 achieve global vaccination coverage of at least 70 to 90% (1). Vaccines against 105 COVID-19 are not only safe but have also been shown to reduce hospitalizations, 106 the use of ventilation, health care costs, mortality, as well as viral transmission (2– 107 5). Although initially there was controversy about vaccination in the child 108 population due to the relatively low incidence, severity, and limited spread of the 109 disease in this age group, it is currently considered essential to achieve herd 110 immunity (6). Similarly, it is necessary to ensure the return to regular school 111 learning and prevention against severe cases in children, as well as long-term 112 consequences such as post-COVID-19 syndrome (7). 113 In October 2021, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the BioNTech 114 vaccine for emergency use in children from 5 to 11 years of age (8). Although this 115 vaccine remains under surveillance and continuous monitoring, it has been 116 demonstrated to be safe and effective in this population (9). Nonetheless, 117 investigations at a world level have suggested that some parents reject 118 vaccination due to false information reported by the media (10,11), leading to 119 uncertainty regarding the safety and efficacy of the vaccines (12). 120 Although 9 out of 10 parents in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) intend to 121 vaccinate their children, there are factors associated with the non-intention to 122 vaccinate (13). The proportion of parents who do intend to vaccinate their children 123 is encouraging despite being one of the continents with the highest degree of 124 misinformation and low adherence to the control recommendations of the 125 pandemic (14). However, this vaccination intention varies among the regions of 126 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 each country, and each country has factors associated with its social 127 determinants or its health systems. 128 There are differences among the regions of Peru concerning the intention of the 129 adult population to be vaccinated against COVID-19 (15), being lower in older 130 adults (16). A study in Colombia showed lower vaccination acceptance in adults 131 than in the Peruvian population (17), with important variations among its regions 132 as in Peru (18). These results suggest that the intention to vaccinate in different 133 countries varies according to the sociodemographic context and age (19–23). 134 Likewise, fear, socioeconomic conditions, and institutional situations can also 135 intervene in compliance with vaccination (24,25). 136 Therefore, while some studies have evaluated the vaccination intention in LAC 137 countries (13), there may be variations within these countries that warrant 138 strategies to achieve adequate coverage in children and adolescents. Therefore, 139 the objective of the present study was to evaluate the factors associated with the 140 intention to vaccinate children and adolescents in Peru and Colombia and the 141 variations of this intention among the different regions of these two countries. 142 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 METHODS 143 Study design 144 We performed a secondary analysis using a database generated by the 145 University of Maryland and Facebook (Facebook, Inc). Both institutions designed 146 a survey to assess sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, mental 147 health, economic and food insecurity, compliance with mitigation strategies 148 against COVID-19, and practices related to vaccination against this disease. 149 Since April 23, 2020, this survey has been carried out daily in more than 200 150 countries and in the primary language of the territory. The sampling frame for the 151 random selection of participants included daily Facebook users over 18 years of 152 age from a particular region and country. The selection of the surveyed 153 participants was random based on the sampling frame that was recalculated 154 daily. If a Facebook user refused to participate, another was randomly invited 155 within the sampling frame. Participants could only answer the survey once within 156 an eight-week time frame. This survey has been used to develop previous studies 157 (26), and the survey methodology has been described in greater detail elsewhere 158 (27). 159 Population and sample 160 We included adult (18 and over) Facebook users residing in LAC who responded 161 to the survey between May 20 and November 5, 2021. We excluded participants 162 who did not have the variables of interest, who did not have children, those of 163 non-binary gender, and those over 54 years of age. We excluded participants 164 over 54 years of age to reduce the probability of not exclusively including parents 165 of children under 18 (Figure 1). 166 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 Variables and measures 167 Outcome variable: The outcome variable was parents’ non-intention to 168 vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19. 169 We evaluated the parents’ intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents 170 against COVID-19 using the survey question: Will you choose to get a COVID-19 171 vaccine for your child or children when they are eligible? This question has four 172 possible alternatives: yes, definitely; yes, probably; no, probably not; and no, 173 definitely not. Subsequently, we dichotomized the variable considering the first 174 two alternatives as to the parents’ intention to vaccinate their children and 175 adolescents, while the last two were considered non-intention. 176 Independent variables 177 Sociodemographic variables 178 We included the following sociodemographic variables (the survey question 179 related to the study variables and the categories considered for these variables 180 in the study are shown in parenthesis): gender (What is your gender?; male, 181 female), age (What is your age?; 18 to 24 years, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 to 54), 182 educational level (What is the highest level of education that you have 183 completed?; university post-graduate degree completed/university 184 completed/college/pre-university, secondary school completed/high school (or 185 equivalent) completed, primary school completed/less than primary school/no 186 formal schooling) and area of residence (Which of the following best describes 187 the area where you currently live?; city, town, village or rural area). Town was 188 defined as a populated area with fixed boundaries and a local self-government; 189 city was defined as an important or a large town; and village was defined as a 190 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 group of houses and other buildings, usually in the countryside, smaller than a 191 town. 192 Comorbidities, personal and COVID-19 history 193 Participants self-reported the following comorbidities (survey question: Have you 194 ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or another health professional that you have 195 any of the following medical conditions?): asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 196 disease (COPD) or chronic bronchitis or emphysema, cancer, diabetes, high 197 blood pressure, kidney disease, compromised or weakened immune system, 198 heart attack or another heart disease, and obesity. We created a variable that 199 grouped comorbidities in yes or no. 200 We also included self-reporting of being a smoker (yes, no), having had COVID- 201 19 (yes, no), and having been vaccinated against COVID-19 (yes, no). 202 Compliance with community mitigation strategies 203 The community mitigation strategies included were physical distancing and mask 204 use during the last seven days. We defined physical distancing as when a 205 participant reported having intentionally avoided contact with other people at least 206 at some point in the last seven days (survey question: In the past 7 days, how 207 often did you intentionally avoid contact with other people?). In addition, the use 208 of masks was defined if a participant reported wearing a mask in public at least 209 at some point during the last seven days (survey question: In the past 7 days, 210 how often did you wear a mask when in public?). 211 Food and economic insecurity 212 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 We assessed food insecurity with the survey question: How worried are you about 213 having enough to eat in the next week? This question had four possible answers: 214 very worried, somewhat worried, not too worried, and not worried at all. We 215 considered the first three responses as food insecurity. 216 We defined economic insecurity using the survey question: How worried are you 217 about your household’s finances in the next month? There were four response 218 alternatives: very worried, somewhat worried, not too worried, and not worried at 219 all. We defined economic insecurity using the first three responses. 220 Anxiety and depressive symptoms 221 We evaluated anxiety symptoms using the survey question: During the last seven 222 days, how often did you feel so nervous that nothing could calm you down? This 223 question is part of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), and the survey 224 has five response alternatives: all the time, most of the time, some of the time, a 225 little of the time, and none of the time. Therefore, we dichotomized the variable 226 considering the first four alternatives as to the presence of anxiety symptoms. 227 We evaluated depressive symptoms using the survey question: How often did 228 you feel so depressed that nothing could cheer you up in the past seven days? 229 This question is part of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and has 230 five response alternatives: all the time, most of the time, some of the time, a little 231 of the time, and none of the time. Therefore, we dichotomized the variable 232 considering the first four alternatives as to the presence of depressive symptoms. 233 Statistical analysis 234 We downloaded the databases in Microsoft Excel 2016 ® format and imported 235 them into the statistical package Stata/SE ® version 17.0 (StataCorp, TX, USA). 236 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 Then, we performed the statistical analysis considering the complex sampling of 237 the survey and the svy command. 238 We performed a descriptive analysis using absolute frequencies and weighted 239 proportions with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). We used the 240 Chi-square test with Rao-Scott correction to perform the bivariate analysis 241 between the independent variables and the parents’ non-intention to vaccinate 242 their children and adolescents against COVID-19. Two generalized linear models 243 (crude and adjusted) of the Poisson family with a logarithmic link function were 244 used to estimate the factors associated with the parents’ non-intention to 245 vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19. Crude (cPR) and 246 adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios with their respective 95%CI were estimated. 247 The adjustment for confounders was carried out according to an epidemiological 248 approach based on other studies (13), after evaluating the collinearity of the 249 associated factors included in the final adjusted model. We evaluated the 250 possible collinearity of the associated factors included in the final adjusted model. 251 A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all the 252 analyses. 253 Ethical considerations 254 All participants gave their informed consent before answering the survey. This 255 study analyzed a secondary database that collected data without identifiers and 256 did not violate the integrity of the participants. The database is not open access; 257 the authors of this study achieved access after obtaining a signed agreement with 258 the University of Maryland.
259 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 RESULTS 260 We analyzed a sample of 44,678 adults from Colombia and 24,302 adults from 261 Peru (Figure 1). 262 Colombia 263 Characteristics of the study sample in Colombia 264 In the Columbia study sample, 55.44% were female, 33.19% were between 35 to 265 44 years old, 53% had completed secondary education or less, 60.88% lived in 266 a city, and 10.78% reported smoking. Regarding prevention measures, 89.45% 267 and 92.27% had complied with physical distancing and the use of a mask, 268 respectively. Food insecurity was reported by 72.49%, and 86.61% reported 269 having economic insecurity. In addition, 35.82% and 42.51% described having 270 anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively; 65.27% of the participants did 271 not report comorbidities, 47.53% were not yet vaccinated against COVID-19, and 272 35.79% had had COVID-19 at some point. In Colombia, the prevalence of 273 parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID- 274 19 was 7.41% (Table 1). 275 Prevalence of parents’ non-intention to vaccinate their children and 276 adolescents against COVID-19 according to each region of Colombia 277 In Colombia, the regions with the highest prevalence of parents´ non-intention to 278 vaccinate children against COVID-19 were Amazonas (14.95%), Putumayo 279 (13.72%), and Vichada (12.96%), while the lowest prevalence of non-intention to 280 vaccinate children against COVID-19 was in Vaupés (0%), San Andrés and 281 Providencia (0.27%), and Bolivar (5.33%) (Figure 2a). 282 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 Bivariate analysis according to parents’ non-intention to vaccinate their 283 children and adolescents against COVID-19 in Colombia 284 We found statistically significant differences for age, level of education, 285 compliance with physical distancing and use of a mask, economic insecurity, 286 anxiety symptoms, presenting comorbidities, and having been vaccinated (Table 287 2). 288 Factors associated with parents’ non-intention to vaccinate their children 289 and adolescents against COVID-19 in Colombia 290 In the adjusted regression model, we found that age groups between 35 and 44 291 years old (aPR=0.77; 95%CI: 0.66-0.90; p=0.001) and 45 to 54 years old 292 (aPR=0.78; 95%CI: 0.65-0.95; p=0.012) were associated with a lower prevalence 293 of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 compared to the age 294 group between 18 and 24 years. Likewise, compliance with physical distancing 295 (aPR=0.55; 95%CI: 0.49-0.61; p<0.001), use of masks (aPR=0.71; 95%CI: 0.65- 296 0.78; p<0.001), economic insecurity (aPR=0.72; 95%CI: 0.65-0.89; p<0.001), 297 anxiety symptoms (aPR=0.87; 95%CI: 0.79-0.95; p=0.003), was associated with 298 a lower prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19. 299 Additionally, having one or more comorbidities (aPR=0.83; 95%CI: 0.75-0.91; 300 p<0.001) and being vaccinated against COVID-19 (aPR=0.17; 95%CI: 0.15-0.20; 301 p<0.001) were associated with a lower prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate 302 children against COVID-19 (Table 3). 303 Peru 304 Characteristics of the study sample in Peru 305 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 In the Peruvian sample, 52.81% were female, 33.01% were between 35 to 44 306 years old, 51.48% had at least a full university post-graduate degree 307 completed/university completed/college/pre-university, 75.98% lived in a city, and 308 11.39% reported having smoked. In addition, 90.39% and 93.94% had complied 309 with physical distancing and the use of a mask, respectively. We found that 310 76.26% reported having food insecurity, while 89.95% reported having economic 311 insecurity. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were reported in 42.31% and 312 50.01%, respectively, and 62.81% of the participants did not report comorbidities, 313 53.71% were not yet vaccinated against COVID-19, and 45.91% had had COVID- 314 19 at some point. The prevalence of parents´ non-intention to vaccinate their 315 children and adolescents against COVID-19 was 6.64% (Table 1). 316 Prevalence of parents’ non-intention to vaccinate their children and 317 adolescents against COVID-19 according to each region of Peru 318 In Peru, the regions with the highest prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate 319 children against COVID-19 were Moquegua (13.73%), Madre de Dios (13.65%), 320 and Puno (11.83%). On the other hand, the regions with a lower prevalence of 321 non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 were Pasco (4.10%), Lima 322 (4.82%), and Piura (5.03%) (Figure 2b). 323 Bivariate analysis according to parents’ non-intention to vaccinate their 324 children and adolescents against COVID-19 in Peru 325 We found statistically significant differences between the independent variables 326 and the intention of parents to vaccinate their children and adolescents against 327 COVID-19, except for smoking (p=0.797) (Table 2). 328 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 Factors associated with parents’ non-intention to vaccinate their children 329 and adolescents against COVID-19 in Peru 330 In the adjusted regression model, we found female gender (aPR=0.81; 0.71-0.93; 331 p=0.002) compared to male gender was associated with a lower prevalence of 332 non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19. Likewise, compliance with 333 physical distancing (aPR=0.45; 95%CI: 0.39-0.52; p<0.001), use of masks 334 (aPR=0.71; 95%CI: 0.65-0.90; p=0.005), economic insecurity (aPR=0.66; 335 95%CI: 0.59-0.75; p<0.001), anxiety symptoms (aPR=0.82; 95%CI: 0.70-0.97; 336 p=0.020) were associated with a lower prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate 337 children against COVID-19. In addition, having one or more comorbidities 338 (aRP=0.74; 95%CI: 0.63-0.86; p<0.001), being vaccinated against COVID-19 339 (aPR=0.24; 95%CI: 0.20-0.28; p<0.001) and having had COVID-19 (aPR=0.83; 340 95%CI: 0.73-0.94; p=0.006) were associated with a lower prevalence of non- 341 intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19. On the other hand, living in a 342 town (aPR=1.16; 95%CI: 1.00-1.35; p=0.048) and living in a village or rural area 343 (aPR=1.51; 95%CI: 1.26-1.80; p<0.001) compared to living in the city was 344 associated with a higher prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children against 345 COVID-19 (Table 3).
346 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 DISCUSSION 347 Our main results show that about 9 out of 10 parents in Colombia and Peru intend 348 to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19. In Colombia, 349 being between 35 and 54 years old, adherent to maintaining physical distance, 350 using masks, having economic insecurity, having symptoms of anxiety and 351 comorbidities, and being vaccinated were associated with a higher probability of 352 vaccinating children against COVID-19. In Peru, being female, an adherent to 353 maintaining social distancing, using a mask, having economic and food 354 insecurity, having comorbidities, having been vaccinated, and having had 355 COVID-19 was associated with a lower probability of not having the intention to 356 vaccinate children. On the contrary, living in a town or rural area was associated 357 with a greater intention not to vaccinate. 358 Our results of the intention to vaccinate children and adolescents are similar to 359 those found in the evaluation carried out between May and June 2021 in LAC (13). 360 This are good news in terms of public health because the Ministries of Health of 361 Peru and Colombia have already scheduled or started vaccination against 362 COVID-19 with different vaccines in children and adolescents (28,29). This 363 acceptance is expected to be reflected in the increase in population coverage of 364 the vaccine to achieve the rate needed to obtain herd immunity. However, 365 variations between the regions of the countries and in the case of Peru, according 366 to the place of residence, require individualization of the vaccination programs 367 based on the region. 368 As in other LAC countries, some factors associated with the socioeconomic and 369 psychological consequences of the pandemic reduce the non-intention of 370 vaccination(13). Indeed, aspects such as stress(13), economic or food insecurity as 371 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 a result of the economic crisis during the pandemic and especially during the first 372 wave (30), possibly created a state of alert and the desire for such a situation not 373 to be repeated, being vaccination seen as an opportunity to achieve this (13). 374 Along the same line, adherence to community mitigation measures such as the 375 use of masks and social distancing may reflect a higher likelihood of complying 376 with vaccination. Similarly, the feeling of vulnerability (26) and the desire to avoid 377 this happening to their children may foster the positive view of vaccination and 378 reduce the probability of non-intention to vaccinate their children (13). 379 While some factors coincide among the different countries, some studies have 380 shown that some factors can be explained by social determinants and 381 socioeconomic differences between countries (19–24). Although, to date, no study 382 has compared these differences, there may be several explanations. In a 383 previous study by our group evaluating food insecurity in LAC in the first stage of 384 the pandemic, it was found that food insecurity was higher in Peru than in 385 Colombia (83.9% vs. 76.8%, respectively), which may explain the results of the 386 present study (30). Similarly, the impact of the pandemic was different in the two 387 countries, with the number of deaths registered until November 17, 2021, being 388 more than 200 thousand in Peru (31) and about 128 thousand in Colombia (32). 389 These differences might suggest that the fear of having had the infection and its 390 consequences have led to the desire of this not happening to their children and 391 an increase in the intention to vaccinate them. On the other hand, according to 392 the document "Distinctive features of health systems in the world, 2017" the 393 Colombian health system is better developed than the Peruvian (33). Indeed, in 394 Peru, despite the improvements, structural problems and coverage of health 395 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 services in areas such as rural areas had a great impact on health care during 396 the pandemic and could explain our present results (34,35). 397 There were great variations in the intention to vaccinate among the different 398 regions of Peru. The regions with the least intention to vaccinate were Madre de 399 Dios, Puno, and Moquegua. In contrast, the regions of Lima and Lambayeque 400 had the highest intention to vaccinate children and adolescents against COVID- 401 19. The Madre de Dios and Moquegua regions presented the lowest fatality 402 during the pandemic, which may explain the lesser feeling of fear, commented 403 previously compared to Lambayeque, for example, which is one of the 404 departments with the highest fatality (31). However, the complexity of the impact 405 of the pandemic in each region is far from being fully understood, which could 406 explain why, in the department of Puno, a region with low mortality, the intention 407 to vaccinate is low. However, it is likely that some aspects such as self-medication 408 (36), knowledge about the disease (37), and the reliability of the sites where 409 Peruvians obtain information (38) on the pandemic or the variation in prevention 410 practices among Peruvians (39), may explain the differences in intention to 411 vaccinate children among the different regions of Peru. 412 In Colombia, the departments with the highest vaccination intention were Vaupés, 413 San Andrés, Bolívar, Guainía, and Cundinamarca, being above 94%. Several of 414 these regions were significantly affected by COVID-19, especially in terms of 415 concentration of cases per inhabitant. In departments such as San Andrés, there 416 was deep state intervention in different aspects due to the initial level of 417 involvement of COVID, which might influence the subsequent vaccination 418 intention. Likewise, in the department of Bolívar, where the capital, Cartagena, is 419 located, there were also a considerable number of cases and deaths, which may 420 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 influence the intention of vaccination (40). The vaccination program in Colombia is 421 led by a mass media campaign (41), having the support of scientific societies, such 422 as the Colombian Association of Infectious Diseases, which promotes information 423 based on evidence to both health personnel and the community, and this could 424 also contribute to the intention of vaccination (42). 425 Our study has some limitations. Since the respondents were users of a social 426 network, information was only obtained from people with access to the internet 427 and social networks, which could vary between the regions of the countries 428 evaluated and the rural population. We do not have the non-response rate, which 429 is relevant in the context of an online survey. The variables included in this 430 analysis were pre-established in the survey, and there could be relevant variables 431 not included in our analysis. The data were obtained by self-reporting and, 432 therefore, an underreporting of information is possible. Finally, due to the design 433 of the study, our results should only be interpreted in the context of associations 434 since causality among the variables evaluated could not be established. 435 However, this study presents the strength of analyzing a database with a large 436 representative sample of social network users widely used in Colombia and Peru. 437 In conclusion, about 9 out of 10 parents in Colombia and Peru intend to vaccinate 438 their children and adolescents against COVID-19. This intention is associated 439 with some factors which are similar between the two countries, as well as other 440 factors and variations among the different regions of each country. This means 441 that despite good general acceptance of vaccination against COVID-19, the 442 health authorities of each country must propose individualized strategies 443 depending on the context if the vaccination campaigns in this population group 444 are to achieve their objectives. This includes not only broadening the target 445 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3499 groups of both unvaccinated and vaccinated but also achieving high coverage 446 with an additional booster or complementary doses. Finally, scientific evidence 447 must be communicated to the public, including aspects that may affect confidence 448 in vaccines, such as the new variants of concern, including the Omicron variant, 449 among other aspects.
