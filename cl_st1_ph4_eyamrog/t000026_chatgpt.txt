This study aimed to investigate the relationship between anxiety levels and the utilization of anxiolytics among university students in the health field. A nationwide online survey was administered to 286 health area students, predominantly female (77.9%), with an average age of 23.3 years (standard deviation = 4.9). Notably, 39.86% of participants reported using anxiolytic medications, with a majority being experienced students (87.9%). The prevalence of anxiolytic drug use was found to be 58.8% among students exhibiting high trait anxiety and 60.5% among those with moderate state anxiety. Furthermore, a statistically significant relationship was observed between medication usage and university type, along with a significant but weak negative correlation between age and trait anxiety. It is recommended that universities promote anxiety management strategies and incorporate measures to alleviate symptoms within their support initiatives.
Entering university marks a significant milestone in the lives of numerous young individuals, representing a phase characterized by maturational shifts encompassing physiological, neurological, and psychological alterations as they navigate the transition from adolescence to adulthood (Silva & Costa, 2012). This period can prove to be demanding, necessitating the adjustment to a novel social role and modifications across multiple facets of a university student's existence (Ferreira et al., 2009; Pereira & Ramos, 2021).
University students in the health field encounter obstacles in their academic journey that can have adverse effects on their physical and mental well-being. These challenges encompass extensive teaching hours, an overwhelming load of academic responsibilities, and mandatory internships in hospital and primary care environments, exposing them to stressful scenarios associated with sickness and the experience of falling ill. (Carli et al., 2022; Chattu et al., 2020).
Exposure to a demanding academic environment can heighten vulnerability to anxiety, detrimentally impacting university students' academic performance and overall well-being (Balapala & Indla, 2017). Anxiety, as defined by Gama et al. (2021), manifests as a state of mental unrest and disarray marked by worry, avoidance, and heightened emotional reactivity, leading to an unrealistic and distressing emotional state in individuals.
In the context of anxiety, it is important to distinguish between trait anxiety and state anxiety. Trait anxiety, as defined in the university setting, is considered a stable personality trait (Machado et al., 2016) that predisposes students to view the university environment as threatening and potentially dangerous, leading to heightened levels of anxiety that may not align with the actual situation (Balapala & Indla, 2017). Conversely, state anxiety is described as a temporary emotional state (Machado et al., 2016) characterized by symptoms like nervousness, worry, and apprehension, often linked to the excitement experienced within the university environment (Gama et al., 2021).
Global research suggests that anxiety is more prevalent among college students compared to non-college young adults within the same age group. Auerbach et al. (2016) reported a prevalence rate of 31% (n = 1,572) among students, which was notably higher than the 21.4% (n = 4,178) prevalence rate observed among non-students. Subsequently, Auerbach et al. (2018) identified a 31.1% (n = 13,984) prevalence of anxiety conditions among students. In the Brazilian context, Demenech et al. (2021) estimated that around 37.75% (n = 3,193) of higher education students exhibited symptoms of anxiety.
In light of this concerning situation, symptoms of anxiety could potentially play a role in the misuse of prescription anxiolytic medications among university health students (Pérez et al., 2023). This particular demographic is susceptible to the inappropriate use of psychotropic drugs due to their relative financial independence, lack of direct parental or guardian oversight, and inclination to experiment with these substances as a means of managing the overwhelming demands of their academic workload (Nogueira et al., 2021; Souza et al., 2022).
To support this perspective, the relationship between the use of anxiolytic medications and anxiety has primarily been explored within the context of university students. A global study conducted by Auerbach et al. (2018) revealed that 12.6% of university students exhibiting anxious symptoms were utilizing these medications. Among the most frequently employed are benzodiazepines (BZDs; 5.9%), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; 3.9%), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; 2.2%). In Brazil, a study discovered that 24.3% of medical students were using antidepressant and/or anxiolytic drugs (Souza et al., 2022).
The literature has highlighted that female university students exhibit a higher susceptibility to anxiety (Blanco et al., 2021) and are more inclined towards the use of anxiolytic medication (Martínez-Líbano et al., 2023). This underscores the necessity for a more intricate examination of potential sex-related disparities. Despite existing studies on this subject, the prevalence of anxiety and the utilization of anxiolytic medications are typically addressed independently in national literature. Moreover, national empirical investigations on prevalence predominantly concentrate on cohorts of medical students (Chattu et al., 2020; Souza et al., 2022) and nursing students (Marchi et al., 2013; Paixão et al., 2021).
This article addresses the lack of research in Brazil concerning the relationship between anxiety and the consumption of anxiolytic drugs, particularly among university students studying health-related disciplines and working directly in the healthcare sector. By examining the correlation between anxiety levels and the use of anxiolytics in this specific demographic, this study aims to make a valuable contribution to the existing literature on the subject.
This cross-sectional web survey study adopts a descriptive and correlational approach, adhering to the methodological guidelines outlined in Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) (Cevallos et al., 2014) for enhanced rigor. The research was conducted across three distinct geographic regions in Brazil, namely the Northeast, Southeast, and South. Data collection occurred online between September 15 and October 14, 2021, spanning a 30-day period. The study sample comprised undergraduate university students specializing in the health field.
The study comprised 286 university students enrolled in 13 distinct undergraduate programs within the biological and health science domains, encompassing disciplines such as biology, biomedicine, physical education, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, medicine, nutrition, dentistry, psychology, chiropractics, and occupational therapy. Participants were chosen through convenience sampling methods, adhering to the criteria of being undergraduate students pursuing health-related degrees at Brazilian Higher Education Institutions (HEI), being at least 18 years of age, and possessing internet access.
In this study, the participants comprise students hailing from various educational institutions, including public, private, and community establishments, representing different Brazilian states across the Northeast (Alagoas, Bahia, and Sergipe), Southeast (Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo), and South (Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul) regions.
The sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire encompassed inquiries pertaining to various factors including age, ethnicity, gender, marital status, location, academic program, semester, university affiliation, as well as the manifestation of anxiety symptoms both physical and psychological, and a record of past anxiolytic medication usage.
The Anxiety Trait-State Inventory (IDATE) was developed by Spielberger et al. (1970) and subsequently validated in Brazil by Biaggio and Natalício (1979). The instrument demonstrates a high level of internal consistency, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.86 to 0.95 (Spielberger et al., 1980). Comprising two 40-item scales presented in a four-point Likert format, with responses ranging from "4-very much" to "1-absolutely not," the IDATE assesses anxiety state (IDATE-E) and anxiety trait (IDATE-T) separately. Each scale consists of 20 items (Grös et al., 2007). In the current study, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated at 0.85, indicating satisfactory internal consistency of the data.
The study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of Tiradentes University (CAAE No. 20058919.5.0000.5371) and adhered to both national and international ethical standards for research involving human subjects.
Initially, data collection was conducted using an online questionnaire distributed via a Google Forms link that was sent to the institutional email addresses of university students enrolled in health courses at a private university in Sergipe, the researcher's home institution.
The virtual snowball sampling method was employed to distribute a survey link on the social network Instagram. This referral approach, recognized as a viral strategy, involved sending a message introducing the research and urging recipients to share it within their network of contacts. Consequently, students enrolled in any health-related program at universities, regardless of their educational institution or geographical location, were able to access and respond to the questionnaire.
Upon accessing the questionnaire link, participants were guided to the Informed Consent Form (ICF) screen, which guaranteed voluntary participation, anonymity, and the option to withdraw from the study without any impact on their psychological well-being. Electronic consent was secured through the act of clicking on "I agree to participate in the research." Subsequently, individuals were led to a page housing the sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire alongside the IDATE, with an estimated completion time of 20 minutes.
The data collected were meticulously organized in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using a double typing method, followed by a thorough validation process to ensure accuracy and minimize errors. Subsequently, the data were exported and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0. This allowed for the characterization of sociodemographic and clinical profile data through the calculation of absolute and relative percentage frequencies, a common practice in descriptive statistics. To assess the normality assumption of the data, the Kolmogorov‒Smirnov test with Lilliefors correlation was employed.
The study utilized Fisher's exact test for quadratic tables, where rows and columns have an equal number of elements, and Pearson's chi-square test (χ2) for nonsquare tables, where the number of rows and columns varies. These statistical tests were employed to assess the distribution of data concerning the variables in relation to the levels of anxiety symptoms, as indicated by the scores on the IDATEs (IDATE-T and IDATE-E).
In conducting the correlational analysis, Kendall's Tau-b test was employed to evaluate the correlation of scores (IDATE) across both indices, examining the strength of correlation with the variables age, period, and medications utilized. Furthermore, the agreement rate between IDATE-T and IDATE-E was assessed using the Kappa (K) coefficient test. Throughout all analyses, a 95% confidence interval and a significance level of p < 0.05 were adhered to.
Table 1 illustrates the sample's characteristics by conducting a descriptive analysis of sociodemographic and clinical information. Among the 286 participants, the majority are female (77.9%), with an average age of 23.3 years (standard deviation SD= 4.9). The participants are predominantly veterans (87.9%), studying in the Medicine course (44.2%), self-identifying as white (49.8%), single (85.8%), attending private universities (80.4%), and primarily residing in the state of Sergipe (58.2%).
In the study, it was noted that 39.9% of participants utilized anxiolytic drugs, with the remaining 60.1% abstaining from their use. Table 2 delves into a correlation analysis encompassing age, period, anxiolytic medication dosage, and state-trait anxiety. Notably, no statistically significant associations were discerned between age, period, anxiolytic dosage, and state anxiety. Similarly, no significant relationships were found between period, anxiolytic dosage, and trait anxiety. However, a weak yet noteworthy negative correlation was identified between age and trait anxiety (r = -0.114, p = 0.007).
When examining the comparison of anxiolytic drug usage based on university type and gender (Table 3), it was noted that a greater prevalence of anxiolytic drug consumption was evident among female students (42.3%) and individuals enrolled in public universities (55.3%). Furthermore, a statistically significant correlation was found between university type and anxiolytic drug utilization (p=0.042), whereas no significant association was observed between gender and anxiolytic drug use.
In relation to the utilization of anxiolytic medications and state-trait anxiety (Table 4), the study revealed a statistically significant association between elevated trait anxiety and the consumption of anxiolytic drugs (p=0.019).
In examining the correlation between gender and state anxiety, it was observed that a greater percentage of women (68%) displayed moderate anxiety levels compared to men (60.3%). When considering sex and trait anxiety, 51.8% of women exhibited high anxiety levels, while 57.1% of men showed moderate levels. These findings indicate variations in the prevalence of anxiety between genders, contingent upon the specific type of anxiety under evaluation (state or trait).
Table 4 illustrates that over the data collection period, participants utilized a total of twenty-one distinct medications. The most frequently consumed were Anxiolytic BZDs, specifically Diazepam and Clonazepam, followed by antidepressants belonging to the SSRI class, such as Escitalopram, Citalopram, and Fluoxetine, and ADTs like Amitriptyline. This data sheds light on the prevalent medications among the surveyed participants.
This study examined the relationship between anxiety and the utilization of anxiolytics among university students specializing in health-related fields. The primary results indicated that 58.8% of the surveyed students acknowledged using anxiolytic medications, predominantly among those with prior academic experience. The manifestation of anxiety symptoms prompts students to pursue immediate remedies for managing the burden of academic responsibilities, often resorting to pharmaceutical interventions (Nogueira et al., 2021; Pérez et al., 2023).
The university setting serves as a crucial environment for the utilization of anxiolytic medications and the emergence of concerning consumption habits related to these drugs (Vera et al., 2021). Research indicates that a significant portion of senior health students, approximately 20%, engage in daily use of anxiolytics as a means to manage anxiety preceding exams, challenges in handling academic obligations, and meeting requirements for curricular and extracurricular internships (Fond et al., 2019).
An association was observed between the type of university and the use of anxiolytic drugs, with female students exhibiting a higher occurrence of drug use, a trend consistent with findings from other national studies (Aquino et al., 2010; Bojanić et al., 2021; Souza et al., 2022). This outcome could be partially elucidated by women's increased exposure to medicalization across their lifespan, higher demand for medical attention, and targeted educational campaigns (Forster et al., 2019). Conversely, the lower representation of male participants might be attributed to men's reluctance to seek assistance in managing their mental health issues (Souza et al., 2022).
It is important to note that while university students are generally considered to be at higher risk, the sample used in this study predominantly consisted of women, potentially impacting the outcomes. Consequently, it is crucial to take into account the composition of the sample when analyzing the findings and to pursue additional research to validate these findings.
The primary outcome of the study indicated that 58.8% of health students exhibiting high trait anxiety and 60.5% of those with moderate state anxiety resorted to anxiolytic drugs. Furthermore, it was observed that students enrolled in public universities demonstrated a higher prevalence of anxiolytic drug usage. These findings align with a national investigation by Marchi et al. (2013), where 34% of nursing students at a public university reported mild anxiety, with 16% of them disclosing current or past use of anxiolytic medications.
An important finding of this study was that female participants exhibited elevated levels of moderate state anxiety in comparison to their male counterparts. Current research indicates that state anxiety among female university students is linked to transient anxiety, which fluctuates based on the evolving stimuli from their academic encounters and may lead to temporary negative emotional states (Deer et al., 2018; Thomas & Cassady, 2021).
In contrast, a recent international study conducted by Nazir et al. (2021) revealed that female university students exhibited elevated levels of trait anxiety (M = 48.45, SD = 12.79, p <0.001) in comparison to their male counterparts, who demonstrated higher levels of state anxiety (M = 41.85, SD = 8.91, p <0.001). Previous research has indicated that the expression of trait anxiety among university students could be linked to specific personality traits and a consistent inclination towards experiencing anxiety in academic settings (Bados et al., 2010; Williams & Crawford, 2016).
The current study revealed that participants employ a range of medications to manage anxiety symptoms, with Benzodiazepines (BZDs) emerging as the most frequently utilized, followed by Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Antidepressants (ADTs) in succession. It is crucial to note that the data presented offer insights into the predominant medications used by the participants during the survey data collection period. Within this framework, anxiolytics encompass all psychotropic medications categorized as antidepressants, antipsychotics, BZDs, barbiturates, and other sedative-hypnotic drugs that target mild to severe anxiety symptoms (Morris et al., 2021).
It is crucial to highlight that inadequate treatment of anxiety through solely relying on anxiolytics without psychological monitoring can potentially result in adverse reactions or dependency among university students. This, in turn, can exacerbate the physical and mental health issues within this demographic (Morcerf & Acero, 2021).
The findings of this study indicate that slightly more than half of the university students sampled in the health field were utilizing anxiolytic medication. A greater prevalence of the usage of these medications was observed among female students and those enrolled in public universities. Furthermore, our investigation unveiled that a notable proportion of university students with elevated trait anxiety levels and those experiencing moderate state anxiety were resorting to anxiolytic medications. These outcomes enrich the existing understanding in this domain, highlighting the prevalence of state-trait anxiety symptoms among students and underscoring the significance of employing the IDATE as a screening tool for anxious symptoms within this demographic.
This research has the potential to enhance the field of health psychology by shedding light on the university environment. The study revealed a surprisingly high prevalence of anxiolytic drug consumption among university students, surpassing initial expectations given the setting (university) and the life stage of the demographic (young adulthood).
In the national context, there is a lack of studies examining the correlation between anxiety levels and the utilization of anxiolytics among students enrolled in various undergraduate programs within the health sector. Previous research predominantly concentrates on medical or nursing students, leaving a significant gap in understanding the broader student population. This gap poses a challenge for universities and researchers, necessitating further investigations to accurately depict the national landscape and facilitate the development of preventive measures. Additionally, such studies are crucial for assessing the effectiveness and implications of these interventions over time.
This study acknowledges several limitations that warrant consideration. Firstly, the cross-sectional design employed restricts the ability to draw definitive cause-and-effect relationships. Secondly, the small sample size utilized may compromise the generalizability of the findings. Nonetheless, the data collected could prove valuable for prospective longitudinal investigations, notwithstanding the constraint of sample size. Moreover, the utilization of a self-administered questionnaire introduces the potential for memory bias and participant interpretation of the questions. Furthermore, the sample is constrained in its representation of various types of higher education institutions, particularly lacking in adequate representation from public and community universities.
Another limitation of the study pertains to the sample composition, predominantly comprising women. To address this in future research, efforts could be made to achieve a more balanced representation of both genders through stratified or quota sampling methods. Caution is advised when generalizing the findings, given the overrepresentation of participants from Sergipe due to convenience sampling, which may not accurately reflect the broader Brazilian population. Consequently, it is recommended that future studies replicate this research while taking into account the aforementioned limitations.
Although this research has its limitations, it stands out as one of the pioneering studies exploring the relationship between anxiety and anxiolytic usage among university students enrolled in various health courses across the country, thereby lending credibility to the investigation. The findings revealed a prevalence of moderate to high levels of state and trait anxiety among these students, coupled with the utilization of anxiolytic medications. Consequently, it is evident that the university setting serves as a conducive platform for promoting health initiatives. Hence, there is a pressing need to support studies that assess anxiety levels and offer insights into effective management strategies, ultimately aiming to diminish the reliance on medication among the student population.
