Since December 2019, an epidemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged unexpectedly in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, rapidly disseminating from Wuhan to various regions within China and across international borders. Designated by the World Health Organization as COVID-19, this novel coronavirus disease derives its name from the fusion of "Corona," "Viruses," and "Disease," with a reference to the year 2019, marking its initial emergence. The General Directorate of Health of Portugal affirms that COVID-19 transmission can transpire through respiratory droplets, direct contact with respiratory secretions, exposure to infected feces or contaminated surfaces, and potentially through airborne means, facilitated by aerosol-generating procedures.
There is a relatively low incidence of reported COVID-19 cases in children compared to the general population. In February 2020, China reported 2.4% of the 75,465 cases in children, while Italy reported 1.2% and the United States reported 5%. Data from Portugal's General Directorate of Health as of March 29, 2020, indicated that 1% of children under 10 and 2.3% of adolescents between 11 and 19 had COVID-19, with no reported deaths in this age group. One possible explanation for the lower prevalence in children is their reduced exposure to the virus and fewer indications for SARS-CoV-2 testing due to mild flu-like symptoms. Children exhibit stronger innate immunity to respiratory infections compared to adults, with a superior adaptive immune response and less mature angiotensin-converting enzyme binding protein, potentially hindering viral attachment. Consequently, children may have a weaker acute inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, leading to better outcomes. However, serious cases and fatalities can still occur, particularly in children with underlying health conditions.
In relation to mother-fetus intrauterine vertical transmission, there remains a lack of scientific evidence to definitively establish its occurrence. Notably, COVID-19 has not been detected in breast milk. The primary concern lies in the potential transmission of the virus through respiratory droplets from an infected mother. Consequently, breastfeeding during maternal COVID-19 infection is not discouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. However, it is crucial to take necessary precautions to prevent virus transmission to the newborn, such as washing hands before contact and wearing a face mask. Moreover, strict adherence to guidelines for cleaning breast pumps after each use is recommended.
While the immediate risk of COVID-19 in children remains low, it is crucial to continuously monitor the situation and its progression. The current climate of concern surrounding COVID-19 can induce anxiety in children and their families. Various nations have enforced social confinement and distancing measures, necessitating the maintenance of a safe distance of approximately one meter from others and the avoidance of gatherings with more than five individuals. In the event of home confinement, parents often serve as the primary and most accessible source of support for their children. Engaging in games and play can serve as effective strategies for both distraction and communication with children. It is imperative that toys are regularly cleaned and disinfected using soap and water, a disinfectant, or a sodium hypochlorite solution (10 ml per 1 liter of water). Notably, this virus can be inactivated after a mere five minutes.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a significant global threat, having been classified as a Public Health emergency and an international priority by the World Health Organization. This virus is highly transmissible, and while the current incidence among children is relatively low, they are not immune to infection. The critical need for heightened awareness and enhanced infection control protocols cannot be overstated.
