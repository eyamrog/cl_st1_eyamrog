The Caatinga, spanning approximately 912,529 km², stands out as one of Brazil's most distinctive phytogeographic regions, characterized by varying vegetation patterns influenced by geographical factors. This research focused on conducting a comprehensive floristic survey of the ABA farm in Passagem, situated within the Paraíba backlands mesoregion. Over a four-year period, fortnightly botanical collections were meticulously carried out across all plant physiognomies on the farm, adhering to a standardized botanical protocol for floristic surveys and herborization techniques. The findings unveiled a significant floristic inventory, encompassing 322 species from 194 genera across 62 botanical families. Notably, Fabaceae (48 spp.), Euphorbiaceae (23 spp.), Convolvulaceae (21 spp.), Malvaceae (19 spp.), and Asteraceae (15 spp.) emerged as the families with the highest species diversity. The species exhibited diverse habits, including herbs (108 spp.), trees (59 spp.), subshrubs (56 spp.), shrubs (46 spp.), lianas (46 spp.), epiphytes, and parasites (four spp.). Furthermore, the study documented 38 new species records for the Paraíba State, underscoring the area's biological significance.
The Caatinga, situated in the northeastern semiarid region, covers an expanse of roughly 912,529 km² (Silva et al., 2017) and stands out as one of Brazil's most unique phytogeographic zones. Within the Caatinga domain, the flora boasts a diverse array of 5,022 species, with a significant concentration of 2,307 species identified in Paraíba State, as indicated by a recent study outlined in BFG (2021).
The Caatinga climate is characterized as semi-arid, giving rise to vegetation mosaics predominantly composed of deciduous, xerophilous, and prickly plants, with rainfall and precipitation being unevenly distributed over a span of three to six months (IBGE 2004, Silva et al. 2017). In the Northern backland depression, precipitation is more concentrated within this ecoregion compared to other areas of the Caatinga, ranging from 500 to 800 mm annually (Veloso et al. 2002).
Located in an area deemed of high biological significance in the Caatinga by MMA (2002), ABA Farm is situated within the mountain complex known as Aba, named after the river that traverses this geological formation. The entirety of its expanse showcases a variety of phytophysiognomies, featuring mountains reaching heights of up to 800 meters, dense and well-preserved tree-shrub caatinga intertwined with riparian forests, rupicolous flora, and open fields. Within these diverse habitats, one can observe riparian forests, open fields hosting exotic species, and montane vegetation, as highlighted by MMA (2002).
In the mesoregion of the Paraíba hinterland, recent floristic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of the state's flora, particularly in Caatinga areas. These studies, conducted over the past five years, have been instrumental in enhancing knowledge about the flora and vegetation of the region (Lucena et al. 2015, Torres et al. 2016, Brito et al. 2018, Costa et al. 2019, Fernando et al. 2021). The current research project entails a comprehensive floristic survey conducted at ABA farm, situated in the municipality of Passagem, Paraíba State, located in Northeast Brazil.
The municipality of Passagem is situated in the mesoregion of the Paraiba hinterland, bordered by Quixaba and São Mamede to the north, Taperoá and Cacimba to the south, and Cacimba de Areia to the east (IBGE, 2019) (Figure 1). The climate in this area is classified as semi-arid (Bsh), characterized by warm and dry conditions, with an average annual temperature of 25ºC (Francisco, 2015; IBGE, 2019).
The ABA farm is situated 4.6km away from the urban area of Passagem and covers an expanse of 350 hectares, with 120 hectares designated as legal reserve. While the majority of the farm is situated on a flat terrain, the caatingas extend to the mountains, characterized by undulating to strongly undulating topography, featuring elevations ranging from 300m to 810m, notably including the Aba Mountains and Preacas (Beltrão et al., 2005).
The mountainous terrain comprising the farm (Figure 2) exhibits a well-preserved vegetation, contrasting with the lower altitudes in the region. The prevalent vegetation consists of dense tree-shrubby formations, interspersed with patches of open shrubby caatinga, riparian forests along a seasonal river, rupicolous, and aquatic vegetation. Despite the anthropogenic activities like cattle and goat husbandry and subsistence farming prevalent in the area, these practices are confined to the vicinity of the mountains or near residential areas, sparing the mountainous regions. The data collection process involved floristic sampling conducted between 2014 and 2017, during which botanical collections were gathered through exploratory and random walks across the study area to encompass a broad range of phytophysiognomies. Specimens were carefully collected using established techniques and methods, with botanical materials prepared in accordance with standard taxonomic parameters (Judd et al., 2009; IBGE, 2012). Essential details for taxonomic identification were meticulously recorded in a field book, alongside photographic documentation, geographic coordinates, landscape descriptions, and soil characteristics.
The gathered material was added to the HCSTR collection, as per the acronym defined by Thiers in 2022, a collection that is regularly updated. Specimens were identified through the assistance of specialized literature and examinations conducted by experts. The floristic list was organized alphabetically by family and species, with the classification of botanical families following the guidelines of the "Angiosperm Phylogeny Group" (APG IV 2016). To verify the accuracy of scientific names, electronic databases such as Flora do Brasil (BFG 2021) and Tropicos (http://www.tropicos.org) were consulted.
A total of 322 species and 194 genera, spread across 62 botanical families, were identified in the study. Among the Pteridophytes, two families were observed, with Selaginella convoluta (Arn.) Spring being the dominant species present in all vegetation types on the farm, particularly in the riparian forest. Angiosperms were the most prevalent group in the area, with 60 families documented, including two basal Angiosperms (Annonaceae and Aristolochiaceae) represented by Annona leptopetala (R.E.Fr.) H.Rainer and Aristolochia birostris Duch.
Eudicotyledons were the predominant group within angiosperms, comprising 47 families, with Fabaceae (48 species), Euphorbiaceae (23 species), Convolvulaceae (21 species), Malvaceae (19 species), and Asteraceae (15 species) being the most notable. Among Monocotyledons, 11 families were identified, primarily represented by Poaceae (nine species), Bromeliaceae (six species), Commelinaceae (six species), and Cyperaceae (five species), which were frequently observed in the study area.
Among the genera, Ipomoea L. was the most represented with nine species, followed by Euphorbia L., Oxalis L., and Tillandsia L., each with five species. In terms of life forms, herbaceous species were the most predominant with 108 species, followed by trees (59 species), subshrubs (56 species), shrubs (46 species), lianas (46 species), and epiphytes and parasitic forms (four species). A comprehensive list of all species can be found in Table 1.
Thirty-eight new species occurrences were documented in Paraíba State, with one of these representing new genus occurrences: Eriope Kunth ex Benth. Additionally, three new occurrences were noted within the Caatinga domain: Helicteres andersonii Cristóbal (Malvaceae), Niedenzuella multiglandulosa (A. Juss.) WR Anderson (Malpighiaceae), and Oxalis latifolia Kunth (Oxalidaceae). Furthermore, two newly described species, Harpochilus paraibanus F.K.S. Monteiro, J.I.M Melo & E.M.P. Fernando and Mesosphaerum caatingense Harley & J.F.B. Pastore, were identified based on studies by Monteiro et al. (2018) and Harley et al. (2019).
The discovery of Eriope Bonpl. ex Benth. with the species Eriope macrostachya Mart. ex Benth. in Paraíba State marks a novel occurrence of the genus in this region. This shrub, belonging to the Lamiaceae family, was observed in a flowering state from April to July and in a fruiting state in August, specifically at an elevation of 810m, the highest point within the ABA farm. Additionally, the identification of Niedenzuella multiglandulosa (A.Juss.) W.R. Anderson signifies a new botanical record within the Caatinga domain. This vine, characterized by yellow flowers, was predominantly located within the riparian woods of the farm.
Two novel species were identified at the ABA Farm by Monteiro et al. (2018) and Harley et al. (2019). The first species belongs to the Acanthaceae family, specifically the genus Harpochilus Nees, characterized as a shrub species with a cream yellow inflorescence named Harpochilus paraibanus FKS Monteiro, JIM Melo & EMP Fernando, documented in the Paraíba semiarid region (Monteiro et al. 2018). The second species, discovered in the same location, hails from the Lamiaceae family under the genus Mesosphaerum P. Browne, identified as a subshrub endemic to the Caatinga biome, with its range spanning across the States of Paraíba, Pernambuco, and Rio Grande do Norte, christened as Mesosphaerum caatingense Harley & J.F.B. Pastore (Harley et al. 2019).
The riparian forest on the farm boasts a diverse array of vegetation, with prevalent species including Microdesmia rigida (Benth.) Sothers & Prance (Oiticica), Erythrina velutina Willd. (Mulungu), Tabebuia aurea (Silva Manso) Benth. & Hook.f. ex S.Moore (Craibeira), Lonchocarpus sericeus (Poir.) Kunth ex DC. (Ingazeira), and Sapium glandulosum (L.) Morong. (Leiteiro). Additionally, the less common species Sebastiana riparia Schrad can be observed in proximity to the water streams within the area.
Several floristic studies have been conducted in Caatinga regions within Paraíba, as documented by Santos et al. (2010), Lucena et al. (2015), Silva et al. (2015), and Gadelha-Neto et al. (2018), revealing a shared species similarity with the present study. Consistent with prior research, Fabaceae emerges as the most prominent family in terms of species abundance at the ABA Farm, underscoring its significance as one of the prevalent plant families within the Caatinga ecosystem.
The study area shows promise for preservation owing to its high rates of endemism, with 94 species exclusive to Brazil. Among these species are Trianthema portulacastrum L., Ruellia bahiensis (Nees) Morong, and Harpochilus paraibanus F.K.S. Monteiro, J.I.M. Melo & E.M.P. Fernando, which are unique to the Caatinga region (BFG 2021).
Moreover, within this floristic survey, it is noteworthy that herbs constitute the predominant habit, with a total of 108 species identified. This contrasts with findings from other plant surveys, such as those conducted by Silva et al. (2015) and Gadelha-Neto et al. (2018), where woody plants were found to be the prevailing habit. Various factors could potentially explain this dominance of herbaceous species: the environmental conditions in the study area may be particularly conducive to herb growth, thereby fostering a higher diversity of herbaceous species. Alternatively, this prevalence of herbs could be attributed to a lack of comprehensive collections focusing on the herbaceous stratum in previous studies conducted in similar environments.
The ABA farm is a highly preserved area, housing exotic species unique to the vicinity of the residences. It boasts a remarkable species richness, with a total of 322 species identified, including 38 new records. Designated by the MMA (Ministry of the Environment) as a Caatinga area susceptible to desertification, it holds significant conservation value. The findings of this study will play a crucial role in establishing an RPPN (Private Natural Heritage Reserve) on the farm and developing its management plan.
