Cleaning interactions are interspecific associations in which cleaners benefit from hosts by feeding on parasites, injured tissues, or blood. Globally, there is a notable diversity of birds that act as cleaners of large mammals. This study delves into the drivers influencing the structure of networks formed by cleaning birds and host mammals, utilizing two cleaner-host networks from Brazilian and African openlands. The investigation aims to uncover the link between diet generalism and cleaning behavior. The hypothesis posits that cleaning interactions are typically opportunistic, suggesting that generalist species play a pivotal role in cleaner-host networks. Initially, the study contrasts the diet diversity of cleaner species with their closely related non-cleaning counterparts. Out of 26 bird families examined, 18 exhibit higher diet diversity among cleaners compared to their non-cleaning relatives. Subsequently, the research explores whether birds with more diverse diets hold central positions in cleaner-host networks. Surprisingly, the findings reveal no clear correlation between species centrality in the networks and their diet diversity. It is proposed that generalism enables opportunistic species to partake in cleaning interactions, yet a cleaner species' significance is influenced by other factors such as abundance and behavioral traits associated with cleaning behavior. These results suggest that the criteria enabling species to engage in ecological networks may differ from those governing their roles within the networks themselves.
In ecological communities, interactions among different species play a crucial role in connecting individuals. These ecological interactions have significant implications for population ecology (Macarthur, 1955; Jordano, 2016) and evolutionary processes (Drossel et al., 2001; Guimarães et al., 2011), influencing the maintenance of biodiversity within the community (Paine, 1966; Fontaine et al., 2006; Hale et al., 2020). Within communities, these interactions often give rise to complex networks as pairs of species engage with each other (Pascual & Dunne, 2006; Jordano et al., 2006). Various types of interactions, such as mutualisms between plants and their seed dispersers or pollinators (Bascompte et al., 2003), predator-prey relationships among mammals (Pires & Guimarães, 2013), facilitative interactions among plant species (Verdú, 2010), and cleaning interactions among fish (Guimarães et al., 2007), form diverse networks that exhibit a range of nonrandom patterns. These patterns include nestedness (e.g., Guimarães et al., 2007; Bascompte et al., 2003) and modularity (e.g., Olesen et al., 2007).
Nestedness and modularity patterns in ecological networks reveal asymmetries and organization in species interactions. Nestedness suggests that species with many interactions form a core, while those with fewer interactions tend not to interact with each other. On the other hand, modularity indicates that interactions are grouped into modules, semi-isolated clusters of densely connected species. These structured patterns in networks reflect variations in specialization levels, generalism, and niche overlap across different interactions. The ecological network's structure can encode processes that shape interactions and influence community organization, highlighting the importance of understanding these patterns in ecological research.
In a basic scenario, individuals from different species are considered generalists, engaging with partners opportunistically, such as by consuming resources as they become available in the environment. Despite compelling evidence showing deviations from expected interaction patterns based on resource availability (Olesen et al. 2011; Kuebbing et al. 2013; Pekkonen et al. 2013), the premise that individuals behave as opportunistic foragers provides valuable insights into the structure of ecological networks. Specifically, individual-level opportunism suggests that, at the species level, variations in the number of interactions among species would be linked to species abundances (Vazquez et al. 2007; Krishna et al. 2008).
Several network patterns can be elucidated by variations in species abundance (Vázquez et al., 2005, 2007; Lewinsohn et al., 2006), indicating that opportunism plays a pivotal role in the structuring of numerous ecological networks. Opportunism enables species to partake in diverse interactions, accessing new resources and shaping interconnected species networks at the community level. For species to engage in novel interactions, they must possess traits and behaviors that facilitate interactions with a wide array of individuals and species. Therefore, the initiation of new interactions and opportunistic behavior is not solely dictated by resource availability but also by the diversity of resource consumption.
While opportunism plays a significant role in certain ecological networks, it is important to note that opportunistic species coexist alongside highly specialized lifestyles within these networks. Some of these specialized lifestyles involve extreme specialization, where certain species interact exclusively with single partners, as seen in gall-making insects, floral parasites, myrmecophytes, and anemonefishes. On the other hand, there are highly specialized species that are highly connected within the network, relying on a diverse array of partners for their survival. Examples of these highly connected species include obligate nectarivorous insects, obligate frugivorous birds, cleaner fishes, hypercarnivores, and specialized cleaning birds like the oxpeckers. By examining how ecological networks integrate both opportunistic and specialized species, we can gain valuable insights into the processes that have led to the development of species-rich communities of interacting organisms.
In this study, we utilized cleaning interactions among birds and mammals as a study system to investigate the impact of opportunism and specialized lifestyles on ecological networks. Cleaning interactions, involving clients and cleaners, are observed in various marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In terrestrial environments, numerous bird species partake in cleaning interactions with mammalian herbivores, showcasing a diverse global distribution of this behavior (e.g. Ruggiero and Ewes 1988, Sazima 2007a). The cleaners, typically birds, derive benefits from the hosts, large mammals, by consuming parasites, injured tissue, or blood (Ivan Sazima 2011). While these interactions often yield advantages for the cleaner individual, the effects on clients can vary, ranging from negative to neutral to positive outcomes. In most instances, cleaning behavior is facultative for birds; however, certain species like caracaras (Falconidae) and some tyranid birds exhibit stereotyped cleaning behaviors. Notably, in African savannahs, oxpeckers (Buphagus spp.) are specialized cleaners heavily reliant on these interactions for feeding resources. Consequently, the variability in opportunism and specialization within cleaning interactions prompted us to explore the role of opportunism in shaping these ecological relationships.
We propose that opportunism enables species to engage in cleaning interactions as a means of acquiring resources. From this hypothesis, we have formulated two specific predictions. Firstly, we anticipate that cleaners will exhibit a broader dietary range compared to their closely related counterparts (see Fig 1A). This expectation is grounded in the idea that opportunistic species, already possessing generalist diets, will incorporate additional resources such as mammalian ectoparasites and damaged fleshy tissues. Secondly, we predict that opportunistic species will engage with a greater number of mammalian hosts, particularly those utilized by the majority of other cleaning species, positioning them as central figures within the network (refer to Fig 1B). To evaluate these predictions, we analyze two continent-wide networks detailing the natural history of cleaning interactions between birds and mammalian hosts in Africa and South America (Sazima et al. 2012; Mikula et al. 2017).
To investigate how the diversity of bird diets influences cleaning associations among birds that act as cleaners feeding on parasites or injured tissue of mammals (clients), we initially computed a diversity diet index (H) for all bird species using the Elton Traits database, specifically EltonTraits 1.0: Species-level foraging attributes of the world’s birds and mammals (Wilman H, et al. 2014). Within this database, the diet of each bird species is classified into broad diet categories (Supplementary figure 1 a), which we utilized to gauge the diet diversity of each bird species by calculating the Shannon’s Diversity Index (Shannon 1948): <>, where Hj represents the diet diversity of species j, R denotes the number of diet categories (resources), and pi signifies the proportion of diet category i in the diet of species j. Essentially, a higher H value indicates a greater diversity of diet resources that each individual of the species can consume. Building upon the two aforementioned predictions (figure 1), we segmented the methods into two sections: section (a) and section (b). In section (a), we compared the H values of cleaner bird species from Brazilian and African cleaning networks (Sazima et al. 2012; Mikula et al. 2017) with the H values observed in non-cleaning closely related species. Moving to section (b), we examined whether the H values exhibit a correlation with the centrality degree of both networks. A visual representation of the methods is encapsulated in figure 2.
The H values of the cleaning bird species observed in Brazil and Africa, as documented in previous works by Sazima et al. (2012) and Mikula et al. (2017), were calculated. From the identified cleaning bird species, we determined the families to which these species belonged, totaling 26 families. Subsequently, we compared the mean H values of these 26 bird families, excluding the observed cleaners, with the mean H values of only the cleaners within the same families (refer to Fig 2). Our objective was to investigate a potential bias towards generalist diet habits among cleaners, operating under the hypothesis that these cleaners would represent the species within their families exhibiting greater diversification in feeding habits. For further insights into the calculated H values of the species and families, please refer to Supplementary Fig. 1.
To elucidate the distinctions in means between the H values of families and cleaners, a Paired T-Test was employed to ascertain if the mean disparity between these two groups of H is statistically significant. Additionally, calculations were conducted to determine the standard deviation and P-value associated with the analysis.
The centrality degree of the Brazilian and African networks (Sazima et al., 2012; Mikula et al., 2017) was analyzed by calculating the number of host species with which the cleaner species interacted. Our focus was on the degree measure, where nodes (species) with a greater variety of interactions are considered central. Subsequently, we conducted a comparison between the centrality degree of each bird species and their H value through regression analysis. Our hypothesis posited that bird species engaging with a wide range of hosts (i.e., more links with different mammal species) would exhibit higher H values, indicating a positive correlation between these two measures (see Fig. 2). For specific information on host species and H values for each bird species, please refer to Supplementary Fig. 2.
The average diversity of cleaners tends to exhibit higher values compared to non-cleaners across most families. Among the 26 families examined in Brazil and Africa, 18 showed significantly greater mean diversity among the cleaners, as illustrated in Figure 3. For instance, within the Charadriidae family, the H mean value stood at approximately 0.268 when non-cleaners were included (comprising roughly 93% of the family members). However, when focusing solely on the cleaners (representing approximately 6% of the family members), the H value surged to about 1.265.
Some families, such as Coraciidae, Cuculidae, and Furnariidae, were examined with only one species designated as a cleaner species. However, there appears to be a trend indicating that cleaner species exhibit a more diverse diet compared to other species within their respective families. For instance, within the Furnariidae family, the H mean value was approximately 0.113 when excluding the cleaners, which constitute around 99.5% of the family members. In contrast, when considering only the cleaner species, the H value increased to about 0.5, representing approximately 0.45% of the family members. Detailed values can be found in Supplementary Figure 1b.
Drawing upon the works of Sazima et al. (2012) and Mikula et al. (2017, we undertook the reconstruction of cleaning interaction networks in Brazil (Pantanal) and Africa. Employing a heat map, we aimed to discern the diet diversity index associated with each bird species (refer to Fig. 4). Furthermore, the size of nodes within these networks serves to indicate the centrality degree, with larger nodes denoting bird species engaging in interactions with a broader array of host species.
When examining the centrality degree of birds within networks alongside the H value of each bird species, no clear relationship emerges between H and the centrality degree values. This lack of correlation suggests that there are no significant results indicating a direct link between these two variables, as illustrated in Figure 5.
Cleaning interactions among birds and mammals display a remarkable diversity of species and contexts. By examining two distinct networks, varying in size and location, we were able to discern patterns in facultative interactions from a broader viewpoint. Species with a broad range of consumption behaviors may partake in various types of interactions, including facultative interactions like cleaning symbiosis. When a bird encounters an opportunity, defined here as the presence of a mammal hosting food resources, its ability to capitalize on this opportunity is shaped by the species' natural history. Our findings indicate that, for most cleaners, the capacity to consume diverse resources is a crucial factor in participating in cleaning interactions. Given the significance of consumption diversity in these interactions, structural patterns like centrality degree may also be influenced by the range of consumption. The aim of this analysis is to comprehend the implications of resource consumption within the community. The analysis of network centrality degree reveals no correlation between centrality degree and the diet diversity index of bird species, indicating that the ability to consume various resources does not impact a species' centrality within the network.
Opportunism is a prevalent behavior observed among bird species, exemplified by caracaras (Falconidae) that exhibit a diverse diet including fruits, carcasses, and arthropods. These birds engage in interactions with a wide array of mammals, suggesting a potentially pivotal role within the community network. Despite their generalist consumption habits and interactions with various host species, caracaras deviate from the norm in cleaning interactions, as there is no significant correlation between centrality degree and dietary diversity. This absence of correlation implies that generalism and specialism behaviors encompass multiple dimensions. Different levels of organization influence biodiversity patterns, as highlighted by Levin (1992). While some cleaner birds, like Oxpeckers (Buphagus sp.), are generalists in their network interactions across different host species, they are specialized in consuming parasites residing on large mammals. This specialization in consumption, despite the varied morphologies and physiologies of the parasites, distinguishes Oxpeckers as specialists. This specialized behavior, stemming from opportunistic tendencies crucial for facultative interactions, fosters intimate relationships between cleaners and their frequent hosts.
These organisms rely on resources provided by the network, such as arthropods, injured tissue, or blood, rather than specific hosts. Referred to as supergeneralists, these highly connected species, as identified by Jordano et al. (2003) and Thompson (2005), exhibit specialized lifestyles that are reliant on the network for survival. Within the community, these supergeneralists play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and functionality of the ecosystem. The specialization of diet within central species is not unique to cleaning networks, as dietary specialization is also observed in other supergeneralists. For instance, species with higher centrality degrees in seed-dispersal networks exhibit centrality, which is primarily explained by dietary specialization, as highlighted by Mello et al. (2014).
In this study, we have examined the structure of interactions and the natural history of bird species engaged in facultative interactions, with the goal of untangling the intricacies of bird-mammal cleaning communities. While understanding the history of resources consumed and the centrality degree are crucial for deciphering interaction patterns, each factor plays a distinct role in shaping the community composition. Our findings suggest that the factors enabling species to participate in ecological community networks differ from those influencing their role within these networks. Factors like species abundance can dictate degree centrality, indicating that a species' role is not universally determined by structural generalism. Instead, a species' role is intricately tied to its natural history and its involvement in various types of interactions.
