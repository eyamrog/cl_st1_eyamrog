The expansion of the agricultural frontier in the northern region of Río Negro has led to the utilization of plateau land for dryland livestock farming, resulting in an ecological imbalance impacting the spontaneous plant species in the scrublands. This study aimed to identify the spontaneously growing species in the area, determine their specific richness and distribution, and establish relationships between native species and cattle consumption, as well as exotic species and their toxic potential. The Sörensen similarity index was employed to quantify the similarity between different sites. The research area encompassed 59 families, 197 genera, and 300 species of vascular plants, with the most prominent families being Asteraceae, Poaceae, Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Verbenaceae, and Chenopodiaceae. A significant proportion of the consumed species were native, while 66% of the exotic species were found to be potentially toxic to cattle. The Riparian Zone exhibited a higher number of exotic species, and the Plateau Plain showed the highest similarity with the Foot of Escarpment. These findings serve as a foundational resource for future evaluative studies concerning the interplay between dryland cattle production and plant conservation in the Middle Valley of Río Negro.
The province of Río Negro constitutes a significant portion of the arid and semi-arid territory in Argentina. Various factors including hydrology, topography, geomorphology, and climatic conditions such as low rainfall and fluctuating temperatures play a crucial role in determining the type and spatial distribution of vegetation in this region (Bisigato et al. 2009; Fernández et al. 2017). From a phytogeographic perspective, the northern part of Río Negro falls within the southern sector of the Phytogeographic Province of Monte (Cabrera 1976; Morrone 2014; Fernández et al. 2017; Oyarzabal et al. 2018). The plateau sector of this area is characterized by xerophytic shrub species, often aphyllous, with photosynthesizing stems, spiny structures, or small deciduous or perennial leaves, sometimes coated with waxes or resins. Dominant among these species are those from the Larrea Cav. genus, specifically "jarilla" species like L. divaricata Cav., L. cuneifolia Cav., and L. nítida Cav. of the Zygophyllaceae family. The vast "jarillales" (low scrubland) are intermingled with plants from diverse families such as Anacardiaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Verbenaceae, and halophyte species like Atriplex L. and Suaeda Forssk. ex J.F.Gmel. (Chenopodiaceae). Additionally, smaller clusters of "chilladora" (Chuquiraga erinacea D.Don, Asteraceae), "mata cebo" (Monttea aphylla (Miers) Benth. & Hook., Scrophulariaceae), and "chañar" (Geoffroea decorticans (Gillies ex Hook. & Arn.) Burkart, Fabaceae) are common, along with cacti, various annual and perennial herbs, and grasses that thrive in the protective cover of shrub patches. Grass species like Jarava Ruíz & Pav., Nassella Desv., and Poa L. dominate the herbaceous layer, while Salix humboltiana Willd. is distinctive along the banks of the Rio Negro river. Additionally, several exotic species from families like Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Fabaceae, and Salicaceae, as well as introduced shrubs like Elaeagnus angustifolia L. (Elaeagnaceae), Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. (Tamaricaceae), and Rosa rubiginosa L. (Rosaceae) are commonly found in the region (Klich 2016).
The relocation of the agricultural frontier to northern Patagonia towards the close of the 20th century led to a significant transformation of the valley regions into crucial agricultural production hubs, predominantly featuring orchards and pastures. The development of intricate irrigation systems played a pivotal role in advancing these agricultural ventures. Simultaneously, the non-irrigated arid lands were utilized for extensive grazing of domestic herbivores. The primary food source for these herbivores comprises the indigenous vegetation that thrives on the plateau, particularly in the context of cattle husbandry (Zeberio, 2012).
Livestock practices, encompassing activities such as land clearing, road construction, pasture demarcation, water supply installation, and fence building, significantly contribute to ecological imbalance. These disruptions not only facilitate degradation processes but also pave the way for the introduction and invasion of exotic species, ultimately leading to a decline and fragmentation in native species populations (Derner et al., 2009; Milchunas & Lauenroth, 1993). Furthermore, some of these invasive species harbor chemical components that are potentially toxic to cattle, resulting in the deterioration of natural pastures (Bisigato et al., 2005; Krikor & Hierro, 2011; Marino, 2008; Peralta & Klich, in press).
Furthermore, Cingolani (2008) and Zeberio et al. (2008) have posited that a comprehensive comprehension of the system and its inherent characteristics could facilitate the preservation of biodiversity within scrublands and foster the sustainable growth of extensive cattle production.
In light of this, there exists a necessity for precise data pertaining to the land allocated for livestock farming to effectively utilize the natural vegetation resources. Therefore, the current study seeks to examine the indigenous plant species thriving on the expanses designated for extensive cattle rearing in the Middle Valley of Río Negro. Understanding the vegetation present will aid in formulating conservation tactics at a localized level.
The research was conducted in the drylands of the Middle Valley of Rio Negro and its surrounding areas (38º50' to 39º55' S: 65º15' to 66º35' W) as depicted in Figure 1. Typically, this region is primarily utilized for extensive cattle farming, particularly for breeding purposes, with a limited presence of feedlots in this rainfed environment (Klich et al., 2020).
The region experiences an average annual temperature of 15.4°C and receives an average precipitation of 268 mm. Furthermore, fires, whether natural or intentional, occur frequently, leading to significant alterations in the structure and composition of the vegetation.
Four sites were delineated based on relief characteristics, including plateaus, alluvial plains, and flood plains: Riparian Zone (RZ), Valley Plain (VP), Foot of Escarpment (FE), and Plateau Plain (PP).
The floristic survey was conducted at various times throughout the year in natural areas subject to anthropogenic activity. Standard species recognition techniques were employed to classify taxonomic groups. Collection trips to the study site were conducted periodically, considering climatic conditions and cattle rotation in different pastures. Phenological observations were documented, and photographs of plants and their habitats were taken simultaneously. Specimens were preserved, and environmental data were meticulously recorded. To identify species and determine their biogeographic origin (native/exotic), specific references were consulted (Correa 1999; Kröpfl et al. 2012; Velasco & Siffredi, 2009; Zuloaga et al. 2008), along with electronic databases like SIB (www.sib.gov.ar) and the Catalogue of Flora Argentina from the Darwinion Botanical Institute (www2.darwin.edu.ar/Proyectos/FloraArgentina/FA.asp).
The study involved determining the proportion of herbs, shrubs, and trees, followed by calculating the richness and representativeness of families concerning the total species recorded at each sampling site. The identification of species with toxic potential was then correlated with their biogeographic origin. The Sörensen Similarity Index (IS) was utilized to quantify the similarity between two sites based on the presence or absence of species (Sörensen 1948). Furthermore, fieldwork was enhanced through observations and guided walks with producers, yielding valuable insights into spontaneous forage resources. To supplement this data, bibliographic sources and preliminary findings from microhistological fecal analysis were incorporated.
The distribution of vegetation in the area exhibits significant heterogeneity, with a total of 59 families, 197 genera, and 300 species being identified. The comprehensive list detailing the families, genera, and species found at each surveyed site can be found in Annex 1.
Table 1 presents the 59 families of plants identified within the study area, detailing the number of species within each family and their respective percentage of representation. Notably, the Asteraceae family emerges as the most prevalent, encompassing 20% of the total species observed. Following closely are the Poaceae family with 15.66% representation, Fabaceae with 8.66%, Solanaceae with 6%, Verbenaceae with 4%, and Chenopodiaceae with 3.33%. Additionally, there exist 47 families with less than 2% representation, such as Zygophyllaceae with 1.33% (4 species), Anacardiaceae with 0.66% (2 species), and Elaeagnaceae with 0.33% (1 species), which exhibit a notable abundance of individual plants.
Among the identified species, 70.67% were classified as native while 29.33% were categorized as exotic (Fig. 2a). The exotic species predominantly inhabit regions characterized by higher levels of disturbance, including tracks, roadsides, fencelines, and power lines. These specific areas within natural landscapes experience frequent vehicular traffic, primarily from trucks and agricultural machinery originating outside the Middle Valley, serving as vectors for the transportation of seeds and other propagules of these non-native species. The disruption caused by land clearing activities further alters the structure and composition of plant communities. For instance, activities like fence maintenance and surrounding area clearance, as investigated by Peralta et al. (unpublished) in two agricultural establishments within the Middle Valley, represent a recurring pattern across the region.
In terms of plant habit, the majority consisted of herbaceous dicotyledons, with shrubs and sub-shrubs following closely behind. Monocotyledonous herbs, predominantly Poaceae at 84%, were also prevalent, while the arboreal habit was the least represented (Fig. 2b).
In examining the correlation between these plant species and cattle, it is evident that 30% (93 species) of the total identified taxa are consumed. Among these, herbaceous species were the most consumed, accounting for 55 species (59%), with 31 of them being grasses. The shrub or sub-shrub category constituted 33% (31 species), while the remaining species belonged to the arboreal habit, as illustrated in Figure 3a.
Although forage grasses are abundant, the significance of shrub species in consumption is noteworthy. Initial findings from microhistological analysis of cattle feces (Klich & Peralta, 2019; Klich et al., unpublished) indicate that certain taxa, including Lycium L., Larrea, Schinus L., Prosopis L., Elaeagnus angustifolia, Atriplex lampa (Moq.) D.Dietr., and Ephedra ochreata Miers, are consumed at comparable frequencies to many grass species. This observation is intriguing given the high prevalence of these species within the Monte ecoregion community. Additionally, it is worth noting that over 70% of the consumed species are native (see Fig. 3b).
As highlighted in preceding sections, the prevalence of exotic species tends to rise in areas subjected to cultivation, frequent machinery traffic, or overgrazed pastures. This trend poses a significant concern as 66% of these species (51 in total) are either toxic or potentially harmful to cattle. Various scholars (Krikor & Hierro, 2011; Peralta & Klich, forthcoming) concur with this observation and have issued cautions regarding the introduction of adventitious species into disturbed environments, many of which exhibit detrimental traits for cattle farming (see Fig. 3c). Notable examples of such adventitious species include Conium maculatum L. (Apiaceae), Diplotaxis tenuifolia (L.) DC., Hirschfeldia incana (L.) Lagr.-Foss., Sisymbrium irio L. (Brassicaceae), Vicia villosa Roth., Trifolium repens L. (Fabaceae), and Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (Poaceae).
Data analysis was conducted for the four identified sites: Plateau Plain (PP), Foot of Escarpment (FE), Valley Plain (VP), and Riparian Zone (RZ). The distribution and number of taxa in these areas are presented in Table 2. The data reveals that the Riparian Zone (RZ) and Valley Plain (VP) were the sites with the highest richness in terms of families, genera, and species, with percentages of 72.88%, 59.39%, and 47% for RZ, and 54.23%, 55.84%, and 54.33% for VP, respectively.
Only 13 families out of the total 59 families present in the area were common across all four sites, including Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Boraginaceae, Brassicaceae, Calyceraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Plantaginaceae, Poaceae, Solanaceae, Verbenaceae, and Zygophyllaceae. Additional families were identified in three out of the four sites. Specifically, the sites PP-FE-VP, with the exception of RZ, shared 13 families, while the FE-VP-RZ sites, excluding PP, exhibited 7 shared families.
At the specific level, four species of Asteraceae are distributed in all sites (Centaurea calcitrapa L., C. solstitialis L., Gaillardia megapotamica (Spreng.) Baker, and Gamochaeta filaginea (DC.) Cabrera), all of which are common in highly disturbed areas. Following Asteraceae, the Poaceae family is represented by three species (Bromus catharticus Vahl. var. catharticus, Hordeum murinum L., and Nassella tenuis (Phil.) Barkworth), serving as the primary forage plants in the region. Two species of Brassicaceae, Eruca vesicaria Mill. and Sisymbrium irio, both exotic species, are frequently observed along road verges and tracks near power lines. Additionally, four families each have a single species in the four sites: Amsinckia calycina (Moris) Chater (Boraginaceae), Stellaria media (L.) Cirillo (Caryophyllaceae) (found under shrubs in PP and FE), Euphorbia collina Phil. (Euphorbiaceae), and Plantago patagonica Jacq. (Plantaginaceae).
P. patagonica and G. filaginea are indigenous species frequently observed covering extensive areas, particularly in regions subject to prolonged periods of intensive grazing or inadequate recovery periods.
On the contrary, distinct families were identified at each site (Table 3), except for PB. Within the RZ, a total of 14 families were observed, including representatives of aquatic environments such as Arecaceae (3 species), Ceratophyllaceae, Hydrocharitaceae, and Salviniaceae (1 species each). The remaining families were typical of humid and partially shaded habitats, such as Asparagaceae (1 species), Campanulaceae (1 species), Cyperaceae (2 species), Oxalidaceae (1 species), Typhaceae (1 species), and Vitacaea (1 species). Additionally, Portulacaceae (2 species) and Tamaricacae (1 species) were found in open sandy areas. The Salicaceae (3 species) and Ulmaceae (1 species), characterized by their arboreal nature, formed dense thickets along the riverbanks, often impenetrable, with leaves that cattle consumed in autumn. In the PP site, exclusive families included Shoepfiaceae (1 species - Arjona tuberosa Cav.), Orobanchaceae (Agalinis communis (Cham. & Schltdl.) D’Arcy), and Hydrophyllaceae (Phacelia Juss. 3 species). No unique families were identified in the FE site, while only one (Apocynaceae - Tweedia brunonis Hook. & Arn.) was exclusive to the VP site.
In terms of species distribution based on their origin, it is evident that the majority of species across all sites are native. The PP and FE sites (Fig. 4a and 4b) exhibited the highest proportions of native species, with percentages reaching 87% and 82%, respectively, while the RZ site (Fig. 4c) had 51% native species. Conversely, the RZ (Fig. 4d) and VP sites showed the highest percentages of exotic species, potentially attributed to higher levels of traffic in these areas, as well as being residential or work areas for landowners and employees. Additionally, their proximity to the river, a significant vector for propagule and plant transport, could also contribute to the prevalence of exotic species in these locations.
Figure 5 illustrates the correlation between the species consumed and their respective origins, with PP and FE exhibiting the highest percentage of native species consumed (Fig. 5a-b). Notably, a greater number of species with a shrub or sub-shrub habit were consumed compared to grasses, as evidenced by PP consuming 33 species of shrubs or sub-shrubs and 25 species of grasses, while FE consumed 20 species and 15 species, respectively. In contrast, RZ (Fig. 5d) displayed a lower percentage of consumed native species, primarily herbaceous in nature (25 herbaceous dicots and 8 grass species), which stands in stark contrast to the overall area findings (Fig. 3b).
The Figure 6 illustrates the toxic or potentially toxic species for cattle present at each of the sites.
As noted broadly, the prevalence of toxic or potentially toxic species is predominantly of exotic origin. Site-specific analysis reveals that the RZ and VP areas exhibited a higher proportion of exotic toxic species compared to native ones, whereas the PP and FE regions showcased a higher percentage of native toxic species (including Asclepias mellodora A.St.-Hil., Baccharis ulicina Hook. & Arn., Euphorbia collina, E. serpens Kunth, E. hieronymi Subils, Clematis montevidensis Spreng., Nierembergia linariaefolia Graham, Nicotiana noctiflora Hook., Solanum triflorum Nutt.) than exotic ones (refer to Fig. 7).
The Sörensen similarity index (SI) was computed for the four sampled sites (Table 4). Broadly speaking, the SI suggests that the four sites had at least one species in common. The highest level of similarity was noted between PM and PB, which is reasonable given their proximity, while PM and ZR exhibited a lower degree of species overlap. This lower similarity between PM and ZR was anticipated due to the distinct environmental conditions of the two sites. Furthermore, the shared taxa (24 species) are species that were also identified in other locations and are typically known for thriving in disturbed habitats, showcasing a remarkable adaptability to such environments.
The findings of this study indicate that the semiarid livestock fields in the Middle Valley of the Río Negro maintain the native vegetation typical of the Monte ecoregion. The Asteraceae family boasts the highest number of species (60 sp.), followed by Poaceae (47 sp.), Fabaceae (26 sp.), Solanaceae (18 sp.), Verbenaceae (12 sp.), and Chenopodiaceae (10 sp.). A significant 72% of the native species are consumed by cattle, while 66% of exotic species are either toxic or potentially toxic. The introduction of exotic species has been primarily observed in areas with higher levels of disturbance, such as those subjected to maintenance activities or traversed by various vehicles. This trend is particularly pronounced in the Riparian Zone.
The Plateau Plain exhibits the highest specific richness among the studied sites, with the Riparian Zone, Valley Plain, and Foot of Escarpment following in descending order.
In terms of the Similarity Index calculation, the Valley Plain and the Foot of Escarpment emerged as the sites with the highest number of shared species. Conversely, the Valley Plain and the Riparian Zone exhibited the lowest Similarity Index, indicating a minimal overlap in species, limited to those with widespread distribution.
In conclusion, the data acquired in this analysis can provide a foundation for future studies aiming to conduct a thorough assessment of the correlation between livestock production and the preservation of plant diversity within the expanses utilized for extensive livestock farming in the Middle Valley of Río Negro.
