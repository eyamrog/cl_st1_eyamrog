The study aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of a set of scales measuring job satisfaction in Peruvian physicians across various domains such as general professional activity, health services management, and working conditions, utilizing data from the National Survey of Satisfaction of Users in Health (ENSUSALUD). A total of 2,137 participants were included in the analysis, selected through a two-stage probabilistic national representative sampling method stratified by political region. The general professional activity scale, comprising 6 items (CFI=0.946; RMSEA=0.071), and the health services management scale, consisting of 8 items (CFI=0.972; RMSEA=0.081), demonstrated strong measurement properties within a one-dimensional model. The working conditions scale exhibited satisfactory measurement properties within a two-dimensional model (CFI=0.914; RMSEA=0.080), encompassing individual conditions (8 items) and infrastructural conditions (3 items). Invariance analysis indicated that comparisons could be made across various demographic and professional variables. Internal consistency for all scales was deemed adequate (ω and α between 0.70 and 0.90). The study concludes that these instruments are appropriate for assessing job satisfaction among outpatient physicians nationwide in Peru, given the representative nature of the data collected.
Job satisfaction is characterized as an emotional state or attitude towards a job, influenced by positive or negative experiences and the values or expectations of the worker. International evidence indicates that health workers in higher-ranked positions tend to exhibit greater psychological engagement with their work. The significance of job satisfaction lies in its potential to enhance health policies by positively impacting the performance of health workers and patient satisfaction. Conversely, low levels of job satisfaction among health workers can lead to adverse outcomes such as burnout, high turnover rates, job changes, and subpar performance. These repercussions not only compromise the functioning and quality of healthcare services but also weaken the accountability and resilience of healthcare systems, exacerbating health disparities within and between socioeconomic groups. Therefore, assessing the job satisfaction of health workers, particularly physicians who often play leadership roles in healthcare teams, is a crucial aspect to be considered in the global public health agenda.
Assessing physician job satisfaction in low- and middle-income countries is crucial due to the challenges they face, such as limited financial compensation, lack of career development opportunities, heavy workloads, and inadequate legal protection compared to their counterparts in high-income countries. Job dissatisfaction in these regions often leads to the migration of healthcare professionals abroad, exacerbating specialist shortages. While evaluating physician satisfaction is essential, it poses significant challenges as it requires assessing various aspects of the work environment beyond the scope of a physician's expertise. Factors influencing job satisfaction include the doctor-patient relationship, workload, relationships with colleagues, financial circumstances, and autonomy in clinical decision-making. Many of these factors are modifiable, underscoring the need for appropriate measurement tools in these complex settings. Although numerous scales exist for assessing job satisfaction, many are not tailored to low- and middle-income contexts or the unique characteristics of each healthcare system. Therefore, it is imperative to develop instruments that are specific to the nuances of each healthcare system to mitigate the risk of measurement biases.
Peru, a middle-income country in Latin America, has faced historical and structural challenges in its public health sector, including financial crises and an unfavorable political climate. Despite these obstacles, the issue of job satisfaction among healthcare personnel has been largely overlooked. The country's healthcare system is underdeveloped, lacking adequate human resources and financial support, which directly contributes to healthcare inequities. Various factors may influence the job satisfaction of health workers and physicians in Peru; however, as far as we are aware, there is no valid and reliable instrument developed to comprehensively assess these factors at a national level. The absence of a robust measure of physicians' job satisfaction could hinder the diagnosis and monitoring of this issue in the country, impacting health policy planning and the sustainability of human resources. In 2016, the National Health Authority (SUSALUD) conducted the National Survey of User Satisfaction in Health (ENSUSALUD) to assess user satisfaction with Universal Health Insurance across six different populations within the Peruvian Health System, including doctors working in healthcare centers. While ENSUSALUD included questions related to job satisfaction among these professionals, no formal analysis was conducted to evaluate the validity and reliability of these instruments.
Our objective was to assess the validity and reliability of a set of scales measuring job satisfaction in Peruvian physicians across various domains (general professional activity, health services management, and working conditions) using data from the National Survey of Satisfaction of Users in Health (ENSUSALUD). Our findings have the potential to enhance the measurement of physician job satisfaction in Peru and provide foundational data for the formulation of public policies concerning human resources in healthcare.
The ENSUSALUD database is accessible to the public on the web at http://portal.susalud.gob.pe/blog/base-de-datos-2016. Our research involved conducting a psychometric study through secondary data analysis of Questionnaire 2 from ENSUSALUD-2016, which was completed by healthcare professionals including physicians and nurses. Our analysis focused specifically on the responses provided by doctors in the dataset.
The ENSUSALUD 2016 survey was conducted through a collaborative effort between the Peruvian National Institute of Statistics and SUSALUD. It encompassed 185 healthcare centers across all 25 regions of Peru. The survey targeted professionals with a minimum of 12 months of experience working in healthcare centers within the public subsector, including the Ministry of Health (MINSA), Social Security (EsSalud), Armed Forces and Police Health Services, as well as the private subsector.
Participants were chosen through a rigorous two-stage probabilistic national sampling method that was stratified by political region. The primary sampling unit consisted of healthcare centers, while the secondary sampling unit comprised healthcare professionals. Individuals who were physicians and aged over 65 were excluded from the study, as this age marked the retirement threshold in Peru.
Before ENSUSALUD 2016, two initial attempts were made in 2014 and 2015 to create a job satisfaction scale specifically tailored for healthcare workers in the country. The development process of these instruments involved a dual approach:
During the initial six months of 2014, a multidisciplinary technical team comprising members from the Health Services Quality Directorate of the Ministry of Health, Research and Development Intendance of SUSALUD, and the Peruvian National Institute of Statistics put forth 53 preliminary scales aimed at evaluating various facets of healthcare professionals' work, specifically physicians and nurses, alongside sociodemographic data (18). These scales were formulated through a comprehensive literature review and the utilization of operational tools previously employed by the Ministry of Health in the country. Ranging from 1 to 22 items, each preliminary scale was integrated into the inaugural version of ENSUSALUD 2014, a national survey. These scales were essentially clusters of items derived from existing instruments or custom-designed to assess the Peruvian health system, albeit without prior evaluation of their measurement properties. Subsequently, in ENSUSALUD 2015, the same technical team repurposed the 53 preliminary scales from the initial version of ENSUSALUD 2014, introduced additional scales, and made adjustments to the wording of certain items based on past experiences (19).
In 2016, SUSALUD brought together representatives from the Social Security, Armed Forces, and Police Health Services, along with officials from the Comprehensive Health Insurance and four universities in Lima, Peru. Discussions centered around modifications to the current questionnaires, retaining existing items from ENSUSALUD 2015, and introducing 29 new preliminary scales.
In terms of job satisfaction, the researchers opted to retain all the questions and items from the previous iteration, albeit with specific alterations. Consequently, a total of 30 items organized into three groups (or preliminary scales) were included in questionnaire 2 of ENSUSALUD 2016, assessing various facets of job satisfaction.
The evaluation process entails a one-on-one interview conducted between the evaluator and the physician. Data entry was facilitated through the use of a Tablet, which transmitted information directly into a database in real-time. The collection of data was overseen by the Peruvian National Institute of Statistics, with supervision from SUSALUD.
To ensure data quality, continuous monitoring was implemented through a network of supervisors. Evaluators were overseen by a team coordinator, with each team being supervised by a regional supervisor.
The job satisfaction questionnaire used in this study, consisting of 30 items, assesses various job-related aspects and is categorized into three distinct scales: general professional activity (6 items), Health Services Management (8 items), and working conditions of the health center (16 items). Each item in the questionnaire follows a Likert scale format with five response options ranging from 5 (very satisfied) to 1 (very dissatisfied). The scale itself can be found in supplement 1. Additionally, an initial English version of the items is provided in Supplement 2 for comparative purposes, although it was not utilized in the current study.
The satisfaction scale on general professional activity aims to investigate various aspects of professional work. Its items assess satisfaction levels concerning the doctor-patient relationship, accomplishments related to the profession, job opportunities, perception of occupational hazards, and expectations regarding meeting patient needs. In ENSUSALUD, the Spanish items of this instrument are located in question 82, with codes ranging from c2p82_1 to c2p82_6 (refer to supplement 1 for details).
The Health Services Management Satisfaction Scale is utilized to evaluate how effectively a facility's management team operates and organizes the healthcare facility. This scale comprises items that gauge satisfaction levels regarding resource management, including economic and human resources, drug management, shift scheduling, and work capacity. Within the context of ENSUSALUD, these items are specifically addressed in question 83, with corresponding codes ranging from c2p83_1 to c2p83_8 as detailed in supplement 1.
The satisfaction scale on the working conditions of the health center aims to assess the perceptions of health professionals regarding their work environment. The scale includes indicators such as satisfaction with promotion opportunities, the organization of the health center, workload, schedules, salary, career advancement prospects, infrastructure and equipment quality, relationships with superiors, administrative processes, and the overall hygiene of the health center. Within the ENSUSALUD survey, these items are addressed in question 81, with corresponding codes ranging from c2p81_1 to c2p81_16 (refer to supplement 1 for further details).
In our analysis, we incorporated demographic, professional, and economic data. Demographic variables encompassed sex, age, and marital status (whether currently in a relationship). Professional information included specialization status (yes, in progress, or no), employment at other institutions (yes/no), self-reported work-related illnesses (yes/no), the type of organization (Ministry of Health, EsSalud, Armed Forces and National Police, or Private Clinics), and hours worked. Furthermore, we assessed self-reported monthly income, categorizing it based on the minimum wage (less than four, four to ten, and more than ten times the minimum wage). The minimum wage stood at 750 Peruvian soles (PEN) or US$222.5 (with an exchange rate of 3.37 soles per US dollar).
We outlined the participants' general characteristics by utilizing weighted frequencies and percentages.
A random subset from the total sample using the split-half method was analyzed, employing polychoric matrices and the weighted least squares means and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator, chosen for its suitability to the ordinal nature of the items. Quartimin rotation, parallel analysis test, and Kaiser analysis were utilized to determine the most appropriate number of dimensions. Various models were generated and assessed to pinpoint the one with the most favorable measurement properties, guided by the understanding that job satisfaction is a multidimensional construct. Prior to conducting exploratory factor analysis, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value was calculated as an indicator of sample adequacy, with values exceeding 0.90 considered sufficient for analysis.
In evaluating the factor structures, three distinct criteria were employed. Firstly, it was required that the factor loadings of items should meet or exceed 0.40 (20). Secondly, for scales with multiple dimensions, each dimension needed to consist of a minimum of three items to ensure stability (25). Thirdly, in cases where an item loaded onto more than one dimension, it was necessary to assess the difference in loadings between them. If this difference was less than 0.020, the item was to be removed. Conversely, if the disparity in loadings equaled or exceeded 0.20, the item would be allocated to the dimension with the highest factor loading (20).
In conducting confirmatory factor analysis, the models derived from the exploratory factor analysis were assessed. The analyses took into account the intricate nature of the sampling strategy, specifically the complex multistage sampling method, utilizing the lavaan.survey command. The WLSMV estimator was employed, as referenced in (23), and polychoric matrices were utilized, as indicated in (22).
The evaluation of model adjustments for the three scales occurred in three sequential steps. Initially, a series of goodness-of-fit indices were computed, including the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), both deemed optimal with values ≥0.95; the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) with a 90% confidence interval, considered acceptable if <0.08 (26, 27). Subsequently, in the final step, for scales comprising two or more dimensions, the correlation between these dimensions was assessed to determine if there was any overlap. A clear distinction between dimensions is established when the correlation is below 0.80 (23).
Various models of CFA measurement invariance were assessed across groups delineated by key variables such as sex, age group, marital status, medical specialty, institutional affiliation, individual income, self-reported work-related illness, and chronic disease. Four measurement models with increasing constraints were compared within these group categories, for instance, between females and males. The change in Comparative Fit Index (ΔCFI) served as the primary criterion for contrasting models with differing restrictions. Empirical simulations indicate that a ΔCFI < .01 between consecutively more constrained models offers support for measurement invariance. Initially, models assumed configural invariance, establishing a similar factor structure across groups as the baseline. Subsequently, they progressed to metric invariance, ensuring comparable factor loadings and structure across groups, followed by strong invariance, which entailed similar thresholds, factor loadings, and structure across groups, and finally strict invariance, which required uniform residual item variances, thresholds, factor loadings, and structure across groups. The ΔCFI was scrutinized between each model to determine the appropriateness of the more restricted model compared to its less restricted predecessor. The preference for ΔCFI over χ2 comparisons stemmed from its insensitivity to large sample sizes.
Reliability is assessed using the internal consistency method, with the McDonald's omega coefficient (ω) and the alpha coefficient (α) serving as the preferred indicators. Values exceeding 0.70 are deemed appropriate in both instances (30-33).
We conducted complex sampling analysis using R Studio®, utilizing the packages "lavaan" (34), "lavaan.survey" (35), "semTools" (36), and "semPlot" (37).
The survey was conducted anonymously, ensuring that no information in the database could lead to the identification of participants. Therefore, the analysis carried out did not pose any ethical risks as there was no access to confidential data. During the survey design phase, two authors (LBB and EMH) were actively involved in developing the three scales.
The study comprised 2,137 participants, predominantly male (69.0%) and residing with a partner (married or cohabiting). Over half of the participants possessed a specialty, with 65% reporting a monthly income ranging from four to ten minimum wages ($890 to $2,225). A quarter of the participants reported a work-related illness, while a third self-reported a chronic disease. The average age of the participants was 44.7 years (SD: 10.8), with an average tenure in the organization of 9.4 years (SD: 9.2). Table 1 presents the sociodemographic characteristics of the physicians.
The satisfaction scale for general professional activity exhibited a KMO value exceeding 0.90, indicating a sufficient sample size for conducting exploratory factor analysis. While parallel analysis suggested the presence of two potential dimensions, Kaiser's analysis pointed towards a single dimension. Given this discrepancy, both one and two-dimensional models were assessed. The one-dimensional model displayed satisfactory factor loadings (λ>0.4; refer to Table 2), whereas the two-dimensional model fell short of the requirement of a minimum of three items per dimension. Consequently, the two-dimensional model was excluded from further analysis.
The Health Services Management Satisfaction Scale exhibited a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value exceeding 0.90, indicating a substantial proportion of shared variance among the variables. Through parallel analysis, three potential dimensions were identified, while Kaiser's analysis pointed towards two dimensions. Given this diversity, one, two, and three-dimensional models were assessed. The one-dimensional and two-dimensional models demonstrated satisfactory factor loadings for physicians (λ>0.4) and adhered to the requirement of having a minimum of three items in each dimension (refer to Table 2). Conversely, the three-dimensional model displayed significant heterogeneity, with unstable dimensions characterized by a scarcity of items (less than three per dimension). Consequently, this model was excluded from subsequent analyses.
The KMO value exceeded 0.90, indicating a sufficient sample size for conducting the exploratory factor analysis. Through parallel analysis, a two-dimensional model was identified, while Kaiser's analysis pointed towards a three-dimensional model. Consequently, both two and three-dimensional models were assessed (refer to table 2). Within the two-dimensional model, the item "order in the health service and labor organization" (variable c2p81_2 in the dataset) exhibited factor complexity, as there was no distinct disparity between factor loadings in the first and second dimensions, leading to its exclusion from the analysis. Furthermore, items concerning satisfaction with hours or salary received (c2p81_7), training opportunities (c2p81_10), filling out medical records (c2p81_15), and respect for the patient (c2p81_16) displayed notably low factor loads and were consequently removed from subsequent analyses. Conversely, in the three-dimensional model, the first dimension proved to be unstable due to the limited number of items, resulting in the elimination of this model as well. Therefore, only the 2-dimensional model was deemed suitable for further analysis, following the exclusion of the five problematic items identified during this evaluation (c2p81_2, c2p81_7, c2p81_10, c2p81_15, and c2p81_16).
Of course! Please provide the passage you would like me to improve.
The one-dimensional model under evaluation demonstrated satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices, as illustrated in Table 3. Consequently, the six items comprising this scale could be aggregated to yield an overarching score.
The one-dimensional model and the two-dimensional model exhibited satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices. Nevertheless, the two-dimensional model displayed a notably high latent correlation exceeding 0.80, indicating potential overlap between its dimensions (refer to Table 3). Consequently, the optimal model for this scale was determined to be the one-dimensional model comprising eight items.
The two-dimensional model, comprising eleven items, exhibited satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices, with the latent correlation between the dimensions falling within acceptable values (below 0.80, as shown in Table 3). The initial dimension encompassed eight items concerning satisfaction with the physician's working conditions, including workload, hours, and salary, while the second dimension comprised three items related to structural working conditions such as infrastructure and equipment. Based on this analysis, it can be inferred that the model demonstrated sufficient validity evidence through its internal structure, warranting its consideration for subsequent analysis (refer to Figure 1).
Invariance was established among marital status categories (individuals living with a partner versus those who do not), presence of a chronic disease (those with versus those without), and individuals with work-related diseases (those affected versus those unaffected), enabling comparisons between these groups. However, invariance was not upheld between genders (sex), among individuals employed in different institutions, and based on tenure within the institution, precluding comparisons within these variables as indicated in Supplement 3. Notably, invariance could not be assessed according to organizational type, monthly income, possession of a specialty, or participant age due to unmet assumptions necessary for such analyses within this variable set.
In both scales, invariance was achieved across sex, age groups, marital status, possession of a specialty, employment in another institution, years of experience, and presence of work-related or chronic diseases (refer to Supplement 3). This allows for comparisons to be drawn between these groups utilizing the scales. However, assessment of invariance based on organizational type and monthly income was not feasible due to failure to meet the necessary assumptions.
The General Professional Activity Satisfaction scale (α=0.70; ω=0.70; 6 items) and the Health Services Management Satisfaction Scale (α=0.90; ω=0.90; 3 items) demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency values. Similarly, the Working Conditions Satisfaction scale for the Health Center showed acceptable internal consistency for both the individual working conditions dimension (α=0.81; ω=0.81; 8 items) and the structural working conditions dimension (α=0.81; ω=0.82; 3 items).
The instrument set comprised three independent scales with a solid factorial structure and measurement invariance, facilitating group comparisons. These scales demonstrated stability in scores and adequate internal consistency coefficients. Our findings suggest that these instruments are appropriate for assessing job satisfaction among physicians working in Peruvian outpatient clinics, with data representative at the national level. They could serve as valuable tools for evaluating various facets of physician job satisfaction, informing decision-making in human resources and health services research. These scales can be utilized collectively to gauge overall job satisfaction or individually to target specific areas of satisfaction.
A systematic review revealed that between 2000 and 2017, 61 studies examining job satisfaction among physicians in Europe utilized 26 different assessment instruments (38). Notably, 31% of these studies developed their own tools for measuring job satisfaction (38). The diverse array of instruments employed in the European studies may stem from variations in healthcare system structures and operations, suggesting that a singular instrument could yield biased results. In Latin America, there is a lack of data on the most commonly used instruments for assessing job satisfaction. Nonetheless, certain studies in this region have adapted various tools such as the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (39) and the Warr–Cook–Wall Job Satisfaction Scale (40). These studies, albeit conducted on limited samples that were not nationally representative, selected instruments originally designed for disparate healthcare contexts in European countries. While some instruments have been developed in Latin America, they encounter similar constraints as their European counterparts.
Limited data exists on this topic within the Latin American region, with a plethora of scales developed elsewhere requiring further analysis and testing. The three scales introduced in our study have been tailored to reflect the nuances of a middle-income country in Latin America, such as Peru, and have demonstrated sufficient evidence of validity and reliability. For instance, considerations include the presence of primary care centers lacking consistent access to water, drainage, and light (item c2p81_11), the common practice of health professionals working across multiple institutions simultaneously (items c2p82_3), and the organization of rotations or changes in opening hours (item c2p83_5). Consequently, these scales could serve as a valuable set of instruments for assessing various facets of job satisfaction among physicians in this region and other Spanish-speaking countries with similar healthcare environments.
Evidence of internal structure within the scales was uncovered through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Our analyses suggest that both the professional activity satisfaction scale and the health center management scale are one-dimensional, meaning all items can be aggregated to derive an overall score. In contrast, the satisfaction scale pertaining to working conditions was identified as a two-dimensional scale, comprising individual and structural dimensions, allowing for the calculation of separate scores for each dimension.
Our three instruments enable us to gather data on various facets of job satisfaction among physicians, taking into account the unique characteristics of the healthcare system in a middle-income country. For instance, our scale focusing on general professional activity gauges physicians' willingness to work as care providers in other institutions (item c2p82_3), given that approximately half of physicians in Peru are employed in multiple institutions. Conversely, within the Health Services Management scale, we have included items that evaluate satisfaction levels regarding the management of rotating shifts (item c2p83_5) and drug management practices (item c2p83_2). It is important to highlight that we have not come across any other scale in existing literature that specifically assesses satisfaction with the management of health centers. Lastly, our working conditions scale allows us to measure satisfaction concerning one's position within their institution (item c2p81_6) and essential services like water and drainage (item c2p81_11).
It is worth noting that certain items within our scales, such as professional activity, health center management, and individual and structural working conditions, bear theoretical similarities to psychometric scales previously documented. An illustrative example is the 4CornerSAT questionnaire, utilized for assessing physicians' career satisfaction, which comprises four dimensions mirroring those identified in our study: personal, professional, performance, and inherent (41, 42).
The research landscape concerning the evaluation of measurement invariance in job satisfaction scales is notably sparse, resulting in a scarcity of instruments with sufficient empirical support to warrant intergroup comparisons. Despite this limitation, the common practice of conducting such comparisons persists, often without the requisite evidence to support the validity of these analyses. This oversight could potentially introduce bias into the results if invariance assumptions are violated. Notably, a study highlighted the achievement of invariance when comparing physicians and nurses across 14 European countries, indicating that cultural influences may facilitate the assessment of various organizational variables in these professionals over time. In our own investigation, we rigorously tested the measure invariance of the scales, thereby enabling comparisons across diverse groups such as differing marital statuses, occupational or chronic disease statuses. Furthermore, our study permits comparisons between genders, age brackets, specialties, institutional affiliations, and years of service for the working conditions and health center management scales. Importantly, our findings affirm that all these comparisons are devoid of measurement bias.
In our study, we observed stability in the scores of three scales. One notable advantage of our scales, in comparison to others, is their concise length and ability to demonstrate satisfactory levels of internal consistency. This is particularly significant as numerous scales, such as the Warr-Cook-Wall Job Satisfaction Scale 38, exhibit limited variability and necessitate a substantial number of items to attain reliable values (25).
One of the strengths of our study lay in the representativeness of the results at the country level in Peru, enabling us to assess the scales across various outpatient settings. Additionally, there was meticulous quality control and real-time monitoring of the data being gathered. However, we identified three primary limitations. Firstly, despite having evidence of internal structure for the three instruments, our scales lacked a definitive cut-off point to determine whether Peruvian physicians were satisfied with the evaluated dimensions. This was due to the absence of robust results in both sensitivity and specificity analyses conducted for the selected scales. Secondly, validity and reliability estimates were solely calculated for outpatient physicians, thus limiting the generalizability of the results to other healthcare professionals or doctors in different settings like hospitals or community healthcare centers. Thirdly, as this was a secondary data analysis, certain variables crucial for a comprehensive understanding of job satisfaction, such as race or the presence of diagnosed mental health issues, were not taken into account.
In the current global landscape, healthcare systems are facing unprecedented challenges stemming from demographic, political, economic, and social factors, jeopardizing their ability to effectively safeguard and enhance population health. Many of these systems are struggling to adapt and survive amidst these changes. To navigate these complexities successfully, healthcare organizations require dedicated and efficient teams, comprising physicians collaborating closely with organizational leaders and the community. Monitoring job satisfaction is crucial over time, yet existing measurement scales are often outdated, limited in scope, or lack cultural translations for diverse regions. Addressing job satisfaction adequately is essential to bolster the resilience and protective capabilities of healthcare systems in promoting and sustaining population health and well-being.
In the Peruvian health system, the National Health Authority (SUSALUD) is responsible for protecting and promoting health rights through insurance and healthcare provision. Within this realm, the issue of physician job satisfaction has gained significance, yet there has been limited effort to quantify it. This study introduces new evidence regarding the validity and reliability of the ENSUSALUD satisfaction scales for assessing job satisfaction among physicians. National metrics on job satisfaction and other work-related variables among healthcare professionals serve as crucial tools for policymakers. Specifically, the ENSUSALUD survey enabled us to gain insights into key organizational aspects affecting primary care physicians in Peru. Our findings have the potential to enhance the measurement of physician satisfaction in Peru, laying a foundation for informed public policy decisions in the realm of healthcare human resources. Furthermore, this research can serve as a reference point for adapting these tools for Spanish-speaking physicians in other healthcare systems across Latin America and Europe.
Further research is warranted to compare job satisfaction across various regions in Peru, a task not within the current study's scope. Additionally, establishing a benchmark for job satisfaction is crucial for conducting sensitivity and specificity analyses. It is recommended to assess the measurement properties of the three scales provided in supplementary materials 1 and 2, containing the Spanish and English versions, respectively. Specifically, the psychometric properties of the English version require evaluation, given that it is solely a suggestion put forth by the authors.
The three scales introduced facilitate the evaluation of various dimensions of job satisfaction, including professional activity, perceptions of health service management, and working conditions. Their utilization is advised for assessing the job satisfaction levels of primary care physicians in Peru. Furthermore, stakeholders are encouraged to employ these scales as a metric for informing decision-making within the healthcare system.
