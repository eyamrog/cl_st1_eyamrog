Objective: This study aims to assess the efficacy of the SEIR model in predicting the potential for epidemic control within various geographical scales, such as cities, states, or countries, by incorporating parameters related to changes in mobility patterns.
Study design and setting: The prediction of COVID-19 through a SEIR model hinges significantly on determining the values of the basic reproduction number (R0) and the infectious period, measured in days. These crucial parameters were computed using mathematical constrained optimization techniques, enabling the identification of the minimal SEIR model errors within a specific country, utilizing COVID-19 data up to April 11th. To gauge changes in community mobility, the Community Mobility Reports sourced from Google Maps (<https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility>) were leveraged, comparing mobility patterns on April 5th against a baseline period from January 3rd to February 6th. This data was instrumental in assessing adherence to non-pharmacological interventions. Logistic regression models were employed to evaluate the impact of individual mobility components. The criterion for COVID-19 control was established as an R0 value below 1.0 within a given country.
Results: On April 11th, the ECDC recorded a total of 1,653,204 COVID-19 cases worldwide. Sixteen countries accounted for 78% of all reported cases. Among the six Google Maps mobility parameters analyzed, the "Stay at home" parameter emerged as the most influential in controlling the spread of COVID-19 within a country. Specifically, a 50% increase in mobility trends towards places of residence was associated with a 99% likelihood of effectively controlling outbreaks.
Conclusions: The restriction of residential mobility emerged as the most effective measure in controlling the spread of COVID-19. The utilization of the SEIR model in conjunction with mobility parameters was found to be a valuable tool for assessing the likelihood of successfully managing and containing outbreaks of the virus.
In December 2009, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China, caused by a novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This nomenclature was assigned to the virus due to its genetic similarity to another coronavirus that triggered the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. Subsequently, in February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially designated the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19. The WHO, on January 30th, 2020, declared the outbreak of this novel coronavirus (previously referred to as 2019-nCoV) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), urging nations to ready themselves for containment strategies. Finally, on March 11th, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The mechanisms of viral transmission remain incompletely elucidated. The prevailing hypothesis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through person-to-person contact, facilitated by respiratory droplets. Furthermore, individuals who are asymptomatic or in the incubation phase are thought to be capable of transmitting the virus.
Non-pharmacological interventions aimed at preventing the transmission and infection of this pathogen encompass practices such as home isolation, voluntary home quarantine, social distancing from the broader population with particular emphasis on safeguarding the elderly, and the temporary closure of educational institutions, universities, and workplaces.
Mathematical models offer a valuable tool for enhancing comprehension of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Through the utilization of a suitably calibrated mathematical model, it becomes feasible to extrapolate existing data on the epidemic, predict the likelihood of future outbreaks, and offer valuable insights for the development of mitigation strategies by public health authorities.
Compartmental mathematical models, including SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered), SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered), SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible), and MSIR (maternally derived immunity-susceptible-infected-recovered), are commonly used for modeling infectious diseases. The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the SEIR model in predicting the control of COVID-19 outbreaks based on varying community mobility restriction parameters.
The susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) compartmentalized epidemiological model was utilized during the onset of the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009. In this model, a susceptible individual (S) is exposed to the virus and transitions into a latent or exposed state (E). Following an incubation period, exposed individuals progress to being infected (I), with the potential to recover (R) within a defined timeframe determined by a recovery rate (deceased individuals are also categorized within the recovered group). Elevated transmission and recovery rates serve to shorten the overall duration of the epidemic, ultimately impacting its total duration.
The SEIR model comprises a system of four ordinary differential equations, detailed in the algorithm (Figures 1A and 1B). In the context of modeling the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, four key parameters of the SEIR model were derived from global observations: the incubation period (3.7 days), the proportion of critical cases (0.051), the overall case-fatality rate (0.023), and the estimated proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients (0.181). While these values are adaptable to specific regions, the pivotal aspect in forecasting COVID-19 trends using the model lies in determining the basic reproduction number (R0) and the infectious period (T_infectious) in days, which were computed through mathematical constrained optimization techniques.
A solver such as Microsoft® Excel or the NEOS Server (https://neos-server.org/neos/) can be employed to determine the numerical minimum of a function Z. This function represents the sum of squared errors between the daily observed new cases of COVID-19 and the cases predicted by the SEIR model across three distinct phases (Equation 1): <>.
The Community Mobility Reports generated by Google Maps are designed to offer a comprehensive understanding of the shifts occurring in response to COVID-19 mitigation policies (<https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/>). These reports track movement patterns over time across various geographic regions and categories of establishments, including retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas. The data utilized in these reports is sourced from mobile phone location tracking of users, which is collected with prior consent from the individuals. Researchers leveraged the Google Maps Mobility Report to gauge compliance with non-pharmacological interventions (Google LLC “Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports”).
The influence of each mobility component was assessed using logistic regression models, with the control of outcomes in a given country being determined by a basic reproduction number (R0) that is less than 1.0.
Six logistic regression models were developed for each Google Maps mobility parameter: Retail & recreation (reflecting trends in places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters); Grocery and pharmacy (depicting trends in places like grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies); Parks (illustrating trends in places like national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and public gardens); Transit stations (representing trends in places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations); Workplaces (showcasing trends in places of employment); and Residential (indicating trends in places of residence). The percentage of mobility changes in each country served as the exposure variable for the logistic regression modeling.
On April 11th, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported a total of 1,653,204 COVID-19 cases across 206 countries and territories. Notably, a mere 16 countries, constituting just 8% of the total, were responsible for a staggering 78% of all reported cases (Figure 2). This data underscores the disproportionate distribution of cases globally and highlights the significant impact of the pandemic on a select number of nations.
Table 1 illustrates the variations in mobility observed on April 5th in comparison to the baseline period spanning five weeks from January 3rd to February 6th, 2020. Additionally, it presents the values for the reproduction number (R0) and the duration of infectious periods in days (T_infectious) for the 16 countries under study. Notably, only Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and Israel exhibited an R0 value below 1.0, indicating that only these five nations had effectively managed to control the epidemic by April 5th. Figure 3 visually represents the SEIR models for these countries, providing a graphical insight into the epidemiological dynamics being analyzed.
The fundamental reproduction numbers (R0) and infectious periods, denoted in days (T_infectious), as shown in Table 1, were computed for the third phase of the epidemic using mathematical constrained optimization to determine the numerical minimum of a Z function (Equation 1) in each country. This analysis was based on actual COVID-19 data up to April 11th. These figures correspond to the incidence of new cases, where R0<1 indicates a controlled situation, while values exceeding one signify an uncontrolled scenario, indicating a higher level of infection spread with increasing values.
Table 2 presents a comprehensive overview of the influence of individual mobility components on epidemic management. The probability of achieving control is determined through logistic regression models, with logistic coefficients assigned to the six parameters derived from Google Maps® localization data. These coefficients are subsequently utilized to ascertain the minimum levels of mobility restrictions for each parameter, as well as the likelihood of successfully containing the outbreak if these restriction thresholds are adhered to.
Residential mobility restriction exhibited the highest logistic coefficient of 17.7, indicating a significant impact on outbreak control. Specifically, a 32% increase in isolating individuals within their households can lead to a 90% likelihood of effectively controlling the outbreak.
Workplace mobility restrictions emerged as the second most effective measure, with a minimum restriction of 56% associated with a 53% chance of outbreak control. Retail and recreation mobility restrictions showed effectiveness levels of 53% and 86%, respectively. Transit stations were also evaluated, with restrictions of 96% and 54% showing varying degrees of efficacy. In contrast, park mobility restrictions were found to be the least effective in outbreak control, with absolute restrictions (100%) yielding the lowest chance of control at 46%.
The impact of each Google Maps mobility component on the probability of epidemic control was illustrated in Figure 4, indicating that "stay at home" and "stay out of the workplace" are the most effective measures in curbing the spread of COVID-19. Through the simulations depicted in the graph, the influence of each mobility component can be assessed. For instance, to achieve a minimum 50% likelihood of epidemic control, a mere 22% increase in mobility trends for residential areas is required. Conversely, a reduction in all other components is imperative for successful epidemic management: a 56% decrease in workplace mobility trends, an 84% reduction in activities at places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters, a 76% decline in visits to grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies, and a 92% cutback in public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations. Even a complete cessation of mobility trends at locations such as national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and public gardens is insufficient to control the spread of COVID-19.
This study is grounded in mathematical modeling, which, despite its inherent limitations, can predict COVID-19 cases within a specific region. The analysis deviated from traditional statistical modeling methods and instead adopted a numerical perspective. The reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 was approximated based on confirmed cases in various countries. While the R0 exceeded initial expectations, estimates derived from likelihood and model analysis suggest it could reach as high as 6.513. These elevated values align with findings from other studies, such as Liu et al., who concluded that the reproductive number of COVID-19 surpasses that of the SARS coronavirus.
Analysis of the R0 values allows for the assessment of epidemic spread or containment within each country. As depicted in Table 1, out of the 16 countries under scrutiny, only 5 exhibit an R0 value below 1, signifying a controlled epidemic situation. These 5 nations displayed an average R0 of 0.6 and experienced the most significant alteration in residential mobility during the specified period. Conversely, the remaining 11 countries recorded an average R0 of 1.9. On April 5th, there was a notable 20% surge in the population staying at home compared to the baseline in the aforementioned 5 countries, while the other 11 countries saw a 14% increase. This observation underscores the apparent relationship between changes in residential mobility patterns and epidemic control.
A social isolation rate of 50% at home is deemed adequate for controlling the COVID-19 epidemic. Among various measures, residential mobility restriction emerges as the most effective with minimal effort required. An increase of 50% in mobility trends towards places of residence is associated with a 99% likelihood of controlling outbreaks. It is hypothesized that isolating residents would indirectly lead to a decrease in the overall number of individuals frequenting public spaces.
The impact of mobility restrictions on the overall epidemic size is contingent upon the risk level within individual communities and the specific characteristics of the disease. Further investigation is necessary to determine the ideal equilibrium between mobility constraints, outbreak management, economic considerations, and the preservation of freedom of movement.
