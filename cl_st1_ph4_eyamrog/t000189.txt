ABSTRACT 
 
OBJECTIVE: Considering the rapid spread of COVID-19, the scientific community has 
been looking for ways to recognize factors that may interfere with the outcome of viral 
infection. Despite the lack of studies with the new coronavirus, it is known that adequate 
serum levels of micronutrients are essential for the organic response to infectious 
diseases. Thus, we aim to review the effects of vitamin A, D, iron, zinc, or folate 
deficiency on the prognosis of patients with respiratory infections with manifestations 
similar to COVID-19 and discuss about supplementation of the nutrients analyzed in this 
review. METHODS: The search was conducted in the databases PubMed, Lilacs, and 
SciELO, including observational studies published between 2010-2020, with results for 
individuals with respiratory tract infections with manifestations similar to COVID-19. 
RESULTS: Six articles met the inclusion criteria, all of which were related to 
deficiencies of vitamins A and D. In general, vitamin A deficiency was associated with 
cough, fever, and greater total respiratory resistance. Regarding vitamin D, the lack of 
this nutrient led to higher rates of ICU admission, the need for mechanical ventilation, 
and mortality. Evidence linking specific relationships between nutritional deficiencies 
and COVID-19 remain lacking due to the small number of studies and heterogeneities in 
population subgroups. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, deficiencies of vitamins A and D 
seem to negatively affect the prognosis of respiratory tract infections. Supplementation 
of these nutrients for prevention or treatment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 
should respect serum levels, nutritional status and housing conditions (e.g.,endemic 
location) of individuals. 
 
KEYWORDS: Micronutrients; vitamin A; vitamin D; coronavirus; respiratory tract

Introduction 
Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory illness caused by the new 
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that emerged in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan/China 
[1]. The rapid geographical spread of the new coronavirus has represented a major 
challenge for public health [2]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 
report [2], until April 30, 2020, the world pandemic resulted in 3.090.445 confirmed cases 
and more than 217 thousand deaths resulting from clinical manifestations secondary to 
infection (fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath) [3,4]. 
Possible risk factors that affect the disease prognosis in patients infected with the 
new coronavirus include advanced age, presence of chronic non-communicable diseases, 
such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases [5,6], as well as 
immune dysregulation [7]. 
The importance of adequate nutritional status to modulate the immune response 
and decrease the risk of infections is well established in the literature [8,9]. Micronutrients 
such as vitamin A, D, iron, zinc, and folate, are highlighted for their participation in 
several stages of the immune response, including differentiation, proliferation and 
functioning of innate immune cells; regulation of cytokine; and production/development 
of antibodies [8]. 
Considering the lack of scientific evidence regarding the role of nutritional 
deficiencies in the prognosis of viral infections and, given the current global pandemic 
scenario of COVID-19, the present study aimed to assess, based on the literature, the 
effects of deficiency of vitamin A, D, iron, zinc or folate in the prognosis of patients with 
respiratory infections with manifestations similar to COVID-19 and discuss about 
supplementation of the nutrients included for qualitative analysis in this review. 
 
Methods 
Guidelines 
The study design and conduct of this systematic review comprised the 
recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) 
[10] guidelines and the research protocol was registered in the International Prospective 
Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) [11], under registration number 
CRD42020178982. 
 
 
Bibliographic search strategy 
The methodological procedure was carried out from March to 30 April 2020, 
based on the following guiding question, elaborated according to the acronym PECO 
[12]: “Deficiency of vitamin A, D, iron, zinc or folate in individuals with respiratory 
infections with manifestations similar to COVID-19 leads to a worse prognosis when 
compared to those without deficiency?”. 
The electronic search was performed in the databases: Publisher Medline 
(PubMed), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Resource 
(LILACS) and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO). For the search strategy, 
the following descriptors were used: “Nutritional Deficiency”, “Vitamin A”, “Vitamin 
D”, “Zinc”, “Iron”, “Anemia”, “Folate”, “Folic Acid”, “Respiratory Tract Infections”, 
“Influenza”, and “Coronavirus”. The descriptors were identified in the Medical Subject 
Headings 
(Mesh), 
available 
at 
the 
U.S. 
National 
Library 
of 
Medicine 
(http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/), and in the list of Health Sciences Descriptors 
(http://decs.bvs.br). 
The search algorithm for PubMed was: (("malnutrition"[MeSH Terms] OR 
"malnutrition"[All Fields] OR ("nutritional"[All Fields] AND "deficiency"[All Fields]) 
OR "nutritional deficiency"[All Fields]) AND ("vitamin a"[MeSH Terms] OR "vitamin 
a"[All Fields])) AND ("respiratory tract infections"[MeSH Terms] OR ("respiratory"[All 
Fields] AND "tract"[All Fields] AND "infections"[All Fields]) OR "respiratory tract 
infections"[All Fields]). The keywords were changed to provide the inclusion of articles 
with the other micronutrients and infectious conditions (influenza or coronavirus). 
 
Eligibility criteria 
The articles selection criteria included original observational studies, carried out 
with respiratory infected individuals manifesting similar COVID-19 symptons, published 
in the last 10 years (between 2010 and 2020), in English, Spanish or Portuguese. The 
similarity of manifestations of the respiratory infections included in this review with the 
symptoms of COVID-19 was assessed based on the Epidemiological Bulletin on 2019-
nCoV [13], which refers to a broad common clinical spectrum between COVID-19 and 
other colds, with manifestations ranging from coughing, fever, and shortness of breath to 
severe pneumonia. 
Studies as reviews, letters to the editor, theses, and dissertations addressing 
bacterial infections like tuberculosis, carried out with experimental models, and whose 
analytical methodology was the assessment of the association between the infection 
leading to nutritional deficiency were excluded from the present review. To increase the 
sensitivity of the search for studies related to iron deficiency, the term "anemia" was 
included as a descriptor, however, researches that identified anemia exclusively by 
assessing hematocrit and hemoglobin, and did not evaluate iron status by ferritin and 
transferrin receptor [14,15], were not considered eligible for the study. 
 
Study screening and inclusion 
The articles screening followed three stages: reading the title, reading the abstract, 
and reading full-text articles. After reading the titles and abstracts, the full texts were read 
to identify those who met the inclusion criteria, according to the pre-established protocol. 
The authors independently evaluated the articles and, later, they were gathered for 
confrontation and confirmation of the investigated data to reduce bias and heterogeneity 
in the analyzes. 
 
Quality assessment of articles 
The articles included in this review received scores from 0 to 22 points, according 
to the initiative Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology 
(STROBE) [16].  
 
Data extraction 
Data extraction was performed in Microsoft Excel 2016 version, using a protocol 
prepared by the researchers, containing the following data: title of the article, author, 
place and year of publication, objective and type of study, sample size, characteristics of 
the study population, diagnosis/clinical manifestation of the infection, the prevalence of 
nutritional deficiency, and clinical outcomes associated with the deficiency. 
 
Results 
Screening and characteristics of included studies 
The search for articles resulted in the identification of 1,691 articles 
corresponding to the respective surveyed micronutrients. Of these, we excluded 29 
because they were duplicated. Among the remaining 1,662, after applying the eligibility 
criteria based on the information provided in the titles and abstracts 1,615 were 
eliminated. A total of 47 articles were read in full and, in the final stage, 6 studies were 
considered eligible for this review (Figure 1). 
According to STROBE, the median quality of the articles was 17.7 (Interquartile 
Range=15.6-18.8), with scores ranging from 15.6 to 20 points. All studies included met 
percentages higher than 50% of this indicator (Chart 1). 
The selected studies were published between 2012 and 2018, involving 
participants from Europe [17], South America [18–20], North America [21], and Asia 
[22] (Chart 1), with a total of 4,352 individuals (3,388 children and 964 adults and 
elderlies) of both sexes, with diagnosed community-acquired pneumonia [18,22], acute 
upper respiratory tract infections [20] or acute lower respiratory infections [17,21], and 
predicting clinical symptoms of viral infections, such as cough with fever [19]. 
Four studies were carried out at a hospital [17,18,21,22], one in a specialized 
clinic, [20] and one in primary schools [19] (Chart 1). The included studies were two 
cross-sectional studies [18,20] two prospectives [17,19] one population-based 
observational study [21] and one with retrospective design [22]. 
Regarding the nutrients considered in the search stage, we found articles that met 
the inclusion criteria for vitamin A [19–21] and vitamin D [17,18,21,22].  
 
Vitamin A 
Vitamin A deficiency in non-hospitalized children between 0 and 12 years old 
with respiratory tract infections, reached a prevalence of 12-46% [19–21], and a severe 
deficit reached 1.2-3.9% of the participants [19,20]. Serum retinol levels were inversely 
related to cough with fever (p=0.05) [19], and to an increase in total respiratory resistance 
in individuals without wheezing (p<0.05) [20]. Children with vitamin deficiency were 
more likely admitted to the ICU (p<0.05), an association that lost significance when 
adjusted analyzes were conducted [21], and those with severe deficit were 2.4-fold more 
likely to present cough with fever. An increase of 10mg/dL of plasma retinol was a 
protective factor contributing to 10% fewer days of cough with fever (p<0.001) and 6% 
fewer visits to the doctor (p<0.05) [19]. Amaral et al. [20] observed that patients with 
infections without wheezing and with vitamin A deficiency had difficulty recovering of 
respiratory resistance even after clinical treatment for infection (Chart 2). 
 
 
 
Vitamin D 
All included studies that assessed the impact of vitamin D, regardless of age, were 
conducted with hospitalized patients. In children, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency 
ranged from 12% to 85% [17,21] and was positively associated with a higher risk of 
severe signs of breathing difficulties (OR:5.065; 95%CI:1.998;12.842; p<0.001) [17]. 
Children with vitamin D levels below 20ng/mL presented 117% more chances of using 
oxygen support and 217% more chances of needing respiratory support [17]. In addition, 
Hurwitz et al. [21] showed that vitamin D deficit in the pediatric group contributed to 
greater chances of ICU admission (OR: 3.29; 95%CI: 1.20;9.02; p<0.05) and mechanical 
ventilation (OR: 11.2; 95%CI: 2.27;55.25; p<0.001). In hospitalized adults and elderlies, 
vitamin D deficiency was prevalent in 80 to 85% of the sample [18,22]. Brance et al. [18] 
found no association between the disease symptoms and levels of respiratory infection. 
Kim et al. [22] observed that, after statistical adjustments, there was an increased risk for 
mortality in 28 days in the group with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency (OR: 
3.31; 95%CI: 1.17– 9.39; p<0.05) (Chart 2). 
 
Discussion 
Vitamin A and D deficiencies and outcomes of respiratory infections  
Evidence suggests that micronutrient deficiency is one of the main etiological 
factors involved in the global burden of diseases, where deficiencies in vitamins A, D, 
iron, zinc, and folate stand out as important public health problems, especially in 
developing countries [23–25]. Such epidemiological scenario led to the choice of these 
micronutrients to be addressed in the present review. 
During the search stages, investigations involving analysis of iron, zinc, and folate 
did not meet the necessary criteria for inclusion in this study, thus the results were limited 
to findings corresponding to vitamin A and D, showing that the deficiency of these 
nutrients appears to be a predictor of clinical complications in the course of the assessed 
respiratory infections. 
Indeed, studies confirm that maintaining nutritional status is associated with 
immune integrity [26–28] and International Society for Immunonutrition reinforces the 
importance of eating diversified and balanced foods, rich in antioxidant nutrients, aiming 
to promote healthy eating practices in times of pandemic [29]. 
Among the nutrients with such characteristics, vitamin A is part of the 
intervention strategies, since it reduces the susceptibility to pathogens in the mucosal 
epithelium of digestive and respiratory tract [8], playing an essential role in the regulation 
of growth, differentiation and gene expression of airway epithelial cells [30]. 
The described functions may in part explain the results related to vitamin A in the 
present study, which demonstrated that the deficiency of this nutrient in children was 
associated with outcomes such as cough with fever, a greater number of visits to the 
doctor, greater total respiratory resistance, and less response to clinical treatment of acute 
upper respiratory infection. 
Supporting this tendency Qi et al. [31] in a survey with 684 Chinese children (age 
range 5 months to 12 years old), observed that vitamin A deficiency (retinol<0.2mg/L) 
was a risk factor for the development of acute respiratory tract infection (p<0.05). It is 
worth noting the possibility of non-causal effects in these findings, as it is known that 
vitamin A concentrations may decrease in the presence of infectious conditions due to the 
acute phase response [32]. 
Barbosa et al. [33] when following Brazilian children with and without 
pneumonia, found that serum retinol levels were statistically lower during the 
inflammatory process than after recovery (1.11±0.43 vs. 1.38±0.30μmol/L; p<0.05). The 
authors attributed this finding due to the acute phase response associated with reduced 
mobilization of hepatic nutrient reserves, as well as the increased need for retinol 
secondary to the improved activity of immune cells in pneumonia. 
Although the results related to vitamin D are heterogeneous, it is known that 
vitamin D deficiency has been a common nutritional disorder in patients diagnosed with 
respiratory tract infections [34,35]. Inamo et al (2011) [36], in their hospital-based 
retrospective case study, observed that Japanese children (mean age 14.03±11.43 months) 
with bronchiolitis or pneumonia who had vitamin D deficiency (<10ng/mL) were the ones 
who most needed oxygen and/or ventilation support (p<0.01). 
On the other hand, Xu et al (2016) [37], when evaluating 2,694 children and adults 
in Hong Kong, did not find an association between the lowest serum concentrations of 
25(OH)D (<50nmol/l) and the risk of infections by influenza virus (RR: 1.15; 95%CI: 
0.73;1.83; p=0.55) after adjusting for age, sex, chronic disease, and vaccination history. 
However, the authors observed an association with the incidence of influenza-like 
symptoms (presence of fever ≥37.8ºC and cough or sore throat) (RR: 1.70; 95%CI: 
1.14;2.51; p=0.01). 
According to a case-control study conducted by Mamani et al (2017) [35] with 
149 adults diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, the risk of pneumonia among 
individuals with deficient levels of vitamin D (<10ng/mL) was 3.69-fold (95%CI: 
1.46;9.31) greater than those with sufficient levels (>20ng/mL) (p<0.01). 
The biochemical profile of vitamin D in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is 
still unknown. Thus, it is suggested that determining vitamin D levels in baseline blood 
samples may be a way of investigating the impact of vitamin D levels on the prognosis 
of COVID-19 and justifying the possible therapeutic action of vitamin D in the treatment 
of 2019-nCoV. 
 
Perspectives on Vitamin D and A supplementation  
Zhang and Liu [38], in a recent publication, discuss possible nutritional 
interventions for 2019-nCoV and claim that vitamin A can be a promising strategy for 
the treatment and the prevention of lung infections, however, they do not suggest dosages 
or protocol for supplementation.  
Cochrane review published by Chen et al. [39] demonstrated unexpected effects 
for megadose supplementation (100.000-206.000 IU/day) or low doses (5.000 IU/day or 
8.333-10.000 IU/week or 20.000-45.000 IU every two months) of vitamin A in children 
from 0 to 7 years old. The results showed no effect and some of the studies revealed 
exacerbation of clinical symptoms (cough with fever, tachypnea and higher incidence of 
acute respiratory infections) in children who used vitamin supplementation. The authors 
report that beneficial effects may be more prominent in children with pre-existing 
malnutrition, concluding that low doses of vitamin A leads to fewer side effects and 
shows similar benefits to those found in megadose supplementation. 
In a research conducted by Mawson [30], an extensive consideration about 
vitamin A supplementation in Influenza infection was available, verifying that 
supplemental vitamin A seems to induce Influenza-like symptoms, a hypothesis 
formulated given the increase in respiratory symptoms reported in the studies analyzed 
by the review. Nevertheless, the author concludes that retinoids can act both to fight 
infection and to induce symptoms, with the serum vitamin D concentration being a critical 
factor determining the action of retinoids (previous vitamin D deficiency seems to 
determine greater toxicity of endogenous retinoids). 
Clinical trials on vitamin D supplementation that assessed the prevention of 
respiratory infections and/or the severity of the disease indicated heterogeneous results 
[40-44], which can be explained by the varying doses of vitamin D (400 to 100.000 IU 
per day, week and/or single dose), and protocol duration (5 days to 8 months). However, 
a meta-analysis including 25 randomized controlled trials and totaling 10,933 participants 
showed a protective effect of vitamin D supplementation against acute respiratory tract 
infection [45]. 
A recent literature review [46], discussing the evidence on vitamin D 
supplementation during COVID-19 pandemic, proposed that, in the hospital setting, 
patients and staff should take vitamin D supplements to increase 25(OH)D for at least 
40–50ng/mL (100–125nmol/L). To achieve these concentrations, the authors suggested 
taking 10,000IU/d for a month and then decrease to 5,000IU/d for maintenance. However, 
it is stated that “The hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of 
influenza and COVID-19 incidence and death should be investigated in trials to determine 
the appropriate doses, serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and the presence of any safety 
issues.” 
 
Conclusions 
In summary, deficiencies of vitamins A and D may negatively affect the prognosis 
of respiratory tract infections and supplementation of these nutrients for prevention or 
treatment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should respect serum levels, nutritional 
status and endemic areas.  
Some limitations must be considered when interpreting the presented data, such 
as the inclusion of observational studies, interfering in some causality relationships; the 
heterogeneity of the selected studies made it impossible to calculate a summary measure 
(meta-analysis), however, the use of strategies such as checking the quality of articles can 
help to control this bias; and the absence of original studies with a nutritional approach 
in patients with COVID-19 restricted inferential aspects. 
It is worth emphasizing the importance of recognizing endemic nutritional 
deficiencies in communities dealing with the 2019-nCoV pandemic, so that specialized 
measures can be taken to control deficits in serum vitamins and minerals and, 
consequently, control the prognosis of infectious conditions.

(HMPV) 
Retinol binding protein (deficiency 
<15ng/mL or <7µmol/L) 
46% 
In the univariate analysis, patients with vitamin A 
deficiency had higher rates of ICU admission (27% vs. 
8%; p=0.02). In the inverse probability-weighted 
estimation model, vitamin A lost its association with the 
analyzed outcomes (ICU admission (p=0.198), need for 
mechanical ventilation (p=0.437), and length of hospital 
stay (p=0.449)). 
Thornton et

Cough with fever (a predictor of Influenza 
infection, and a variety of viral and bacterial 
infections) 
Serum retinol (deficiency=10-
19.9µg/dL and severe deficiency 
<10.0 µg/dL) 
Deficiency =12.3% 
Severe deficiency =1.2% 
Vitamin A concentrations were inversely related to 
cough with fever (p=0.05). Children with severe vitamin 
A deficiency had 2.4-fold more days of cough with fever 
(IRR: 2.36; 95%CI: 1.30;4.31). After adjusting for 
explanatory variables (gender, age, educational level and 
maternal parity, household food insecurity, and 
hemoglobin), each 10mg/dL of plasma retinol 
contributed for 10% fewer days of cough with fever 
(p<0.001) and 6% fewer visits to the doctor (p=0.01).

Acute upper respiratory tract infection and 
Acute upper respiratory tract  
infection with wheezing 
Serum retinol (deficiency=10-

Dose Response - MRDR (>0.060) 
Deficiency=24.2% 
Severe deficiency=3.9% 
Deficiency assessed by 
MRDR=26.8% 
 
There was a significant inverse linear relationship 
between MRDR or retinol and decreased total 
respiratory resistance for individuals in the infection 
group without wheezing (the lower the MRDR, the 
greater the deficiency of vitamin A stores, and the 
greater the total respiratory resistance (p=0.015); and the 
lower the retinol, the greater the total respiratory 
resistance (p=0.02)). Patients with the infection without 
wheezing, and with vitamin A deficiency (assessed by 
MRDR) did not show a reduction in total respiratory 
resistance after clinical treatment for the infection (Mean 
total respiratory resistance in infection 
(𝑥±SD=1.14±0.22) vs. recovery (𝑥±SD=1.15±0.21); 
p=0.565).

Community-acquired pneumonia

85% 
There were no significant differences in symptoms 
(fever, sputum, hypothermia, dyspnoea, chest pain, and 
length of hospital stay) and in the physical examination 
of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, findings that 
occurred regardless of serum levels of 25(OH)D.

Children with vitamin D deficiency admitted to the ICU, 
had a greater need for mechanical ventilation when 
compared to those without deficiency in the univariate 
analysis (27% vs. 4%; p=0.02). The inverse probability-
weighted estimation model shows that vitamin D 
deficiency remained associated with the need for 
mechanical ventilation (OR: 11.2; 95%CI: 2.27;55.25; 
p<0.001), demonstrating statistical significance with ICU 
admission (OR: 3.29; 95%CI: 1.20;9.02; p=0.018).

Acute lower respiratory tract infection 
25(OH)D

Patients with 25(OH)D deficiency had a higher risk of 
severe signs of respiratory distress (OR: 5.065; 95%CI: 
1.998;12.842; p<0.001) than patients with normal values 
of this nutrient. Children with levels below 20ng/mL 
showed 117% more chances of using oxygen support 
and 217% more chances of needing respiratory support.

2015 
Community-acquired pneumonia 
25(OH)D 
(deficiency <20ng/mL) 
80.4% 
28-day mortality was significantly higher in the group 
with 25(OH)D deficiency than in the non-deficient group 
(8.3% vs. 2.6%; p = 0.01). After statistical adjustments, 
the risk for mortality at 28 days in the 25(OH)D deficient 
group was OR: 3.31 (95%CI: 1.17;9.39; p=0.03).
