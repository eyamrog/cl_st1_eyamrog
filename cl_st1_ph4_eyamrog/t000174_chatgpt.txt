Historically, women have long been subjected to the constraints of patriarchal society and the inequitable distribution of labor based on gender. Many women were relegated to domestic duties, lacking access to professional training and facing barriers to entry into the predominantly male-dominated workforce. The emergence of the contemporary feminist movement, originating in the United States in the late 1960s and spreading to numerous industrialized nations by the late 1970s, saw a surge of women entering various professions, including the field of Science. Despite these advancements, societal structures have remained largely patriarchal, with Brazil serving as a poignant example where women faced pressures, criticisms, and discrimination for deviating from traditional gender roles. The transition of women from household duties to the workforce did not bring about an equitable redistribution of domestic responsibilities, a shift that has only recently begun to take place on a limited scale. Consequently, women found themselves burdened with a dual workload, juggling professional responsibilities alongside domestic duties.
In the realm of Science, women have long confronted the biases and misogyny prevalent in a patriarchal society. As highlighted in the study "Deciphering the code: education of girls and women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)" by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a mere 35% of students enrolled in STEM Programs globally are women. Despite women securing the majority of STEM scholarships for various academic levels - undergraduate internships (55%), master’s degrees (52%), doctorate degrees (50%), and postdoctoral positions (53%) - as per data from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (INEP), and the Parent in Science group, they only receive 23% of grants from the highest echelons of research productivity (CNPq - A1). This disparity underscores the disproportionate academic success of women compared to their male counterparts, a phenomenon influenced by factors like impostor syndrome, maternity leave, discrimination, and sexual harassment. These challenges often play a pivotal role in a woman's decision to pause or altogether abandon her academic pursuits.
The presence of children significantly impacts the representation of women in advanced scientific careers. In the initial stages of undergraduate and graduate studies, women often do not have children, allowing them to fully commit to their academic pursuits, as evidenced by the availability of numerous scholarships for women. However, as women progress to higher academic levels, the likelihood of having children increases, leading to constraints on the time they can allocate to scientific endeavors. In contrast, most men are able to maintain full-time employment and focus on their research. Research conducted by the Parent in Science group reveals that scientists without children experience a steady increase in their scientific output, while mothers experience a sharp decline in publications in the first four years following the birth of their first child. Although there is a subsequent rise after this period, it is challenging for mother scientists to keep pace with new scientific developments, secure funding, and remain engaged in graduate programs.
In a recently published study examining the influence of parenting on the life of myrmecologists (researchers who study ants), it was found that even after a child reaches the age of five, parents continue to experience challenges related to work activities that deviate from their daily routine, such as field trips and attendance at meetings. Engaging in field trips, conferences, and collaborations with students and fellow researchers are integral components of a scientific career. Consequently, it is imperative for institutions to implement measures that facilitate the participation of scientist-parents in such events, which are crucial for career advancement. The hurdles encountered by scientific parents, particularly mothers, have enduring effects on their professional trajectories, manifesting in disparities in the allocation of research grants and other performance indicators.
The disparities in the conditions necessary for the comprehensive development of an academic career are evidently leading to specific challenges faced by female scientists who are also mothers. Recent data from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) reveals that women dedicate nearly double the amount of time to household chores and childcare compared to men. For mother scientists, these gender imbalances are further exacerbated during the ongoing pandemic, as academic work demands intense focus and concentration, which is often at odds with the immediate and constant needs of young children. Notably, various scientific journal editors have noted a decline in paper submissions by women during this period, while there has been a notable 50% increase in submissions by men. The proportion of papers submitted by women as the primary author, which had previously averaged at 37% from 2016 to 2020, plummeted to a mere 13% in the second quarter of 2020. This trend suggests that in the coming years, the academic landscape may reflect a significant imbalance, further perpetuating the existing gender disparities prevalent in academia.
In response to the pandemic, many scientists have had to adjust their routines and working dynamics, transitioning to remote work. Some researchers are seizing the opportunity presented by the shift away from face-to-face interactions, administrative tasks, and teaching responsibilities to focus more on scientific inquiry and paper publication. What used to require extensive time and rigorous scientific scrutiny is now being expedited, with findings being disseminated rapidly in the race to comprehend the disease and develop new treatments and vaccines. However, this transformation extends beyond research on SARS-CoV-2; the entire scientific community is grappling with this new reality. Concurrently, parents, particularly those with young children, are navigating complex challenges. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic demands that we rely on expert insights to forge a fairer and more inclusive society. Science plays a pivotal role in enhancing our understanding of the world and elevating the quality of life for all individuals. Given its immense potential, science should be accessible and inclusive to all. It is imperative that we urgently reassess our societal structures, timelines, paradigms, and expectations to address the injustices exacerbated by this global crisis.
In recent years, women have been engaging in collective actions to address and rectify injustices within the field of science. It is imperative that we do not allow the current pandemic to drag us into irreparable setbacks. It is crucial to persist in promoting the presence of women in academic settings across all levels, highlighting gender disparities and injustices, and collaborating to formulate action plans that can bring about substantial changes within the existing system.
One overarching cause lies in the predominant occupation of directorial and scientific advisory positions by men, who wield the authority to allocate scholarships in financial agencies and research institutions. Numerous studies have highlighted a prevailing trend towards same-sex gender bias within these spheres. Consequently, women in the scientific community face formidable challenges in redressing these gender disparities. Urgent action is imperative in the form of affirmative policies to address these injustices. Institutions must factor in gender imbalances when making decisions regarding funding allocation, career progression, and leadership appointments. It is crucial to expand graduate scholarships, particularly during the ongoing pandemic, to prevent mother-scientists from facing financial hardship. Failure to implement these corrective measures will likely result in a cumulative exacerbation of gender and maternity-related inequalities, further compounded by the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on academic disparities.
