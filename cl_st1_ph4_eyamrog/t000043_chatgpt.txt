The Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) and Self-Controlled Risk Interval (SCRI) study designs are utilized in pharmacovigilance to investigate rare events, with cases serving as their own controls. Despite their common use, there is currently no established tool for assessing the methodological quality of such studies. Critical appraisal in primary and secondary research is essential as it allows readers to understand how a study was conducted and to consider this when evaluating the presented evidence. This paper introduces a proposed instrument derived from an existing tool used for cohort studies, integrating elements from this tool with the principles of SCCS and SCRI study designs. The aim is to provide researchers and readers with a tool to effectively evaluate SCCS and SCRI study designs.
The Self-controlled Case Series (SCCS) method is an observational epidemiological study design utilized to investigate the temporal relationship between a time-varying exposure and the abrupt onset of events. This study design involves cases serving as their own controls, allowing for a focused examination of the association between exposure and outcome (1–5).
Originally developed in 1995 for assessing vaccine safety in pharmacoepidemiology, this method has now found application in general epidemiology. It is a derivative of a cohort study design, where individuals who have encountered the event of interest are monitored over a predetermined observation period to identify exposure history and event occurrence. Within this observation period, distinct risk and control periods are established, typically of varying durations. The risk period, predetermined and considered the time during or post-exposure where individuals face an altered risk of the events of interest, is contrasted with the control period, encompassing any time within the observation period not part of the risk period. For instance, in a study examining the risk of GBS following Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccination in England, the risk period commenced at vaccination (day 0) and concluded on day 91, with the control period encompassing any time outside this risk period.
Information from previous events can often assist in delineating the risk period. An illustrative instance is evident in the context of influenza vaccines and the emergence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), where the predetermined risk period spans 42 days post-vaccination. This specific timeframe was established subsequent to a series of GBS incidents in the United States in 1976 following the administration of the A/New Jersey influenza vaccine. Within this designated risk period, it is postulated that there exists an elevated likelihood for vaccinated individuals to manifest GBS, with the period thereafter serving as the control phase.
The self-controlled case series (SCCS) design is well-suited for analyzing both independent recurrent events and rare non-recurrent events. Several key assumptions underlie the applicability of the SCCS method. Firstly, the events under study must be rare in occurrence. Additionally, the happening of one event should not influence the likelihood of subsequent exposures; in other words, consecutive events should be independent. Furthermore, the event of interest should not censor or impact the observation period, and each individual's observation period should be distinct from the event times. It is important to note that the independence of observation periods from event times may be compromised in cases of death (1,2,4,5,7).
The Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) method is utilized to estimate the relative incidence (RI) of events of interest occurring within a specified time frame following a transient exposure compared to a control period. The RI is calculated as the ratio of events during the exposure risk period to those in the control period, as outlined in previous studies (1, 6, 11).
The primary advantage of the Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) design lies in its ability to rigorously control for time-invariant confounders that influence standard rates, such as sex, location, genetics, socioeconomic factors, and underlying health conditions. This design is cost-effective and facilitates easier data collection since it only necessitates cases with the specific event of interest. Furthermore, SCCS demonstrates methodological efficiency when compared to cohort designs, particularly evident in scenarios like monitoring adverse events post-vaccination, where traditional cohort studies may struggle to recruit unvaccinated controls due to data collection practices focusing on individuals reporting adverse events. SCCS's requirement for a smaller study population enables the generation of clinically and statistically valid results from a limited number of cases. However, limitations of the SCCS design include its inability to provide absolute incidence estimates, reliance on relative incidence estimates, assumptions regarding exposure probability independence from outcome occurrence, transient exposure effects, lack of adjustment for temporal variations, susceptibility to selection and information biases (often reliant on surveillance databases), and applicability primarily to non-recurrent events with low event risks over the observation period.
The Self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) represents a modification of the Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) design, wherein cases serve as their own controls. This approach involves delineating a risk period and a corresponding control interval, typically positioned either before or after the exposure of interest. Notably, the SCRI design features a condensed control interval, particularly evident in studies involving vaccines. Following the identification of the risk period, a brief timeframe proximal to the vaccination event is selected as the control interval, thereby mitigating potential confounding factors such as age and seasonality. The control interval is typically aligned with the duration of the risk period, as exemplified in a study examining adverse events post-varicella vaccination in Taiwan. Here, the risk interval spanned from day 1 to day 42 post-vaccination, while the control interval encompassed the subsequent period from day 43 to day 84 following vaccination.
The notable distinction between the two study designs lies in the observation period. In the SCRI design, the vaccination date serves as the index date, which then defines both the risk and control periods. Conversely, the SCCS design opts for an observation period that is not contingent on the vaccination date, with all cases being identified within this specified timeframe (14).
Similar to the SCCS, the SCRI design effectively controls for fixed confounding factors such as sex, race, genetic factors, preexisting health conditions, and geographical locations. However, for time-varying confounders like seasonality and age, explicit adjustments are necessary. For instance, in the context of vaccines, adverse effects can vary significantly among children and over the follow-up period, potentially leading to false positive impressions of vaccine effects when confounded with other factors (13,14). In contrast to the SCCS, which considers both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals when analyzing adverse effects post-vaccination, the SCRI design exclusively focuses on vaccinated cases (13). This exclusive focus on vaccinated cases is a key strength of the SCRI design, effectively reducing bias that may arise when comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated cases (16).
The utilization of SCCS and SCRI study designs holds significant importance in epidemiology, particularly in scenarios where alternative study designs may not be as appropriate, such as when investigating adverse events following vaccination in pharmacovigilance. Therefore, it is essential to assess and report the quality of these study designs while adhering to their fundamental assumptions.
In evidence synthesis, it is crucial to conduct a thorough critical appraisal of the included studies to evaluate the credibility of their findings, which directly correlates with the level of methodological rigor applied. This process also aids in assessing the transparency and reproducibility of the published evidence. The lack of critical appraisal poses a significant obstacle for consumers of the generated evidence, as it hampers their ability to interpret research findings effectively by considering the strengths and weaknesses of the study in question (17,18).
To our understanding and following consultations with two esteemed researchers in SCCS/SCRI design, it has been revealed that there is currently no established methodological assessment tool that has been documented and validated for assessing the methodology of SCCS/SCRI designs. In 2018, Wachira and colleagues modified the New Castle Ottawa Scale, originally designed for evaluating cohort studies, to assess SCCS study designs in their systematic review on the etiology of Guillain-Barré. The objective of this current study is to introduce a methodological quality assessment tool that can be utilized for evaluating the quality of SCCS/SCRI study designs.
The quality assessment tool utilized in this study is a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (19) specifically designed for evaluating the quality of cohort studies, as outlined by Wachira and colleagues, taking into account the fundamental assumptions of SCCS/SCRI (21). The adaptation of this tool was carried out by V.W and subsequently evaluated by H.M and M.R. This tool has also been employed by two other researchers in their respective systematic review studies (22,23).
Two widely utilized approaches in the quality assessment of primary studies are the component approach, which involves evaluating the individual items within each domain of the assessment tool, and the composite approach, which takes into account the quality scores of each domain to provide an overall score (24).
The proposed quality assessment tool comprises three distinct sections: Selection, Comparability, and Outcomes, as delineated in Table 1. Within the Selection segment, the tool scrutinizes the representativeness of chosen cases in the SCCS/SCRI concerning the total cases derived from the study population, case definitions, exposure ascertainment, and the absence of the outcome of interest at the observation period's commencement. Moving to the Comparability section, the tool assesses confounding variables that may fluctuate over time, such as age and seasonality. It is imperative for the study to disclose whether these factors were taken into account and if any adjustments were implemented during result analysis. Lastly, the Outcome section entails an evaluation of outcome ascertainment, explicit delineation of risk and control periods, and the sufficiency of observation durations.
In each section of the assessment, stars are allocated to evaluate the overall quality of the study. Section 1 can receive a maximum of three stars if the cases are representative of the general population, as seen in vaccine safety studies, if there is a clear identification of the exposure of interest, and if the occurrence of the outcome of interest is demonstrated within the observation period. Section 2 can be awarded up to two stars if the study accounts for time-varying confounders or if the follow-up period is sufficiently short to minimize time-related confounding factors. Section 3 allows for a maximum of five stars if there is a clear method of confirming outcomes, if the risk and control periods are clearly defined, if the duration of these periods allows for meaningful analysis of the outcome, and if there is complete follow-up or accountability for lost cases. Overall, a study can receive a maximum of 10 stars based on these criteria.
In the initial iteration of the assessment tool, the evaluation of a study's overall quality is categorized as "poor quality" if it receives 3 stars, "moderate quality" for up to 6 stars, and "high quality" for 7 to 10 stars. This grading system serves as a guideline for assessing study quality, but users have the flexibility to adapt and apply it based on the unique characteristics of the research questions addressed in the studies under analysis.
The tool did not assign weights to the sections, allowing users to have flexibility in assessing the overall quality of the study based on the requirements of the quality assessment and the specific nature of the evidence synthesis being evaluated. Table 1 displays the sections of the quality assessment tool, provides explanations of the items considered, and outlines the criteria for awarding stars to these items.
Various quality evaluation tools exist for both quantitative and qualitative studies. Researchers often customize existing tools or create their own to suit their specific requirements, as was the case in our study. In 2018, we encountered the need to assess SCCS and SCRI as part of a systematic review, yet we were unable to locate a suitable pre-existing tool. Consequently, we opted to modify the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) originally designed for cohort studies to meet our evaluation needs.
The initial version of the quality assessment tool for SCCS and SCRI is presented here. This tool has been utilized in various studies, including a master's dissertation, a published article, two scientific initiation program projects (not yet published), a thesis, and an article currently under review for publication. It is constructed based on the NOC, which, notably, has not been previously published in a journal and therefore has not undergone peer review. However, it is important to highlight that the instrument was developed using the Delphi method, has been tested in numerous systematic reviews, and has undergone modifications throughout this iterative process. Despite criticisms directed towards the NOS, it has been employed to assess numerous studies featured in published systematic reviews, thereby affirming its validity and practicality.
In the initial iteration of the tool, quality scores are suggested, yet no specific weighting scores have been assigned to the individual items within the assessed domains. This approach offers flexibility in the evaluation process, tailoring it to the specific type of evidence synthesis under consideration. Criticism has been directed towards quality scores in the past, as they have been deemed inadequate predictors of a study's overall quality, particularly when factored into the performance of a meta-analysis (26,27).
The SCCS and SCRI study designs are commonly employed in pharmacovigilance to analyze rare events, particularly in the context of studying populations post-vaccine exposure, such as with influenza vaccines and Human Papillomavirus vaccines. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and the subsequent global administration of Covid-19 vaccines in 2021, there has been a notable temporal association between these vaccines or SARS-CoV-2 infection and the occurrence of events like GBS, stroke, encephalitis, and psychiatric events. A plethora of primary and secondary studies have emerged to document these associations. In such instances, the SCCS and SCRI methodologies could prove beneficial, especially when coupled with a proposed quality assessment tool to ensure adherence to methodological rigor, thereby enhancing the reliability of the findings.
The proposed quality assessment tool, utilized in several studies, some of which are published or undergoing peer review, is an adaptation developed to evaluate self-controlled study designs. It is important to note that this tool emerged based on specific needs. Over time, it will undergo a Delphi process to validate its utility and improve its applicability. The anticipation is that this tool will aid in the critical evaluation of the methodological quality of Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) and Self-Controlled Risk Interval (SCRI) studies, with the hope that it will be refined and customized further by the scientific community.
The self-controlled case series (SCCS) and self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) designs are crucial in pharmacoepidemiology, particularly for investigating rare events following transient exposures, such as the association between influenza vaccines and the development of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). This paper introduces a novel quality assessment tool tailored for such studies. The need for this tool arose when the authors encountered a lack of existing instruments to evaluate the methodological quality of SCCS/SCRI designs. Consequently, the authors modified an existing tool, aligning it with the fundamental principles of SCCS/SCRI. This tool is anticipated to assist researchers in appraising the methodological robustness of SCCS/SCRI study designs, a necessity that has become even more pressing during the Covid-19 pandemic. Given the widespread use of these designs in investigating events following Covid-19 vaccine administration, the tool is poised to be particularly valuable in current research endeavors.
