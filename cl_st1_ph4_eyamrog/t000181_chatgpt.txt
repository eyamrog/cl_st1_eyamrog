The Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread exponentially worldwide, particularly in America, with Brazil emerging as one of the most severely affected countries by mid-June 2020, reporting over one million cases and up to 50,000 deaths. This study seeks to evaluate the fear and peri-traumatic stress experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, with the goal of improving infection control strategies, implementing appropriate interventions, and shaping public health policies. Conducted as a cross-sectional survey from April 12th to 18th, the study utilized the Peri-Traumatic Distress Scale (CPDI) and the Fear Scale (FCV-19S) to gauge peri-traumatic stress and fear as psychological responses to the pandemic. An online spreadsheet was employed to distribute the questionnaire and scales to a sample of 1844 participants for data collection purposes. Notably, both scales exhibited a correlation factor of (r=0.660). The findings underscore significant gender disparities, with women consistently displaying higher mean scores on both scales, underscoring the importance of ensuring women's perspectives are integrated into policy-making processes. Given the socially constructed gender roles that position women strategically, their inclusion is crucial for advancing multi-level interventions, promoting equitable policies, and devising innovative strategies to combat the pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, China, towards the end of 2019 and had already reached a dozen countries by the beginning of 2020. Subsequently, the global number of cases has been increasing exponentially. Presently, Brazil stands out as one of the most severely impacted nations, with the virus spreading across all five regions. As of the commencement of this study on June 19, 2020, Brazil had reported 1,038,568 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 49,090 fatalities and 520,360 recoveries.
From a bioecological perspective, prior studies on pandemics have illuminated a profound and extensive array of psychosocial repercussions on individuals amidst infectious outbreaks. At a micro level, individuals are prone to encountering apprehensions regarding their own health and mortality, a sense of powerlessness, and social stigma (Wang et al., 2020). Moreover, they face threats to their own well-being and that of their loved ones, along with an increased likelihood of experiencing mood fluctuations, depressive symptoms, irritability, anxiety, fear, anger, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, and alterations in subjective well-being (Abad, Da Silva, das Neves Braga, Medeiros, De Freitas, Coimbra & Da Silva, 2020).
Pandemics, on a meso level, are linked to significant disruptions in daily routines, separation from loved ones, school closures, scarcity of essential supplies like food and medicine, loss of income, and enforced social isolation through quarantine or other distancing measures. Moreover, the looming threat of overwhelming healthcare systems during the Covid-19 pandemic has instilled fear among the populace (Choi et al., 2020; Taylor, 2019). Looking at the macro level, the repercussions on cultural, political, and socioeconomic aspects must be acknowledged, with Covid-19 significantly impacting areas such as education, employment, and the nature of work. The uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of these events and the timeline for a return to normalcy remains unclear (Danese et al., 2020).
Individuals across different nations encounter varying degrees of stress, fear, and distress. For instance, the experience of fear in China amidst the pandemic contrasts with that in Iran, Italy, and Spain, underscoring the necessity to investigate mental health determinants within specific countries during the Covid-19 crisis. This research is crucial for accurately pinpointing, monitoring, and supporting individuals who are particularly vulnerable to mental health challenges (Jahanshahi et al., 2020; Maza et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).
A collaborative effort between Brazilian and international researchers, driven by a shared interest in understanding the psychological impacts and varied states induced by the rapid global spread of Covid-19, led to the inception of the research project titled "Physical, Psychological, and Cognitive Reactions to Covid-19." This project received approval from the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) of the Federal University of Alfenas (UNIFAL-MG) under process number 4.128.627. Structured into six modules, each module is dedicated to evaluating specific dimensions of psychological states stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic: psychological responses to pandemics, factors contributing to psychological vulnerability, the effects of social isolation, the role of media in disseminating information about Covid-19, effective strategies for managing psychological distress, and the implications for public health policies, including interventions for risk communication.
This study not only adds to the existing body of Brazilian literature on the Covid-19 pandemic but also seeks to evaluate the levels of fear and peri-traumatic stress experienced during the Covid-19 outbreak in Brazil. The overarching goal is to improve infection control strategies, implement effective interventions, and inform public health policies.
The initial phase of the research project, titled "Physical, Psychological, and Cognitive Reactions to Covid-19," involved the implementation of a cross-sectional survey from April 12th to 18th. The primary objective of this survey was to assess peri-traumatic stress and fear as psychological responses amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. To facilitate data collection, an online spreadsheet utilizing Google Forms was employed to distribute the questionnaire and scales to the study participants.
Prior to completing the questionnaire, participants were required to read and agree to the terms outlined in the Participant Consent Form, which detailed the study's purpose and procedures, as well as their right to decline to answer any question or withdraw from the research at any point. Initially, a total of 1875 individuals were contacted to participate in the study; however, 31 incomplete questionnaires had to be excluded from the analysis, likely due to issues such as internet connectivity problems that may have hindered the completion of the questionnaire. This resulted in a final sample size of 1844 participants for the study.
Participants initially completed a socio-demographic survey, which inquired about chronic disease prevalence and levels of social isolation experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic. Subsequently, distress levels were evaluated using the Peri-Traumatic Distress Index (CPDI), a self-report questionnaire specifically crafted to gauge depression, anxiety, avoidance, compulsive behavior, specific phobias, cognitive alterations, physical symptoms, and the decline in social functioning (Qiu, Shen, Zhao, Wang, Xie & Xu, 2020).
The twenty-four questions were presented in a Likert format with five categories of responses ranging from "never" to "most of the time." The authors noted that scores on this scale range from 0 to 100, with scores between 28 and 51 indicating mild to moderate distress, and scores of 52 or higher indicating severe distress. The content validity of the CPDI was confirmed by Psychiatrists from the Shanghai Mental Health Center, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.95 (p<0.001) (Qiu, Shen, Zhao, Wang, Xie & Xu, 2020).
Fear was assessed using the Covid-19 Fear scale (FCV-19S) in a Likert format comprising five response categories (strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree). This scale, consisting of seven items, demonstrated strong psychometric properties with a Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency of 0.82, rendering it reliable and valid for evaluating and alleviating fears associated with Covid-19 among individuals (Ahorsu, Lin, Imani, Saffari, Griffiths & Pakpour, 2020). Scores on the scale range from 7 to 35, indicating varying levels of fear: normal (7 – 16), mild to moderate (17 – 26), and severe (27 – 35).
The authors granted permission for the utilization of the FCV-19S and CPDI scales in this study. These scales were translated and adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. Descriptive statistics were employed as the method of data analysis, encompassing the calculation of average scores for CPDI and FCV-19S, frequency ranges for males and females, and the correlation coefficient of the scales using Pearson's r.
The characteristics of the participants, including gender, age, marital status, number of children, education level, job status, and levels of social isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic, were initially evaluated and are presented in Table 1. Among the sample, 643 participants (34.9%) reported a prevalence of chronic diseases, with notable instances of suffering and indicators of psychological disorders (16.1%). This is significant due to the multifaceted impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which not only affects individuals physically but also psychologically by disrupting lives, instigating public panic, and causing mental health distress (Bao, Sun, Meng, Shi & Lu, 2020). The repercussions extend to pathological anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and depression (Veer, Riepenhausen, Zerban, Wackerhagen, Engen, Puhlmann, ... & Mor, 2020).
From a Covid-19 control strategy perspective, it is crucial to consider the prevalence of hypertension, which stands at 10.4%. Non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular issues, and chronic obstructive pulmonary illnesses have been linked to the requirement for intensive care units (Fernandes, 2020). This correlation underscores the significance of flattening the curve of infections within a complex political, economic, and social landscape. The fragility of health systems and the high rates of contagion further emphasize the urgent need for effective control measures (Abad, Da Silva, das Neves Braga, Medeiros, De Freitas, Coimbra & Da Silva, 2020).
Based on the data presented in Table 1, a preliminary profile of the participants can be constructed: nearly half of them are single (48.7%), predominantly female (79.8%), with an average age of 36.2 years, most having one child (75.7%), and the majority holding a college degree (complete or incomplete 89.7%). A significant portion are employed (69.5%), possess health insurance (69.4%), and have experienced social isolation during the pandemic (87.0%). This profile holds psychological significance as it aligns with the known biological, behavioral, and cognitive distinctions between genders, which can impact healthcare approaches concerning the presentation, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of prevalent diseases (Regitz-Zagrosek, 2012).
The gender dimensions of the pandemic encompass both physical and socially constructed aspects, impacting individuals of different sexes in varying ways (Smith, 2019). Women are commonly perceived as being more cognizant of their healthcare needs, displaying greater adherence to counseling and treatment regimens, and are more inclined to seek medical attention compared to men (Rugema et al., 2019). This trend may elucidate the higher participation rates of females in surveys, including the one under consideration and others (Lauri Korajlija & Jokic‐ Begic, 2020).
Moreover, as highlighted by Smith (2019), the availability of health services, governance structures, and interactions with emergency responders all exhibit gender dimensions. This is further compounded by Rugema et al. (2019) who emphasize the impact of gender roles and stigma on adherence to counseling and treatment. Consequently, it can be deduced that women play a crucial role in controlling the transmission of the coronavirus and thereby enhancing global health security, as posited by Wenham, Smith, and Morgan (2020). Therefore, it is imperative to integrate women's perspectives and expertise in decision-making processes, preparedness efforts, and responses to the pandemic, particularly given the inadequate representation of women in global Covid-19 policy forums (Wenham, 2020).
Table 2 presents the gender frequency scores for the Peritraumatic Distress Scale (CPDI) and the Fear Scale (FCV-19S). Across both scales, women exhibit higher mean scores. Specifically, women tend to have CPDI frequency scores predominantly falling within the mild and severe distress frequency levels, with percentages of 47.3% and 27.2% respectively, while men's scores are more concentrated in the normal and mild levels, at 41.6% and 48.4%. Similarly, the majority of women's FCV-19S frequency scores are at a mild level (44.5%), contrasting with men whose scores predominantly fall within the normal level (68.8%). Notably, women's scores at the severe level (15.4%) surpass those of men (4.8%).
The results of the study revealed a significant association between female gender and heightened levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. This aligns with previous research findings that consistently demonstrate a link between being female and experiencing increased psychological distress (Olagoke, Olagoke & Hughes, 2020; Maza et al, 2020; Wang et al, 2020; Qio et al, 2020). Moreover, the "Mental Health in the UK and COVID-19" report further supported these findings by indicating that elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were more prevalent among younger individuals and females during the pandemic (Jia, Ayling, Chalder, Massey, Broadbent, Coupland & Vedhara, 2020).
The findings align with a nationwide survey on psychological distress among Chinese individuals during the Covid-19 pandemic, indicating that female participants exhibited significantly higher levels of psychological distress and were more prone to developing post-traumatic stress disorder compared to their male counterparts (Ahorsu, Lin, Imani, Saffari, Griffiths & Pakpour, 2020; Jia, Ayling, Chalder, Massey, Broadbent, Coupland & Vedhara, 2020). Additionally, the mean scores for gender differences in the Brazilian CPDI data (41.1 and 33.2) from our study surpass those observed in the Chinese population (24.87 and 21.41) (Ahorsu, Lin, Imani, Saffari, Griffiths & Pakpour, 2020).
Gender differences, characterized by elevated levels of fear and distress among female respondents, may be viewed through the lens of social construction. It is plausible that men, who may not openly articulate their concerns regarding Covid-19, could potentially disregard the preventive sanitary guidelines advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO) for containing the spread of the virus. This non-compliance could manifest in various ways, such as undermining risk communication initiatives by authorities and media, neglecting basic hygiene practices, and failing to adhere to social distancing measures - all of which are critical risk factors in the effective management of the pandemic.
The CPDI scale indicates that anxiety, exhaustion, and attention deficit were the factors with higher scores, showing significant gender differences. Women exhibited elevated levels of anxiety, reporting feeling anxious often (30.5%) and most of the time (23.7%) during the pandemic. In contrast, men displayed lower levels of anxiety, reporting feeling it often (21.2%) and most of the time (13.6%). A study conducted by Maza et al. (2020) with 2766 volunteers assessed anxiety levels during the pandemic. The results indicated high levels of anxiety, with ranges varying from medium (81.3%), high (7.2%), to extremely high (11.5%), particularly associated with young age, female gender, family members infected with Covid-19, and a history of stressful situations and medical problems (Maza et al., 2020).
In light of the disproportionate burden and risk shouldered by women in assuming the majority of healthcare provider roles within the home, often without adequate external support (Smith, 2019), significant disparities emerged in responses to the fourteenth question of the exhaustion factor scale. Men reported lower scores, with 20.7% indicating they never felt tired or exhausted, and 26.4% stating they only occasionally experienced such feelings during the pandemic. In contrast, women reported higher frequencies of feeling tired or exhausted, with 22.5% feeling this way often and 27.9% feeling so most of the time. Additionally, the closure of schools had a distinct impact on women, who typically bear the primary responsibility for providing informal care within families (Smith, 2019).
The question of scale measuring the attention deficit factor revealed significant gender differences: men reported lower scores, indicating they rarely (20.9%) or occasionally (29.8%) found it challenging to concentrate during social isolation, while women's responses indicated they often (19.9%) and most of the time (24.8%) experienced difficulties. These findings may be linked to the higher levels of exhaustion reported by women during the pandemic and potential cognitive disparities between genders (Regitz-Zagrosek, 2012).
In the FCV-19S survey, two questions revealed notable gender disparities in responses. The first question, "I am most afraid of coronavirus-19," saw 74.1% of women agreeing to being most fearful of the virus, in contrast to only 34.8% of men selecting that option. Similarly, in response to the second question, "It makes me uncomfortable to think about coronavirus-19," 66.2% of women acknowledged feeling uneasy contemplating the virus, while only 26.1% of men chose that response.
The CPDI and FCV-19S scales exhibited a correlation coefficient of r = 0.660, as illustrated in Figure 1. Furthermore, a notably stronger relationship was observed between the FCV-19S scale and CPDI's question S3 (pertaining to feelings of terror upon imagining oneself or family members being infected), with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.728.
It is important to note the limitations of this study. Firstly, while the participants were drawn from various regions of Brazil, it is crucial to recognize that this survey cannot be considered a nationally representative sample. Secondly, the fact that a majority of respondents possessed either an incomplete or complete college degree means that the findings may not accurately reflect the broader Brazilian population.
The results from CPDI and FCV-19S indicate gender differences in response to the pandemic. It is crucial to ensure the representation of women's voices in policy-making arenas, given that socially constructed gender roles position them strategically to contribute to the enhancement of multi-level interventions addressing both primary and secondary effects of Covid-19, the development of equitable policies, and the exploration of novel approaches to pandemic control.
