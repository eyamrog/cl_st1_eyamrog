The emergence of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its association with severe pneumonia and deaths have highlighted deficiencies in the healthcare systems of numerous countries globally. While the primary focus has understandably been on caring for hospitalized patients, it is imperative to enhance Primary Health Care (PHC) initiatives. PHC serves as the entry point to the healthcare system in various nations, including Brazil, and plays a crucial role in prevention, protection, promotion, and treatment for individuals and communities. Brazil, like many other countries, has grappled with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Given Brazil's universal and decentralized healthcare system, with PHC serving as the cornerstone for health system reorganization, it is essential to underscore the significance of bolstering PHC in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic.
On February 26, 2020, 57 days subsequent to the Chinese government's notification to the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, the first confirmation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Brazilian territory. Since this initial confirmation, the virus responsible for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly disseminating throughout the country. As of April 15, 2020, the date of this paper's composition, there have been 28,320 confirmed cases (a daily increase of 3,058) and 1,736 deaths (a daily increase of 204 deaths). In this context, we emphasize the critical need to fortify Primary Health Care (PHC) in Brazil during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
In Brazil, the Unified Health System (SUS), established in the 1980s to provide universal and comprehensive care, has the crucial task of ensuring healthcare for over 210 million Brazilians and numerous foreigners living in or visiting the country. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SUS plays a vital role in containing the spread of the disease in Brazil by leveraging a vast network of hospitals, laboratories, research centers, health units, blood banks and blood products, as well as the support of private institutions and public universities.
In an effort to stave off the impending collapse of the healthcare system, a series of measures were implemented by the Brazilian government, mirroring strategies observed in other countries. Brazil bolstered its healthcare capacity by procuring over 200 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and recruiting more than 5,800 doctors through the Mais Médicos (More Doctors) Program, particularly targeting densely populated urban areas. A substantial financial injection of US$ 2 billion was allocated to private healthcare plans for the enhancement of infrastructure, procurement, and distribution of 10 million rapid SARS-CoV-2 tests across various states and municipalities. Furthermore, a budget of US$ 200 million was earmarked for the acquisition of ventilators, with an additional US$ 10 million allocated for scientific research. Notably, a significant sum of US$ 0.9 billion was reallocated from the Insurance for Traffic Accidents fund to bolster the public healthcare system (SUS). Despite these proactive measures, the healthcare system has struggled to provide comprehensive care to the populace, with the looming threat of system collapse becoming increasingly palpable and foreseeable.
Amidst the predominant focus on the hospital network, the significance of Primary Health Care (PHC) within the system has been disregarded. Within the strategy to combat the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil, there is a notable absence of explicit mention or emphasis on investing in and fortifying this crucial aspect of the healthcare system. It is our contention that neglecting to recognize the pivotal role of PHC during this pandemic could prove to be a critical oversight, potentially leading to the swift deterioration of the healthcare system as the number of COVID-19 cases escalates in the country.
In recent years, the component of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) that has experienced the most significant weakening is evident through various measures. This includes the disengagement of Cuban doctors who were pivotal in providing healthcare in vulnerable areas within Brazil, the discontinuation of the multi-professional model in Family Health care due to the elimination of financial incentives to the Center for Support to Family Health (known as NASF in Portuguese), alterations in primary healthcare (PHC) financing and organization following the introduction of the new National Policy for Primary Health Care in 2017, and modifications in the structure and implementation of primary health incentive programs like the Quality and Care Improvement Program (PMAQ in Portuguese).
Enhancing primary healthcare (PHC) during the current pandemic is considered a viable option. The Family Health Strategy (ESF), originally established as the Family Health Program (PSF) in the early 1990s, has played a pivotal role in reshaping healthcare practices in Brazil and solidifying PHC in the country. By 1998, Brazil had 2,054 family health teams, a number that had significantly increased to 41,619 by 2017, covering approximately 70% of the Brazilian population, which equates to around 143 million individuals. The implementation of the Mais Médicos (More Doctors) Program led to a rapid expansion in family health coverage from 66.9% to 70.0% between 2014 and 2017. The PHC workforce comprised over 36,000 health posts, 63,000 doctors, 70,000 nurses, 263,000 community health workers, and 26,000 oral health teams.
With a resolution rate of approximately 85% in meeting the basic health needs of the population, Primary Health Care (PHC) played a significant role in reducing hospitalizations for conditions sensitive to this level of care between 2001 and 2016. This reduction amounted to 45% overall, with notable decreases in hospitalizations for specific conditions such as asthma (76%), gastroenteritis (66.5%), and cardio and cerebrovascular diseases (57.3%). In municipalities where the Mais Médicos (More Doctors) program was implemented, the reduction in hospital admissions for these conditions was 4% higher compared to those without the program.
Immunization stands as a crucial component of Primary Health Care (PHC), with enhanced vaccination coverage leading to a decrease in hospitalizations stemming from preventable diseases like whooping cough, diphtheria, H. influenzae, and measles. Presently, there exist over 36,000 vaccine facilities offering 45 different types of immunological products, encompassing vaccines, serums, and immunoglobulins. The Unified Health System (SUS) administers 95% of the country's vaccine doses. In response to the pandemic, Brazil opted to advance the commencement of Influenza vaccination by a month, targeting a seasonal respiratory illness that escalates hospital admissions, potentially straining the healthcare system further. The initiative aims to immunize a minimum of 90% of the designated population, comprising 67.6 million individuals.
Established in 2011 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Telehealth program (Programa Telessaúde, in Portuguese) serves as an additional tool utilized by health professionals and managers in the fight against COVID-19. Through bidirectional telecommunication instruments, these individuals can address queries regarding clinical management, preventive measures, or work-related issues. A qualified professional then provides the requesting party with information grounded in current scientific evidence. This initiative has enhanced the quality of care delivered in Primary Health Care (PHC) settings and minimized unnecessary referrals of patients to higher levels of specialization.
A robust primary care system has the potential to decrease unnecessary hospital admissions, thereby alleviating the strain on hospital resources and increasing the number of available beds for COVID-19 patients. Additionally, it can lead to cost savings for the health system and ensure its long-term sustainability. Research conducted between 2010 and 2016 revealed that over 23,000 hospitalizations for primary care-sensitive conditions were prevented in Brazil, resulting in a substantial saving of US$ 6.1 million for the public coffers.
The significant role of Primary Health Care (PHC) in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic is widely acknowledged. Governments must prioritize efforts to enhance this aspect of the healthcare system to prevent exacerbating the health crisis, potential rapid system breakdown, and a rise in fatalities from COVID-19 and other illnesses influenced by PHC, such as diarrheal disease, respiratory issues, and cardiovascular conditions. Consequently, PHC stands as a crucial asset within the restricted array of resources accessible for combating COVID-19.
