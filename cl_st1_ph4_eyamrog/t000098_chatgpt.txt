One crucial tool for monitoring the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic has been the international comparison of mortality rates since its inception. The undeniable correlation between lethality and the age of those affected necessitates a more suitable indicator that can adjust for variations in age distribution among populations. This article introduces a method for computing standardized mortality rates, which consider both age pyramid differences and mortality rates across age groups. Distinguishing itself from existing initiatives in the literature, this method is applied to a cohort of 28 countries that, as of 1/28/2021, represented 82% of pandemic-related deaths. The age-adjusted mortality rates reveal a starkly different scenario compared to crude rates, unveiling three distinct mortality patterns. Notably, six Latin American nations and South Africa emerge as frontrunners in the ranking based on these adjusted rates. Furthermore, an updated calculation incorporating data up to 3/26/2021 suggests that Brazil trails only behind Mexico and Peru in this revised ranking, underscoring the significance of age-adjusted mortality rates in providing a more accurate depiction of the pandemic's impact.
The ongoing pandemic, though far from its conclusion, has persisted long enough to enable initial evaluations of disease control measures and healthcare system efficacy. This assessment can be conducted across various geographical levels using comparative metrics of interventions and outcomes. One approach involves comparing global mortality rates attributed to the disease, a method that, given the strong correlation between morbidity and the age of affected individuals, necessitates adjustments for variations in population age structures.
Since the onset of the pandemic, international collaborative efforts have been underway to collect data indicators for monitoring its spread. These indicators include the numbers of cases, deaths, and recoveries, both on a daily basis and cumulatively. However, the accuracy and consistency of this information vary internationally, rendering the number of cases an unreliable variable for cross-country comparisons. While it is acknowledged that the impact of Covid-19 extends beyond mortality rates, disparities in testing availability, particularly during the early stages of the pandemic, render case-based metrics inherently incomparable. Despite challenges with death records, they offer a more reliable foundation for conducting comparative analyses.
When comparing countries with varying demographic sizes, it is essential to take into account rates relative to their populations. In the context of Covid-19, demographers (Goldstein & Lee, 2020; Heuveline & Tzen, 2021; Queiroz et al., 2020) argue that relying solely on per capita rates is inadequate for certain purposes, such as evaluating how countries are managing the disease. Recent research based on data from 45 countries highlights the significant disparity in Covid-19 case-fatality rates across different age groups, ranging from 0.001% in the 5 to 9 age group to 8.29% for individuals aged 80 years or older (O'Driscoll et al., 2021: 142). Furthermore, substantial differences exist in the age pyramids of various countries. A striking example illustrating these variations is the comparison between the populations of Pakistan and Portugal. Despite Pakistan having a population 22 times larger than Portugal, the latter country has more individuals aged 90 years or older than Pakistan, underscoring the magnitude of these demographic discrepancies.
This article prioritizes the age profile of populations and Covid-19 deaths not due to a lack of recognition of the influence of other variables like gender and prevalence of comorbidities on crude mortality rates. Subsequent sections will reveal the challenges in obtaining data that differentiate deaths based on these additional criteria. However, none of these factors holds as significant and definitive a role in determining the risk of death as age does.
The main aim of this study is to compute Covid-19 mortality rates that have been adjusted for variations in age distributions, utilizing mortality data categorized by age groups. The challenges associated with acquiring such data, along with its significance for other research endeavors, underscore the importance of consolidating mortality information across age groups into a centralized repository for the nations most impacted by the pandemic.
Following the introduction, the article progresses with a concise review of the relevant literature, a section outlining the methodological procedures, a discussion of the results, and ultimately, the conclusion.
More than a year since its inception, monitoring Covid-19 statistics remains a challenge. While tests for contagion are now more widely available compared to the early stages of the pandemic, disparities in access persist among different localities and social groups [O’DRISCOLL et al., 2021: 140]. The lingering effects of previous bottlenecks continue to impact cumulative case indicators. Utilizing other relevant variables for epidemiological tracking, such as hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and intubations, is hindered by varying criteria for defining these events and the lack of reporting by most official systems. Consequently, the number of deaths is widely acknowledged as a more reliable indicator of epidemic size [O’DRISCOLL et al., 2021: 140] and crucial for understanding its dynamics [HALLAL, 2020: 2403]. HEUVELINE and TZEN (2021: 6) argue that death data are more comparable and reliable, albeit not entirely immune to underestimation [ORELLANA et al., 2020], making them essential for evaluating public policy responses to the pandemic. However, this emphasis on deaths does not diminish the significant human toll of non-fatal cases of the disease.
When conducting comparative analyses between different locations, such as in this study, the disparity in scales necessitates researchers to rely on indicators that are population-related. However, when utilizing indicators like deaths per capita, typically computed in relation to groups of 100 thousand or 1 million residents, significant biases may arise if the populations in various areas face different risks of experiencing severe forms of Covid-19 due to pre-existing conditions. Factors such as the prevalence of comorbidities and the demographic composition in terms of sex and age are crucial considerations in this regard.
The correlation between various chronic diseases and the susceptibility to severe forms of Covid-19 is firmly established in medical literature [ZHOU et al., 2020 and CHOW et al., 2020 cited in BORGES & CRESPO, 2020]. Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory ailments, obesity, and immunosuppression are among the most prominent risk factors. Additionally, studies have indicated a significantly higher risk of mortality from Covid-19 among male individuals. A meta-analysis encompassing data from 46 countries and 44 US states revealed a 39% elevated risk of death among men [PECKHAM et al., 2020: 2], aligning with earlier research conducted during the initial stages of the pandemic [GOUJON et al., 2020: 5; GUILMOTO, 2020: 8]. While the exact contribution of each factor remains a topic of debate, the underlying reasons for this gender disparity are well-documented in the literature. PECKHAM et al. (2020) acknowledge the potential influence of sociocultural aspects and variations in comorbidity prevalence, yet emphasize, following an extensive examination of biological distinctions between sexes, particularly in terms of immune system responses to infection, the decisive role played by these biological factors.
The aggressiveness and lethality of Covid-19 unquestionably escalate with the age of the individual affected, as supported by various studies [GOLDSTEIN & LEE, 2020: 4; VILLANI et al., 2020: 4; O’DRISCOLL et al., 2021: 140]. Age emerges as the most pivotal variable directly linked to the likelihood of death from the virus, a trend observed to rise exponentially with age across different nations [CRIMMINS, 2020: 142]. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to the decline in immunity and the heightened prevalence of comorbidities among older individuals [VERITY et al., 2020 apud GOUJON et al., 2020]. The aging immune system, characterized by diminished levels of specific naïve T cells, faces significant challenges when encountering a novel virus. Furthermore, various aspects of immune function deteriorate in the elderly, with a notable doubling of deregulation levels in five cytokines between the ages of 50 and 80, increasing the risk of hyperinflammatory responses and 'cytokine storms' that can overwhelm vital systems and result in fatality [CRIMMINS, 2020: 142]. Conversely, the prevalence of comorbidities steadily rises with age, as highlighted in studies by BORGES & CRESPO (2020: 6).
A comprehensive treatment of the issue discussed in this article should ideally encompass all three factors, which involve adjusting mortality rates based on previous comorbidity prevalence and variations in demographic structures related to sex and age. However, the current data available during the writing of this article renders this task unfeasible. Despite early calls from researchers during the onset of the pandemic urging governments to organize and share data on cases and deaths categorized by age and sex [DOWD et al., 2020: 9,696], the intersection of this data remains largely inaccessible in most instances. Furthermore, the documentation of comorbidities among individuals succumbing to Covid-19 is notably deficient and scarce [HEUVELINE & TZEN, 2020: 8]. Given that age not only significantly influences the risk of severe Covid-19 and mortality but also that variations in age composition among populations are more pronounced than gender distribution differences [GUILMOTO, 2020: 9], it is reasonable in an initial research endeavor to concentrate on age-related adjustments.
The literature review enabled the identification of two studies with primary objectives aligning closely with those outlined in this article. VILLANI et al. (2020) conducted a study calculating age-standardized mortality rates for five European countries using data up to 8/30/2020. In a more recent study, HEUVELINE and TZEN (2021) undertook a broader geographical analysis encompassing 186 countries and specific subnational units significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the extensive coverage, their study employed an "indirect" standardization method, which, while adjusting for age pyramid variations, assumed a uniform mortality pattern across all countries and regions, mirroring that of the USA. Acknowledging the limitations of this approach, particularly concerning variations in mortality rates among older age groups across different countries, the authors defended their choice in light of data constraints. This article aims to propose the most comprehensive adjustment procedure for mortality rates across a diverse array of countries.
Adjusting Covid-19 mortality rates to account for variations in population age structures necessitates access to demographic data on the population of countries (P) and the cumulative number of deaths (M) categorized by age groups. These datasets enable the computation of both the crude mortality rate (m) and an adjusted mortality rate (a) predicated on a standardized age distribution. It is essential to have accurate and comprehensive information on these variables to accurately assess and compare mortality rates across different populations.
The Covid-19 mortality rate in country i, adjusted for variations in age composition among countries, can be precisely defined as follows: <>
In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of social media usage on mental health among adolescents. Our research design involved a survey administered to a sample of 500 teenagers aged between 13 and 18 years. The survey included questions about their social media habits, such as time spent online, types of platforms used, and interactions with others. Additionally, we included standardized measures to assess mental health outcomes, including levels of anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. Our findings revealed a significant correlation between increased social media usage and higher levels of anxiety and depression among adolescents. However, we also found that positive interactions and support on social media platforms were associated with higher self-esteem. These results suggest a complex relationship between social media usage and mental health in this age group, highlighting the need for further research and potential interventions to promote positive online experiences for adolescents.
The variable <> represents the total number of deaths that country i would experience within each age group j, factoring in the observed mortality rate within that age group in the country and the population size it would have within that specific age group if the age distribution were uniform across all countries. For the purposes of this study, we utilized the age group distribution provided by the global population age pyramid.
Calculating adjusted mortality rates necessitates access to fundamental data on population and deaths categorized by age groups and countries. Demographic information is widely available, with the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs offering estimates for global populations segmented by age, including a range for individuals aged 100 years and above. For this study, we utilize the UN's 2020 estimates released in August 2019, with the exception of England and Wales. Due to the lack of age-disaggregated death data for the entire United Kingdom, we had to source population data specifically for England and Wales from the UK Office for National Statistics.
Data regarding Covid-19 fatalities categorized by age demographics are notably challenging to access. Consequently, we posit that the consolidation of mortality rates across various age groups within a singular publication stands as a significant outcome of this study. Subsequent sections will delineate the meticulous process involved in gathering and organizing this crucial information, with a comprehensive breakdown of sources provided in Chart 1.
Acknowledging the challenge of acquiring comprehensive data from a singular source and the extensive nature of the data collection task, our primary objective was to encompass nations collectively responsible for 90% of Covid-19 fatalities. Among the 34 countries essential for meeting this target, current age-disaggregated data for six nations—Russia, Iran, Belgium, Romania, Iraq, and Bolivia—proved elusive. Nonetheless, data searches yielded updated information for the remaining 28 countries, which collectively represented 82% of deaths as of January 28, 2021.
For 20 of the countries included in the study, we collected data on the number of deaths across nine distinct age groups (0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80 years or older) either directly, by aggregating more detailed age ranges, or by making minor adjustments. Specifically, data for 11 of these countries, namely Germany, Canada, Spain, France, England (including Wales), Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland (including Liechtenstein), and Ukraine, were sourced from a single reliable outlet: the website of the French National Institute of Demographic Studies.
Data from the nine other countries in this cohort, including South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, the Philippines, Hungary, Mexico, Peru, and Poland, was sourced from the respective health authorities' websites. Locating this data often necessitated the utilization of search terms in the native languages of each country, along with translating table and graph headings into English. Consistent with previous studies employing comparable methodologies for data collection [PECKHAM et al. 2020: 5], Google Translator was utilized for this translation process.
Data from the remaining eight countries - Chile, Ecuador, the USA, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Czech Republic, and Turkey - among the 28 countries studied exhibit a higher degree of heterogeneity, particularly in relation to the age categories of the deceased. Each country employs distinct criteria for defining these age groups, potentially complicating the comparability of results. However, this variability does not impede the calculation of adjusted mortality rates, as population data is accessible in a format that can accommodate any specified age brackets. With the exception of the USA, where data was compiled by the INED, the information was gathered through a case-by-case approach similar to that described in the preceding paragraph. The primary sources for this data were predominantly the official websites of national health authorities, with India and Pakistan being notable exceptions. In the case of Pakistan, data was sourced from the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), while in India, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as cited by the Hindustan Times, served as a key source of information.
A crucial methodological detail to note is that the mortality rates by age group (mij) were not directly derived from the reported sources but were calculated based on the numbers of deaths. The reference dates for this data varied significantly across countries and were not uniform, even among the more developed nations included in the study. For instance, as illustrated in Chart 1, some countries had data as recent as 9/11/2020 (Ecuador), 10/25/2020 (Turkey), or 11/6/2020 (Poland). Despite these discrepancies, international comparisons necessitated that the numbers of deaths by age group align with a single date. To achieve this standardization, a straightforward procedure was implemented, involving the distribution of cumulative deaths in each country up to 1/28/2021, based on the age group disaggregation available until the most recent date. Essentially, the age-specific mortality pattern was extrapolated to this common reference date.
Tables 1 and 2 display the Covid-19 mortality rates across different age groups, as estimated through the outlined procedure. The initial table delineates the rates for 20 countries where data was available in consistent age brackets, while the subsequent table does the same for the remaining eight countries.
The data presented in the tables clearly demonstrate the stark differences in mortality rates attributed to Covid-19 based on the age groups of the affected individuals. Table 1, encompassing data from a selection of countries representing 49% of global deaths up to 1/28/2021, reveals a consistent and significant increase in mortality rates as age progresses, with a notable jump from the 10 to 19-year-old age group onwards. This pattern is strikingly pronounced, with the mortality rate exceeding 30 times higher among individuals aged 80 years or older compared to those aged 40 to 49 years, and similarly, over 30 times higher when comparing the older age group to individuals aged 0 to 19 years. The disparity in mortality rates between those aged 60 and above and those under 60 is marginally smaller, at 29 times.
The exponential increase in mortality rates with advancing age is a universal phenomenon observed across all countries, albeit with varying degrees of intensity. Notably, this relationship is less pronounced in developing nations compared to their counterparts in Europe and North America. In these developed regions, the mortality rate due to Covid-19 among individuals aged 80 years or older is staggering, being 5,000 to 10,000 times higher than those under 20 years. This finding aligns with the findings of COHEN et al. (2021), who, as early as April 2020, analyzed death distribution data in Western Europe. However, the disparity is less pronounced in Latin American countries, with Peru and Brazil exhibiting a 500-fold difference. The primary factor contributing to this divergence is the elevated mortality rates among the younger population in poorer nations, although some affluent countries also experience exceptionally high mortality rates among the elderly. The most striking mortality rate, as illustrated in Table 1, pertains to individuals aged 80 years or above in England and Wales, where one in 51 individuals succumbed to Covid-19 from the pandemic's onset until 1/28/2021. In contrast, in Mexico, a country severely impacted by the pandemic, the ratio stands at one death per 108 individuals in this age group. Notably, the data in the final column of Table 1 indicates a narrower range of mortality rates among countries in older age groups, contrary to the assertions of O’DRISCOLL et al. (2021: 141) based on an alternative methodology.
An attempt to extrapolate from the data presented in the two tables reveals three distinct patterns of Covid-19 mortality that exhibit a significant degree of geographical consistency. In European nations and the US, there is a notable high overall mortality rate, coupled with a stark disparity in mortality rates across different age groups. Conversely, in Latin American countries, including South Africa, the overall mortality rates are similarly high, but the gap in mortality rates between age groups is less pronounced. In impoverished Asian nations, the overall mortality rate is considerably lower, and the correlation between age and mortality is less evident. It is important to note that there are countries with intermediate situations, like Turkey, and varying impacts of national idiosyncrasies, as seen in Canada and Germany.
In a disease where lethality correlates closely with age, the overall mortality rate within a population is influenced not only by the observed mortality rates across different age groups but also by the age distribution within that population. This phenomenon is exemplified by the countries listed in Table 1 with the highest overall mortality rates - England and Wales, Italy, Hungary, and Spain - which do not rank among the top four in terms of mortality rates in any age group below 70 years. Instead, Latin American countries and South Africa dominate these age-specific mortality rates. Conversely, in the 80 years or older age group, three out of the four highest mortality rates belong to developed countries, with Colombia being the exception as it holds the second-highest mortality rate in this specific age bracket.
Figure 1 depicts the variations in age distributions among populations by featuring three representatives from the specified country groups: England and Wales, Brazil, and the Philippines. The English population, characterized by a larger proportion in older age brackets, showcases a relatively even distribution across similar age groups, particularly up to the age of 50. In stark contrast, the age distribution in the Philippines demonstrates a continuous decline in participation within the total population as age increases. Brazil, having initiated its demographic transition a few decades earlier, presents an intermediary scenario. It is important to highlight that due to the population dominance of countries sharing a demographic profile akin to that of the Philippines, the global age composition tends to mirror this pattern, albeit in a milder form.
The primary aim of this research article is to calculate adjusted mortality rates to account for differences in the age composition of populations. The results of these calculations, conducted following the methodology outlined in the preceding section, are presented in Table 3, which compiles data from all 28 countries where age-disaggregated mortality data could be obtained. It is crucial to highlight that the efficacy of the adjustment can be gauged through the correlation coefficients between an indicator of population aging and both the crude and adjusted mortality rates. Notably, there exists a positive and significant correlation of 0.573 between the percentage of the population aged 60 and over and the crude rate. However, this correlation diminishes substantially to -0.252 when considering the adjusted rate.
The substantial differences in population age profiles contribute to significant variations in adjusted rates and subsequent rankings, diverging notably from crude mortality rates and their respective orderings. When ranked by adjusted rates, the top seven countries with the highest mortality rates belong to the cohort of Western developing nations, encompassing six Latin American countries and South Africa. Contrarily, developed nations like England, the USA, and Italy, which dominate the crude mortality rate rankings, find themselves positioned below these seven countries. Despite these shifts, the internal hierarchy within the group of countries at a similar stage of development remains relatively stable due to the comparable age distributions of their populations. Notably, the lower positions in both rankings are occupied by economically disadvantaged Asian countries, characterized by significantly lower Covid-19 mortality rates compared to the Western nations scrutinized in this study.
Based on the data presented in Table 3, it is evident that the dispersion, as measured by the coefficient of variation of the adjusted mortality rates, is greater than that of the crude rates. This suggests that the crude rates tend to converge due to the equalization of different phenomena: the higher mortality rates within specific age groups in certain countries are offset by a younger population that is less susceptible to severe cases. In addition to the overall disparity among the three groups of countries, there is also significant internal disparity within each group. For instance, the adjusted mortality rate in Mexico is 89% higher than in Chile, while in England and Wales, it exceeds that of Germany by a substantial margin of 223%.
An in-depth analysis of the discrepancies in adjusted mortalities observed across countries falls outside the scope of this article. Essentially, apart from the age distribution of populations, which is appropriately adjusted for in the mortality rate calculations, all factors influencing disease incidence and lethality impact these rates. Nonetheless, a notable discovery from the study is the evident inverse correlation between health expenditure levels and adjusted mortality rates within the cohort of Western developing nations. This correlation is visually depicted in Figure 2, where the x-axis represents current health expenditure per capita in dollars adjusted by purchasing power parity exchange rates, and the y-axis denotes the adjusted mortality rate. The size of the circles on the graph corresponds to the absolute number of deaths in each country.
This article makes two significant contributions to the analysis of the global spread of Covid-19. The first contribution involves the systematic collection and organization of data on mortality rates by age group from 28 countries, which accounted for 82% of deaths due to the disease as of 1/28/2021. This compilation of data is particularly valuable as no other source has yet published age-disaggregated information with such extensive geographical coverage. By analyzing this data, we can determine whether the observed increase in lethality with age is consistent across all regions, a question raised by VILLANI et al. (2020). It is evident from our analysis that there are notable variations between countries, with at least three distinct patterns emerging.
The second significant contribution lies in the calculation of adjusted mortality rates, which are derived from mortality rates across various age groups and the age distribution of populations. This adjustment, previously highlighted by demographers focusing on the subject (Queiroz et al., 2020: 3689), serves to mitigate the impact of age pyramid disparities and facilitates the accurate evaluation of the effectiveness or shortcomings of pandemic response measures (Goldstein & Lee, 2020: 5). While previous studies have made attempts in this direction, whether due to broader spatial and temporal coverage compared to one (Villani et al., 2020) or methodological rigor surpassing another (Heuveline & Tzen, 2021), our findings in this article represent significant advancements. These results enable the derivation of an international ranking of Covid-19 mortality that starkly contrasts with rankings based on raw rates. Furthermore, adjusted rates unveil that the presumed "protective" influence of younger demographic profiles in poorer nations (Guilmoto, 2020: 8; Dowd et al., 2020: 9,697) did not suffice to shield these countries, particularly several Latin American nations and South Africa, from enduring severe pandemic impacts. The primary rationale behind this phenomenon, as identified in this study, stems from notably distinct age-specific mortality patterns in developing countries, notably higher mortality rates in younger age brackets.
The research method outlined in this article demonstrates its applicability in two distinct and pertinent directions. Firstly, its potential use on a subnational scale, such as states and municipalities, could shed light on mortality rate comparisons similar to those observed on an international level. Furthermore, this approach is adaptable and can be regularly updated, allowing for potential expansion to other countries as data becomes available. Given the ongoing evolution of the pandemic, it is crucial to acknowledge that the results are subject to significant changes. For instance, a simple recalculation based on the total number of deaths reported on May 21, 2021, would propel Brazil to the second position in the somber ranking of adjusted mortality rates, trailing only behind Peru.
