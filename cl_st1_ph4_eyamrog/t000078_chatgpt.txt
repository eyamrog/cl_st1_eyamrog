The discussion surrounding sprawling urban employment has introduced theoretical models that address the concept of multiple centers; however, the specialized literature lacks a specific focus on empirical methods for identifying these centers. This paper aims to fill this gap by introducing a new empirical methodology for identifying and characterizing urban employment subcenters, specifically Small Business Districts (SBD), within the Municipality of São Paulo. Our approach involved a two-step process, incorporating Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis and a Spatial Hedonic Price Model. Through this methodology, we successfully identified seven regions within São Paulo that can be classified as SBDs.
Employment decentralization within the city is a significant factor contributing to urban landscape modifications, influencing wages, housing prices, transportation demands, and worker commuting (Fujita and Ogawa, 1982; Anas and Kim, 1990; Helsley and Sullivan, 1991). This decentralization of employment is a result of the suburbanization process (Glaser and Kahn, 2001), where economic growth extends from the Central Business District (CBD) towards the city's periphery, leveraging advantages in transportation costs, wages, and land prices (McMillen and Smith, 2003). McMillen (2001b) highlights that city growth facilitates a substantial concentration of employment outside the CBD, a common pattern in major American cities where suburbs accommodate families, offices, and employment, sometimes surpassing the central area in worker aggregation (McMillen, 2001a). These emerging sub-centralities significantly impact the city's structure, often referred to in Urban Economics literature as employment subcenters or Small Business Districts (SBD).
SBDs create competition for land among households and firms (Wheaton, 2004), impacting low-income families by leading to a shift in spatial location from the new business region towards the city's periphery due to rising rent prices. Consequently, there is a surge in public transportation demand from the outskirts to the city center, disrupting the traditional concentric transportation pattern of a monocentric town. Commuting patterns become less clear as households opt for cross-commuting, with workers choosing to supply their labor where their skills are in demand rather than solely focusing on minimizing commuting costs. As a result, workers do not have the guarantee of minimizing commuting distances.
Identifying sub-centralities enhances understanding of microeconomic development issues, including firm cost structures (such as congestion, labor force access, and land prices) and their impact on workers' welfare and productivity (such as spatial segregation, commuting, wages, and labor supply). Moreover, Spatial Business Development (SBD) can serve as a public policy tool to encourage the establishment of new business subcenters, alleviate congestion by bringing firms closer to workers, balance land prices spatially to reduce pressure on prices in the CBD region, and reshape public transport and taxation patterns.
Focusing on Brazil, the fifth-largest country in the world with an urban population concentration of 84% in cities, 43 million inhabitants reside within just 17 cities and contribute to 34.7% of the Brazilian GDP (IBGE). Specifically, in the Municipality of São Paulo, 11.446 million inhabitants occupy an area of 1,512 km², and in 2014, the GDP of the MSP was US$ 237 billion, representing approximately 11.7% of the national GDP, positioning the city as the wealthiest among all municipalities in the country (SEADE, 2017). Meyer, Grostein, and Biderman (2004) highlighted the employment trends across the districts of São Paulo (MSP). Since the 1960s, the service sectors have shifted from the old center (Sé district) towards the west and south. Initially, this concentration was observed in Jardim Paulista, followed by Cerqueira Cezar and Itaim Bibi districts. The latter attracted numerous firms due to the construction of Faria Lima Avenue in the 1970s, which emerged as one of the city's key avenues. Between 1970 and 1990, employment growth extended towards the Vila Olimpia neighborhood along Luis Carlos Berrini Avenue. More recently, from 2000 to 2010, companies have been expanding towards the far south and west zones of the city (refer to Table 1).
This paper aims to identify and characterize sub-centralities within the Municipality of São Paulo, with the objective of enabling future assessments related to employment decentralization, housing prices, commuting patterns, transportation demands, and wage gradients.
The paper is structured into five sections. The subsequent section delves into the monocentric and polycentric city, emphasizing the process of employment decentralization. Following this, the third section outlines the econometric identification strategy in two stages, presents the estimated results, and characterizes the SBD. Subsequent to the presentation of the main findings, robustness tests are discussed. The final section offers concluding remarks, explores potential extensions, and acknowledges limitations.
Pioneering economists in the field of New Urban Economics developed a theoretical model that posited job supply being concentrated in the Central Business District (CBD) of a monocentric city. This central premise was rooted in the historical development of cities, often near a transportation hub. Consequently, the outcomes of monocentric models suggest the CBD acts as a price anchor, with prices decreasing as distance from the city center increases, reflecting the rising transport costs. The model essentially argues that as one moves away from the CBD, the increase in distance must be offset by a corresponding increase in land prices to maintain equilibrium between firms and households. In essence, the endogenous variables of the model (such as population density, lot size, land price, and wages) exhibit an inverse spatial cone pattern, with their values being determined as a function of the CBD as the anchor point.
According to Romanos (1979), rental prices tend to be undervalued in regions with sub-centers. Furthermore, numerous cities boast multiple business hubs and subcenters. Contrary to the expectations of monocentric models, the property price gradient does not consistently decrease in relation to the city's central business district (CBD); however, in polycentric models, it does exhibit this pattern.
The theoretical literature on polycentric cities can be categorized into two primary strands. The first strand delves into the intricacies of the Central Business District (CBD) and Suburban Business District (SBD) as inherent components of the optimization process, taking into account economies of agglomeration and transportation costs (Ogawa and Fujita, 1980; Fujita and Ogawa, 1982; Anas and Kim, 1990; Helsley and Sullivan, 1991; Henderson and Slade, 1993; Sasaki and Mun, 1996; Berliant and Konishi, 2000). This strand primarily aims to evaluate the impact of the city's evolving spatial configuration on the labor and housing markets. Factors contributing to a dispersed workforce pattern include high transportation expenses, the absence of agglomeration benefits, direct sales to households, firms' land demands, and the higher price elasticity of labor demand. The second group of models focuses on analyzing the repercussions of employment decentralization on residential property prices and related aspects (Romanos, 1979; Yinger, 1992; Wrede, 2015). These models explore how individuals make decisions regarding their living and working locations, consequently influencing land prices, population density, and commuting patterns between work and home. The findings suggest a decline in land prices and wages as distance from the CBD and SBD increases, with the SBD serving as a pivotal point influencing real estate values and wage levels.
Firms encounter a tradeoff when deciding between localizing in SBD as opposed to CBD. Companies concentrated in CBD benefit from agglomeration economies, experiencing advantages that stem from clustering. These firms are not burdened by the frictions that often dissuade businesses from establishing themselves in suburban areas, such as challenges related to commuting and a limited pool of available labor (McMillen, 2001b).
The rise of sub-centers is intricately tied to the benefits of the de-agglomeration process, despite the advantages associated with CBD concentration. Businesses situated in the suburbs enjoy various perks, including lower land costs, convenient access to intercity and interstate roads, the ability to tap into a broader pool of workers over extended distances, and potentially lower wages (as there would be no need to compensate for commuting expenses). Effective communication could be facilitated if firms in the SBD were in close proximity to the CBD and had access to communication innovations. While the business diversity in SBDs might be somewhat limited, the negative impact of this non-diversity could be mitigated if there were low transportation costs and land opportunities near the CBD. Additionally, the size of the sub-center plays a role in offering employment and shopping options, thereby reducing household reliance on the central business district (McMillen, 2001b).
In the realm of empirical research, a definitive empirical strategy for SBD identification remains elusive. Initially, studies relied on prior regional knowledge for identification, but as highlighted by McMillen (2001b), the outcomes did not align with the data. More objective procedures have since emerged, including: 1) Cut-off values, where researchers establish density thresholds for jobs and total job numbers (McDonald, 1987; Giuliano and Small, 1991; McDonald and McMillen, 1998; Coffey and Shearmur, 2001; Baumont and Bourdon, 2002; López and Muñiz, 2005); 2) Econometric models (Craig and Ng, 2001; McMillen, 2001a, 2001b; McMillen and Smith, 2003); and 3) Spatial statistics (Plaut and Plaut, 1998; Baumont et al., 2004; Herman and Haddad, 2005; Guillain et al., 2003; Siqueira, 2014).
McDonald (1987) initially introduced the cut-off method for the Chicago metropolitan area, while Guiliano and Small (1991) expanded on this empirical approach by identifying 32 SBDs in Los Angeles, United States. According to their criteria, a sub-center is defined as a cluster of adjacent areas with a minimum density of ten employees per acre and a total of 10,000 employees. Despite their contributions, these models faced criticism for the subjective selection of locations, the sensitivity of results to the cut-off threshold, and the inability to be generalized to other urban areas (Anas et al., 1998; McMillen, 2001b; Baumont et al., 2004).
The two procedures discussed in this study are modifications of the original method introduced by McDonald (1987), which revolves around analyzing the residuals of a log density specification related to employment. Craig and Ng (2001) make a significant advancement by addressing the issue of subjectivity inherent in the previous approach. Their innovation involves the application of quantile regression specifically targeting the 95th percentile of the employment density distribution, focusing on areas with high density and employment based on their familiarity with the urban landscape. McMillen (2001b) raises concerns regarding the symmetric density function estimation around the Central Business District (CBD) and the researcher's preconceived notions about the employment distribution within the city under study.
McMillen (2001a, 2001b) introduced a two-stage model that does not necessitate prior knowledge of the city being evaluated. The initial stage mirrors the approach of Craig and Ng (2001), involving the regression of employment density logarithm against the distance to the CBD. Subsequently, SBD candidates are identified based on statistically significant residue clusters at a 5% level. Moving to the second stage, potential subcenters are taken into account, employing a semiparametric model. The nonparametric component of the regression, adjusted by a flexible Fourier approximation, utilizes the residuals from the first stage as the dependent variable and the distance to the CBD as the explanatory variable. Estimated distance coefficients that are statistically significant are deemed as SBD.
Spatial statistical models, rooted in Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA), serve as the foundation for evaluating the spatial patterns of employment levels and densities. Baumont et al. (2004) define sub-centers as areas characterized by high employment levels and statistically significant densities.
Approaches utilizing gross employment density (employment/area) are inherently influenced by the size of the area under consideration. Larger regions typically exhibit lower densities, while smaller regions tend to have higher densities, complicating the accurate identification of subcenters. Additionally, Mieszkowski and Smith (1991) highlight that coefficients derived from gross density calculations often result in an overestimation of the estimated coefficients.
SBD is distinguished by its high land prices, which decrease proportionally with distance, and by the clustering of employment, creating focal points of attraction for both firms and workers. The methodology employed by Plaut and Plaut (1998) and Herman and Haddad (2005) may not be the most advisable for pinpointing these central hubs. These authors factored in the error term of a hedonic price econometric model before applying the kriging approach. Nonetheless, the latter method could be susceptible to significant omitted variables, including unobservable real estate attributes or amenities that influence price differentials.
We introduced a two-stage approach that integrates the a priori identification of potential sub-centrality candidates into the hedonic price model. Initially, the first stage involves pinpointing all potential candidates for Suburban Business Districts (SBD) through an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) type of analysis. Subsequently, in the second stage, we execute the hedonic house price model while considering explanatory variables such as distances to the identified SBD candidates from the first stage. This two-stage methodology allows for the management of overidentification issues stemming from the utilization of employment levels concentrated in the polygon centroid. Consequently, both approaches enable the testing of the null hypothesis that each region does not qualify as an SBD.
The identification of SBD candidate areas relies on the ESDA technique, specifically the initial stage estimation strategy. Through this method, one can derive metrics for both global and local spatial autocorrelation. The Global Moran’s I statistic enables the examination of the spatial relationship pattern of jobs across the entire sample, considering area weights. In contrast, the Local Moran’s I facilitates the breakdown of the spatial relationship structure, categorizing clusters into HH (high-high), HL (low-low), LH (low-high), and LL (low-low) types. This differentiation is achievable as each observation in the sample undergoes computation of a specific Moran’s I, denoted as 𝐼𝑖 (where 𝑖 represents the evaluated region and ranges from 1 to 𝐼) (Anselin, 1995). Mathematically, <>, where 𝑧𝑖 signifies the employment deviation in Census tract 𝑖; 𝑊𝑧𝑖 denotes the average employment deviation value in neighboring tract zones of 𝑖, and 𝜎2 represents the variance of the deviation value. In terms of inference, the methodology employs random permutation for analysis.
In the second stage of our analysis, we turn our attention to the hedonic price approach. Broadly speaking, the hedonic price model aims to quantify fluctuations in prices based on variations in product quality, as outlined by Court (1939), Lancaster (1966), and Griliches (1971). This method is extensively employed in empirical research to assess the relationship between price and quality attributes of products.
In the context of a general hedonic model for house 𝑖 in year 𝑡, the estimated empirical model can be articulated as follows: <>. Here, 𝑃𝑖𝑡 represents the price of house 𝑖 in year 𝑡, 𝐶𝐵𝐷𝑖 denotes the center-house distance, 𝑆𝐵𝐷𝑝,𝑖 signifies the distances from house 𝑖 to each SBD candidate identified previously in the initial state, 𝑍𝑖𝑡 encapsulates the intrinsic characteristics of house 𝑖 in 𝑡, 𝐴𝑖 encompasses the distance vector of house 𝑖 to each 𝑙 amenities, 𝑇𝑖 denotes the distances of house 𝑖 to each 𝑚 avenues and modes of transportation, 𝐷 represents the time dummy vector, 𝜀𝑖𝑡 stands for the spatially autocorrelated error, and 𝑢𝑖𝑡 is the random error term. Spatial lags are constructed using 𝑤𝑖𝑗 (neighborhood spatial matrix) under specific conditions: a) 𝑤𝑖𝑗= 0 for 𝑗= 𝑖, b) 0 < 𝑤𝑖𝑗≤1 if 𝑗 is a neighbor of 𝑖, and c) <>, typically equal to one. Consequently, 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑃𝑖𝑡 represents the house price spatial lag, while 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑋𝑚,𝑖 denotes covariates spatial lag (𝑍𝑘𝑖𝑡, 𝐴𝑙𝑖, 𝑇𝑚𝑖). The coefficients to be estimated encompass 𝛼, 𝜌, 𝜃, 𝜏𝑝, 𝛾𝑘, 𝛽𝑙, 𝜅𝑜, 𝜇, 𝜆, and 𝜎𝑢.
The specification of Equation 1 deviates from the commonly accepted understanding in both theoretical and empirical urban economics literature. As noted by Hermann and Haddad (2005), studies in this field typically adhere to the linear or semi-logarithmic functional forms of the hedonic price function. Therefore, in line with this convention, Equation 1 will be estimated using these two functional forms.
The utilization of a spatial econometric model is primarily driven by a wealth of empirical research that views space as a fundamental aspect of the housing market, leading to the creation of spatialized databases (Arnold, 1987; 1998b). Furthermore, the significance of examining spatial association is underscored by the interplay of two effects: spatial heterogeneity can give rise to spatial autocorrelation, and conversely, spatial autocorrelation can lead to spatial heterogeneity.
To mitigate the risk of omitted variables, we account for the overall impact (comprising both direct and indirect effects) by utilizing spatial econometric models that account for these amenities. As highlighted by Can (1992) and Campos and Almeida (2018), the decomposition of real estate prices reveals two distinct effects. The first pertains to the property's inherent characteristics, while the second relates to the spatial spillover effect emanating from the surrounding neighborhood. Consequently, our focus in econometric analysis centers on the outcomes of the global effect.
In line with Kim, Phipps, and Anselin (2003), Campos (2017), and Campos, and Almeida (2018), it is evident that the distribution of extrinsic and intrinsic house characteristics does not follow a uniform pattern within a weighting area, as suggested by Megbolugbe and Hoek-Smit (1996). To address this issue, we aim to enhance our methodology by taking into account the spatial positioning of each house and amenity (such as schools, shops, libraries, etc.) rather than solely focusing on the quantity or presence of amenities within the weighting area. This approach enables the units within the weighting area to form distinct neighborhoods based on the size of the area delineated by the chosen distance matrix W cut-off. Furthermore, this method offers the advantage of circumventing the neighborhood boundaries enforced by governmental entities in defining the area composition (such as districts or census tracts).
In order to ensure the reliability of the findings, the sensitivity of the results to various weight matrices will be examined through robustness tests on the spatial matrix. This analysis aims to establish internal validity for the outcomes obtained. In terms of the robustness of the weight matrix, we will explore the impact of allowing for 5% and 10% distance, thereby expanding the initial cut-off and enabling larger neighborhoods to be considered.
The initial phase involves assessing the tract areas that exhibit statistically significant clusters through the implementation of the ESDA approach. Subsequently, the validation of these tract areas as SBD is conducted based on the hedonic price model. This second stage of the study's methodology involves an identification strategy that takes into account real estate spatial distribution for each year under consideration. Geocoding is utilized to pinpoint the locations of amenities such as schools, parks, hospitals, as well as transportation options like subways, trains, and access points to major avenues and roads. The geocoded data serves two primary purposes: a) pinpointing the precise locations of properties, amenities, and transportation within the city, and b) calculating the Euclidean distance from each property to public amenities and transportation facilities within the municipality.
After adjusting property prices for intrinsic characteristics, amenities, and transportation access, we hypothesized that the distance of each property to the suggested SBDs should exhibit statistical significance with negative coefficients to qualify as sub-centers. This methodological approach enables us to draw conclusions about the SBDs and assess whether the econometric model of hedonic prices in the real estate market aligns with theoretical predictions.
To initiate the estimation of the Hedonic Price Model, it is essential to note that the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation, as depicted in Equation 1, imposes specific constraints on the spatial parameters 𝜌= 𝜆= 𝜅𝑜= 𝜏𝑝= 0. This estimation serves as a means to determine whether control variables can effectively address the potential spatial dependence highlighted in existing literature, thereby enabling an assessment of whether the price gradient diminishes with increasing distance from the Central Business District (CBD).
The Moran’s I test is utilized to assess spatial dependence within OLS model residuals, following the empirical methodology proposed by Halleck Vega and Elhorst (2015) that emphasizes models incorporating the spatial lag of explanatory variables (SLX). As suggested by Gibbons and Overman (2012) and Halleck Vega and Elhorst (2015), the SLX model should be employed when spatial econometric analysis is warranted. Despite facing challenges like multicollinearity and complexities in causal interpretation, the SLX model stands out as the most adaptable among spatial specifications, offering ease of interpretation in terms of signal, magnitude, and statistical significance. Furthermore, it effectively sidesteps criticisms directed at global spillover models like SDM, SDEM, or GNS when estimating models (Halleck Vega and Elhorst, 2015).
We utilized a range of databases for our study. In the initial stage of estimation, we relied on the employment data from the Annual Social Information Report (RAIS – Relação Anual de Informações Sociais) provided by the Ministry of Labor to identify the SBD. This dataset encompasses all formally established (incorporated) organizations, both public and private, as well as workers holding a labor card, essentially serving as a census of formal workers. It is important to note that RAIS is confined to the formal labor market, which poses a limitation to our analysis as we do not account for the informal labor sector. Nevertheless, in 2013, formal employment accounted for 66% of the labor force within the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo, as indicated by the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD – Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios). The geocoding of firms and the aggregation of workers by Census tracts were carried out by the Municipal Secretariat for Urban Development (SMDU – Secretaria Municipal de Desenvolvimento Urbano) of the Municipality of São Paulo (MSP). The MSP comprises 310 Census tracts, as per the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).
In the second stage, real estate formal market data are utilized, sourced from the Brazilian Company for Heritage Studies (Embraesp), encompassing 4,758 thousand vertical and horizontal newly constructed housing units between January 2006 and March 2013 in the municipality of São Paulo (MSP). This database includes 271,861 apartments and houses within the specified timeframe. Despite constituting approximately 6% of the total domiciles in the MSP, each property launch price reflects the average market price trends within neighborhoods comprising numerous existing apartments and houses. Moreover, the Embraesp database offers insights into the spatially heterogeneous nature of property launching growth rates and housing typologies, indicative of the non-isotropic distribution of land use policies, consumer preferences, and financial considerations for construction firms. Notably, this database has been extensively referenced in prior research studies (Biderman, 2001; Maciel, 2010; Nadalin, 2010; Campos, 2017; Campos and Almeida, 2018).
The Embraesp database offers data on property size (floor area and total area), bedroom and bathroom count, parking spaces, elevators, apartment units per floor, building floors, and a dummy variable distinguishing between apartment and house typologies. However, details like condominium composition (pools, playgrounds, courts) are not included. To address this gap, we utilized the variance between total area and useful floor area as a stand-in for the condominium size per apartment.
An essential aspect of the database is its capability to handle new residential properties, thereby eliminating the necessity to account for property depreciation. In terms of monetary restatement, all prices underwent adjustments based on the IGP-DI index and were brought up to date as of December 2013. Geocoding within the database is achieved through the utilization of ZIP codes, street names, and property numbers, while the geographic coordinate system employed is SIRGAS 2000 with a UTM Zone 23S projection. This identical geographical projection is also utilized for the creation of maps.
To account for urban infrastructure, we computed the minimum Euclidean distance from each property to various transportation sites such as train and subway stations, main avenues, bus corridors, and highways, as well as amenities including urban parks, libraries, cultural centers, art galleries, theaters, concert halls, movie theaters, malls, race stadiums, resorts, sports centers, clubs, courts, soccer stadiums, elementary and high schools, hospitals, health centers, and favelas.
In the context of São Paulo, Figure 1 illustrates the spatial layout of the municipality through macro zones and Census tracts.
Due to the ad hoc nature of the neighborhood composition, various weighting matrices are being considered in this study. Specifically, binary contiguity matrices (queen and rook), distance matrices, and 𝑘 nearest neighbor weight matrices are utilized. In the contiguity matrices, 𝑤𝑖𝑗 is set to 1 if 𝑖 and 𝑗 are contiguous, and 0 otherwise. The distance weight matrix used calculates the centroid distances of the tracts based on Euclidean distance, where mathematically 𝑤𝑖𝑗≤𝑑𝑖𝑗. For this analysis, a maximum distance of 8 km for at least one neighbor is imposed to address the island issue in the econometric estimation. As for the 𝑘 neighbor weight matrix, six closest neighbors were selected, as this represents the average number of neighbors in the database.
Firstly, the results of the Global Moran’s I test should be taken into consideration. The findings for the employment variables are presented in Table 2, utilizing the weighting matrices previously outlined. It is important to note that all outcomes demonstrate statistical significance at the 1% level. Furthermore, it is crucial to highlight that all tests reveal a positive spatial correlation. This outcome implies a relationship of similarity between the employment levels and the spatial positioning of neighboring areas, indicating that the spatial pattern of employment in the MSP region is concentrated in neighborhoods where the residents share similarities with each other.
To identify potential SBD candidates, we utilize the Local Moran’s I, a component of the LISA (Local Indicator of Spatial Association) indicators. Table 3 displays the total number of tracts that are statistically significant at a minimum of 5%. The outcomes are notably influenced by the weighting matrix in distance format.
Although the weighting matrices (queen, rook, and 𝑘 neighbors) yield varying results, they exhibit smaller deviations from the aggregate outcome compared to the distance weight matrix. When examining the SBD candidates from São Paulo, only those that demonstrate statistical significance across all specifications and belong to areas identified as HH and HL clusters are considered. In this instance, 37 tract areas emerge as potential SBD candidates with a minimum significance level of 5%, all of which are categorized as HH exclusively, as outlined in Table 3. Among the three spatial weighting matrix specifications, namely queen, rook, and k neighbors, only one area fails to show significance for both rook and queen specifications simultaneously. Consequently, 36 weighting areas are identified as candidates for SBD.
In terms of the localization of these tract areas (see Figure 2), the above-average spatial concentration (HH) of employment levels is predominantly situated across the Center Zone (CZ), extending into portions of South Zone 1 (SZ1) and South Zone 2 (SZ2), as well as encompassing sections of the West Zone (WZ) with limited representation in the East Zone 1 (EZ1).
The econometric approach aims to validate the SBD candidates identified in the preceding subsection. Initially, the models will be estimated without SBD controls to provide insight into the coefficient measuring the distancing effect from CBD, focusing on the Municipality of São Paulo as a monocentric city.
The CBD coefficient is found to be statistically insignificant across all functional forms (Table 4, columns 1-2). When the model is adjusted for the quadratic effect of CBD distancing, the coefficients deviate from theoretical expectations and remain statistically insignificant (Table 4, columns 3-4). Two potential explanations for these findings are considered: a) spatial dependence could be introducing distortions in the signals and/or tests, or b) the omission of relevant variables (such as SBD) may be at play, suggesting that São Paulo could be a polycentric city.
Tests on residuals (Moran’s I tests) indicate non-spatial randomness (Table 4, columns 1-4). When employing the SLXb estimator to address spatial dependence (Table 5, columns 9-11), the estimated coefficients exhibit theoretical counterintuitiveness (overall effect) alongside statistical significance. Models conducted without controlling for sub-centralities suggest a higher land price at the city fringes, a finding not observed empirically. Additionally, the null hypothesis of spatial randomness remains unchallenged, except for the log-level functional form model incorporating control for the quadratic form of distance from the CBD, where the global effect aligns with theoretical expectations (Table 5, column 12). Nevertheless, these counterintuitive outcomes prompt an exploration of the second hypothesis: could the non-intuitive and statistically insignificant results of CBD coefficients be attributed to the exclusion of SBD controls?
In the econometrics estimation, we control for all SBD candidates while considering cross-commuting. This implies that workers can opt for distant business centers over those closer to their homes (Plaut and Plaut, 1988; Wrede, 2015). This approach offers greater flexibility compared to selecting the nearest center to the worker's residence, as suggested by Fujita and Ogawa (1982) and Baumont, Ertur, and Gallo (2004).
The results obtained from estimating Equation 1 (controlling for SBD) using OLS (refer to Table 4, columns 5-8) align with urban theoretical models (indicating a decreasing gradient price) across various functional forms and specifications of the CBD variable. Nevertheless, tests for spatial randomness refute the null hypothesis, suggesting potential inaccuracies in the signals and tests due to spatial dependence. To address this limitation of the OLS estimator, we proceed to estimate the econometric model using the SLX estimator.
The specification that considers the quadratic form of distancing lacks clarity and typically does not yield statistically significant coefficients capturing this effect, leading to the exclusion of models estimated by SLX in this specification. Results from the SLX estimator exhibit signs of overall effects in line with theoretical expectations and demonstrate statistical significance. Moran's I tests, as shown in Table 6 columns 17-22, do not reject the null hypothesis of spatial randomness.
This econometric analysis reveals compelling evidence supporting the presence of at least one additional central region within São Paulo. Consequently, models that overlook this sub-centrality may produce biased coefficient estimates and exhibit heteroskedastic residuals.
The SLX model, when controlling for SBD, offers the most robust theoretical and econometric adjustment. The coefficients in the CBD model align with the theoretically expected signals. Additionally, the discussion on SBD takes into account the log-level functional form due to its higher R²-adjusted value in comparison to the level-level specification.
Duranton and Puga (2015) highlight the absence of a universally agreed-upon definition for SBD. Various authors have explored contiguity areas as an empirical approach to address the challenge of quantifying SBD (Guiliano and Small, 1991; McMillen, 2003; Baumont, Ertur, and Gallo, 2004). In line with theoretical frameworks, regions with estimated coefficients that are both statistically significant and negative are identified as SBDs. Applying this criterion to the model estimates, São Paulo is identified as having seven SBDs, each exhibiting a negative and statistically significant overall impact (both direct and indirect).
Figure 3 illustrates the geographical distribution of each identified Special Business District (SBD) as outlined in Table 6, column 1, along with the primary avenues of the city. These SBDs are situated within specific districts of the city, namely Santa Cecilia (SCE), Belém (BEL), Jardim Paulista (JDP), Pinheiros (PIN), Itaim Bibi (IBI), Campo Belo (CBE), and Vila Mariana (VLM). Geographically, the SBDs are located in the Central Zone (CZ), South Zone 1 (SZ1), West Zone (WZ), and East Zone 1 (EZ1).
Our findings align with the effects observed in the municipality. Studies conducted for the metropolitan area of São Paulo also present results that are similar to ours, despite employing different methodological approaches, varying polygon sizes, and utilizing different databases. Siqueira (2014) identified seven SBDs within the metropolitan area of São Paulo, with three of them situated in the municipality of São Paulo, specifically in the historic center, along the Paulista Avenue – Faria Lima Avenue corridor, and in Santo Amaro. Campos (2018) reported three SBDs for the SPMA, with only one located in the MSP, encompassing all seven SBDs identified in our study. The strategies employed by Siqueira (2014) and Campos (2018) for SBD identification are centered around the relative concentration of employment, which explains why they identified fewer SBDs compared to our study. Consequently, their findings can be categorized as global SBDs (relative to the SPMA), while ours can be classified as local SBDs (relative to the MSP).
An in-depth analysis of housing prices, employment specialization, wages, and education offers a comprehensive insight into each Suburban Business District (SBD), highlighting the diversity among sub-centers. Across all identified SBDs, the average price per square meter stands at R$ 8,230.00, with a standard deviation of R$ 2,295.00. Notably, housing prices are notably higher in Pinheiros compared to other areas. Illustrated in Figure 4 is a clear positive correlation between average prices per square meter and distance from the Central Business District (CBD), contrasting with monocentric models that suggest a negative correlation. This trend aligns with our research findings, further supporting the presence of distinct sub-centers.
Focusing on the activity sectors outlined by IBGE, our study delves into the concentration of activities within each SBD. Broadly speaking, SBDs exhibit a notable concentration in service-related activities. As depicted in Table 7, the highest employment concentrations are observed in construction (Campo Belo), credit institutions, insurance, and capitalization (Itaim Bibi), management and administration, real estate, securities, and technical services (Vila Mariana, Santa Cecilia, Pinheiros), as well as medical, dental, and veterinary services (Jardim Paulista). It is noteworthy that Belém stands out as the sole SBD with the highest concentration of employees engaged in manufacturing activities.
Itaim Bibi and Pinheiros stand out as districts with the highest concentration of workers earning more than 5 minimum wages monthly, as indicated in Table 8. In contrast, Belém and Campo Belo emerge as subcenters with the highest proportion of workers earning less than 2 minimum wages monthly (60% and 54% respectively). The former pair of SBDs require a workforce with advanced skills for the available positions, whereas the latter two are primarily focused on manufacturing and civil construction activities, necessitating workers with lower levels of education.
One approach to understanding the low productivity levels is by examining the educational attainment of workers in each Specific Business District (SBD). Table 9 provides insight into the educational background of employees in each SBD and its potential correlation with wage trends, albeit lacking in thoroughness. In Pinheiros, 42% of workers have completed high school or have some college education, while 34% hold a college degree. Itaim Bibi, known for its higher wage levels compared to other SBDs, has 40% of workers with a high school diploma or higher and 40.4% with a bachelor's degree or higher.
On the contrary, Belém has 54% of its workforce possessing a complete high school education and 30% with an incomplete high school education. Similarly, Campo Belo also exhibits a workforce primarily concentrated within the lower educational attainment brackets, with a significant portion having only a few years of schooling.
The primary focus of this section pertains to the validity of the identification strategy, specifically in correctly identifying subcenters. Robustness tests are conducted on the SBD identification by exploring various spatial matrix specifications and altering the functional form to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the identification process.
In the initial stages of our analysis, we explored various spatial weight matrices for the model that did not include SBD controls, utilizing the functional forms of level-level and log-level. Subsequently, we conducted tests with distance weight matrices, incrementally adjusting the initial threshold by 5% and 10% (8.4 Km and 8.8 Km). This systematic approach enabled us to assess the impact of excluding a significant variable when estimating models that do not account for SBD.
From Table 5 (columns 13-20), it is evident that the estimated coefficients maintain statistical significance, with the signals consistently contradicting the theoretical approach for both spatial weight matrices and functional forms. These findings bolster the internal validity of the estimates and reinforce the notion that the model exhibits bias when SBD controls are omitted. Notably, the estimated coefficient for the log-level functional form and quadratic specification of the CBD variable remains stable despite variations in the spatial weight matrices. This outcome further discredits models employing the quadratic form of CBD as a control.
As outlined in the preceding section, the coefficients of the CBD variable, as estimated by OLS, remain consistent across various functional forms and specifications, displaying anticipated trends in all models (refer to Table 4, columns 5-8). Nevertheless, these models exhibit spatial dependence. Upon employing the SLX estimator to incorporate control by SBD, the overall impact of CBD demonstrates the expected trends for both weight matrices under consideration (refer to Table 6, columns 18 and 19). These findings affirm the econometric estimation and lend credence to the polycentric hypothesis of São Paulo.
The Pinheiros region is the sole area that loses statistical significance when alterations are made to the weight matrices, yet the signal remains consistent with expectations. Within this model, the Morumbi district (A9), situated adjacent to Pinheiros, demonstrates a statistically significant effect in line with expectations. Due to the inability to ascertain whether the subcenter lies precisely on the census tract border of both regions, we do not deem this slight discrepancy in a single model to be of significant importance. Consequently, we persist in advocating for the characterization of Pinheiros as a business subcentrality.
After increasing the distance cut-off by 10%, the Morumbi district begins to exhibit a statistically significant coefficient with the anticipated sign as per theoretical models. However, the coefficient of region A7 loses its statistical significance, despite the signals aligning with expectations. Notably, the coefficients estimating the commuting effect in areas A4, A28, and A32 maintain statistical significance across both specifications of the spatial weight matrices.
When examining the functional form at the level-level (refer to Table 6, columns 20-22), it becomes apparent that the areas identified as SBD remain consistent when compared to the econometric model estimated using the log-level functional form. The only deviation observed is in the Pinheiros area, which is deemed insignificant, while Morumbi shows significance.
When Equation 1 is estimated using the level-level function form, the econometric estimation reveals a greater sensitivity to structural break detection than when employing the log-level form. Nevertheless, the R2-adjusted values of these models are observed to be lower compared to the semi-logarithmic models, as previously demonstrated.
Theoretically, Special Business Districts (SBDs) concentrate forces that can lead to segregation due to rising land prices, yet they also have the potential to alleviate urban road congestion by reducing commuting times within the municipality. SBDs should not be viewed solely as a consequence of individual firm decisions seeking agglomeration benefits in a self-contained manner. Instead, they should be recognized as significant public urban policy tools that facilitate the alignment of workers and firms in the labor market. For example, policymakers can encourage firms to relocate outside the city center by lowering land taxes, thereby increasing land values in the city and helping to stabilize land prices across the municipality.
The impact of SBD on the economy has been extensively studied in international literature, yet there is a lack of research on sub-center identification in large cities in Brazil. This article introduces a two-stage identification approach to address this gap, aiming to enhance the objectivity of empirical methods. The initial stage involves identifying potential SBD candidates through an ESDA approach. The subsequent stage introduces a novel aspect by employing a Hedonic Spatial Price Model, enabling the testing of the alternative hypothesis regarding the presence of SBD. This methodological innovation contributes to the advancement of research in this area.
In this study, seven sub-centers were delineated within the municipality of São Paulo, each situated in areas of significant economic activity and employment opportunities. These sub-centers are strategically positioned in regions characterized by excellent transportation infrastructure, including extensive road networks as well as access to railway and subway services.
The study successfully identified the subcenters and delved into the specialized activities within each SBD, along with analyzing the wage and educational breakdown among SBD workers. It was observed that SBDs with a significant number of employees earning low wages also tended to have a higher proportion of workers with lower levels of education, primarily engaged in retail trade. Conversely, SBDs focused on financial activities exhibited higher wages and a greater concentration of highly educated workers compared to the former group. This analysis revealed that the identified sites within the MSP function as centralities and display a diverse range of characteristics.
The identification of SBDs is influenced by geographical scales, as highlighted by Anas et al. (1998). Altering the weighting areas based on districts within the municipality or dividing the total area of the municipality into 1 km² cells can lead to varying results. One approach to address this issue is to take into account the spatial distribution of each firm and emphasize the modifiable areal unit problem. By doing so, the identification of the SBD could extend beyond the geographical polygon boundary suggested by the IBGE, potentially allowing for the recognition of a corridor-shaped SBD. If all the identified SBDs are interconnected, rather than identifying 7 separate SBDs, a reduced number of SBDs could be identified.
