In addition to combatting the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicine and Science are confronted with another pressing issue at this critical juncture: the proliferation of misinformation online. By the end of March 2020, over 2100 Iranians fell victim to methanol poisoning due to oral ingestion. Iran, being an Islamic nation with strict alcohol regulations, saw patients influenced by social media messages suggesting that consuming alcohol could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly 900 individuals poisoned by illicit alcohol required ICU admission, resulting in 296 fatalities (a fatality rate of 13.5%). In the past, news dissemination was primarily controlled by a select few organizations or private entities; however, in today's digital age of the Internet and social media, anyone can disseminate news online. Fake news is characterized by the intentional spread of false information through social or traditional media channels. Fake medical news, specifically, can mislead individuals to the detriment of organizations or individuals, and can also be exploited for financial gain through the promotion of certain foods, supplements, or treatments.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recently emphasized the dual challenge faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, stating, "We are not just fighting an epidemic; we are fighting an infodemic." Recognizing the overwhelming influx of information and misinformation during times of crisis, particularly following the declaration of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, the WHO launched the Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) to disseminate tailored information to specific target groups. The infodemic, characterized as a global epidemic of misinformation, poses significant risks to healthcare and society at large. While online content has the potential to educate and positively influence behavior, it also has the capacity to propagate harmful opinions and behaviors that jeopardize public health.
One of the most significant pieces of misinformation in public health revolves around the false belief that the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine leads to autism, a notion perpetuated by a discredited article in Lancet. This misinformation spread widely through social media channels, bolstered by conspiracy theories and other anti-vaccination sentiments, ultimately fueling the growth of the anti-vaccination movement. The repercussions of this misinformation have been profound, with several countries, such as the United Kingdom, Greece, Venezuela, and Brazil, losing their measles elimination status in 2020. In the field of cardiology, similar instances of fake news have emerged. Social media platforms have been instrumental in disseminating misinformation regarding the supposed oncogenic effects of antihypertensive drugs, prompting patients to discontinue beneficial medications. Battistoni et al. have refuted claims supporting the prohibition of antihypertensive drugs due to potential neoplasm risks, highlighting the lack of evidence to justify such actions. Oâ€™Connor further emphasizes the need for cardiologists to resist exaggerated treatments, unverified substances, unproven vaccines, and nutraceuticals, citing heart failure as a prime example of the dangers posed by fake news in the medical field.
Expanding on Jonathan Smith's assertion, it is evident that fake news propagates significantly further, faster, deeper, and more extensively than the truth. Robots play a role in accelerating the dissemination of both true and false information equally, suggesting that the prevalence of false news is primarily due to human behavior rather than automated processes. This distinction is crucial, as Pennycook et al have highlighted that prior exposure to information (familiarity) enhances the perception of its truthfulness. Moreover, their research indicates that repeated exposure further reinforces this sense of "illusory truth". Addressing this pressing issue, how can we effectively combat this threat (see figure 1)?
A promising strategy involves leveraging computational methods to identify fake news and misinformation. The predominant techniques for addressing this issue are cultivated within the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), predominantly employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) methodologies. In addition to automatically categorizing text as either fake news or legitimate, other ML and NLP approaches prove beneficial, encompassing feature extraction, social context modeling, knowledge-based systems, sentiment analysis, and various other tools.
Feature extraction plays a crucial role in providing valuable information to machine learning methods. These features can be derived either directly from the text or from external sources. Examples of such features include title representativeness, quotes from external sources, presence of citations from other organizations and studies, use of logical fallacies, emotional tone of the article, inference consistency (such as incorrect associations or generalizations), originality, credibility of citations, number of ads, confidence level in the authors, number of social calls, and more. Machine learning algorithms can leverage these features to build a classifier model capable of distinguishing between fake and truthful content. The learning process of the classifier involves using a pre-annotated dataset as a training set, where the articles serve as examples and the annotations indicate their authenticity. In some instances, data preprocessing is necessary before feature extraction, which may involve techniques like tokenization, lower casing transformation, removal of stop words, sentence segmentation, and others. In addition to traditional feature engineering, recent approaches based on Deep Learning directly consider the content of texts in an end-to-end manner. For instance, Fang et al. achieved a 95.5% precision rate in judging news authenticity solely based on content by employing convolutional neural networks and a self multi-head attention mechanism.
Other promising AI approaches involve analyzing the social network features that may contain potentially false information. This is significant due to the growing prevalence of non-human accounts or bots being utilized to generate fake news and disseminate it across social networks. Therefore, examining the profiles of social network users can offer valuable insights for detecting fake news. Additionally, features based on posts concentrate on understanding how individuals convey their opinions regarding fake news through their social media posts. Users establish diverse networks on social media platforms based on interests, topics, and relationships. Network-based features assess the patterns within the networks to which users belong.
One crucial strategy to combat the dissemination of fake news involves providing evidence-based information to the general public through reputable organizations and institutions such as the WHO, PAHO, national health authorities, and academic societies. This approach is closely linked to creating health content that is easily understandable for laypeople, fostering increased collaboration between journalists and scientists to minimize communication errors. Additionally, it is imperative for all physicians and healthcare providers to actively correct misinformation when encountered. This strategy has been proven effective, with repeated corrections showing promise in reducing the impact of false information. Employing various checks on social media content, identifying and preventing the spread of misinformation, and recognizing profit-driven motives are crucial in managing fake medical information. Government involvement, akin to successful anti-smoking campaigns, is vital in the fight against fake news, emphasizing the need for sustained efforts rather than isolated actions. Establishing regulatory frameworks, implementing educational initiatives, and prioritizing the education of children and young adults are essential components of this ongoing battle.
In essence, we find ourselves amidst an unprecedented scenario with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dissemination of false information poses a significant threat to public health, potentially resulting in severe consequences. It is imperative that scientists, physicians, and healthcare professionals unite in a collaborative effort to combat the proliferation of inaccurate medical information. The battle against fake news in the medical realm is one that cannot afford to be surrendered.
