Dear Editor,
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious 
disease that emerged in December 2019 in China1 and has spread 
rapidly worldwide2. Globally, COVID-19 infected more than 3.1 
million people and caused more than 220,000 deaths in the 
first quarter of 20202,3.
The first case in Brazil was recorded on February 26, 2020, 
and the first death on March 17, 20204. Soon after the disease was 
detected in Brazil, the number of cases and deaths increased daily, 
and 2 months later (April 29, 2020), Brazil had 71,866 cases and 
5,017 deaths, even more than China, the origin of the pandemic5.
Monitoring mortality from COVID-19 plays a fundamental role 
in assessing severity and may serve as a tool for decision making. 
This study analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 
mortality in Brazilian states, between March 17, 2020, and April 
24, 2020 (epidemiological weeks [EWs] from 12 to 17).
This was an ecological study involving all deaths from 
COVID-19. Geographic units of the analysis were the state and 
EW. Data were obtained from the Ministry of Health of Brazil  
(https://covid.saude.gov.br) on April 25, 2020, and population 
data were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and 
Statistics (https://www.ibge.gov.br/). Accumulated mortality rates 
for each state and EW were calculated using the following equation:
In addition, we performed an exploratory spatial analysis, with 
stratification at equal intervals. Choropleth maps were prepared 
to show the results. As we used secondary data from the public 
domain, the Research Ethics Committee's approval was waived.
The first death from COVID-19 was registered in São Paulo on 
March 17, 2020. Two days later (March 19, 2020), two deaths were 
confirmed in Rio de Janeiro. In EW 12, both São Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro accounted for 18 deaths together. In EW13, 10 states had 
already reported deaths, and São Paulo (1.82/1 million) and Rio 
de Janeiro (0.77/1 million) had the highest rates. Together, both 
states accounted for 97 out of 114 deaths recorded in Brazil. In 
EW 14, São Paulo (5.62/million), Rio de Janeiro (3.42/1 million), 
Amazonas (2.83/1 million), and Ceará (2.40/1 million) had the 
highest mortality rates. In EW 15, Amazonas had the highest 
mortality rate among all states (12.50/1 million), followed by São 
Paulo (12.26/1 million). In the same EW, Pernambuco experienced 
a significant increase in mortality (from 1.45/1 million to 7.46/1 
million). In EW 16, the mortality rate was tripled in Amazonas, 
reaching 37.9/1 million. The mortality in Amazonas was 1.7 times 
higher than that in São Paulo (21.51/1 million). In EW 17, the 
highest COVID-19 mortality was in Amazonas at 60.14 deaths/1

million (n = 255 deaths), followed by Pernambuco (36.47/1 million), 
Rio de Janeiro (33.64/1 million), São Paulo (32.82/1 million), and 
Ceará (30.94/1 million).
This study showed the dynamics of the evolution of death rates 
by Brazilian states in the first six EWs of COVID-19 mortality in 
Brazil (Figure 1). The first cases and deaths were reported in São 
Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. As soon as cases of death in São Paulo 
and Rio de Janeiro emerged, surveillance services in other states 
began to report both cases and deaths. A few weeks later, North 
and Northeast states were the ones with the highest mortality rates.
Obviously, since the community transmission of COVID-19 
has commenced, tracing a faithful route for distribution of cases 
has become difficult. However, some explanations can be given to 
characterize the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil. São Paulo and Rio 
de Janeiro are considered Brazil's “entrance gates” because of the 
concentration of international passengers and cargo flights, and most 
flights from Europe and the United States arrive in São Paulo or Rio 
de Janeiro6. In addition, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have the 
highest concentration of domestic flights in the country, operated 
either as arrival/departure or as connecting points, thus likely to be 
responsible for the spread of the disease to other states6.
Although both air transport and traffic network are important to 
understand the dynamics of COVID-19 spread across the country, it 
alone cannot explain the differences in mortality rates among states. 
Preliminary reports have shown that COVID-19 mortality has been 
associated with old age and comorbidities, such as cardiovascular 
disease and diabetes7–9. However, mortality rates vary widely even 
in these population groups. Our study found that on April 24, 2020, 
the mortality rate in Amazonas was almost twice as high as mortality 
that in São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. This suggests that social and 
demographic factors and supportive differences in health services may 
play an important role as factors associated with COVID-19 mortality.
As COVID-19 progresses rapidly to severe pneumonia and 
acute respiratory distress syndrome8, critically ill patients need 
mechanical ventilatory support at intensive care units (IUCs). Thus, 
the varying availability of such resources can be an additional risk 
factor for death from COVID-19. Amazonas has 6.5 adult ICU 
beds for every 100,000 people, which is 3.3 times less than those 
in Rio de Janeiro (21.9/100,000 population) and 2.7 times less than 
those in São Paulo (18.0/100,000 population). When only public 
health beds are analyzed, the availability in Amazonas is lower 
(5.0/100,000 population)10.

An estimated 22.6% of people who are exclusively in the public 
health system have no access to ICU beds at their resident health 
regions, as these ICU beds are concentrated in the metropolitan 
regions. Additionally, 9.8% of health regions have 10 beds per 
100,000 population10. Regarding human resources, the region 
contains only 4% of the total number of physicians working in the 
country, which represents approximately one physician for every 
1,000 inhabitants. This means seven times less than the availability 
of physicians in the capitals from states in the South region11. 
The situation is even more serious in municipalities far from the 
capital. For example, in Amazonas, the capital Manaus has a rate 
of two physicians per 1,000 inhabitants, while in municipalities 
in the interior of Amazonas, the rate is 10 times lower (0.2/1,000 
inhabitants)11, 12. Thus, it is likely that the scarcity of human and 
material resources for health care associated with the rapid spread 
of COVID-19 may contribute to increased mortality.
In the Northeast region, Pernambuco and Ceará presented 
with high COVID-19 mortality. Similar to the North region, the 
Northeast region faced social vulnerability, since 30.5% of people 
who are exclusively in the public health system have no access to 
ICU beds in their residence health regions10. In addition, all states 
in the Northeast region have less than two physicians per 1,000 
inhabitants12.
This study has some limitations. As we analyzed secondary data 
from surveillance systems, it is likely that COVID-19 deaths were 
underreported. Brazil is one of the countries performing the least 
number of tests for COVID-19 worldwide. However, underreporting 
is likely to occur randomly and has not influenced our findings.
In summary, Brazilian states with the greatest lack of health 
resources have shown the highest COVID-19 mortality rate. 
Inequalities in availability and access to the health care system 
represent additional challenges, given the increase in COVID-19 
mortality in the country. This study reinforces the need for an urgent 
expansion of the operational capacity of the Unified Health System.
