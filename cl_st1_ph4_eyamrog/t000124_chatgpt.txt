Porotrichum squarrosum, a species previously unreported in Brazil, represents a new addition to the country's botanical records. During the examination of herbarium specimens, a specimen labeled as Pireella squarrosa (now recognized as Porotrichum) and identified by Massimo Mastracci was discovered. Through a meticulous comparison of this specimen with existing literature and hundreds of other specimens, it was determined that several specimens previously classified as P. substriatum actually belong to P. squarrosum. These taxa are commonly found throughout various regions in Brazil, including the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Cerrado phytogeographical domains, at elevations ranging from sea level to approximately 600 meters. The distinguishing features between these taxa include the squarrose leaves, spur costa at the back, and the absence of a stem central strand in P. squarrosum, in contrast to the complanate leaves, lack of a spurowed costa at the back, and the presence of a central strand in P. substriatum.
During the revision of specimens for the Brazilian Flora online using online databases (Peralta, 2019), we encountered a specimen initially labeled as Pireella squarrosa Arzeni, which is currently recognized as Porotrichum squarrosum, with identification credited to Massimo Mastracci.
Porotrichum squarrosum, previously unreported in Brazilian literature, is now documented as a new record. Through the examination of numerous unidentified specimens of Neckeraceae, it was observed that P. squarrosum is prevalent in Brazil, spanning various phytogeographical domains such as the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Cerrado. This species thrives at elevations ranging from sea level to approximately 600 meters.
Plants of this species were identified in herbaria as Porotrichum substriatum (Hampe) Mitt., likely due to the synonymization proposed by Buck (1998). The distinguishing features between these species include the concave and widely spreading to squarrose leaves of P. squarrosum, even evident on dry plants, with a spur costa at the back and the absence of a stem central strand. In contrast, P. substriatum exhibits clearly plane and complanate leaves that are typically obliquely spreading, lacks a spur costa at the back, and possesses a stem central strand. For further reference, the type specimen can be viewed at https://plants.jstor.org/stable/viewer/10.5555/al.ap.specimen.bm000961357. Plates showcasing both species will soon be accessible at FBO (2020).
The revision of the Neckeraceae family by Sastre de Jesús (1987) does not incorporate the name Porotrichum squarrosum, which was a combination made by Arzeni in 1954 based on the work of Crum & Steere in 1958 on Pireella squarrosa. The original publication also lacks a description of the pseudoparaphyllia. It is important to note that the genus Pireella is classified under Pterobryaceae, where the pseudoparaphyllia are consistently filamentous according to Allen (1987). In contrast, Porotrichum and the entire Neckeraceae family exhibit foliose pseudoparaphyllia as highlighted by Sastre de Jesús (1987).
Porotrichum squarrosum was initially described from Haiti and the Dominican Republic by Arzeni in 1954 (with pl. 20, as Pireella), with only one additional specimen from Haiti reported by Crum & Steere in 1958 (with figures 62-83). However, despite Buck's proposed synonymization in 1998, these names have not been re-evaluated, even in the absence of specimens or types examined by Buck. Our new records represent the first occurrences of Porotrichum squarrosum in Brazil, underscoring the need for a thorough revision of specimens previously identified as P. substriatum to accurately determine the true distribution of this taxon.
In response to the potential misinterpretation of the examined specimens, we offer a detailed description and accompanying images of this taxon. This aims to encourage a reevaluation of previously analyzed herbaria specimens.
Further elucidation and visual aids can be found in the works of Arzeni (1954) and Crum & Steere (1958).
Plants are gregarious, typically pale-green or partially brownish, with a dull, stipitate-frondose appearance, reaching heights mostly between 2 to 4 cm. Stolons exhibit a creeping growth pattern, featuring small ovate-acuminate leaves and clusters of smooth, brownish-orange, densely branched rhizoids in contact with the substratum. These stolons undergo heteroblastic transformation into stems, characterized by a proximal, unbranched stipe and a distal, branched frond. The fronds are irregularly pinnately branched and complanate in structure. The stipe is distinctively green, with a cross-section revealing a cortex composed of 5 to 8 layers of very thick-walled cells transitioning into larger medullary cells with thinner walls, alongside a central strand. Stipe leaves are sparse, spaced apart, with a wide base that tapers into an acute acumen at about 3/4 of the leaf length, measuring approximately 0.5 × 0.6 mm. The margins of these leaves are recurved from the base to the acumen, remaining entire, while the costa is well-defined, tapering and disappearing in the lower part of the acumen. Stem leaves, when dry, are not complanate, rather symmetric or nearly so, erect-spreading, imbricate, often slightly concave, keeled by the costa, and measuring around 1.0–1.2 × 0.5–0.6 mm, with an acute or obtuse apex that is mucronate. The margins of these stem leaves are either flat or slightly recurved in the lower half, remaining entire near the base and becoming serrulate towards the top, with distinct uni- or bicellular teeth. The costa is robust, single, extending up to 9/10 of the leaf length, with a spur and/or spinose structure above. The leaf cells are smooth, prorulose, with eporose walls; apical laminal cells are fairly thick-walled, mostly long hexagonal, occasionally sinuose, measuring 8–10 × 3–4 µm, while median laminal cells are thinner-walled, fusiform to irregularly penta- or hexagonal, measuring 10–14 × 5–8 µm. Basal laminal cells and marginal cells resemble the median cells, with alar cells being fairly distinct, thick-walled, subquadrate or subrounded to irregularly angular, and shorter than basal laminal cells. Pseudoparaphyllia are few, foliose, somewhat asymmetrically lanceolate, up to 0.4 mm long. The plant is dioicous, with perigonia appearing bud-like on stems, approximately 1.1 mm long, faintly costate, lancelate, narrowing above midleaf to a lanceolate-acuminate tip, and featuring hyaline, uniseriate, filiform paraphyses. Perichaetia and sporophyte were not observed.
The specimens were identified based on the illustrations and descriptions provided in the original publications by Arzeni (1954) and Crum & Steere (1958).
Three additional records of Porotrichum squarrosum are documented in the repositories of GBIF (2019), with one suggesting it is a synonym of Porotrichum substriatum. However, we maintain that these taxa are distinct. The specimens under examination originate from various states in Brazil, including Amazonas, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Pará, and São Paulo (refer to figure 2), spanning diverse phytogeographical domains such as the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Cerrado. These specimens were collected at elevations ranging from near sea level to approximately 600 meters.
We express our gratitude to M. Mastracci for bringing Porotrichum squarrosum to our attention.
