Amidst the global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals, including specialists in inflammatory bowel diseases, are facing unique challenges in addressing the specific clinical needs of their patients. In this context, we aim to consolidate existing literature on the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients during the ongoing COVID-19 era. This review supports the restructuring of our IBD unit and the clinical guidance offered to our patients, emphasizing the importance of adapting to the current healthcare landscape shaped by the pandemic.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) that originated from bats. This single-stranded RNA virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its resemblance to the virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome. The outbreak of this infection commenced in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and swiftly disseminated worldwide, including Brazil. On March 11th, 2020, WHO officially declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Presently, over one million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to the WHO, with more than 50,000 deaths. In Brazil, as of April 4th, 2020, there have been 10,278 confirmed cases and 432 deaths, with these numbers continuing to rise.
COVID-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets, aerosols, and via the conjunctiva. In adults, the clinical presentation of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic cases to severe pneumonia and potentially fatal outcomes. Common symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, myalgia, with around 10-20% of patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome within 8-14 days of onset. Analysis of data from over 72,000 patients in China revealed that 81% experienced mild symptoms, 14% had severe manifestations, and 5% were critically ill. Notably, mortality rates were higher in older individuals and those with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory issues, or cancer. While children of all ages were susceptible to COVID-19, they generally exhibited milder symptoms compared to adults. Approximately 6% of children experienced severe or life-threatening conditions, often associated with a history of congenital or acquired diseases or being younger than one year old.
Digestive symptoms are reported in nearly half of COVID-19 patients, with diarrhea and fever often accompanying respiratory symptoms. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool samples and other clinical specimens has heightened awareness regarding the management of patients with pre-existing digestive conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as the potential transmission of the virus through fecal routes. Post-viral infection, the synthesis of virus-specific RNA and proteins in the cytoplasm leads to the assembly of new virions. Notably, the presence of viral RNA in feces 1 to 12 days after it was undetectable in respiratory samples indicates continuous viral secretion from infected gastrointestinal cells. Furthermore, the duration of viral shedding in pediatric feces surpasses that in adults. These findings suggest that individuals with IBD, both adults and children, may be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the inflamed nature of their gut, which serves as a potential entry point for the virus.
In light of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 outbreak, IBD specialists globally are confronted with the task of navigating the pandemic and addressing the unique concerns of their patients, specifically pertaining to the risks associated with infection and the use of immunosuppressive treatments. This review seeks to consolidate the most current evidence and expert insights within the realm of IBD and the COVID-19 outbreak.
Treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) typically includes the administration of immunosuppressants, which can render IBD patients more vulnerable to infections, depending on the specific medications prescribed. With the rapid spread of the pandemic, numerous medical facilities globally have expressed apprehensions regarding the heightened susceptibility of immunocompromised individuals to contracting SARS-CoV-2 and experiencing severe respiratory complications (13).
In general, patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) who are undergoing treatment with immunomodulators may exhibit increased susceptibility to infections, particularly when combined with biologics, specifically anti-TNF agents. Furthermore, factors such as malnutrition, comorbidities, advanced age, a prior history of severe infections, and the presence of active IBD can also contribute to the heightened risk of infections (14,15).
Prior research has established that clinically active IBD and exposure to thiopurines elevate the likelihood of viral infections (16,17). Nevertheless, in contrast to various other viruses such as Influenza, Herpes, Cytomegalovirus, Adenovirus, Rhinovirus, Norovirus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus, coronaviruses have not been proven to induce more severe illness in immunosuppressed individuals (13,15,17).
Currently, there is a global agreement that individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) do not face a heightened susceptibility to contracting SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general populace. However, the impact of active inflammation on the likelihood of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 remains ambiguous. Furthermore, the potential elevated risk of developing COVID-19, experiencing complications, or facing mortality among IBD patients who contract SARS-CoV-2 remains uncertain. Notably, there is a significant scarcity of data concerning immunosuppressed individuals with IBD and their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Guan et al. (18) found no evidence of immunomodulators posing a risk for serious diseases in their study of 1,099 patients in China. In the international Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion (SECURE)-IBD database, as of April 3, 2020, there were 12 reported deaths among 275 IBD patients with COVID-19, with a majority being male. Among these fatalities, three patients were under 65 years old, all of whom had received treatment involving multiple immunosuppressants (such as steroid+ JAK inhibitor, adalimumab+methotrexate, adalimumab+ azathioprine+steroid) (19). However, it is crucial to interpret these cases cautiously, as many individuals with mild symptoms may not have been tested for COVID-19.
In a collaborative effort between the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and Crohnâ€™s and Colitis UK association, specific guidance has been issued for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) based on their individual risk factors such as age, medication usage, and other health conditions. A decision tree has been developed to categorize patients into high, moderate, or low-risk groups for severe complications from COVID-19. Those at the highest risk include individuals with comorbidities (respiratory, cardiac, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), those over 70 years old on immunosuppressant therapy for IBD, individuals of any age taking over 20 mg of prednisolone, those undergoing new induction therapy with biologics and immunomodulators within 6 weeks, those with moderate to severe active disease or short gut syndrome, and patients requiring parenteral nutrition. Patients on biological therapy, thiopurines, calcineurin inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, or combination therapy are classified as moderate risk, while the remaining IBD patients are considered low risk. High-risk patients are advised to self-isolate, while those at moderate or low risk should adhere to strict or general social distancing measures, respectively.
In our center, we adhered to the BSG recommendations concerning risk stratification, while also identifying patients who underwent IBD surgical procedures within 30 days as being at the highest risk for severe complications of COVID-19. A concise overview of the specific recommendations we offered to patients based on their risk levels is outlined in Table 1.
Over the last month, accumulating evidence has informed an optimized strategy for preventing coronavirus infection in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) to ensure the continued safety of their treatment.
Similar to the general population, patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) were advised to adhere to preventive measures such as staying at home, maintaining appropriate social distance during conversations, regularly washing hands with soap or alcohol-based sanitizers, and refraining from touching their facial mucosa, as outlined in Table 1.
Our institute, the largest in Latin America, has implemented a comprehensive structural plan to evacuate wards, equip intensive care units, and ensure an adequate number of beds for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. These institutional rearrangements have posed challenges for our IBD team, necessitating a specific approach to maintain IBD care during the pandemic. A summary of the measures implemented to adapt IBD care is outlined in Table 2.
In the gastroenterology department, patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) who were hospitalized were relocated to a dedicated building staffed by specialized medical personnel. This measure has effectively reduced their risk of exposure to the virus.
In our outpatient clinic, the majority of appointments were rescheduled, with medical staff closely monitoring patients with severe active disease requiring corticosteroids or combination therapy via telephone calls due to the absence of a formal tele-health system. Currently, laboratory tests are restricted, and the endoscopy unit is prioritizing urgent cases in line with guidelines. Consequently, when appropriate, ileocolonoscopy was substituted with fecal calprotectin testing.
At our infusion center, the staff requested us to identify patients who could potentially have their infusion delayed by 1 or 2 weeks to allow for the reorganization of seating arrangements and create more space. The primary criteria for rescheduling infusions were patients in deep clinical and endoscopic remission based on their most recent outpatient clinic evaluation. During infusions, a safe distance of approximately 1.5 meters between seats was maintained, and no accompanying individuals were allowed. While recognizing the recommendation of using surgical masks for immunodeficient patients, their availability was not always guaranteed. Consequently, a screening protocol involving an objective interview was established before admission to systematically evaluate for acute respiratory symptoms like cough, dyspnea, or fever in both IBD patients and their close contacts. Asymptomatic patients proceeded with their IV infusions as scheduled, while those showing signs highly suggestive of a coronavirus infection were promptly directed to the emergency department. In situations where the initiation of biologics was deemed critical, preference was given to biologics that could be administered subcutaneously at home rather than intravenously at the infusion center, if feasible.
The correlation between malnutrition and infection risk is extensively documented in the literature on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) (23,24). Hypoalbuminemia is recognized as a systemic marker of inflammation and is prevalent in approximately one-fifth of IBD patients (25,26). Given the current backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation may impede patients' ability to access nutritious foods or maintain healthy dietary practices, potentially leading to nutritional deficiencies. Consequently, we advocate for a well-rounded diet comprising four to six small meals daily along with sufficient hydration. Additionally, all patients are advised to cease smoking.
Furthermore, patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) were recommended to adhere to general immunization schedules, with a specific emphasis on receiving the influenza vaccination, in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the European Crohnâ€™s and Colitis Organization (ECCO) (27,28).
Numerous studies have investigated the impact of vitamin supplementation on viral replication (29). Although randomized controlled trials are lacking in this context, we have maintained the administration of vitamin D and iron replacement to our IBD patients upon detection of iron-deficiency anemia.
Currently, it is not advisable to suggest ceasing immunosuppressant therapy for individuals with IBD (11). Discontinuation poses a potential risk of disease reactivation, with active inflammation correlating to heightened chances of hospitalization, surgical intervention, infections, and exposure to steroids (which are best avoided during the COVID-19 pandemic) (20,30).
The utilization of non-hormonal anti-inflammatory drugs should be discouraged due to their link with negative consequences in various viral respiratory infections and their potential to act as a catalyst for the reactivation of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) (14).
Currently, there is a lack of formal evidence-based recommendations from clinical societies or governments for immunosuppressed patients, such as those with IBD. Table 3 provides a summary of therapy-specific considerations for IBD patients, primarily derived from expert opinions, and should be interpreted within a patient-specific context. It is important to note that these recommendations are subject to modification and updates as new evidence becomes available (14,20).
In cases of moderate to severely active Crohnâ€™s disease or ulcerative colitis, patients should receive treatment based on standard protocols, irrespective of the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic (14).
In asymptomatic patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and have ceased treatment, it is recommended to resume IBD medications after a 14-day period, provided they have not developed symptoms of COVID-19 (14).
In instances where signs and symptoms indicative of COVID-19 manifest, it is imperative for the patient to promptly liaise with the healthcare team. It is advised, within this framework, to temporarily halt immunosuppressant therapy until the infection subsides. Following the complete resolution of COVID-19 symptoms or, ideally, after two consecutive negative PCR tests from nasopharyngeal swabs, with a gap of over 24 hours between them, therapy can be recommenced. It is worth noting that this approach is presently unattainable in Brazil due to a scarcity of coronavirus tests.
The emergence of the novel coronavirus has presented a new challenge for surgeons on a global scale. With numerous patients in need of surgical interventions, the potential risks associated with contracting severe pulmonary infections and experiencing prolonged hospital stays have become a significant cause for concern. This issue is particularly pressing for individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), as they are inherently immunocompromised due to the nature of their condition and the medications commonly prescribed, coupled with potential nutritional deficiencies. In such a scenario, surgical interventions could potentially exacerbate existing morbidities.
The primary objective currently is to prioritize the safety of both patients and healthcare workers. The existing guidelines predominantly rely on expert opinions and are subject to swift alterations due to the anticipated escalation of the outbreak in the upcoming weeks. A recent study originating from Wuhan, China, delineates the results of 34 patients who underwent elective surgical interventions during the COVID-19 incubation period in the initial stages of the outbreak. Subsequent to the surgeries, all patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia, with 15 individuals (44.1%) necessitating intensive care unit admission and seven patients (20.5%) succumbing to the illness (31).
Most surgical societies worldwide strongly recommend the postponement of all elective surgeries and endoscopic procedures to safeguard patients and surgeons, as well as to conserve vital resources like hospital beds and personal protective equipment (PPE) (32,33). Concerns exist regarding the potential aerosolization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during minimally invasive procedures, although conclusive evidence is lacking. Similar risks may arise from the use of electrocautery in open surgeries. Adherence to strict PPE protocols, including the use of an N95 mask and face shield, is advised based on local guidelines. Whenever possible, negative pressure surgical rooms should be utilized, and for laparoscopic procedures, a smoke evacuation system is recommended. Furthermore, it is advisable to limit the number of essential staff involved in the surgical process.
Prior to entering the operating room, several factors must be taken into account, including the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the facility, anticipated duration of hospitalization, and the likelihood of surgical complications and concurrent clinical comorbidities that could exacerbate morbidity and mortality. In cases where surgical intervention is deemed essential, it is imperative to secure informed consent that explicitly acknowledges the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Ideally, individuals scheduled for surgery should undergo preoperative testing for COVID-19; however, this protocol is not feasible in our institution, where only symptomatic patients are currently being tested.
In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is a lack of specific guidelines on which patients would derive the most benefit from surgical intervention, as global IBD societies have not yet provided clear recommendations on surgical care. Consequently, the decision-making process continues to rely heavily on medical judgment and individual patient factors.
Our group deems patients with anorectal septic complications (e.g., perianal abscess due to Crohnâ€™s disease), acute peritonitis, bowel obstruction, severe/toxic colitis (toxic megacolon), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage who do not respond to conservative treatment as potential surgical candidates during the pandemic, although each case should be evaluated individually. Advanced colorectal malignancies that could advance to unresectable disease may also warrant surgical consideration. Whenever possible, minimally invasive approaches like percutaneous abscess drainage should be considered as a viable strategy.
In pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD), the manifestation often appears to be more extensive and severe compared to adults. Consequently, the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with gastrointestinal symptoms raises specific concerns in PIBD patients. As of April 3rd, 2020, SECURE-IBD reported eleven cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children under 19 years old out of a total of 275 patients, with no instances from Brazil. Among these cases, only one patient was under 9 years old, all cases were managed as outpatients, and no fatalities were documented. This situation prompts inquiries regarding the potential heightened susceptibility of PIBD patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the comparative severity of the infection in PIBD versus adults, and the appropriateness of delaying or discontinuing treatment during the infection.
A recent paper by the Pediatric IBD PORTO Group of ESPGHAN has presented crucial insights into children with IBD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, offering clear guidance on appropriate management strategies. Chinese and Korean pediatric GI specialists documented 272 cases of children with IBD and SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic, whereas European reports highlighted 8 PIBD patients aged between 14 and 19 years with COVID-19, sourced from the PORTO-IBD group and SECURE-IBD database.
In the Chinese cohort, 917 children were identified with confirmed COVID-19 infections, none of whom were diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Conversely, in Korea, out of 8,413 children with confirmed COVID-19, 272 (3.2%) were found to have IBD, with a high percentage (99.3%) continuing their IBD treatment regimen. Notably, 4.8% of children in this group delayed their biological infusion, leading to 23% experiencing an IBD flare.
In Europe, out of the total of eight patients included in the study, seven were sourced from the Porto-IBD database, while one adolescent, aged 17, was from the SECURE-IBD database. The predominant condition among the patients was Crohnâ€™s disease, with most individuals either in deep remission or exhibiting a moderate disease activity index; only one patient had a history of cardiovascular disease. Nearly all patients had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, presenting with mild symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue. Notably, none of the eight patients reported experiencing diarrhea during their illness.
pandemic. By sharing knowledge and strategies, these centers can better navigate the challenges posed by the current global health crisis. This collaborative effort can lead to improved patient care, enhanced research opportunities, and a more unified approach to managing inflammatory bowel diseases during these unprecedented times. The exchange of information and best practices among PIBD centers worldwide is crucial for ensuring the well-being of patients and the continued advancement of medical science in the field of gastroenterology. Through this collective effort, healthcare professionals can work together to address the unique needs of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and adapt their practices to the evolving circumstances brought about by the pandemic.
Despite the ongoing pandemic, numerous inquiries regarding children and PIBD COVID-19 infections remain unresolved. The primary recommendations concerning the treatment of PIBD amidst the COVID-19 pandemic are outlined in Table 3.
During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the quest for safety information and guidance is of utmost importance. Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) face a potentially heightened risk of COVID-19 complications, primarily due to the nature of their chronic illness and the utilization of immunosuppressant therapies. Confronted with these complex circumstances, our team has restructured IBD care by reevaluating priorities, furnishing patients with pertinent information, and ensuring the uninterrupted provision of treatments. It is crucial to acknowledge that in developing nations, a substantial portion of the populace resides in precarious conditions characterized by overcrowding, slum habitation, and inadequate sanitation, among other distinctive factors, necessitating focused attention from healthcare authorities and the implementation of effective adaptations. In this context, particularly concerning IBD patients, the customization of treatment is imperative, with a careful consideration of the pros and cons associated with each approach.
