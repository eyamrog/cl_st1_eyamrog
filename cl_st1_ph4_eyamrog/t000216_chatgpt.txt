The novel coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is accountable for the viral pneumonia outbreak initially detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. This outbreak has swiftly spread, impacting 184 countries. Insights gained in recent months have revealed diverse clinical manifestations of varying severity, spanning from asymptomatic cases to fatalities resulting from multiple organ failure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently designated the intricate disease process caused by SARS-CoV-2 as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The COVID-19 pandemic, rapidly spreading across various countries, currently impacts over one million individuals globally as reported by the World Health Organization. As of April 29, 2020, Brazil had documented 73,235 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5,083 fatalities, resulting in a case-fatality rate of 6.9%. Hospitalization is deemed necessary for up to 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with 5% to 10% requiring intensive care unit admission due to hemodynamic and/or ventilatory support needs. Mortality rates vary from 0.8% to 12% among different countries, potentially influenced by various factors, notably the structure of the healthcare system. Patients with moderate to severe disease presentations primarily exhibit respiratory system involvement, with clinical manifestations ranging from mild pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Complications typically arise between the 7th and 12th day of the disease. The most severe clinical manifestation, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), is characterized by hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrate, and varying phenotypic presentations, including 'normal lung compliance and low potential for lung recruitment' and 'low lung compliance and high potential for lung recruitment'. Approximately 20% to 30% of patients experience cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial ischemia, acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure, and shock. Kidney failure affects 30-50% of critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, with 30% of them requiring renal replacement therapy.
The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell occurs through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor located in the alveoli. The severe manifestation of the infection is distinguished by a robust immune-inflammatory reaction, as indicated by the presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. Recent minimally invasive autopsies have unveiled widespread alveolar damage, the formation of hyaline membranes, and an interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, accompanied by microcirculatory thrombosis. Notably, elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins 1 and 6, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-g, collectively termed as a "cytokine storm," have been documented in these patients.
Thrombosis and extrapulmonary organ damage have been noted even in the absence of confirmed viral presence at these sites, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger a robust inflammatory response, hypercoagulability, and ischemia, exacerbated by hypoxemia. Preliminary results from minimally invasive autopsies conducted at the São Paulo Medical School in Brazil align with findings from China, indicating a similar pattern of organ damage and thrombotic events associated with COVID-19.
Elevated levels of D-dimer, a byproduct of fibrin breakdown, have been linked to increased mortality rates. Expert opinions, drawing from clinical experience and analysis of descriptive studies, underscore the significance of the hypercoagulable state in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, with a noted correlation between worsening disease progression and rising D-dimer levels. The phase characterized by the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and deteriorating radiographic patterns is notably distinguished by a marked increase in D-dimer levels. In the most severe cases, patients may experience myocardial injury and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
In patients with infection, a systemic inflammatory response can lead to endothelial damage, causing an increase in thrombin generation and a decrease in endogenous fibrinolysis. This prothrombotic condition is known as sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) and occurs before disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Various mechanisms contribute to SIC, collectively promoting a pro-hemostatic state. Inflammatory cytokines appear to play a crucial role in mediating this coagulation system dysfunction in sepsis.
Evidence has demonstrated a bidirectional relationship between inflammation and coagulation, where inflammation triggers coagulation, and coagulation amplifies inflammatory responses (see Figure 1). Platelets play a pivotal role in the development of coagulation abnormalities during sepsis, being directly activated by pro-inflammatory mediators like platelet activating factors and thrombin. Platelet activation can also induce fibrin formation through an alternative pathway. The presence of P-selectin on platelet membranes not only facilitates platelet adhesion to leukocytes and endothelial cells but also enhances tissue factor expression in monocytes. Normally, coagulation activation is regulated by three key physiological anticoagulant pathways: the antithrombin system, the activated C-protein system, and the tissue-factor pathway inhibitor. In sepsis, all three pathways exhibit dysfunction. Amidst this imbalance in the coagulation system, endogenous fibrinolysis is significantly diminished.
As per the criteria set forth by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH), improved clinical outcomes are discernible in patients with SIC who are undergoing anticoagulant therapy. The administration of anticoagulants, particularly in critically ill individuals, is not devoid of risks and may be associated with severe hemorrhagic complications. Therefore, the decision to prescribe anticoagulants should be individualized, taking into consideration the thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk profiles of the patients.
Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response triggered by the inappropriate activation and proliferation of lymphocytes, which in turn activate macrophages and histiocytes, leading to the phagocytosis of hematological cells. This condition is also marked by a significant production of inflammatory cytokines. The initial clinical presentation of HPS typically mirrors that of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. As the syndrome progresses, additional symptoms may manifest, including neurological manifestations, alterations in liver function, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and elevated ferritin levels. These symptoms can be induced by various infections, such as COVID-19, which has been associated with a substantial release of cytokines, particularly interleukin 6, alongside systemic inflammation and DIC. It is crucial to consider these conditions based on both clinical and laboratory findings, and an early therapeutic intervention should be established to mitigate their effects.
Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by organic dysfunction like acute respiratory failure, aligns with sepsis diagnostic criteria. Recent observational studies have linked a hypercoagulable state to severe COVID-19, with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIC) and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) often present in fatal cases. The decrease in arterial oxygen pressure in critical patients directly and indirectly contributes to ischemic syndrome development. Consequently, findings suggest that the prothrombotic pathophysiology seen in sepsis may be linked to intrinsic factors of the novel coronavirus, warranting individual analysis of the potential benefits of anticoagulant use in specific patient groups. A retrospective study at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, revealed lower mortality rates in severe COVID-19 patients treated with anticoagulants like unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), particularly those with a SIC score of ≥ 4 and/or markedly elevated D-dimer levels (> 6 times the upper reference limit).
Anticoagulant therapy may be considered as a therapeutic approach for patients with severe COVID-19 exhibiting signs of SIC and/or markedly elevated D-dimer levels, alongside other severity biomarkers, provided there are no contraindications to anticoagulation. This recommendation is supported by expert consensus and a limited number of retrospective studies. Implementing this strategy necessitates adherence to stringent institutional protocols that facilitate continuous monitoring and prompt intervention in case of complications. The algorithm depicted in Figure 2 outlines the assessment of thrombogenesis in COVID-19 patients and offers treatment recommendations. However, the current data remains insufficient to determine crucial elements essential for formulating a comprehensive therapeutic plan, including the optimal choice of medication, dosage, administration schedule, and treatment duration.
Further prospective studies are necessary to provide stronger evidence supporting the use of anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The potential benefits of mitigating the hypercoagulable state must be carefully weighed against the risk of bleeding. Anticoagulant therapy may offer greater advantages if initiated during the pre-thrombotic phase rather than in advanced stages, where bleeding risks are heightened. When considering anticoagulation, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended for stable patients with normal creatinine clearance, administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously. For patients in shock or with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min/m², intravenous heparin at a rate of 18 IU/kg/h should be utilized, targeting an activated partial thromboplastin time between 1.5 and 1.8. Nevertheless, there is currently insufficient evidence to advocate for the widespread use of therapeutic doses of heparin in COVID-19 cases.
In conclusion, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 entails the activation of the inflammatory response and the induction of the thrombotic system. Presently, expert consensus recommends anticoagulant treatment for patients exhibiting the pro-coagulant phenotype, characterized by high D-dimer levels, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated plasma levels of fibrin fragments. Additional research is necessary to definitively establish the efficacy of anticoagulation in preventing complications associated with COVID-19.
