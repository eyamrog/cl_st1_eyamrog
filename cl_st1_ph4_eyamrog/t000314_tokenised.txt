1 Coronavirus 2: Analysis of Regularity of Complete Genome (SARS-CoV-2/Hu/DP/Kng/19-020 RNA)

Abstract This paper shows a technique for the detection of regularities in the complete genome of Coronavirus 2. For this, the concept of intervals in the RNA chain and their comparison within the known sequence is used. The Maximum Regularity Index was applied. The results show that areas of high regularity are identified that coincide with ORF10, Gene N, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and others. The interval around 3500 and the interval around 11000, respectively, appear with high values of regularity and this do not correspond to particularly documented elements (both within Gene: Orf1ab). It might be in the interest of giving importance to that region. The detection of regularities can enhance the creation of biochemical or genetic techniques to deactivate certain functions of Coronavirus 2 or control its effects.

Introduction
Coronavirus 2 has a sequence of 29902 nt (April 10th, 2020) [1]. Its full lineage is: Viruses; Riboviria; Nidovirals; Cornidovirineae; Coronaviridae; Orthocoronavirinae; Betacoronavirus; Sarbecovirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and its genbank acronym is SARS-CoV2.
A method has been applied in which chains of RNA of a certain length are taken and compared with chains of the same length within the complete genome. In previous work this technique has been applied to other microorganisms [2],[3],[4].
Methodology
The index of maximum regularity 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟 was defined in [5] and in other papers such as [4] has been widely described.
In summary, a string or interval lc is defined. It considers the new sequences that are generated 𝑙𝑐−1 when a shift is made, one nucleotide at a time. Each ordered pair is part SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.29
2 of the set 𝐵× 𝐵, where 𝐵= {𝐴, 𝐺, 𝑇, 𝐶}. This procedure is repeated considering the original sequence together with the one generated by reversing its order.
Denoted by 𝑛𝐴,𝐴,𝑑, 𝑛𝐴,𝐺,𝑑, 𝑛𝐴,𝐶,𝑑, 𝑛𝐴,𝑇,𝑑, 𝑛𝐺,𝐴,𝑑, 𝑛𝐺,𝐴,𝑑, 𝑛𝐺,𝐺,𝑑, 𝑛𝐺,𝐶,𝑑, 𝑛𝐺,𝑇,𝑑, 𝑛𝐶,𝐴,𝑑, 𝑛𝐶,𝐺,𝑑, 𝑛𝐶,𝐶,𝑑, 𝑛𝐶,𝑇,𝑑, 𝑛𝑇,𝐴,𝑑, 𝑛𝑇,𝐶,𝑑, 𝑛𝑇,𝐺,𝑑y 𝑛𝑇,𝑇,𝑑 the number of ordered pairs actually counted. The 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟 is defined as:
𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟= 𝑚𝑎𝑥{ 𝐷1, ⋯, 𝐷𝑙𝑐−1, 𝐷0 ∗, ⋯, 𝐷𝑙𝑐−1 ∗ } (𝑙𝑐−𝑙𝑐 16) 2 + 15 ( 𝑙𝑐 16) 2


Where 𝐷∗ 𝑑= (𝑛𝐴,𝐴,𝑑− 𝑙𝑐 16) 2 + (𝑛𝐴,𝐺,𝑑− 𝑙𝑐 16) 2 + ⋯+ (𝑛𝑇,𝑇,𝑑− 𝑙𝑐 16) 2

Results
The 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟 was applied to the complete genome of Coronavirus 2. Below are the results of coincidence with the genes already discovered by other techniques (NCBI, 2020) and possible areas of study for possible deepening.
For a visualization on the components of Coronavirus 2, the configuration of the NCBI (2020) is shown. Image 1: Diagram on the structure of Coronavirus 2.

In the indicated regions, there are intervals that take higher values (Table 1).

Thus, it is evident that in the areas near the intervals around 21578, 29876, 29390, 3952, 11076 have high values. As consulted in the database, this is positive because Gene S, Gene N and ORF10 were identified. It is important to research in more detail what happens around 11078 interval (20 nt). It should be clarified that Gene: Orf1ab is in the range [269, 0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 11 740 1 469 2 198 2 927 3 656 4 385 5 114 5 843 6 572 7 301 8 030 8 759 9 488 10 217 10 946 11 675 12 404 13 133 13 862 14 591 15 320 16 049 16 778 17 507 18 236 18 965 19 694 20 423 21 152 21 881 22 610 23 339 24 068 24 797 25 526 26 255 26 984 27 713 28 442 29 171 Index of Maximum Regularity, 20 nt, SARS-CoV2 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.29

5 In this string size, Gene S (start) and Gene ORF10 are identified. And again, the 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟 points to an important zone around the 11000 interval.
When calculating with a length interval of 28 nt, the sectors around 3500 and 11000 appear with high values. Longer chains are not considered because the probability of occurrence decreases with the number of combinations of the four possibilities.
Conclusions
During the analysis Gene S, Gene N and ORF10 were identified. The interval around 3500 and the interval around 11000, respectively, appear with high values of regularity and this do not correspond to documented elements (both within Gene: Orf1ab). It might be in the interest of giving importance to that region.
The strategy developed here may offer insights into Coronavirus 2 and eventually, with much more research and sophistication, a treatment may be found.
