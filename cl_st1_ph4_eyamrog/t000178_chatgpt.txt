Peru stands out as one of the most biodiverse countries globally, with genetic diversity playing a pivotal role in biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of various organisms and ecosystems. Despite the limited existing literature on Peruvian genetic data in public databases, our study sought to enhance this knowledge by exploring four key repositories: Nucleotide, BioProject, PATRIC, and BOLD. Our analysis underscores the predominant focus of Peruvian institutions on sequencing Bacteria, particularly pathogenic strains like Pasteurella multocida, Neisseria meningitidis, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, with a notable absence of Archaea sequences in Nucleotide. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis emerged as a common sequence in BioProject, while PATRIC highlighted Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Yersinia pestis as prominent entries. Within the Eukaryotic realm of BOLD, Chordata (Aves and Actinopterygii), Angiospermae, and Arthropoda (Insecta and Arachnida) were prevalent. These findings suggest a research inclination towards infectious diseases among Peruvian institutions. Despite a noticeable uptick in genetic data submissions, the databases still inadequately represent the country's genetic diversity. It is imperative to broaden research efforts to encompass more overlooked taxonomic groups and foster genetic studies within regional Peruvian institutions.
Peru stands out as one of the most biodiverse countries globally, boasting a rich array of species including plants (20,533), vertebrates (5,738), and arthropods (30,547) according to current estimates (MINAM, 2019). Notably, there is a lack of existing data on the bacterial and archaeal diversity in Peru. The conservation and management of this extensive biodiversity necessitate a multifaceted approach that integrates ecological and systematic knowledge, as well as recent insights into genetic diversity (Norena et al., 2018). This information plays a crucial role not only in conservation efforts and taxonomic studies but also in the exploration of novel compounds through bioprospecting (Sekurova et al., 2019) and in the development of breeding programs utilizing genetic markers (Assefa et al., 2019; Mrode, 2019).
Bioinformatics, the field that utilizes computational methodologies to address biological inquiries, has become indispensable for the analysis of genetic and genomic data (Baxevanis and Ouellette, 2005). Particularly crucial is its role in examining vast and intricate DNA datasets acquired through next-generation sequencing (NGS) to unearth novel genes, functions, pathways, and molecular interactions. A significant portion of this data is accessible through online public repositories. For example, GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank), housed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information under the US National Institute of Health, currently harbors 216,531,829 sequences, making it one of the largest repositories globally. Other databases, such as the Barcode of Life Data System (https://www.boldsystems.org), with 2,869,168 sequences, offer more specialized information pertaining to specific eukaryotic genes.
The representativeness of Latin American data in genome projects and public databases has been a topic of discussion since the inception of the genomic era (Ramírez et al., 2002). The data stored in these databases has become crucial for studying the genetic diversity of indigenous populations (Harris et al., 2018), understanding human diseases (Norris et al., 2018), and addressing regional biotechnological and agro-industrial challenges (Sasson & Malpica, 2018; Wang et al., 2017).
The most recent evaluation of Peruvian genetic data in public databases was conducted by Norena et al. (2018), who identified 645,753 sequences in the NCBI Nucleotide database linked to "Peru," with only 6,522 (1.01%) originating from national institutions. Our study aimed to update the quantity of sequencing data on Peruvian biodiversity contributed by national institutions to four primary public genetic databases: NCBI BioProject, housing various biological data collections associated with a single genomic sequencing initiative; NCBI Nucleotide, encompassing GenBank and related databases; the bacterial-exclusive database Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC), offering sequencing, protein-protein interactions, and transcriptomic data (Wattam et al., 2017); and the Barcode of Life Data System (Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2007), a DNA barcode repository focusing on specific markers such as the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene for animals, internal transcribed spacers (ITS) for fungi, and the ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) and maturase K (matK) for plants. These databases were also utilized by Norena et al. (2018).
Nucleotide data was obtained using Entrez Direct (Kans 2013). In April 2020, all records from the Nucleotide database with the query "Peru" were downloaded using the command <esearch -db nucleotide -query "Peru" | efetch -format gb > peru.gb>. The resulting output, a 30 Gb genbank file, was utilized to extract details such as the journal and organism of the published sequence. Within Nucleotide, the institution responsible for submitting the genetic sequence is stored in the “journal” variable. A separate file was generated containing unique journal names to tally the presence of Peruvian institutions in the database. By employing awk scripts, we tabulated the frequency of the term "Peru" in the journal variable, the number of sequences uploaded by specific institutions, and the total count of sequenced organisms. Furthermore, we conducted an analysis to identify the most frequently sequenced organisms by each institution in Peru.
BioProject data was retrieved using Entrez Direct with the command <esearch -db BioProject -query "Peru" | efetch -format xml | xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Project \ -block Organism -element OrganismName Supergroup \ -block Submission -element Name > BioProject.xml> and processed through awk scripts. BOLD and PATRIC data were obtained directly from their respective webpages by searching for "Peru." The data was downloaded in tabular (tsv) and comma-separated (csv) formats. Cat and grep scripts were utilized for both datasets, where cat concatenated texts to generate a new output, and grep -c counted the occurrences of specific word queries. Additionally, awk scripts were employed for the BOLD dataset to group and tally the most sequenced taxonomic orders per institution, while csvgrep was used for the PATRIC dataset to count sequenced organisms per institution. All codes and scripts can be accessed in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/reymonera/mining_peru_sequence_DB. Lastly, a search was conducted in the Scopus reference database (https://www.scopus.com) for records containing the term "genetic diversity" attributed to at least one Peruvian institution.
Our findings are presented in Figure 1 and Table 1. Detailed information regarding the records from each database discussed in this study can be accessed in the Supplementary Information linked to this publication (Romero & Castillo, 2020). Within the Nucleotide database, we identified 817,694 records associated with the term "Peru" (Table 1). However, it is important to note that this figure may overestimate the actual number of Peruvian sequences in this database. Notably, we encountered records attributed to the Spanish institution Estacion Biológica de Donana due to its location in a building named "Pabellon del Peru." To align with the previous report by Norena et al. (2018), our focus was solely on submissions from Peruvian institutions. Consequently, we identified 14,488 sequences (1.77% of the "Peru" records) contributed by 36 Peruvian institutions (Suppl. Inf. 2). Among these, 11 institutions submitted over 100 records each (Fig. 1). Noteworthy contributors included public institutions like Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS), Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM), Instituto Nacional de Investigación Agraria (INIA), and Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonía Peruana (IIAP), as well as private entities such as Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) and Farmacéuticos Veterinarios S. A. C. (FARVET). Moving to BioProject, we identified 193 records linked to "Peru" (Suppl. Inf. 3), with 59 submissions from 9 Peruvian institutions (Fig. 1). INS led in submissions, followed by UNMSM, Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina (UNALM), and UPCH. In PATRIC, we uncovered 2,959 records (Suppl. Inf. 4), with 107 submissions from 8 Peruvian institutions (Fig. 1). Similarly, UPCH, INS, and UNMSM were prominent contributors. Lastly, in BOLD, we identified 23,968 public records associated with "Peru." Of these, 8,249 were sourced from Genbank and thus excluded from the final count. Among the remaining 3,754 records submitted by 11 Peruvian institutions (Suppl. Inf. 5), significant contributions came from Centro de Ornitología y Biodiversidad (CORBIDI), UNMSM (particularly the Museo de Historia Natural), UNALM (primarily from the Herbarium), Instituto del Mar del Perú (IMARPE), and Servicio Nacional de Sanidad Agraria del Perú (SENASA).
Data from the Nucleotide, BioProject, and PATRIC databases exhibit a bias towards pathogens, likely influenced by the research interests of frequent data submitters and the direction of funding. Notably, the Nucleotide database is dominated by records of Pasteurella multocida, Neisseria meningitidis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Escherichia coli, Shewanella sp., Aeromonas veronii, Homo sapiens, HIV, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with a majority (70.60%) attributed to Bacteria, followed by Eukaryota (24.38%) and Viruses (3.07%). Interestingly, no submissions from Peruvian institutions were found for Archaea. Within Eukaryota, prevalent clades include Fungi, Viridiplantae, and Phyla Chordata, Arthropoda, and Mollusca. In the BioProject database, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis emerges as the most common record. Conversely, PATRIC predominantly features pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Yersinia pestis, Shigella sonnei, and Staphylococcus aureus. BOLD, being a Eukaryotic database, showcases Chordata (Aves and Actinopterygii), Angiospermae, and Arthropoda (Insecta and Arachnida) as the most frequent taxa in descending order.
In our study, we identified 266 articles authored by individuals affiliated with at least one Peruvian institution (Figure 3, Suppl. Inf. 6). The findings mirrored previous results, with UPCH, UNMSM, UNALM, and INS being prominently featured. Collaborative efforts between research groups primarily involved institutions from the United States, Brazil, United Kingdom, Colombia, and France. The primary subject areas explored in these investigations encompassed Agricultural and Biological Sciences, (Bio)Medicine, and Environmental Sciences (Suppl. Inf. 7).
Two years have passed since Norena et al. (2018) initially disclosed the inaugural outcomes of Latin American genetic data housed in public databases. These researchers graciously shared their scripts and data with us for result replication and comparison. Emphasizing the importance of open science and data accessibility, we have made all our scripts and results readily available for retrieval and examination on GitHub. Norena et al. documented 1.01% (~6,500) of records contributed by Peruvian institutions in NCBI Nucleotide. Our findings revealed a more than twofold surge to 14,488 records within just a two-year span (refer to Table 1). Despite the continuous growth in Nucleotide's total records, our calculated occurrence rate (1.71%) remained relatively stable. An independent study by Clark et al. (2016) scrutinized Genbank data over a similar timeframe (2014-2016) and observed a two to fourfold augmentation in both invertebrate and vertebrate data. Notably, institutions like INS and UNMSM in Peru have generated a substantial amount of data, surpassing the collective contributions of all other institutions combined (>8,000 records). Within BioProject, we identified 30.05% of records submitted by Peruvian institutions (58 out of 193), doubling the occurrences noted by Norena et al. (15.95%). In PATRIC, while Norena et al. identified 0.28% of records from Peruvian institutions, our analysis revealed 3.62% of records (107 out of 2959). Lastly, in BOLD, our count of 3,754 records exceeded Norena et al.'s finding of 3,438, albeit with a smaller increase compared to the other databases.
It is unsurprising that the same institutions are consistently contributing data to various databases, given their robust research groups focused on emerging and infectious diseases, biodiversity, and biotechnology. Nevertheless, the majority of these institutions are situated in Lima, the capital of Peru. To enhance diversity and inclusivity, we advocate for directing funding towards regional research groups and other diverse taxa, such as non-pathogenic bacteria, archaea, non-vertebrates, and non-flowering plants.
We acknowledge the limitations inherent in our search methodology. To ensure consistency and reproducibility, we confined our search to the specified four databases and focused solely on nucleotide sequences. Additional details regarding protein sequences and structures can be accessed through NCBI Protein and Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000). Notably, our study exclusively considers Peruvian institutions, omitting mention of international entities within Peru such as the Centro Internacional de la Papa (CIP) or the US Naval Medical Research Unit Six (NAMRU-6), which have also contributed sequences from Peruvian organisms. Nevertheless, given that these institutions are situated in Lima, their exclusion did not alter the primary findings of our analysis (refer to Supplementary Information 2, 3, 4, 5). Moreover, our reliance on researcher-provided information may introduce data heterogeneity, even within the same institution; for instance, in the BioProject database, we encountered records from INS under varying names like "Peruvian National Institute of Health," "Instituto Nacional de Salud - Peru," and "Instituto Nacional de Salud" (Supplementary Information 3). Consequently, we advocate for the establishment of standardized protocols within each institution for data submission.
In the coming months and years, we anticipate a significant increase in sequencing projects. It would not be unexpected to observe a surge in the submission of SARS-CoV-2 genomes by Peruvian institutions. To efficiently monitor and maintain the currency of this data, we recommend that Peruvian institutions establish a centralized online platform for regular surveillance and organization of sequencing data.
We concur with numerous members of the scientific community who advocate for enhancing the quality of science through principles such as transparency, reproducibility, efficiency, and societal benefits, as highlighted by Molloy (2013). Public databases are pivotal in fostering open science and reproducibility, underscoring the critical importance of making sequencing data readily accessible on such platforms to advance scientific inquiry. Moreover, we assert the significance of establishing a national genome sequencing strategy in collaboration with both public and private research entities. Such an initiative would bolster Peru's genetic data presence in public databases, facilitate collaboration among diverse institutions, and allocate resources for addressing multifaceted challenges spanning agriculture, public health, and biodiversity conservation. Additionally, there is a pressing need to prioritize nationwide capacity-building efforts aimed at nurturing a new cohort of Peruvian bioinformaticians who will play a pivotal role in tackling forthcoming biodiversity-related challenges.
