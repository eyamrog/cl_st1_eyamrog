(Garças Reservoir trophic state dynamics: a 20-year synthesis). The Garças Reservoir history reveals a 
remarkable case of human impacts resulting from the urbanization pressure over the 20th century. It is a shallow tropical 
system located in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga, a protected area within the city of São Paulo, São Paulo State, 
Brazil. Based on a comprehensive dataset (1997-2017), we evaluated the water quality temporal change using a trophic 
state index (TSI); in addition, we also verified whether the management procedures improved the water quality. Mechanical 
removal of macrophytes (1999) triggered an abrupt change from eutrophic-supereutrophic to the hypereutrophic state 
with feedback mechanisms. After five years (2005), a slowdown in the internal P loading process occurred, followed by 
the installation of the secondary wastewater treatment in the city zoo two years later (2007). Both processes promoted the 
beginning of water quality improvement. In 2011, TSI first dropped to supereutrophic state with the temporary diversion 
of the sewage effluent from the São Paulo State Department of Agriculture. This effluent was finally inactivated (2014) 
and the system sustained the supereutrophic state. TSI responded well to the historical key events related to the control of 
sewage effluents. After 11 years from the permanent impact of macrophytes removal, current results have demonstrated 
improved health of the system. It is absolutely necessary to improve the sewage treatment from the city zoo to continue 
the reservoir recovery considering that since 2014 it has been the only external phosphorous loading to Garças Reservoir. 
The history of Garças Reservoir can offer a better understanding of wrong management strategies and the vulnerability of 
tropical shallow systems to eutrophication.

Freshwater systems are among the most threatened 
ecosystems worldwide despite being essential natural 
resources (Dudgeon at al. 2006, Vörösmarty et al. 
2010, Moss 2010). Among the anthropogenic impacts, 
eutrophication is a widespread problem impairing 
the water multiple uses, maintenance of aquatic 
biodiversity, and human health (Davidson & Jeppesen 
2013, Cumming et al. 2015).

Urban reservoirs are, in particular, very vulnerable 
to human impacts since they integrate and accumulate 
material and pollutants from the drainage basin and 
receive discharges of nutrients leading to water quality 
deterioration (Branco & Senna 1996, Figueredo & 
Giani 2001, Dong et al. 2008, Fontana et al. 2014, 
Zorzal-Almeida et al. 2017). Moreover, shallow 
systems are usually more susceptible to eutrophication 
due to the water-sediment interaction and feedback 
mechanisms that intensify the system resistance to 
restoration efforts (Søndegaard et al. 2003, Bicudo 
et al. 2007).

Garças Reservoir history reveals a remarkable 
case of human impacts resulting from the urbanization 
pressure over the 20th century. It is an urban system 
located in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do 
Ipiranga preservation area, surrounded by the São 
Paulo Metropolitan Region. It was originated from 
a former water supply reservoir built in 1894 to 
meet the city increasing demand for drinking water 
and was used for this purpose until 1928. Costa-
Böddeker et al. (2012) provided the eutrophication 
history of the reservoir during c. 110 years based on 
a paleolimnological study and land-use records (1894 
to 2005). According to Costa-Böddeker et al. (2012), 
the reservoir experienced a deep decline in its water 
quality triggered by untreated sewage loads from the 
city zoo and further source of untreated domestic 
effluent from the São Paulo State Department of 
Agriculture.

In 1997, it was initiated a monthly monitoring 
program of the Garças Reservoir water quality. Based 
on a temporal series of 8 years (1997-2004), two 
contrasting limnological phases were characterized, 
i.e. before and after the mechanical removal of the 
macrophyte Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, 
which caused an abrupt change to the hypertrophic 
state with the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms 
(Bicudo et al. 2007) and reduction (average 37%) of 
phytoplankton species (Crossetti et al. 2008). More 
recently, a 20-year study (1997-2017) reported the 
invasion of the dinoflagellate Ceratium furcoides 
(Levander) Langhans and the environmental variables 
that contributed to its establishment and ecological 
success (Crossetti et al. 2019).

Such long-term monitoring measures a lot of 
variables and can hamper public understanding 
and management decision making. In order to 
mitigate such an issue, trophic state indexes (TSI) 
have been developed and improved since the 70s. 
Aiming at aquatic productivity and eutrophication 
measurements, the TSIs compose truthful health 
information on ecosystem. Particularly in São Paulo 
State, Lambarelli (2004) developed a TSI that has been 
widely used and is based on the classic Carlson’s TSI 
(Carlson 1977) with some updates considering the 
tropical reservoir dynamics.

Over these last 20 years (1997-2017), Garças 
Reservoir has undergone environmental changes 
including management actions such as macrophytes 
harvesting, sewage diversion, and construction of 
a secondary wastewater treatment plant in the city 
zoo. Based on this comprehensive dataset, we aimed 
at evaluating (1) the water quality temporal change 
using a trophic state index (TSI), and (2) whether 
the management procedures adopted up to now have 
improved the water quality. The TSI tool has been 
broadly used in monitoring studies for allowing 
comparison of ecosystems productivity and providing 
an initial approach to determine the extent of cultural 
eutrophication (Carlson 1977, Salas & Martino 1991, 
Lamparelli 2004, Cunha et al. 2013).

Study Area - Garças Reservoir (23°38'40.6"S, 
46°37'28.0"W) is a shallow tropical system located 
in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga - a 
protected area of the Atlantic Rain Forest within the 
city of São Paulo, São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil 
(figure 1). It was formed from a larger water supply 
reservoir (Campanário Reservoir) by damming the 
Campanário creek to meet the increasing demand 
for drinking water in 1894. Starting in ~1917, 
Campanário Reservoir was divided into five smaller 
water bodies, having the Garças Reservoir remained 
as the main system. The eutrophication process began 
with untreated sewage loadings from the city zoo 
(1958) and additional untreated sewage input from 
the São Paulo State Department of Agriculture (1975) 
(Costa-Böddeker et al. 2012). A drastic increase 
in allochthonous nutrients (N, P) led to the highest 
macrophyte proliferation, with plants occupying 
40-70% of the water surface causing mosquitoes 
proliferation in the reserve. Local authorities ordered 
the mechanical removal of all the macrophyte cover, 
which was later on carried out within two months 
(September/1999), triggering an abrupt change of 
Garças Reservoir from eutrophic to hypereutrophic 
state with permanent cyanobacteria blooms (Bicudo 
et al. 2007). In 2014, it occurred the invasion of 
Ceratium furcoides due to disturbing events sufficient 
to break the continuous dominance of cyanobacteria 
blooms (Crossetti et al. 2019). Further information 
on climate, morphometric features and limnological 
changes in the reservoir are available in Bicudo et al. 
(2007) and Crossetti et al. (2019).

Data sampling - We performed the samplings monthly 
over 20 consecutive years (1997-2017), always 
in the morning at the deepest site of the reservoir 
and collected the water samples using a van Dorn 
sampler and transferred to acid-rinsed bottles. We 
determined water transparency using a Secchi disk, 
total phosphorus (TP) concentration according to 
Valderrama (1981), and chlorophyll-a concentration 
corrected for pheophytin using 90% ethanol (Sartory 
& Grobbelaar 1984).

Data analysis - We used an adaptation of Carlson’s 
Trophic State Index (TSI) (Carlson 1977) proposed 
by Lamparelli (2004) for tropical reservoirs - an 
index elaborated from reservoirs located at the same 
area of our study (CETESB 2014). TSI uses the total 
phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content, 
and Secchi disk depth (SD) data to calculate the 
corresponding trophic index. This procedure resulted 
in a 20-year trophic state time-series data.

In order to find perceptive changepoints in 
this time-series, we searched for significant mean 
and variance changes over the data. This process 
can separate data in different segments in terms of 
means and variance alterations, a changepoint is the 
observation that separates different segments (Killick 
& Eckley 2014). This procedure allowed to identify 
critical changes in the Garças Reservoir trophic 
dynamics and was performed using the changepoint 
package (Killick & Eckley 2014) and the PELT 
algorithm (Hinkley 1970), which enables multiple 
changepoints detection. For this purpose, we used the 
R program (R Core Team 2019).

After detecting critical changepoints in the data, 
we examined those with an analysis that deals with 
fitting piecewise terms (segments) in a regression 
model called piecewise (or segmented) regression. 
This type of regression considers one or more break-
points as true parameters of the model and identifies 
potential time points that show significant change. The 
potential break-points are identified in the model due 
to a so-called “nuisance parameter”. As a consequence, 
standard statistical tests do not apply (Muggeo 2008). 
In other words, we cannot use the p-value returned 
through classical tests. To mitigate this, we used 
the Davies test (Davies 1977) to verify significant 
differences between the slopes of each segment. It is 
worth mentioning that the Davies test is not aimed at 
obtaining the estimate of the break-point, it tests for a 
non-zero difference-in-slope parameter of a segmented 
relationship. For this purpose, we used segmented 
package (Muggeo 2008), also in R program (R Core 
Team 2019).

The water quality of Garças Reservoir varied 
throughout the study period. During the first three 
years (1997-1999), the system maintained eutrophic 
and supereutrophic states (TSI between 59.1 and 67.0 
without SD). From 2000 to 2011, Garças Reservoir 
was considered hypereutrophic (TSI ≥ 67.0 without 
SD) and from 2011 until the end of the study period 
(2017) it returned to a supereutrophic state, except for 
2013 (figure 2). From the year 2000 on, the influence 
of Secchi disk depth on the index-wide behavior 
started to increase, having decreased again only during 
the last three years (2015-2017) (figure 2).

The behavior of the three limnological variables 
(Chl-a, TP and SD) used to estimate TSI also 
demonstrated great variation during the entire 
period (figure 3). Considering the whole period, TP 
concentrations ranged from 37.77 to 979.68 µg L-¹ 
(172.44 - mean value), Chlo-a from 11.77 to 1323.63 
µg L-¹ (156.60 - mean value), and SD ranged from 0.05 
to 1.7 m (0.41 - mean value) (table1). Chlorophyll-a 
and total phosphorus concentrations presented similar 
variation, with a rapid increase of both variables at the 
end of 1999. However, a distinct TP increase occurred 
in 1999, 2001, at the end of 2002, and across the years 
2003 to 2005; subsequently, both variables kept the 
same relative behavior. Secchi disk depth showed 
an abrupt decrease during the winter of 1999 and 
remained with relatively low values until 2010 when 
it started to increase again (figure 3).

The changepoint analysis identified only one 
point dividing the TSI time series into two segments 
(orange lines in figure 4a). These segments represent 
significant mean and variance changes in the TSI 
values over the time series. Following the same logic, 
we identified in each segment a new changepoint to 
access new mean changes in the data. We observed a 
mean increase (64 to 71, figure 4a) followed by a mean 
decrease (74 to 67, figure 4b) and finally a stable mean 
value (67, figure 4c). This information was important 
to the use of piecewise regression. The first mean 
change occurred in August of 1999, and we used that 
first point as a possible breakpoint in the breakpoint 
(segmented) regression. Still, the breakpoint identified 
through the regression occurred in October of 2001. 
This means that we identified a significant TSI increase 
followed by a significant decrease (figure 4b), which 
was demonstrated through a positive regression 
coefficient (Time = 0.29) followed by a negative 
coefficient (U1.Time = -0.34) (table 2). One can 
notice the “not applicable (NA)” term as the P value 
for U1.Time term (table 2). As previously discussed, 
the reason is that standard methods do not apply. The 
Davies test was significant, which provided us with 
had solid regression coefficients.

Figure 5 presents a synthesis of the TSI inter-
annual variation. As we can see, the trophic state 
index of 2017 is very similar to the trophic state of 
1997 (very close to the hypereutrophic threshold). In 
contrast, along the 2000-2010 period, TSI increases 
and the hypereutrophic state predominates. Starting 
in 2011 (except for 2013), TSI decreases to the 
supereutrophic state. The highest change in TSI 
occurred after phase II (April/1998-Sep./1999); 
thereafter, more pronounced changes occurred along 
different events reported during the study (table 1 and 
table 3). In particular, we observed the strong influence 
of the zoo secondary sewage treatment (STS Zoo in 
figure 5) as revealed in a gradual decrease in all of the 
values of the variables (table 1). Over the last period 
(2014-2017), we observed the lowest values of TSI, 
chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus concentrations 
(table 1) in the time-series. 

Garças Reservoir is part of long-term ecological 
research (LTER) and has been well investigated over 
the years. On the basis of a 20-year data, we observed 
a small improvement in thehealth of the system.

The water quality of the system gradually has 
decreased since the city zoo construction (1958) in a 
headspring area located upstream Garças Reservoir, 
and further with the installation of the Department of 
Agriculture (1975), both with no adequate sanitation 
and contributing to high sewage loadings (table 3). As 
discussed by Bicudo et al. (2007), the eutrophication 
led to seasonal cyanobacterial blooms, the fast growth 
of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), and a huge 
proliferation of mosquitoes. As a measure to control 
the mosquitoes, most of the macrophytes were 
mechanically removed within a few months during the 
period of cyanobacterial bloom (table 3). After such a 
controversial strategy, Garças Reservoir shifted in a 
feedback mechanism with internal phosphorus loading 
and permanent cyanobacterial blooms, jumping to an 
“irreversible degraded state”. The TSI captured such 
an abrupt change (transition 1999-2000, figure 2) 
clearly showing a jump to the hypereutrophic state. 
Bicudo et al. (2007) presented a comprehensive 
discussion of such process synthesizing in distinct 
limnological phases (I, II, and III, see reference) and 
the consequences of such action.

The acceleration of eutrophication occurred at the 
end of 1999 with the process of self-eutrophication 
(internal P loading). This period represents the 
beginning of our time series and includes more than 
15 years of post-disturbance data, which provided 
us with an excellent opportunity to investigate the 
system response after such extreme event (Turner 
et al. 2006, Muller et al. 2010), as well as a long-term 
baseline which allowed to detect change and measure 
ecosystem responses to disturbance (Buma 2015).

The event of macrophytes removal (1999) caused 
a significant increase in the TSI mean values leading to 
a switch to a more turbid state, increased phosphorus 
concentrations, and feedback mechanisms (Bicudo 
et al. 2007). This reverberated into a TSI increase 
until the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2002, as 
evaluated through the point break regression (figure 5). 
Years after the abrupt change event, the TSI started 
to decrease. This can be related to some management 
events in the system history (tables 1 and 3). We 
highlight the importance of secondary wastewater 
treatment in the city zoo (started in October 2007). 
Moreover, it has most likely occurred a slowdown in 
the internal P loading process since 2005, as indicated 
by the lower surface P values in the time-series 
(figure 3) and the decrease in bottom soluble reactive 
phosphorus with the increase in bottom oxygen levels 
(DCB, unpublished data). Therefore, after 2007, the 
combination of both processes promoted the beginning 
of the water quality improvement. From 2008 on, a 
sharp limnological change has also been demonstrated 
with the replacement of the cyanobacteria dominance 
from Microcystis aeruginosa (Kützing) Kützing 
to Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszýnska) 
Seenayya & Subba Raju (Crossetti et al. 2019).

Water transparency was also among the variables 
that were most affected by the water hyacinth removal 
(Bicudo et al. 2007) and throughout the events in the 
time-series, and can provide fruitful insights on the 
system equilibrium (Scheffer 1990). We observed 
that the irreversible turbid phase may have started to 
reverse since 2011, especially over the last five years 
(2013 to 2017) (figures 2-3). Undoubtedly, as stated 
by Crossetti et al. (2019), the replacement of dense 
cyanobacterial blooms with other phytoplankton 
species, such as the invasive Ceratium furcoides, 
might have contributed to higher transparency levels.

In 2011, TSI first dropped to the supereutrophic 
state (figures 2c, 5a) as a consequence of the previous 
actions and the temporary diversion of the sewage 
effluent from the São Paulo State Department of 
Agriculture (table 3). The exceptional increase in 
TSI in 2013 was a response to the historical drought 
during the period 2013-2014 in southeastern Brazil 
(ANA 2015). In 2014, the sewage effluent was finally 
inactivated; the system sustained the supereutrophic 
state and all variables revealed an improvement of the 
system health (table 1).

The TSI captured the vulnerability of this shallow 
tropical reservoir to wrong management actions 
(Bicudo et al. 2007) and the prolonged negative effect 
of the self-eutrophication to recovery (Jeppensen et al. 
2003, 2005). Moreover, the TSI was sensitive to the 
historical key events related to the control of sewage 
effluents.

Summarizing, 11 years after the permanent 
impact of macrophytes removal (1999), current results 
demonstrated an improvement in the system health. 
The slowdown of the internal P loading process, in 
addition to the secondary sewage treatment from the 
zoo city and the sewage inactivation from the State 
Department of Agriculture, led to the maintenance of 
the supereutrophic state. It is important to emphasize 
that the secondary sewage treatment removes 
the biodegradable organic matter (in solution or 
suspended) and suspended solids, however, it does 
not remove dissolved nutrients (phosphorus and 
nitrogen). Therefore, in order to continue the reservoir 
recovery, it is absolutely necessary to improve the 
sewage treatment from the city zoo, considering that 
since 2014 it has been the only external phosphorous 
loading to Garças Reservoir.

As a consequence of the urbanization pressure, 
the history of Garças Reservoir can provide us with a 
better understanding of wrong management strategies 
and the eutrophication process in tropical systems. 
The key measure required for the prevention of water 
deterioration is the control of external nutrient loading, 
including point and non-point source pollution and 
management planning.
