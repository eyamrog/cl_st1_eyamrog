Numerous COVID-19 patients experience thromboembolic complications that significantly impact their prognosis. In this study, the authors suggest a revised CHA2DS2-VASc score, incorporating an additional point for COVID-19, to prompt early prophylactic measures against thromboembolic events before the disease progresses. This modification aims to mitigate the exacerbation of the patient's condition resulting from thromboembolic issues, ultimately decreasing the probability of requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation, consequently lowering mortality rates.
Since the initial description of COVID-19 infection, the severe respiratory syndrome linked to the disease has led to a swift rise in ICU admissions and increased mortality rates among affected patients. In times of a pandemic, it becomes imperative to prevent the overwhelming of healthcare systems, be it public or private, and especially the ICUs. A key discovery in the lungs of these patients is the presence of platelet thrombi and fibrin in small arterial vessels, aligning well with the clinical manifestation of coagulopathy.
Given the absence of a universally endorsed treatment protocol for this scenario and the potential link between coronavirus infection and thrombosis in specific instances, emerging evidence and preliminary research suggest that timely and appropriate anticoagulation therapy may play a crucial role in mitigating or even reversing the prothrombotic tendencies observed in certain patients.
It has been noted that the group of patients exhibiting poor responses to COVID-19 infection (Figure 1) and ultimately succumbing to the disease are the same individuals whose CHA2DS2-VASc scores suggest a predisposition to stroke, transient ischemic attack, peripheral emboli, and pulmonary thromboembolism (Table 1). As per this scoring system, patients are categorized as high risk if they score 2 points or more, intermediate risk if they score 1, and low risk if they lack risk factors. In light of this, our proposition involves augmenting the CHA2DS2-VASc score (Table 1) by 1 point for COVID-19 patients, utilizing this revised score to recommend prophylactic anticoagulation for those deemed at high risk of thrombosis based on the score during the disease's phase 2 (Table 2). The primary aim is to avert the exacerbation of the patient's condition due to thromboembolic complications, thereby circumventing the necessity for intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation.
In this study, the authors suggest adjusting the scoring system of the CHA2DS2-VASc score to potentially decrease the incidence of thromboses and emboli in high-risk patients. By implementing prophylactic measures based on these modified scores, the aim is to prevent the occurrence of events that have been linked to the deterioration of clinical conditions in these individuals. The primary goal is to reduce the progression of critically ill patients to phase 3 by evaluating the validity of these proposed modifications.
