We introduce a dataset that encompasses the documented figures of COVID-19 cases and fatalities at both municipal and federative unit levels in Brazil. This data is compiled on a daily basis from official sources, ensuring the most current information and offering a dependable, accessible resource for researchers, health authorities, and the general public. Interactive pages are accessible in both English and Portuguese, featuring maps, graphs, and tables presenting all the pertinent data. Additionally, information regarding recovered cases, suspected cases, and conducted tests is provided for the majority of federative units.
An outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has spread to provinces of mainland China and then to all six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. In Brazil, the first imported case was confirmed on February 25, 2020 in the city of São Paulo/SP, and was officially announced by the Ministry of Health of Brazil – Ministério da Saúde (MS) – one day later. Since then, the Federal Government of Brazil reports daily the total number of cases and deaths for each federative unit (UF), that corresponds to the Federal District (Distrito Federal) and 26 states. However, Brazil has 5570 municipalities with varied population distributions and characteristics, and official information at least at the municipal level is essential for researchers, health authorities, and the general public. In order to provide reliable data also at the municipal level, we developed an online interactive page to visualize and track the reported cases of COVID-19 in Brazil by using official data from each federative unit reports. These reports contain data at municipal level for both the number of cases and deaths.
The webpage [https://covid19br.wcota.me/en] was initially shared publicly on March 13, featuring interactive plots displaying the numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and suspected cases. A comprehensive dataset is openly accessible and updated daily via a GitHub repository [https://github.com/wcota/covid19br] in CSV format. From March 13 to April 09, data collection involved manual reading of reports and updating case numbers for each municipality and state. On April 10, a semi-automated approach was implemented, utilizing municipal data sources from Brasil.IO [https://brasil.io/dataset/covid19/caso/], which began data collection similarly with the assistance of a task force comprising 40 volunteers. Similar to the previous method, municipal-level data is aggregated to match the officially reported numbers by the Ministério da Saúde, detailed in Section A. To maintain real-time updates, we monitor cases reported by the Twitter account @Coronavirusbra1 [https://twitter.com/coronavirusbra1] through a Google Sheet. Prior to updating the dataset, we verify case numbers with the official sources referenced by the data streams. Additionally, data on recoveries, suspected cases, and tests conducted in each federative unit is included when available.
In Figure 1, we illustrate the comparison between the number of reported cases by the Ministério da Saúde and those aggregated in this dataset. Official data from the Brazilian government is updated once a day, leading to discrepancies in the daily reported case numbers. It is noteworthy that while the government asserts that the first case was recorded on February 26, other sources confirm the epidemic's onset on February 25 in Brazil. The temporal evolution for each federative unit is depicted in Figure 2. Due to the aggregation of federative unit data before federal government confirmation, minor discrepancies may arise. Furthermore, georeferenced data at the municipal level is provided, enabling the visualization of cases on a map, as shown in Figure 3.
We are confident that our dataset can significantly contribute to the modeling, tracking, and control of the ongoing outbreak situation in Brazil. Moving forward, we are committed to continuously updating and enhancing this dataset to ensure its relevance and usefulness in addressing the challenges posed by the current situation.
Acknowledgements are extended to Carlos Achy (@coronavirusbra1), Álvaro Justen, and all volunteers of the Brasil.IO project for their valuable data contributions. Additionally, we express our gratitude to Fábio Rehm, Rafael Calpena Rodrigues, Lucas Biló, and Silvio C. Ferreira for engaging in insightful discussions. Financial support for this study was provided in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (Capes) – Finance Code 001.
This dataset compiles data from a minimum of three primary sources:
Ministério da Saúde (MS) [https://covid.saude.gov.br/]: This is the official website of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, providing daily updates on the number of COVID-19 cases per federative unit. The information presented on the website includes only the figures for cases and deaths in each federative unit.
Brasil.IO (IO) [https://brasil.io/dataset/covid19/caso/]: This platform compiles data daily from the official epidemiological bulletins of each federative unit in Brazil. The information provided is at the municipal level, detailing the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each municipality.
The Twitter account @coronavirusbra1, managed by Carlos Achy, provides updates on the latest numbers of confirmed, recovered, and suspected cases as reported by official websites, social media accounts, and news sources for each federative unit. Additionally, information on the number of tests conducted is also accessible. The data is sourced from a Google Sheet available at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MWQE3s4ef6dxJosyqvsFaV4fDyElxnBUB6gMGvs3rEc/edit?usp=sharing.
The set representing the number of cases (deaths) for each day is denoted as C = {ct1, ct2, . . . , ctN } (D = {dt1, dt2, . . . , dtN }), where cti (dti) signifies the total number of cases (deaths) reported up to day ti. The final day of data update is labeled as tN. Initially, we gather this data from the MS source for each federative unit, followed by collecting the set from the IO source for each municipality. In cases where the number of cases (or deaths) for a federative unit from IO surpasses that of the MS dataset, the figures are adjusted accordingly. Conversely, if the IO numbers are lower, the MS source data takes precedence. The TW dataset is exclusively utilized for the final day of data update, tN. This methodology guarantees that the number of cases for each federative unit remains consistently updated, even if the initial two sources have not yet reported those cases. For recovered and suspected cases, as well as tests conducted, historical data from the TW dataset is employed, which is generally accessible for most federative units.
The complete dataset can be accessed in CSV format through a GitHub repository [https://github.com/wcota/covid19br], made freely available under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International License.

In the research article, latitude information (lat) was a crucial component that played a significant role in the study's findings.
In the study, longitude information was a crucial component for accurately determining the geographical location of the research subjects. The precise longitudes of the participants were essential for mapping their positions with accuracy and ensuring the validity of the study's findings. By incorporating longitude data, the researchers were able to establish a clear spatial context for their analysis, enabling them to draw meaningful conclusions about the relationships between variables. The inclusion of longitude information enhanced the overall quality and reliability of the research, providing a solid foundation for the study's results and contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the field.
The total number of cases or deaths recorded for a specific location is a crucial metric in understanding the impact of a particular event or phenomenon. This figure serves as a fundamental indicator of the scale and severity of the situation under consideration. By quantifying the total number of cases or deaths, researchers can assess the extent of the issue and track its progression over time. This data point is essential for conducting accurate analyses, formulating effective strategies, and making informed decisions in response to the circumstances at hand. Therefore, the total number of cases or deaths for a given location plays a significant role in shaping our understanding of the situation and guiding our actions moving forward.
The variable "total_per_100k_inhabitants" represents the total number of a specific metric per 100,000 inhabitants.
