The coronavirus is a zoonotic RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales. This family of viruses is responsible for causing respiratory infections and was initially identified in 1937, later named coronaviruses in 1965 due to their crown-like appearance when viewed under a microscope. Various types of coronaviruses have been identified, including the alpha coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, the beta coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), MERS-CoV causing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the novel SARS-CoV-2 discovered in late 2019 following cases reported in China, leading to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 is established through the analysis of respiratory samples obtained via aspiration of the airways or sputum induction. Laboratory tests for virus identification employ real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques and either partial or complete sequencing of the viral genome. It is recommended to collect nasopharyngeal aspirate, combined nasal and oral swab samples, or lower respiratory tract secretions such as sputum, tracheal lavage fluid, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Molecular biology tests detecting viral RNA are essential for confirming the disease. Severe cases necessitate transfer to a referral hospital for isolation and treatment, while individuals with mild symptoms should receive follow-up care at the primary health care level and be advised to self-isolate at home.
The clinical spectrum of coronavirus infection is wide, encompassing manifestations from a simple cold to severe pneumonia. COVID-19 typically manifests initially as a flu-like syndrome, with individuals developing signs and symptoms like mild respiratory illness and persistent fever around 5-6 days post-infection (with a range of 1-14 days). Notably, the fever in COVID-19 cases tends to persist, unlike the progressive decline seen in influenza cases. Some individuals, particularly the very young, elderly, immunocompromised, or those who have used antipyretic medication, may not exhibit fever. In children, the disease appears to be relatively rare and mild, with only about 2.4% of reported cases occurring in individuals under 19 years of age, of whom 2.5% and 0.2% have developed severe or critical illness, respectively.
According to the Clinical Management Protocol for the New Coronavirus issued by the Brazilian National Ministry of Health in February of this year, the initial 99 patients hospitalized with pneumonia and confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan were predominantly males and individuals over 50 years of age. Among these patients, the primary symptoms observed were fever (in 83%), cough (in 82%), shortness of breath (in 31%), muscle pain (in 11%), mental confusion (in 9%), headache (in 8%), sore throat (in 5%), rhinorrhea (in 4%), chest pain (in 2%), diarrhea (in 2%), and nausea/vomiting (in 1%). Another study involving 41 COVID-19 patients reported lymphopenia.
In their study analyzing data from 1,099 confirmed COVID-19 patients in China, Guan et al. (4) noted that the average age of the patients was 47 years, with 41.9% being female. The primary composite outcome, encompassing admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), the necessity for artificial ventilation, or progression to death, was observed in 67 patients (6.1%), with ICU admission at 5.0%, invasive mechanical ventilation at 2.3%, and death at 1.4%. Predominant symptoms included fever (43.8% at admission, 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%), while diarrhea was less common at 3.8%. Lymphopenia was prevalent in 83.2% of patients upon admission, with an average incubation period of 4 days. Notably, patients frequently presented without fever, and many exhibited normal X-ray results.
Based on a study of 55,924 confirmed cases, the World Health Organization-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 reported the most common signs and symptoms: fever (87.9%), dry cough (67.7%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), dyspnea (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%), myalgia or arthralgia (14.8%), chills (11.4%), nausea or vomiting (5%), nasal congestion (4.8%), diarrhea (3.7%), hemoptysis (0.9%), and conjunctival congestion (0.8%). In most cases, the disease was mild with complete recovery. Among laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, approximately 80% had mild to moderate disease, 13.8% had severe disease, and 6.1% had critical disease. Severe disease criteria included dyspnea, respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, peripheral oxygen saturation ≤ 93%, and arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio < 300, with or without pulmonary infiltrate occupying more than 50% of the lung parenchyma in the first 24–48 hours. Critical disease involved respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction/failure. While asymptomatic cases have been reported, the true proportion remains unclear. Those at highest risk of severe illness and death are individuals over 60 years old, particularly those with underlying conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer.
In patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the most frequently observed CT findings include ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation, at times exhibiting a rounded morphology and peripheral distribution. Bernheim et al. (5) conducted an evaluation of pulmonary abnormalities in relation to the disease's duration, noting that on chest CT scans, the disease typically reaches its peak extent around 10 days post symptom onset. The utilization of a chest X-ray is often imperative in the assessment of individuals suspected of having COVID-19. Prompt identification of the disease is vital for ensuring timely treatment. From a public health perspective, immediate isolation of the patient plays a critical role in containing the spread of this infectious disease.
In the study by Bernheim et al. (5), the chest CT findings of 121 COVID-19 infected patients in China were analyzed concerning the time elapsed from symptom onset to the initial CT scan. The authors posited that certain CT findings would become more frequent as the time since infection increased. Out of the 121 patients, 27 (22%) showed no changes on CT scans, while the remaining 94 (78%) exhibited ground-glass opacities, areas of consolidation, or both. Among these patients, 73 (60%) had bilateral lung involvement, with none showing thoracic lymph node disease, pulmonary cavitation, or nodules, and only one patient (1%) presenting with pleural effusion. The time intervals from symptom onset to the first CT scan were categorized as early (0–2 days; 36 patients), intermediate (3–5 days; 33 patients), or late (6–12 days; 25 patients). Ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation were notably less frequent in the early-CT group compared to the intermediate and late groups. Only 16 (44%) of the early-CT patients had pulmonary opacities, contrasting with 30 (91%) in the intermediate group and 24 (96%) in the late group. Bilateral lung involvement was seen in 10 (28%) of the early group, 25 (76%) of the intermediate group, and 22 (88%) of the late group. Linear opacities, crazy-paving patterns, and the inverted halo sign were absent in the early group but present in 5 (20%), 5 (20%), and 1 (4%) of the late group patients, respectively. Regarding axial distribution, peripheral involvement was noted in 8 (22%) of the early group, 21 (64%) of the intermediate group, and 18 (72%) of the late group patients.
The identification of imaging patterns based on the duration since coronavirus infection is crucial not only for comprehending the pathophysiology and progression of the infection but also for predicting patient outcomes and the emergence of complications. Currently, the anatomopathological characteristics of the disease remain undescribed. Subsequent research endeavors will have the capacity to assess imaging observations in individuals with persistent COVID-19, along with documenting the pathological features of the infection.
