On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of pandemic proportions. By then, there were over 118,000 infected individuals across 114 countries, with 4,291 fatalities recorded. Despite ongoing efforts by scientists globally, governments and healthcare professionals are grappling with the daunting task of making decisions based on emerging, often incomplete, or unavailable data. Daily reports continue to reveal escalating numbers of infections and deaths, underscoring the urgent need for coordinated responses to this unprecedented crisis.
In efforts to curb the spread of viruses, certain governments have implemented lockdown measures in major cities, while others have advocated for social distancing by prohibiting public gatherings and closing off public spaces such as parks and beaches. Additionally, gyms and fitness centers have been shuttered, depriving individuals of a secure location to engage in physical activity. While the initial impression may suggest that staying at home without exercising is the sole recourse, it is imperative to recognize that abstaining from physical activity is not the sole alternative for individuals adhering to social isolation protocols. In reality, refraining from exercise is a highly detrimental option that should not be entertained.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises that individuals aged 18 years and above should aim to engage in a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or a blend of both on a weekly basis. Those failing to meet these guidelines are classified as sedentary. Physical exercise offers numerous health advantages, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dementia, and breast and colon cancer. Despite the multitude of benefits associated with physical activity, sedentary behavior remains a widespread issue, impacting approximately 27.5% of the global population.
Sedentary behavior significantly elevates the risk of major non-communicable diseases worldwide. According to I-Min Lee et al., physical inactivity contributes to 6% of the burden of coronary artery disease, 7% of type 2 diabetes, and 10% of breast and colon cancers. Consequently, inactivity is attributed to 9% of premature mortality on a global scale. Remarkably, sedentary lifestyles claim more lives annually than the COVID-19 infection.
Yang et al. (12) reported that among Chinese patients with COVID-19, hypertension was the most common comorbidity (17 ± 7%), followed by diabetes (8 ± 6%) and cardiovascular diseases (5 ± 4%). Another meta-analysis supported these findings, indicating that these comorbidities were linked to a poorer prognosis. Information regarding the exercise habits of COVID-19 patients remains unavailable. However, it is evident that the prevalence of these comorbidities could be reduced if the minimum exercise requirements recommended by the WHO were universally met (4).
Exercise training is widely acknowledged as an effective strategy for primary prevention and the treatment of various chronic diseases, particularly those with high prevalence rates that are associated with poorer prognoses in COVID infections. Therefore, engaging in physical training has the potential to significantly reduce mortality rates during this ongoing pandemic.
Physical training has been shown to enhance immune response, a fact that holds true across various demographics. Elite athletes, despite initial concerns about potential side effects of vaccination, have been found to experience improved vaccine responses with high exercise intensity and frequency. This phenomenon extends to older individuals as well, with studies indicating that concentrations of immunoglobulins post-vaccination are notably higher in those who engage in cardiovascular training compared to their sedentary counterparts. These findings underscore the beneficial impact of physical activity on immune function and highlight the potential advantages of incorporating regular exercise into healthcare strategies aimed at bolstering immune defenses.
While exercise training has shown promising effects on the immune system, it is important to note that exercise stress can potentially elevate the risk of upper respiratory tract infections. Research indicates that acute bouts of intense exercise and prolonged, vigorous training, common among long-distance runners, can weaken host defenses and heighten the likelihood of upper respiratory tract infections. Studies have shown that in athletes undergoing rigorous training regimens, both innate and acquired immunity tend to decrease, often by a range of 15-25%.
Exercise has the capacity to modulate various components of the immune system, thereby influencing susceptibility to infections, suggesting that exercise training could either heighten or diminish vulnerability to infections. Despite its seemingly paradoxical nature, this assertion holds true and is rather straightforward. A significant study conducted during the Hong Kong flu outbreak in 1998 revealed that engaging in mild to moderate exercise three to five times a week decreased the likelihood of mortality, contrasting with individuals who either refrained from exercise entirely or engaged in excessive physical activity, who faced a higher risk of death. Consequently, the critical factor in the survival equation during a pandemic is not merely the act of exercising but rather the precise prescription and management of exercise routines.
Physicians are trained in the prescription of various drugs, yet the importance of exercise in treating various diseases is often overlooked in medical education. Just like medication, exercise training requires precise dosing to achieve optimal outcomes. The American College of Sports Medicine has introduced the FITT-VP principle as a mnemonic to guide exercise prescription, encompassing key factors such as Frequency, Intensity, Type, Time, Volume, and Progression. This framework ensures that all essential components are considered when prescribing exercise regimens for patients.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the necessary social restrictions have undeniably disrupted the daily routines of individuals worldwide. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that there are exercises that can be safely performed within the confines of one's home. Building upon the WHO's recommendations for minimal training volume for maintaining health and the potential risks associated with high-intensity training on immunity, certain principles can effectively guide individuals in engaging in home-based exercise routines while adhering to social isolation measures.
The principle of the Hippocratic Oath is relevant in this context, emphasizing the importance of considering potential risks associated with exercise. These risks are not easily discernible from a remote assessment. Prior to commencing independent exercise, patients should ensure that all responses on the PAR-Q questionnaire are negative. Furthermore, it is advised against exercising if the individual is currently experiencing symptoms such as flu-like symptoms, sore throat, body aches, shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, or fever. Patients who answer positively on the PAR-Q questionnaire or exhibit any of these symptoms should consult a healthcare professional before initiating any exercise regimen.
According to established guidelines, individuals who are sedentary are advised to initiate aerobic exercise sessions 3 to 5 times weekly, while incorporating resistance training activities 2 to 3 times per week. Additionally, flexibility and mobility exercises are recommended to be performed on a daily basis.
During a pandemic, it is advisable to avoid high-intensity exercise. Understanding how to assess exercise intensity is crucial. While methods like anaerobic threshold, maximal oxygen volume uptake, and real maximal heart rate are effective, they often necessitate exercise tests that may not be accessible during a pandemic. Despite its potential inaccuracies, the calculation of maximum heart rate (Max HR = 220 - age) is likely the most practical approach to estimating one's maximal heart rate when comprehensive exercise tests are not feasible.
During light-intensity exercise, the heart rate is maintained below 45% of the maximum heart rate. For moderate-intensity exercise, the heart rate is typically maintained within the range of 64% to 76% of the maximum heart rate. Consequently, it is recommended that during the pandemic, individuals should avoid exceeding 77% of their maximum heart rate during exercise, as this would classify as vigorous exercise.
Resistance exercise prescription typically involves determining percentages of repetition maximum for each exercise. However, since repetition maximum tests require equipment that may not be readily available at home, adaptations are necessary. Strength exercises that rely solely on body weight, such as pushups, sit-ups, and lunges, can be performed effectively. Additionally, resistance bands serve as suitable alternatives. In cases where more resistance is desired, everyday items like books, food packages, or other objects can be utilized as makeshift weights for training purposes.
The duration of exercise is contingent upon an individual's aerobic capacity, with recommendations typically suggesting sets lasting between 30 to 50 minutes.
Multicomponent exercise programs, which encompass aerobic, resistance, flexibility, and balance training exercises, are widely recommended in the realm of physical fitness.
Current guidelines suggest a minimum of 150 minutes of aerobic exercise and two resistance training sessions weekly. In light of potential immune depletion risks associated with intense training, my perspective is that individuals previously engaged in exercise should aim to maintain their pre-pandemic training volume. Conversely, those who were previously sedentary should strive to meet the minimum exercise recommendations.
It is imperative to prioritize maintaining physical fitness rather than solely focusing on achieving higher levels of fitness.
Government measures aimed at restricting movement during the COVID-19 pandemic should not inadvertently exacerbate the sedentary lifestyle epidemic. Physical exercise has the potential to combat both public health issues, provided it is appropriately recommended and practiced. Sustaining a routine of regular physical activity within the confines of one's home is crucial for promoting overall well-being amidst the ongoing global crisis caused by COVID-19.
