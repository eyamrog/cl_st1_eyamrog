A population study serves as a crucial instrument for comprehending the true epidemiological landscape of Covid-19 across various regions, enabling the identification of its scale, transmission patterns, and demographic, geographic, and social spread.
Objective: This study sought to ascertain the prevalence and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the populations of two Brazilian cities during the initial wave of the pandemic, while also examining the subsequent socioeconomic and health impacts that ensued.
Materials and Methods: This paper outlines the methodological procedures employed and the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the population. A household survey was carried out between October and December 2020 in two historic cities within Brazil's mining region. The detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was conducted using the Wondfo® rapid test. The face-to-face interview involved the administration of a questionnaire encompassing registration data, sociodemographic and economic variables, living habits, general health condition, mental health, sleep patterns, and dietary and nutritional information.
Results: A total of 1,762 residents were evaluated, with 764 (43.4%) residing in Mariana and 998 (56.6%) in Ouro Preto. In both cities, 51.9% of the interviewees were female, predominantly falling within the age range of 35 to 59 years old (47.2%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to be 5.5% across all cities, with a slightly higher prevalence in Ouro Preto at 6.2% compared to Mariana at 4.7%. Notably, there was no significant difference in prevalence between the two cities (P>0.05).
In conclusion, this study successfully confirmed the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, paving the way for additional investigations into the health status of the population in relation to social isolation and the susceptibility to contracting the virus.
The swift dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for COVID-19, prompted the World Health Organization to declare on January 30, 2020 that the illness constituted a global public health emergency. Globally, the rapid transmission rate and the looming threat of healthcare system overload have presented persistent obstacles for governments, particularly in managing successive waves of the disease [1-3].
In Brazil, the federal government's neglect and mismanagement in coordinating pandemic control efforts have forced many municipalities to independently make crucial epidemiological surveillance decisions to prevent the virus from spreading within their jurisdictions. Within this framework, challenges related to diagnosing and reporting cases, limited human resources in healthcare and surveillance sectors, and a shortage of diagnostic tests have significantly hindered efforts to accurately assess the prevalence of both the disease and infections [4-7].
Several challenges associated with the disease include the likelihood that individuals with severe symptoms are more inclined to seek healthcare services and undergo diagnostic testing, the significant proportion of infected individuals exhibiting mild symptoms or remaining asymptomatic, and the social determinants influencing the disease's manifestation. These factors have the potential to disrupt the transmission dynamics, leading to underreporting and the distortion of actual COVID-19 data.
Hence, it is crucial to evaluate the local viral circulation status, particularly in smaller cities with limited resources.
A population study serves as a crucial instrument for comprehending the true epidemiological landscape of a disease across various regions, determining its scale, unraveling its transmission patterns, and unveiling its demographic, geographic, and social spread. Through this method, valid metrics can be formulated to depict the infection's prevalence accurately and forecast the likelihood of disease occurrence.
Immunochromatographic tests for antibody detection serve as a crucial tool for epidemiological surveillance services, facilitating the identification and interruption of the virus transmission chain. These tests support health surveillance efforts aimed at enhancing monitoring and individual care through the implementation of preventive measures. Consequently, a seroepidemiological survey was conducted to ascertain the prevalence and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the populations of two medium-sized Brazilian cities within the Inconfidentes region, along with the subsequent socioeconomic and health impacts. This paper outlines the methodological procedures employed and presents the estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the studied population.
In this population-based serological study, a household survey was conducted in two historic cities within Brazil's mining region between October and December 2020, amidst the first wave of the pandemic. The survey was executed in three stages, each separated by 21 days, during which distinct census sectors were assessed in every stage.
The study design adhered to the seroepidemiological investigation protocol for SARS-CoV-2 infection outlined by the World Health Organization [11]. All procedures implemented in this study were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and complied with Brazilian guidelines and standards for research involving human subjects.
Mariana and Ouro Preto, two neighboring medium-sized cities situated in the Serra do Espinhaço region of Minas Gerais, Brazil, are part of the Iron Quadrangle, recognized as the country's primary iron ore production hub. Given their unique historical, sociodemographic, and geographical attributes distinct from other Brazilian municipalities, coupled with the potential discrepancy in infection prevalence data from surveys conducted in different regions, it becomes imperative to delve into the local epidemic dynamics of these cities.
Established in 1696, Mariana holds the distinction of being the inaugural village in Minas Gerais. Boasting a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.742, the town's primary economic driver is the extraction of iron ore, a robust source of employment opportunities and public income [12,13].
Founded in 1711, Ouro Preto was designated as the capital of the newly established province of Minas Gerais in 1720 [14]. With a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.741, the municipality's primary economic sectors include mining, metallurgy, tourism, and services, particularly those associated with the Federal Institution of Higher Education located within the city. These industries contribute to significant population mobility, driven by the influx of workers and students [12].
Residents aged 18 years or older living in permanent households within the urban areas of Ouro Preto and Mariana were deemed eligible for inclusion in this study. Based on data from the 2010 demographic census, Ouro Preto had a population of 44,569 individuals residing in 17,753 households, while Mariana had 33,902 inhabitants distributed among 14,078 households [12]. The protocols implemented and outlined below were consistent across both municipalities.
The sample size calculation was determined by the population estimate for each city, factoring in a confidence level of 95%, a design effect of 1.5, and the parameters outlined in Table 1, which also details the sample distribution by survey stage. To account for potential losses due to refusals, absence of selected residents, and closed households during visits, an additional 20% was included for sample recomposition in each city.
A three-stage conglomerate sampling design was implemented, starting with the selection of census sectors for all three stages of the survey in a random and non-repetitive manner. Subsequently, households were chosen through a systematic sampling process. Finally, residents were selected randomly using the "Sorteador de Nomes®" application.
The data collection team comprised researchers, interviewers, and phlebotomists. Interviewers were recruited from academic circles, primarily students enrolled in undergraduate or graduate programs. Candidates underwent interviews to assess their availability and interest. Upon selection, students were provided with a digital document and a video outlining the research objectives.
The interviewers were divided into teams overseen by the six researchers. Each team underwent online training led by the coordinators/researchers, covering project objectives, data collection methodology, and distribution of the interview questionnaire. Following this, in-person training sessions were held for the interviewers at the Medical School of the Federal University of Ouro Preto. These sessions focused on familiarizing the interviewers with the digital questionnaire (Appendix 1), instructing them on approaching interviewees, discussing ethical considerations, and ensuring biosafety protocols during data collection.
During the face-to-face training sessions, the research team and the medical infectologist overseeing the team's biosafety were in attendance. The health status of the interviewers was monitored through regular assessments conducted before the commencement of each survey phase. This monitoring involved the completion of health questionnaires in conjunction with the analysis of serological test results, specifically focusing on the immunochromatography reaction.
The phlebotomists were provided with digital documents and videos elucidating the significance of their role and the research methodology. Subsequently, in a follow-up session, these professionals underwent in-person training conducted by a nurse, focusing on the venipuncture technique for blood collection and emphasizing biosafety measures.
The project's thematic videos were distributed to community health agents tasked with assisting coordinators in the census sectors of the most socially vulnerable areas, randomly chosen during the initial survey stage in both cities. These videos were designed in a language easily understood by the intended audience, focusing on the specific responsibilities of each professional within the data collection team.
The data collection process involved listing and approaching households, recruiting participants, collecting venous blood, and conducting interviews. These activities were conducted over weekends (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) to facilitate the involvement of residents who were employed during the week, thereby improving the representativeness of the population group under study.
In the week leading up to data collection, the research team conducted household enrollment in pre-selected census sectors and devised strategies to enhance community awareness. This involved distributing informational folders and posters in public spaces, as well as promoting the survey through various channels such as local radio stations, social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, the University TV network, WhatsApp groups, and during religious gatherings.
An informative leaflet was affixed to the door of randomly chosen households, signifying their selection for the upcoming data collection scheduled for the weekend. To account for potential losses due to refusals or inaccessible households, neighboring households on the left and right of the selected ones also received informative leaflets (see Appendix 2).
On the days designated for data collection, the entire field team convened at a designated support location, where they equipped themselves with personal protective gear, received comprehensive instructions, and were briefed on the specific census sectors to be covered that day. Subsequently, the teams proceeded to the designated census sectors, with each interviewer approaching households under the direct supervision of the researchers to select an adult for the interview. In instances where a household was closed, the selected resident was absent, or a refusal was encountered, the team would then approach the neighboring household to the right. If unsuccessful there, they would proceed to the household on the left of the initially selected one. If refusals persisted or no residents were present, the team would move on to the next selected household without revisiting closed homes.
Following the presentation of the research process and the participants' agreement, they were requested to provide their signature on the informed consent form. Subsequently, a phlebotomist conducted a venipuncture in the antecubital fossa region to collect venous blood, with the participant comfortably seated and their arm appropriately supported. The blood collection involved the use of a 7.5 mL S-Monovette® (Sarstedt) serum gel tube to obtain serum for the COVID-19 rapid test and other biochemical analyses. Additionally, a 2.7 mL S-Monovette® (Sarstedt) collection tube containing sodium fluoride/EDTA was utilized to collect whole blood for molecular biology analyses.
Following the completion of the blood collection procedure, the interviewer initiated a face-to-face interview that typically spanned between 30 to 45 minutes, contingent upon the interviewee's responsiveness and proficiency in addressing the inquiries posed. The data gathering phase was facilitated through the utilization of the DataGoal® application, which had been integrated into tablets to record the geographic coordinates (specifically latitude and longitude) corresponding to the interviewee's place of residence.
All recommendations outlined in the national protocols to combat the novel coronavirus were diligently implemented, placing particular emphasis on practices such as frequent hand washing and the utilization of personal protective equipment including aprons, caps, disposable surgical masks, and goggles, all of which were changed at the commencement of each shift. Researchers were advised to engage with study participants primarily in the peridomestic setting, and in cases where this was not feasible, interactions were conducted in spacious, well-ventilated rooms as recommended [16].
During the interviews, interviewers maintained a minimum distance of 1.5 meters from the interviewees, with physical contact limited solely to the moment of collecting biological material.
The face-to-face interview involved the administration of an electronic questionnaire containing registration data, sociodemographic and economic variables, lifestyle habits, general health condition, mental health status, sleep patterns, and dietary information (see Appendix 1).
Registration data collected for this study included information on sex, individual taxpayer registry (CPF) number, filiation, date of birth, telephone number, and symptoms experienced in the last 15 days.
Sociodemographic and economic variables examined in this study include race/color, marital status, filiation, education, occupation, and family income both before and during the pandemic.
Lifestyle factors encompass routine activities, behaviors, sun exposure, and participation in religious celebrations both before and during the pandemic.
Health conditions were assessed through various measures including self-perception of health, the presence of physical pain, medication and supplement usage, weight, height, and perception of COVID-19.
Mental health was evaluated through the assessment of anxiety and depression symptoms utilizing the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) [17] and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [18] scales.
Sleep habits were assessed through the utilization of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scale [19].
The study examined various factors related to food and nutrition, including the daily frequency of food consumption, perceived food prices, comfort food consumption, food accessibility, and the availability of food at home. These factors were adapted from the research conducted as part of the Surveillance of Chronic Diseases by Telephone Inquiry - VIGITEL, which is overseen by the Ministry of Health [20].
The inquiries regarding personal information were designed to gather data necessary for registering and reporting serological test outcomes to the Ministry of Health via the electronic epidemiological surveillance system for notifications to the Unique Health System (e-SUS VE). This process aids in monitoring and analyzing the COVID-19 epidemiological landscape within municipalities. Additionally, other inquiries focused on evaluating the living conditions of the populace, enabling a comprehensive situational analysis of health determinants.
Data collection was conducted utilizing offline devices, and upon completion of each day's data gathering, the devices were synchronized in a location with a reliable internet connection. Subsequently, the gathered information was transmitted to the storage cloud of the software employed, namely DataGoal®. Following this process, the devices were prepared for utilization on the subsequent day of data collection.
At the conclusion of each shift (morning and afternoon), blood samples underwent inspection, were carefully packed in a thermal container, and subsequently conveyed to the Epidemiology Laboratory at the Medical School of the Federal University of Ouro Preto for processing and preservation by the skilled technical team. Within the laboratory setting, the serum tubes underwent centrifugation at 2500 rpm for a duration of 15 minutes, resulting in an approximate yield of 3 mL of serum per sample. Subsequently, the serum was divided into distinct polypropylene tubes, with one tube containing a 50 μL aliquot designated for COVID-19 testing, while the remaining aliquots ranged from approximately 500 μL to 1000 μL for utilization in other biochemical analyses. These aliquots were then stored in a freezer at -80ºC until necessitated. The EDTA tube, on the other hand, was preserved in a -20 °C freezer for subsequent genetic material extraction purposes.
Serological screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was conducted by trained professionals utilizing immunochromatographic reaction-based tests. The One Step COVID-2019 Test (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech®, China) was employed for the qualitative determination of IgM/IgG antibodies in whole blood, serum, or human plasma, without differentiation between the immunoglobulin types [21].
In this study, following the manufacturer's guidelines, 10 μL of serum and three drops of the buffer solution were introduced into the reaction well of the test device. Through capillary action, the sample was absorbed and combined with the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-dye conjugate, which then traversed the pre-coated membrane. In instances where the SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in the sample met or exceeded the specified cut-off range (the test's minimum detection threshold), antibodies that had bonded with the antigen-dye conjugate were captured by the human anti-IgG antibody and the anti-μ-chain antibody complex. These antibodies were then immobilized in the test region of the device, resulting in the appearance of a colored test band, indicative of a positive outcome.
When the level of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody in the sample fell below the designated cut-off point, no visible colored band was observed in the test region of the device, signifying a negative result. To ensure the validity of the procedure, a colored line appeared in the control region, confirming the proper functioning of the test. The designated waiting period for reading the results ranged from a minimum of 15 minutes to a maximum of 20 minutes.
Based on the manufacturer's validation data, the One Step COVID-2019 Test (Wondfo®) demonstrated a sensitivity of 86.43% (95% CI: 82.58%–89.58%) and a specificity of 99.57% (95% CI: 97.92%–99.92%). It is crucial to emphasize that negative results do not definitively rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection, while positive results should not be solely relied upon as conclusive evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Rather, these findings simply suggest a prior exposure to the infectious agent [19].
Following the serological testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, individual reports were generated and distributed to all study participants. These reports functioned as informative documents for both the participants themselves and the COVID-19 Confrontation Committees within the respective municipalities.
The reports were generated by laboratory professionals using Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets. These reports included details such as the participant's full name, date of birth, and contact phone number, along with the results of the serological test (reactive or non-reactive). Furthermore, the reports provided information on how to interpret the test results, outlined necessary precautions, and included contact information for Health Surveillance Departments in each city. This allowed study participants to seek clarification and guidance on the recommended procedures, particularly those individuals who tested positive.
The reports were disseminated within seven days following data collection, in a PDF format, through the WhatsApp messaging application. Participants who were not adept at using the application received their results via telephone, while those without access to a telephone had the report hand-delivered to their residence.
The Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets containing the participants' data and test results were subsequently transmitted to the Health Secretariats of Mariana and Ouro Preto for the purpose of case monitoring and management.
At the conclusion of the data collection period, the database underwent consolidation through the merging of the three survey stages conducted in the two cities. Subsequently, a consistency analysis was performed to validate the data's coherence, identify typing errors, and ensure data completeness. The sample weight for each selected unit (census tract, household, and individual) was computed separately for each city, factoring in the inverse of the selection probability as outlined in the study's sampling plan and referencing data from the 2010 demographic census. An adjustment was implemented to address interview losses due to non-response, and the household and resident weights were calibrated to align the population totals by sex and age group (18 to 29 years, 30 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, and 60 years and older) with the 2019 population projections from DATASUS for consistency.
The study calculated the relative frequencies of sociodemographic variables at each survey stage (1, 2, and 3) across all cities. Seropositivity rates for SARS-Cov-2 and their 95% confidence intervals were determined for each survey stage and city, as well as for both cities combined. Pearson's Chi-square test was employed to compare sociodemographic variable proportions and seropositivity rates between survey stages. The analyses incorporated weighting factors using the svy command in Stata® software version 12.0. A significance level of 95% (P≤0.05) was utilized for all statistical comparisons.
The study's funder did not participate in the study's design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, or report writing. The corresponding author had complete access to all study data and bore the ultimate responsibility for deciding to submit the findings for publication.
The project received approval from the Research Ethics Committee (Certificate of Ethics Submission No. 32815620.0.1001.5149). All procedures undertaken in this study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and complied with Brazilian guidelines and standards for research involving human subjects.
A total of 5,252 households were approached, with 2,523 (48.0%) located in Mariana and 2,713 (52.0%) in Ouro Preto. Among these households, 1,912 (36.4%) were found to be closed, 1,079 (20.5%) had residents who refused to participate, 267 (5.1%) had selected residents who were absent, and 1,762 (33.5%) households had residents who agreed to take part in the study. Specifically, 764 (43.4%) households from Mariana and 998 (56.6%) from Ouro Preto agreed to participate, as outlined in Table 2.
In both cities, 51.9% of the interviewees were female, with a majority falling within the age range of 35 to 59 years old (47.2%). Additionally, 51.5% of the participants were married, 67.9% identified as black or mulatto, 71.5% had more than nine years of schooling, and 61.2% reported a family income exceeding two minimum wages. Notably, there were no significant variations in the distribution of sociodemographic factors across different stages of the survey, as illustrated in Table 3.
Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of census sectors within urban areas at each survey stage, based on IBGE data. This distribution accounts for the proportional representation of households and average income, ensuring the inclusion of diverse socioeconomic levels in both the final sample and at each survey stage.
The worldwide prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection stood at 5.5%, with rates of 6.2% in Ouro Preto and 4.7% in Mariana.
The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of Covid-19 pose significant diagnostic challenges, necessitating the adoption of techniques capable of ruling out potential infections, confirming recent infections, identifying past infections, and evaluating the immune response. Understanding the prevalence of the virus is crucial for implementing appropriate containment measures. The World Health Organization advises against using rapid tests for detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings due to the delayed antibody response post-symptom onset. However, these tests are valuable in population studies for identifying previous exposure and understanding the distribution of the virus among different populations. Immunochromatographic tests for antibody detection are cost-effective and easy to administer, making them useful in controlling disease transmission, although they should not replace standard diagnostic tests like RT-PCR. A review on the efficacy of immunochromatographic antibody tests in seroprevalence surveys revealed an increasing accuracy in diagnosing COVID-19 within the first three weeks of symptom onset, with sensitivity rates of 30% in the first week, 70% in the second week, and over 90% in the third week, with a low false-positive rate of 2%. Notably, these serology tests perform better with serum or plasma samples, particularly in terms of diagnostic sensitivity.
The timing of sample collection post-exposure emerges as a critical variable affecting the identification of positive cases in serological population studies, potentially elucidating the seroprevalence disparities between Mariana and Ouro Preto in this investigation. Notably, the prevalence rates in these locales within the Inconfidentes region during October to December 2020 surpassed those reported in a population-based survey in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, conducted from April 11 to May 11, 2020, where prevalence remained below 1% [27]. Conversely, these findings closely align with data from northeastern Brazilian states during a national household survey spanning May 14 to June 7, 2020, revealing substantial regional variations in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence across the country [28].
The literature suggests that variations in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates across regions and population groups can be attributed to multiple factors. These include differences in the stage of infections, inadequate testing leading to late case detection, varying adoption of control measures like movement restrictions, local sociodemographic and socioeconomic profiles, as well as environmental and meteorological elements such as humidity and air pollution [4,29].
The limitations of our study are evident, primarily stemming from the sample's confinement to two medium-sized Brazilian cities, accounting for just 12.2% of the country's municipalities. Excluding residents in rural areas further narrows the scope. While the refusal rate aligned with projections, the response rate of 33.5% falls below the benchmarks set by national surveys in Brazil (53-54%) and Spain (60%) [28,30]. Compounding this, in 41.5% of households, data collection was hindered by the absence of residents.
Further studies associated with this project will be conducted to delve deeper into the health status of the studied population concerning social isolation and the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with the socioeconomic repercussions stemming from these factors. Consequently, beyond merely gauging the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 within the populace, the outcomes of this research enable a comprehensive comprehension of the patterns and characteristics of diseases prevalent in the community and their potential influencers. This, in turn, aids in enhancing healthcare services, be it within the Unified Health System or the private healthcare sector.
The findings of this study will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of social disparities within the cities under investigation, thereby facilitating the development and implementation of public policies aimed at reducing these inequalities and mitigating their adverse effects on the health, nutrition, and overall well-being of the populace.
Despite the inherent limitations in the diagnostic efficacy of the rapid serological test for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, its utilization has proven effective in verifying the seroprevalence of viral infections in the evaluated cities. This has enabled researchers to assess the virus's circulation and determine the percentage of individuals exposed, offering a foundation for public managers to make informed decisions within a socio-health and epidemiological framework aimed at reducing cases and fatalities. Additionally, the study's findings are crucial in providing insights into the socio-economic and health repercussions on the population resulting from social distancing measures.
New surveys are imperative to comprehend the evolving pandemic landscape, particularly in these novel phases. It is crucial to incorporate rapid antigen tests, which were not accessible during the initial wave of the disease. Furthermore, genotyping is essential to pinpoint the prevailing viral strains and their transmission patterns within the community.
