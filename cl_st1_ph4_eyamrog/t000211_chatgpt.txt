The emergence of the New Coronavirus Epidemic (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, primarily manifests as pulmonary pneumonia following symptoms of fever, cough, and myalgia. As the virus spread globally and hospitalizations surged, a notable observation was made regarding severe COVID-19 cases, revealing significant laboratory abnormalities including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated D-dimer levels. These hematological changes have emerged as critical indicators influencing mortality and morbidity rates among infected individuals, prompting a surge in studies delving into the pathophysiology, particularly the hematological aspects, of the disease. Recent research has highlighted the propensity of SarsCoV-2 infection to induce a prothrombotic state in hospitalized patients, increasing the risk of thrombotic or arterial events within this population. Consequently, this study aims to explore the response of Angiology and Vascular Surgery departments amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, collating insights ranging from current vascular service protocols to the roles of vascular surgeons and angiologists in the clinical and surgical care of infected and non-infected patients. By synthesizing existing literature, this work seeks to provide guidance and clarity to this specialty within the unique challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus. The selection of relevant studies was based on search criteria encompassing terms such as “Coronavirus and venous thrombosis,” “Coronavirus and thrombosis,” “COVID-19 and venous thrombosis,” and “COVID-19 Coronavirus and thrombosis.”
COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by the newly identified coronavirus subtype Sars-CoV-2, originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As of the preparation of this manuscript, it has affected over two million individuals globally, as reported by the World Health Organization.
The disease exhibits a wide clinical spectrum, manifesting either asymptomatically or as a flu-like syndrome characterized by symptoms like fever, cough, and myalgia. In certain instances, it progresses to severe pneumonia or even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Laboratory changes such as lymphopenia, neutrophilia, increased prothrombin time, and elevated D-dimer (DD) are indicative of an unfavorable disease course in patients. A study conducted by Zhou et al. with 191 patients from Jinyintan Hospitals and the Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital revealed that advanced age, higher SOFA score, and DD levels exceeding 1 μg/mL upon admission were linked to a heightened risk of mortality. Notably, around 90% of hospitalized pneumonia patients exhibited hypercoagulability. The research also posited potential mechanisms contributing to the systemic alterations observed in these individuals, including the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines known to mediate atherosclerosis and directly contribute to plaque rupture through local inflammation, the activation of pro-coagulant factors, and hemodynamic shifts that increase susceptibility to ischemia and thrombosis.
Hospitalized and critically ill patients exhibit hematological changes, such as elevated D-dimer (DD) levels, indicating potential coagulation abnormalities. Nevertheless, the association between the Sars-Cov-2 virus and coagulation mechanisms remains inadequately investigated in recent research. Han et al.5 illustrated that patients with COVID-19 displayed reduced levels of antithrombin, a natural anticoagulant, alongside elevated DD and other fibrin degradation products (FDP) compared to healthy controls. This suggests an altered blood coagulation profile in COVID-19 patients, with FDP, including DD, potentially serving as predictive markers for disease progression. Consequently, routine monitoring of these markers is recommended, aligning with findings from Tang, Li, Wang, and Sun6. Given the presumed prothrombotic state in many COVID-19 patients, there has been a significant surge in the demand for laboratory tests to assess coagulation parameters, vascular ultrasound examinations, and other imaging modalities. This study aims to compile insights on the standard practices of vascular specialists and reference centers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing search terms like "Coronavirus and venous thrombosis," "Coronavirus and thrombosis," "COVID-19 and venous thrombosis," and "COVID-19 Coronavirus and thrombosis."
Recent studies have highlighted the heightened risk of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 hospitalized patients, posing a significant challenge to Angiology and Vascular Surgery Departments worldwide. The surge in demand for computed tomography (CT) scans and echo-color-Doppler (ECD) for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in these patients has necessitated a thorough review of evidence concerning VTE diagnosis and treatment. Adapting clinical algorithms and flowcharts to the current global scenario has become imperative. Furthermore, careful consideration is essential when making therapy recommendations for these patients, particularly regarding the use of anticoagulants in those requiring invasive ventilation, given the associated bleeding risks. Continual reassessment of the risk-benefit balance throughout the clinical course is crucial.
In response to this situation, the University of Michigan Health System conducted a comprehensive study on the establishment of a temporary committee comprising VTE specialists, vascular surgeons, and clinic representatives to evaluate existing management protocols within the institution. This committee collaborated with experts from various fields including pulmonology, hematology, and medical clinics to devise and implement a new action plan aimed at enhancing patient care during the pandemic. To determine the appropriateness of VTE prophylaxis, patients were evaluated using the Caprini score upon hospital admission. While data on VTE incidence in COVID-19 positive patients remains limited, existing evidence suggests a decrease in mortality rates among patients with significantly elevated DD levels (> 3 times the upper normal limit) who receive thromboprophylaxis with NFH or LMWH heparin. Furthermore, VTE and primary pulmonary thrombosis are potential underlying causes of mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Given these insights and the low risk of bleeding associated with thromboprophylaxis in less critical patients, the study committee recommends the routine use of thromboprophylaxis for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, irrespective of their risk stratification.
Regarding the suspected diagnosis of PE, Obi et al examined two variables: the modified Wells score and the intubation status of the patient.
The study does not advocate for the utilization of ECD to dismiss the diagnosis of PE due to its limited accuracy. Negative DD in conjunction with a low modified Wells score were deemed adequate for excluding the diagnosis. Nevertheless, in the setting of Sars-Cov-2 infection, which elevates DD values, its efficacy is compromised, though this does not imply that its values should be disregarded.
In intubated patients without SARS, there is a dearth of data regarding the risk-benefit ratio of empirical anticoagulation strategies. The team considered administering anticoagulants at doses lower than the full dose but higher than the prophylactic dose in patients with SARS, drawing from their past experience during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. However, this particular strategy has not been evaluated in the current scenario.
The Michigan Medicine team recommends utilizing the Wells score for suspected DVT, despite acknowledging its limitations within the hospital setting. However, its efficacy in the context of pandemic pneumonia has not been extensively validated on a large scale.
The dosage of D-dimer should not serve as the primary criterion for ordering imaging tests, given its anticipated elevation in COVID-19 cases. Instead, healthcare providers should assess other clinical indicators of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) before considering the necessity of such diagnostic procedures for a conclusive diagnosis.
The Michigan Medicine team addresses the issue of long-term anticoagulant therapy in their recommendations. For patients unable to undergo imaging tests for diagnostic purposes during the COVID-19 outbreak, they suggest treatment with direct oral anticoagulants or vitamin K antagonists for one to two months post-hospital discharge, until imaging can be performed. Patients deemed to be at moderate to high risk for PE should undergo a CT scan within a month of testing negative for COVID-19, while those at high risk for DVT should have a lower limb ECD requested once they are COVID-19 negative. It is advised that all patients receive ongoing follow-up and guidance regarding the long-term duration of therapy.
Casini et al. (9) advocate for the administration of pharmacoprophylaxis to all COVID-19 hospitalized patients, unless medically contraindicated. They propose the utilization of LMWH for individuals with a creatinine clearance exceeding 30 mL/min and NFH for those with clearance below 30 mL/min, with dosage adjustments for patients weighing over 100 kg. The authors also recommend regular monitoring, either daily or two to three times weekly, encompassing prothrombin time, DD, fibrinogen, platelet count, LDH, creatinine, and ALT levels. Additionally, they suggest assessing antithrombin levels in cases of DIC, sepsis-induced coagulopathy, or heparin resistance, and anti-Xa activity in specific instances. In critical care settings, therapeutic doses of NFH or LMWH may be warranted for patients displaying elevated DD levels, severe inflammation, or indications of hepatic or renal impairment.
In Italy, Marietta et al. (10) conducted a study that provides recommendations for managing hemostasis in patients with COVID-19.
In the management of confirmed patients, it is imperative that laboratory monitoring encompasses hemostatic function, platelet count, and DVT testing, whenever feasible.
Prophylactic doses of fondaparinux, LMWH, or NFH are highly recommended for all hospitalized patients, with mechanical prophylaxis (such as limb compression) being a suitable alternative if the former options are not feasible.
Pharmacoprophylaxis should be administered throughout the entire hospitalization period and continued for seven to 14 days post-discharge, or initiated during the pre-hospital phase in cases where there are persistent or pre-existing VTE risk factors.
Intermediate doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be deemed appropriate for patients presenting with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE).
Therapeutic doses of LMWH or NFH are typically recommended solely for patients diagnosed with VTE or as a bridging strategy for those already on oral anticoagulants. This is due to the potential for oral anticoagulants to significantly interfere with the antiretroviral treatment of patients with COVID-19.
When administering full doses to patients, it is imperative to carefully assess the dosage of anti-Xa factor or oral anticoagulants present in the plasma.
It is important to acknowledge that multiple studies have indicated that patients with COVID-19 exhibit a state of hypercoagulability, suggesting that the pulmonary microembolism index may be higher than currently documented. Consequently, there is a likelihood that pulmonary embolism (PE) may already be present in numerous patients prior to hospital admission, potentially explaining the reduced efficacy of thromboprophylaxis within the hospital setting.
Testa et al. (13), hailing from Cremona, Italy, have elucidated the protocol employed at their hospital for transitioning patients with COVID-19 from oral to parenteral anticoagulants.
In response to the surge in hospitalizations required to accommodate the influx of critically ill COVID-19 patients, numerous hospital units faced the necessity of reorganizing their services.
The Vascular Surgery Unit at a tertiary hospital in Singapore has redeployed 25% of its staff to the frontline of pandemic care. This restructuring was deemed necessary due to the heightened demand for healthcare professionals across all specialties during this critical period, as well as the imperative to provide surgical interventions for patients exhibiting symptoms of Sars-CoV-2 infection. To ensure the continued operation of emergency and elective Vascular Surgery Services, two to three surgeons remained at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, while the remaining team members were stationed at the National Center for Infectious Diseases, tending to COVID-19 cases. Noteworthy measures implemented include:
The suspension of non-essential meetings and the continued utilization of digital platforms have been implemented as strategies to adapt to the current circumstances.
Essential meetings should be limited to a maximum of ten individuals, with strict adherence to mask-wearing and maintaining a one-meter distance between participants. Furthermore, daily visits should be conducted with a small group of individuals, ensuring that patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are attended to by a single designated team member.
The outpatient vascular surgery procedure is specifically designated for diabetic foot care, necessitating a review of care requirements every two to three weeks leading up to the scheduled surgery date for individuals in need of the operation or those experiencing symptoms.
The postponement of consultations for chronic patients should be accompanied by measures to ensure the continuous supply of medications and the provision of home delivery services.
The maintenance of elective surgeries should prioritize procedures that directly enhance patients' quality of life, reduce mortality rates, or mitigate the risk of amputation.
Screening for symptoms indicative of COVID-19 infection in surgical patients upon admission and promptly referring positive cases to the emergency department.
In the operative procedure, additional measures include ensuring the team remains present outside the operating room during both the induction of anesthesia and the recovery process.
The research emphasizes the importance of utilizing personal protective equipment (PPE) during surgical procedures, including an N95 mask or air purifying respirator, goggles, sterile waterproof suits, and a double layer of sterile gloves. It is recommended that the surgical team be kept as small as possible. The study highlights the air-purifying respirator as the preferred choice for surgeries lasting over 3 hours due to its enhanced comfort for the surgeon. Additionally, vascular surgeons need to be mindful of the challenges posed by using magnifying surgical loupes in conjunction with PPE when operating on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, particularly during the removal and cleaning processes.
The Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Section of the Heart Institute of Minneapolis implemented significant changes in response to the COVID pandemic, aligning with the guidelines set forth by the American College of Surgeons. Elective procedures were largely postponed, with only essential surgeries proceeding to safeguard patients' life and limb integrity. A database was established to track postponed procedures for future rescheduling, ensuring they are not overlooked. Additionally, outpatient visits were transitioned to telephone consultations to minimize in-person interactions and reduce the need for reviewing medical records and imaging exams, thereby safeguarding the clinical staff.
In Italy, the Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery at Hospital San Giovanni di Dio in Florence implemented a reorganization protocol, establishing a Surgical Vascular Sector specifically for urgent cases of COVID-19. Key measures included:
The suspension of all varicose vein surgeries, as well as office and emergency activities, has been implemented.
Centralization of aneurysm and symptomatic carotid artery procedures, as well as vascular surgery for correcting critical limb ischemia (CLI) and creating arteriovenous fistulas for hemodialysis, are crucial aspects of specialized medical care.
The prioritization of endovascular treatment over bypass procedures aims to reduce the requirement for an anesthesiologist in the operating room.
During this period, asymptomatic carotid lesions were referred to a private hospital equipped to conduct the necessary procedures.
In response to urgent cases of hemodynamically stable COVID-19 patients, whether confirmed or suspected, from peripheral hospitals, a COVID-19-dedicated Surgical Sector has been established. This sector is distinct from other operational areas, with a wing that has been isolated and converted into both an operating room and ICU beds. Additionally, there is an emergency transfer area equipped with an exclusive elevator to facilitate efficient and safe patient movement within the facility.
The standardization of the professionals' equipping sequence involves surgeons entering a designated room to don personal protective equipment (PPE), which includes an N95 mask, goggles, face shield, sterile waterproof suits, foot protectors, and two pairs of surgical gloves. Subsequently, the surgeons proceed to the operating room within the COVID-19 area, where they apply an alcoholic solution to the second pair of gloves, don a sterile gown, and add an extra pair of sterile surgical gloves. Upon completion of the surgery, the surgeons follow a structured process akin to a production line, moving to a room situated in front of the operating room to safely remove the PPE under the supervision of a trained operator.
Postoperative evaluation was conducted by two doctors, with one doctor utilizing personal protective equipment (PPE) to directly interact with the patient while the other doctor remained outside the room. This approach was deemed necessary to maintain an "uncontaminated" environment and minimize the risk of cross-contamination within the healthcare team.
Some surgeons opted to alternate staying in their homes for a few days to ensure a pool of uninfected professionals available for immediate deployment in emergencies or to substitute for infected colleagues across various specialties.
The established care algorithm implemented a distinct segregation between COVID and non-COVID hospitals, initiating with a mandatory test for all admitted patients as the primary measure to reorganize and streamline care amidst the outbreak.
An increasing focus in studies is directed towards gaining a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying the deterioration of critically ill COVID-19 patients, with the goal of defining more effective therapies and enhancing clinical monitoring during their hospitalization. Numerous clinical investigations have highlighted the significance of the "inflammatory cytokine storm" as a key mechanism contributing to the exacerbation and mortality rates in COVID-19 patients. Notably, one study demonstrated significantly elevated levels of IL-6 in critically ill patients compared to milder cases, underscoring the role of this cytokine in various pathophysiological processes such as vascular leakage, complement activation, coagulation cascade induction, and in rare instances, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Furthermore, the study indicated that the administration of LMWH could ameliorate coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19 patients due to its anti-inflammatory properties, potentially mitigating or reversing the cytokine storm and thereby improving patient outcomes, supporting its therapeutic potential. A research endeavor at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York sought to deepen the understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology by analyzing pulmonary and skin biopsy samples, as well as autopsies from five severely affected individuals. Their findings suggested that some critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 experienced a widespread thrombotic microvascular injury mediated by intense complement activation. While the limited scope of their study precludes broad generalizations, there is a suspicion that a subgroup of critically ill COVID-19 patients may exhibit microvascular lesions alongside their pro-coagulant state, potentially contributing to the unfavorable outcomes observed in many cases. This underscores the potential critical role of the complement system in the pathogenesis of the disease, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.
Despite the growing body of literature on the relationship between COVID-19 and prothrombotic conditions in patients, there remains a lack of comprehensive studies linking VTE specifically to COVID-19 infection. However, Cui et al.23 conducted a retrospective analysis of 81 critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in the ICU, revealing a 25% incidence of VTE. Similarly, Klok et al.24 reported a high incidence of 31% of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, even with thrombosis prophylaxis in place. Middeldorp et al.25 emphasized the elevated risk of VTE in COVID-19 patients, particularly those in ICU settings, suggesting a proactive screening strategy with diagnostic tests at a low threshold. Collaboration between local professionals in Angiology and Vascular Surgery is crucial to enhance collective procedures, care protocols, and service adaptations during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This joint effort is essential for improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare delivery in this challenging clinical scenario.
COVID-19 has been identified as a potential risk factor for both venous and arterial thromboembolic diseases, primarily attributed to heightened inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Consequently, it is imperative to implement risk stratification protocols for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in all hospitalized patients, utilizing tools like the Caprini8 score. Additionally, it is essential to incorporate complementary scoring systems to assess the risk of bleeding in these individuals.
Thromboprophylaxis is deemed essential for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, unless contraindicated, with therapy selection and duration contingent upon the patient's clinical status and hospital unit protocol, aligning with guidelines from Hemostasis and Thrombosis Societies. However, the data on post-discharge thromboprophylaxis for COVID-19 patients remains insufficient, lacking consensus. The decision to administer it and determining the D-dimer cutoff point guiding its application should be individualized, considering the risk of thrombotic or bleeding events. This assessment should be conducted in accordance with institutional protocols founded on robust prior evidence.
In light of the vascular and hematological complications associated with Sars-CoV-2 infection, it is imperative for vascular surgery departments to adapt their practices by developing or revising algorithms and protocols. These adjustments are necessary to ensure the continued provision of care, albeit under restricted conditions, amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic.
