The emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2, originating in China in late 2019, swiftly escalated to pandemic proportions. Accurate mathematical models are essential for predicting the evolution of outbreaks, enabling governments and local authorities to implement measures aimed at mitigating public health impacts. Amidst the prevailing uncertainties surrounding parameters within the SIR model, our study focuses on analyzing the trajectory of the death rate coefficient in Italy, the USA, and Brazil. Empirical evidence suggests a decreasing trend in this coefficient over time.
The COVID-19 pandemic, stemming from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 in Hubei, China, remains shrouded in uncertainty regarding the exact origins and initial patient zero. Rapidly spreading globally due to its high contagion rate, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic in March 2020. In this context, the utilization of mathematical models plays a pivotal role in forecasting and guiding governmental and local responses to mitigate potential harm to populations and healthcare systems. These models, predominantly based on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) framework and its variations, faced significant challenges early on due to uncertainties surrounding crucial parameters like infection and mortality rates. Predictions, such as those from the Imperial College London model in March 2020, initially overestimated the potential death tolls in countries like the UK and the USA. As the epidemic progresses, accumulating empirical data gradually reduces uncertainties in model parameters. While the ideal model for describing the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic remains uncertain, it is generally accepted that recovered individuals likely develop immunity within the considered timeframe.
In this study, we aim to analyze the evolution of the death rate coefficient µ in Italy, the USA, and Brazil. The latest data indicates a consistent decrease over time, following an exponential pattern for extended time periods. The underlying reasons for this trend remain unidentified based on current knowledge.
Commencing with the SIRD model as our foundation, the equations are articulated as follows: dS dt = −αSI, dI dt = αSI −1 τ I −µI, dR dt = 1 τ I, and dD dt = µI, where S(t), I(t), R(t), and D(t) represent the susceptible, actively infected, recovered, and deceased populations, respectively. For time scales less than 2 years, we can disregard population growth for the current analysis. Consequently, the total population P0 at t = 0 is susceptible, yet at time t, the constancy of P0 = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t) remains. The model's parameters encompass the transmission rate coefficient α, the average recovery duration τ, and the mortality rate coefficient µ, which may vary with time. Normalizing the equations by P0 yields relative values, necessitating the renormalization of the transmission rate coefficient to α' = αP0.
From equation (4), we derive µ(t) = dD(t)/dt I(t) (5), where dD(t)/dt represents the daily death rate and I(t) denotes the actively infected population. The data utilized is sourced from the website Worldometer [8], a platform that compiles information on the global coronavirus pandemic up to July 18th, 2020. In this analysis, we focus on 7-day moving averages to smooth out fluctuations, particularly those arising from delays in reporting over weekends.
The time evolution of the SARS-COV2 outbreak in the USA is depicted in Figure 1, with the starting point at t = 0 marking the day when the total number of active cases exceeded 100. In Figure 1-(a), a plateau emerges within the time interval of 80 < t < 100 days, followed by a rapid increase in active cases. Contrary to this trend, the daily deaths, represented by the death rate dD/dt, did not rise proportionally, as evidenced in Figure 1-(b). In fact, the death rate has been on a decreasing trajectory since t = 50 days. The mortality rate coefficient, derived from available data, exhibits an exponential decrease and can be effectively modeled for extended periods (t > 30 days) by an exponential function of the form µ(t) = 10−4 + 1.5 × 10−2e−t/30. Given the substantial number of asymptomatic or mildly affected individuals who may not be captured in official data, the uncertainty in the total number of deaths is significantly lower compared to that in active cases. Consequently, the absolute value of µ(t) is subject to an uncertainty spanning one or two orders of magnitude. Estimates suggest that the actual number of active cases globally could be 10 to 100 times higher than the reported figures.
Similar conclusions can be drawn from the data obtained from Brazil and Italy, as depicted in Figures 2 and 3, which also exhibit an exponential decay pattern for µ(t) over an extended time scale. The relaxation time observed in these instances is approximately 30 days. The United States and Brazil share a common characteristic of vast territorial expanse, significantly larger than that of Italy, posing challenges in applying the SIR model without accounting for spatial variations in the former two countries. Presently, the epidemic in Italy appears to be approaching its conclusion, evident from a close examination of Figures 3-(a) and 3-(b). Initially, it was believed that around 67% of the population needed to be infected to achieve herd immunity; however, recent models incorporating population heterogeneity have revised this estimate to approximately 40% or even lower. Nevertheless, the overall trend of µ(t) across the three countries remains quite similar thus far, and this behavior can be effectively represented by the equation µ(t) = A + Be−t/t0.
In further analysis, an attempt was made to model the progression of the outbreak in Italy by utilizing the function µ(t) = 10−3 + 3 × 10−2e−t/30 for the mortality rate coefficient. The parameters α′ = 0.14 and τ = 14 days were employed in equations (1)-(4), with τ chosen based on available data regarding the average recovery period. Initial conditions were normalized to I0 = 10−2, D0 = 0, R0 = 0, and a total susceptible population of P0 = 5 million for simulation purposes, aiming for a more accurate fit towards the end of the outbreak. Time evolution is depicted in Figures 4-(a) to 4-(c), while the total number of deaths was calculated by integrating equation (4) to yield Df = ∫tf0 µ(t)I(t)dt, resulting in approximately 36,000 deaths at the conclusion of the outbreak, a figure close to the actual value.
The success achieved with a straightforward model in the case of Italy prompted us to replicate the outbreak time evolution for Brazil. However, it is important to note that the results obtained should be interpreted with caution, primarily due to the vast territorial expanse of the country. Enhancements to the model, particularly incorporating geographical factors, could be implemented relatively easily. The outcomes of the SIR model simulations for Brazil are depicted in Figures 5-(a) to 5-(c), with parameters set at α′ = 0.135, τ = 14 days, I0 = 4 × 10−4, and a susceptible population of P0 = 50 million. Consequently, the projected total number of deaths may reach 120,000 by the conclusion of the outbreak, although this figure could potentially be an underestimate given the current situation in Brazil [11].
In conclusion, based on the current available data regarding the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, it appears likely that the mortality rate coefficient is decreasing gradually. The exact reasons for this trend remain unknown to the best of our knowledge; however, several hypotheses can be proposed for consideration. Firstly, the unreliability of the data, particularly during the initial stages of the outbreak in different regions, where the total number of active cases may have been significantly underestimated due to uncertainties. Secondly, natural processes, including potential mutations that could weaken the virus during transmission, might also play a role in this observed decrease.
