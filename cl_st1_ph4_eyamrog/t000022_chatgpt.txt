This article presents the findings of the Latin American Observatory of Evaluation Indicators (OLIVA, its Spanish acronym), which aims to increase the visibility of scientific production indexed in Latin America and the Caribbean and enhance its value for research assessment. The study focuses on the production published in open access by journals indexed in SciELO and Redalyc, utilizing a deduplicated database containing 908,982 documents and 2,591,704 authors. It emphasizes the scale of this production, outlining its disciplinary diversity and trends in national, regional, and international research collaboration. The analysis also delves into the publishers of the 1,720 journals within the database from 15 countries, highlighting the prevalence of universities and public institutions in this regional network. Furthermore, the study examines journals operating with the APC model, revealing a lower impact of this model compared to other continents, with Brazil standing out as the country with the highest incidence of this practice in the region. Notably, collaboration between states in Brazil, as evidenced by SciELO data, challenges the conventional view of co-authorship within the same country as academic inbreeding, demonstrating significant cross-state collaboration. Ultimately, the research concludes that these journals exhibit multi-scalar circulation, linguistic diversity, and disciplinary breadth, effectively meeting the contemporary demands of scholarly communication in the era of open science.
This research was made possible through the financial support provided by the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo (PROYECTO SIIP TIPO 4-038) and the Agencia I+D+I-Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación, Argentina (PICT 2017-2647).
The Latin American academic circuit comprises national academic communities and regional networks that were established in the mid-20th century with the backing of intergovernmental organizations, cooperation agencies, and foundations advocating for the management of scientific information as a crucial element for development. This initiative gave rise to regional institutions that collaborated closely in cataloging and constructing bibliographic indexes to enhance the dissemination of locally generated scientific knowledge (Rodriguez Garcia Coord. 2020). A significant milestone was reached in 1967 with the establishment of information centers like BIREME and research networks such as CLACSO, which swiftly evolved into major regional repositories for disseminating Latin American scientific output (Packer, 2005; Vessuri, 1994). The drive to professionalize scientific publishing was bolstered by the creation of indexing systems spearheaded by regional centers affiliated with United Nations agencies (IMLA-LILACS, DOCPAL, REPIDISCA, AGRINTER-SIDALC) and prominent public universities, notably the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (which oversaw the inception of indexes like Clase, Periódica, and later Latindex and BIBLAT). These systems, established and operated by universities, national, and intergovernmental organizations, aimed to enhance the bibliographic exchange of the region's scientific and technical output. The advent of regional open-access journal platforms like SciELO in 1998 and Redalyc in 2005 marked a significant development, creating an infrastructure supporting digitized journals and indexing web services. Together with Latindex, these platforms introduced a journal quality certification system emphasizing peer review and editorial best practices, leading to the progressive professionalization of journals and establishing an editorial standard in the region characterized by academic excellence and non-commercial open access. With a strong public orientation and the support of numerous governments, these portals and indexing services now serve as vital spaces for fostering open science (Vessuri, Cetto and Guédon, 2014; Beigel 2019; Packer, 2020; Banzato and Salatino, 2020).
The recent global report on diamond journals (Bosman et al., 2021) published by OPERAS underscores the significance of journals that do not impose charges for publishing or accessing content, highlighting Latin America's contribution to 25% of such publications worldwide. These open access journals, predominantly issued by universities and overseen by full-time professors with assistance from centralized technical support teams in libraries, play a pivotal role in the region's university publishing landscape. A key factor in this consolidation is the widespread adoption of the open-source Open Journal System (OJS-PKP) for managing editorial processes, peer reviews, and publication. Beyond university journals, scientific societies and professional associations also operate journals, often leveraging university resources for tasks like digitization, DOI acquisition, and XML markup. While the need for further support is evident, the foundational backing from institutions and governments elucidates the presence and expansion of Latin American and Caribbean journals.
The regional circuit's vibrancy is now more globally visible due to enhanced scholarly communication facilitated by mega indexes like Google Scholar, Dimensions, Lens, and the federation of repositories LA Referencia, which offers broader coverage of Latin American and Caribbean production. Despite this progress, these journals have not significantly impacted global S&T reports or evaluations of scientific careers, projects, and institutions, where traditional databases like Web of Science and Scopus, with indicators like the Impact Factor, still dominate. This situation devalues regionally indexed journals, leading research groups to favor journals managed by industry giants, a preference historically influenced by the entrenched belief in the relevance and transparency of these indicators (Martinovich, 2020). It underscores the disparity between the region's ability to produce and publish quality science and its struggle to gain international recognition for its journals (Packer and Meneghini, 2007). Numerous studies have highlighted the limitations of these traditional indicators, which, due to structural conditions, have led to abuses and distortions impacting researchers' creativity and their focus on the societal relevance of science (Guédon, 2011; Gingras, 2016; Ráfols, 2019). Consequently, internationalization policies aimed at climbing rankings often result in institutions losing autonomy and weakening their ability to engage with the research landscape.
The global consensus advocating for open access to scientific literature has drawn increased attention to the region's journals and indexing systems. In their study, Basson et al. (2021) examined the proportion of open access articles within Dimensions, revealing that by 2021, 46.6% of its documents were accessible in this manner. Interestingly, this percentage rose to 63.5% for documents originating from Latin American and Caribbean journals. Despite the scarcity of studies offering detailed insights at the document level regarding the breadth and diversity of publications in the region beyond mainstream databases, notable research exists. For instance, Miguel's (2011) study compared journal coverage from Latin America and the Caribbean across SciELO, Redalyc, and SCOPUS during the 2005-2009 period. Discrepancies in scientific production volume were observed among these sources compared to the Latindex catalog. Disciplinary coverage varied, with SCOPUS and SciELO demonstrating thematic balance, while Redalyc exhibited a stronger focus on the Social Sciences and Humanities.
Vuotto, Di Césare, and Pallotta (2020) conducted an analysis of 17 bibliographic databases, revealing that only a few databases currently provide their elements in a standardized format conducive to document-level production analysis. Consequently, existing empirical studies have been limited to analyzing journal collections separately based on the offerings of individual indexing databases. Notably, Scopus features 890 regionally published journals, while Web of Science includes 223. As of June 2021, SciELO boasts 1,358 active, indexed journals, also mirrored in the SciELO Citation Index within the Web of Science platform, facilitating a global citation performance assessment. Redalyc maintains its own information system and indicators for its collection of 1,415 journals, with significant overlap between this collection and SciELO. Additionally, Biblat operates with a distinct cataloging system, featuring a substantial number of comprehensive records at the document level. However, the lack of interoperability among these three regional indexing databases currently hinders the integration of their data. LA Referencia emerges as a crucial database, aggregating content from 790 institutions across 12 Ibero-American countries, encompassing over three million documents. Despite its significance, LA Referencia lacks advanced journal-specific search capabilities and exhibits data overlaps with previous indexing services due to its reliance on individual institutional repositories.
Moreover, a significant number of journals lack metadata at the document level, thereby impeding the comprehensive analysis of publications in Latindex journals, which, as noted by Miguel in 2011, remains the most extensive cataloging database. Compounding this issue is the absence of standardized institutional affiliations and disciplinary classifications for journals, as well as the inadequate adoption of unique author and institutional identifiers like ORCID and ROR across various databases. These deficiencies significantly constrain document-level studies, resulting in a fragmented examination of the extensive body of publications from the region.
The OLIVA project (Latin American Observatory of eVAluation Indicators) emerged within the Centro de Estudios de la Circulación del Conocimiento (CECIC-Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales) as an initiative approved and funded by the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo in early 2019. This project aims to enhance the visibility of scientific production in the region and develop indicators to assess the value of journals for individual career and institutional evaluations. Collaborating with the SciELO/FAPESP Program of Brazil, Redalyc (at the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México -UAEM Mexico), and the Consejo Latinoamericano de Ciencias Sociales (CLACSO) in the first phase, the project's initial outcomes are detailed in this paper. The second phase will involve incorporating documents from journals indexed in Latindex Catalog 2.0 and Biblat, with a pilot already in progress with these institutions.
A database comprising 1,720 scientific journals from Latin America and the Caribbean, indexed in SciELO and/or Redalyc, was established under the OLIVA framework. The study was structured into two tiers - one focusing on the journal level and the other on the document level. The primary aim was to chart the landscape of high-quality scientific literature, examining co-authorship practices, disciplinary attributes, and publication languages. Initially, the article provides an in-depth overview of the journals within the database sourced from SciELO and Redalyc. Subsequently, it delves into profiling the publishing institutions behind these journals, emphasizing their predominantly public nature and self-governance by the academic community. To classify the journals by discipline, an empirical approach was adopted using information from their respective websites due to limitations in the disciplinary cataloging provided by indexing databases. The analysis revealed a diverse coverage, with half of the documents falling under Social Sciences and Humanities, and the other half spanning Engineering, Natural Sciences, Health, and Biological Sciences. Further examination included scrutinizing co-authorship patterns across global, regional (Latin America), and national levels. Language trends were also explored, highlighting the rise of English-language publications and the emergence of multilingualism in journals venturing into publishing in multiple languages.
Turning our attention to Brazil, a country that holds a significant presence in the database with 50% of the total articles, we delve into the prevalent trend of co-authorship among Brazilian researchers. To gain deeper insights, we shift our focus to a more granular examination of the SciELO Brazil collection, which exclusively features journals from Brazil. Within this subset, we observe a pronounced inclination towards scientific collaboration among authors who are affiliated with the same country but hail from universities located in different states. This observation challenges the common assumption that collaboration within national boundaries equates to academic insularity, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of the Brazilian academic landscape.
The OLIVA project database comprises data collected from journals indexed by SciELO and Redalyc, along with revised data from published documents. Each indexing system contributed its historical database updated to June 2019. The data underwent thorough cleaning and deduplication of common journals, resulting in an integrated bibliographic database for statistical analysis. At the document level, it includes information such as document type, publication date, language, and author's country. Notably, citation data is excluded from this database as it falls beyond the project's scope.
The development of this integrated database encountered notable constraints, with the primary challenge being the absence of a standardized identification system across the indexing platforms for authors, journals, and institutional affiliations. Notably, there was a lack of gender-related information, a common omission in scientific documents and bibliographic records. Compiling the varied segments of the indexed publications from journals associated with both indexing services also presented a significant hurdle.
In light of these considerations, we chose to undertake a meticulous manual revision process for the journals. Initially, we identified journals exclusively available on either SciELO or Redalyc platforms, consolidating the metadata of these publications, encompassing articles, reviews, and editorials. This compilation included active journals at the time of data collection, as well as those previously indexed with temporal gaps in coverage. For journals present on both platforms, we observed discrepancies in coverage periods. Consequently, we meticulously compared the consistency and comprehensiveness of the data, opting to retain versions with the broadest temporal span and the highest document count. It is important to note that this phase of the project exclusively focused on journals originating from Latin America and the Caribbean.
In terms of the disciplinary classification of journals, we encountered the challenge posed by the varying classifications utilized by indexing databases, even within the context of grouping journals into scientific areas. Consequently, a single journal could be categorized across different disciplines and, consequently, different areas. To address this issue within the OLIVA database, we opted for a classification system based on the OECD and Frascati Manual criteria. The process of assigning one or more disciplines to each journal involved conducting an empirical survey, drawing from the information provided in the "Scope" or "About" section of the respective journal's official website. Subsequently, the journals were organized into eight distinct subject areas: 1) Agricultural Sciences; 2) Social Sciences; 3) Humanities; 4) Engineering and Technology; 5) Medical and Health; 6) Natural and Exact; 7) Multidisciplinary; and 8) Multidisciplinary-Social Sciences & Humanities (SSH). The presence of two categories labeled "Multidisciplinary" stems from the significant number of journals within the OLIVA database that exhibit a broad scope, transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries. Consequently, group 7 encompasses journals that span at least two subject areas, integrating both "hard" sciences and SSH. On the other hand, group 8 comprises journals that exclusively combine subject areas within the realm of Social Sciences and Humanities. This initial classification framework enabled us to mitigate inconsistencies and conduct a more precise evaluation of the disciplinary distribution among the analyzed journals.
Information regarding the publishers of each journal, along with the Article Processing Charges (APC) details, was sourced from the respective journal websites.
The OLIVA database, compiled from the archives of Redalyc and SciELO, comprises 908,982 records of publications sourced from 1,720 journals released between 1909 and May 2019 (refer to Table 1). Predominantly, articles constitute 87% of the documents, although this proportion varies across different subject areas. On average, each document features 3.1 authors, with articles typically having 3.3 authors. Notably, the prevalence of multiple authorship is more pronounced in the Exact and Natural Sciences, Engineering, and Biological Sciences, suggesting a diverse disciplinary landscape within this dataset. While one might assume that regional journals primarily publish in local languages, predominantly within the Social Sciences and Humanities due to their familiarity with vernacular languages, it becomes evident later that this corpus is multilingual.
Journals edited in Brazil constitute 29.4% of the total, contributing to 48.9% of all documents and 50.1% of articles. This dominance of Brazilian publications is further underscored by the significant number of authors, reflecting a rising inclination towards collaborative efforts involving three or more researchers, particularly in the social sciences and humanities. Following Brazilian journals in article count are those from Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Cuba, and Argentina. Journals from the remaining region account for a mere 8.7% of the articles.
The corpus of indexed Latin American scientific production spans over a century, with the oldest document dating back to 1909 and the most recent to May 2019. However, the majority of articles, 84.2%, are concentrated within the period of 2005-2018. The limited representation of documents from 2019, accounting for only 0.67% of the articles, is attributed to data collection occurring between May and June of that year, capturing only a partial year. The earliest records stem from Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, with 582 documents between 1909 and 1939, followed by the initial appearances of Revista Chilena de Pediatría in 1940, Bragantia in 1941, Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria in 1943, and Anais da Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz (now Scientia Agricola) in 1944. Subsequent introductions of journal documents from other countries include Colombia in 1969, Mexico in 1974, Argentina and Cuba in 1993, Costa Rica and Peru in 1995, Venezuela's Revista de la Facultad de Medicina in 1984, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Uruguay in 2000, Bolivia in 2001, and Panama in 2005. The first entry in Social Sciences and Humanities within the database is the Revista de Administração de Empresas in 1961, followed by the Revista Latinoamericana de Psicología in 1969.
Prior to 1942, the number of documents published annually was less than 100, a figure that increased to less than 1,000 by 1990, and less than 10,000 by 1999. The peak in publication numbers was observed in 2015, with a total of 58,025 articles. However, it is crucial to approach these statistics with caution as they may not accurately reflect the overall history of journals in Latin America and the Caribbean. Notably, our examination revealed that many older journals have incomplete digitization and limited availability of volumes predating 1998. Information is only available for 78 journals, encompassing documents published before 1998, the year SciELO was established. Consequently, the inclusion of documents prior to a journal's indexing year by that time appears to be an exceptional occurrence.
The significant growth in the number of journals and articles can be attributed to the establishment of Redalyc in 2005, particularly focusing on indexing journals within the Social Sciences. Figure 1 illustrates a peak in 2015, indicating a substantial surge compared to the somewhat plateaued article curve from 2011. The decline in the number of articles and journals per year in 2018 is a result of delays in incorporating new issues into the Redalyc and SciELO databases. These delays vary significantly among publishers and countries, stemming from various factors such as publication delays, database management issues, challenges with XML-JATS markup, and differing priorities set by publishing institutions regarding the inclusion of new issues in each database.
The evolution of journals demonstrates two notable spikes, one during 1998-2000 and another in 2005, coinciding with the launches of SciELO and Redalyc. Journals originating from Brazil play a pivotal role, evident in the substantial surge in journal numbers in 1998. This growth trajectory persists, with a climb to 198 journals in 2004 and a further increase to 324 in 2005. The publication trends in the other six countries with significant publishing activities exhibit a similar pattern, albeit less pronounced compared to Brazil (Figure 2). A significant uptick occurs in 1999-2000, aligning with SciELO's expanded outreach beyond Brazil. Notably, Mexico saw a rise from 23 journals in 1996 to 87 in 2000. The most striking escalation is observed in Colombian journals, with the count escalating from 4 to 35 during the same period.
The impact of Redalyc's emergence in 2005 is evident across various countries, particularly in Mexico and Colombia. Colombia exhibited significant growth in journal numbers over the subsequent decade, eventually surpassing Mexico, which saw a slight stagnation in journal count. Argentina, Venezuela, and Cuba displayed a similar trend with two abrupt expansions, although their growth in the following years was more moderate. Specifically, Cuban journals showed an upward trajectory from 2005 to 2015, followed by a decline. Venezuela experienced a decrease in indexed journals from 2009, accelerating notably from 2014 onwards. Chile's case stands out with a consistent growth trend, as 2005 did not trigger a sudden change in journal expansion.
An examination of the disciplinary characteristics of the journals within the OLIVA database reveals a breakdown where Social Sciences journals constitute 33% of the total, followed by Medical and Health Sciences at 19%, Humanities at 12%, and Natural and Exact Sciences at 10%. However, a closer analysis of the disciplinary distribution based on the country of publication indicates a prevalence of Social Sciences journals in countries like Uruguay, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru. Medical and Health Sciences journals hold significant representation in Cuba, Uruguay, Bolivia, Costa Rica, and Peru. Meanwhile, journals in the Natural and Exact Sciences exhibit a stronger presence in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil. Figure 3 visually represents these disciplinary areas, facilitating a comparison of their distribution in less prominent countries such as those in Central America and the Caribbean with the major players in the region.
The comparison of countries is intriguing, yet it is equally important to note the publication disparities within these nations. Scientific output tends to be centralized and focused in major cities, especially within prominent higher education institutions. Therefore, our focus lies in examining the key institutions that act as primary publishers of journals in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Within the OLIVA database comprising 1,720 journals, a notable diversity is evident through the involvement of 899 distinct publishers within the Latin American circuit. Noteworthy is the concentration of publishing activity among a select few institutions, with 38% of the total journals emanating from a mere 53 mega universities, leaving the remaining 62% to be disseminated by 846 other institutions. The distribution of publishing efforts is further elucidated in Table 2, highlighting the institutions responsible for the highest volume of journal publications.
The survey reveals that a significant portion of the journals included are affiliated with universities. Notably, major public universities like the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Universidade de São Paulo, Universidad de Costa Rica, Universidad de Chile, and the Universidad de Buenos Aires hold substantial influence. In Colombia, publishing activities are primarily concentrated in five institutions: Universidad de los Andes, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Universidad de Antioquia, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, and Universidad del Valle. Cuba presents a unique scenario, with the Editorial de Ciencias Médicas (ECIMED) emerging as the third-largest institutional publisher in terms of the number of journals listed in the OLIVA database.
The distribution of publishing institutions based on their editorial management and financing models was examined. Within SciELO and Redalyc journals, five types of publishers were identified: 1) universities; 2) scientific societies, professional associations, independent research centers, national academies, and professional councils; 3) governmental agencies such as ministry departments, museums, and publicly managed hospitals; 4) commercial publishers, which encompassed small and medium-sized national and local specialized publishers; and 5) major publishers like Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor & Francis. These major publishers were classified as oligopolistic commercial entities due to their significant control over 50% to 70% of the world's scientific production until 2013, as noted by Lariviére, Haustein, and Mongeon (2015).
Figure 4 illustrates that 66% of the journals are edited by universities, approximately 7% by governmental agencies, with scientific societies and independent research centers collectively making up 20% of the publishers, indicating a clear inclination towards academic and public management. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the distribution of commercial publishers: local or national commercial publishers accounting for 6%, and major commercial publishers for 2.5%. Notably, within the local commercial publishers, there is a prevalence of journals in medicine and health, with ECIMED's contribution standing out in this sector.
The majority of journals overseen by major commercial publishers are based in Brazil (29), with 7 in Chile, 3 in Colombia, 2 in Mexico, and 1 in Argentina. Categorized by discipline, this group (43) comprises 20 journals in Medical and Health Sciences, 14 in Exact and Natural Sciences, 5 in Engineering, 1 in Agricultural Sciences, and 3 in Social Sciences and Humanities. Forty-six percent of these journals are published exclusively in English, and 88% of them are affiliated with scientific societies that have delegated their editorial operations.
A significant aspect of the ongoing discourse on scholarly publishing revolves around the shift in the business model from subscription charges to Article Processing Charges (APC) levied on authors for publishing their papers. Our study involved collecting publication fee data from the respective journal websites, with a notable number of journals not disclosing such fees. Further investigation revealed that these journals were categorized as open access diamond journals, indicating they do not impose charges on authors for publication or on readers for content access. Among the 1,720 journals examined, 10% implemented APCs, with a majority originating from Brazil (constituting 60% of the total 182 journals with APCs). This contrasts with findings by Appel and Albagli (2019) who, in a broader analysis of Brazilian journals, noted a lower incidence of APCs. The OLIVA database highlights Brazil as spearheading the adoption of the APC business model, followed to a lesser extent by journals from Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela.
Among the journals charging Article Processing Charges (APCs), 38% are overseen by scientific societies, 37% by universities, 13% by major commercial publishers, 7% by governmental organizations, and 5% by small commercial publishers. The trend of academic community-managed journals resorting to APCs raises concerns about their sustainability and institutionalization levels. Córdoba González (2021) notes that Latin American APC-based journals generally have low fees, a pattern also evident in the OLIVA database, indicating a response to the necessity of covering editorial and peer review costs not supported by institutions. Journals listed in SciELO and Redalyc adhere to specific cataloging, evaluation, and digitization protocols demanding material and human resources, typically supplied by publishing entities. In some instances, APCs are utilized for DOI acquisition, translations, or administrative/technical assistance. However, this practice does not mirror the commercial journal business model. Notably, journals with exorbitant APCs, akin to mainstream industry standards, are rare in the region.
The sustainability of diamond open access journals is a topic of debate within the academic community. The recent OPERAS report sheds light on the significance of this model, estimating a global presence of 29,000 diamond access journals. It emphasizes the prevalent issue of weak management in these journals and proposes the implementation of a new business model (Bosman et al., 2021). Contrary to the notion that these journals operate solely on a voluntary basis, our examination of journals in SciELO and Redalyc reveals a different reality, with the majority not imposing charges for access or publication. In Latin America, there is a shared understanding regarding the necessity of national and institutional policies to ensure the sustainability and consistency of these journals, while simultaneously rejecting the adoption of the APC model (Babini and Debat, 2020). Concerns also exist about the potential for the APC model to facilitate the proliferation of predatory journals and commercialization (Córdoba González, 2021).
Collaboration emerges as a compelling and intricate phenomenon within the publications featured in the journals listed in OLIVA. Notably, a mere 25.8% of the articles are attributed to a sole author, a statistic that exhibits significant divergence across various disciplinary journals (refer to Table 3). This trend is particularly pronounced in the Humanities, where a substantial 77.2% of articles are single-authored, contrasting with the Social Sciences where this figure stands at 49.3%. Within the Humanities domain, a mere 19% of articles are co-authored by two or three individuals, with a scant 3.8% featuring more than three authors. In contrast, the Social Sciences witness a higher prevalence of collaborative efforts, with 40.8% of articles being authored by two or three individuals, and 10% involving four to eight authors. Table 3 further illustrates that Multidisciplinary SSH journals exhibit an intermediary proportion of authors in comparison to the distinct disciplinary areas.
Variations in trends within the social sciences become apparent when analyzing journals based on their country of publication. Journals originating from Brazil, Cuba, and Puerto Rico exhibit an average of 38.6% of articles authored by a single individual, a notably lower figure compared to the overall landscape. Conversely, publications in the Social Sciences from Bolivia and Ecuador are predominantly characterized by single authorship, with rates soaring to 76.8% and 77.4%, respectively. The prevalence of single authorship in journals from the remaining nine countries (excluding Panama) varies from 53.8% in Colombia to 62.4% in Mexico. In the realm of Humanities journals, similar disparities are observed, albeit to a lesser degree. For instance, in Cuba, 64.2% of articles in Humanities journals are authored by a single individual. Brazil follows closely with 70%, a figure akin to Uruguay's 70.1% and Chile's 73.6%. Argentina surpasses 80%, while Mexico and Costa Rica exhibit staggering rates of 87.6% and 89.2%, respectively.
In the realm of academic publishing, it is observed that articles within the Agricultural Sciences, Medical and Health Sciences, and Multidisciplinary fields typically feature a range of 4 to 8 authors. Conversely, publications in the Exact and Natural Sciences, as well as Engineering and Technology, tend to have two or three authors. Notably, within the Multidisciplinary domain, articles with two or three authors constitute around 40% of the total publications.
Some countries exhibit distinctive patterns in their journal publications. In Brazil, within the Medical and Health Sciences domain, articles authored by a single individual constitute a mere 5% of the total, while those with 4-8 authors make up a significant 61.8%. This trend of higher authorship numbers is consistent across all other disciplines within Brazilian journals. Conversely, Colombia presents an intriguing scenario with a notable prevalence of articles authored by two or three individuals, contrasting with the 4-8 author trend observed elsewhere. In Agricultural Sciences, this accounts for 56.3% of articles, in Medical and Health Sciences 41.7%, in Natural and Exact Sciences 59.9%, and in Engineering and Technology a substantial 63.8%. These statistics from Colombian journals demonstrate substantially higher proportions compared to the collective data from other countries outlined in Table 3.
The level of international collaboration can be assessed through co-authorship, as depicted in Figure 6 for six countries. The figure illustrates the percentage of articles written by a single author from the country in question, by multiple co-authors from the same country, and by co-authors from the same country collaborating with authors from other countries. A notable comparison can be made between Argentinian and Brazilian authors. A significant 42% of articles by Argentinians are authored by a single individual, reflecting the dominance of SSH papers in the discipline. The remaining articles are divided between those solely by Argentine authors (48.3%) and those with international collaboration (9.8%). In contrast, articles with only one Brazilian author are relatively scarce at 14.1%. Collaboration among researchers affiliated with Brazil prevails at 79.6%, spread across the vast geography of the country. Notably, international collaboration is limited for Brazilian authors when publishing in Brazilian journals. This emphasis on national collaboration is coupled with a lower tendency towards single authorship, as previously noted.
It is intriguing to juxtapose the collaborative patterns observed in OLIVA with those evident in other databases, where international author collaborations from these countries exhibit a notable increase. SCOPUS data reveals that in 2011, 23.9% of articles with at least one Brazilian author displayed international collaboration, a figure that rose to 29.6% in 2015 and further to 36.1% in 2020. Similarly, for Argentina, the corresponding percentages for the same years stand at 40.4%, 42.8%, and 49.9%, respectively. It is essential to note that Brazil's contribution significantly surpasses that of other regional countries, with articles authored by Brazilians constituting 48% of the documents produced in Latin America between 1996 and 2020, as per SCOPUS data.
The level of international collaboration among Brazilian researchers in mainstream journals seems to be influenced by the country's linguistic isolation within Latin America, its increasing preference for publishing in English, and its internationalization policies that prioritize North America and Europe. In contrast, Spanish-speaking Latin American authors have a stronger tradition of intra-regional collaboration. Analysis of the OLIVA corpus indicates that Brazilian authors tend to collaborate more within their own country, while authors from Argentina, Mexico, and Chile are more inclined to work with colleagues from other countries in the region. However, it is noteworthy that Brazilian authors also play a significant role as co-authors in journals published in other countries. For instance, in articles with authors from Argentina engaging in international collaboration, Brazilian co-authors are present in 26.5% of cases. Similarly, collaborations with Chilean authors involve Brazilians in 19% of articles, and with Colombian authors in 16.6% of articles. While national collaboration is prominent for Brazilians in journals published in Brazil, their involvement in co-authorship in articles from other countries is substantial. Future studies will delve deeper into the mapping of international collaboration in the OLIVA database, particularly to assess the balance between intra-regional and extra-regional collaboration across disciplines and countries. It will be valuable to investigate whether Brazilian authors tend to collaborate more with colleagues from outside the region, depending on the journal's recognition, compared to authors from Spanish-speaking countries.
Authors from Chile exhibit distinct patterns in the OLIVA database compared to other countries in the region. Notably, the prevalence of articles with individual authorship or international collaboration surpasses that of Brazilian journals, indicating a lower rate of domestic collaboration. Co-authorship with researchers from other countries is particularly prominent among Chilean authors, suggesting unique academic practices within the region. Cuba, while sharing some similarities with Brazil, demonstrates a higher level of international collaboration. Conversely, Colombia and Mexico mirror Chile in certain aspects but show a higher prevalence of national collaboration. These nuances underscore the diverse collaborative practices among researchers in Latin America.
Analogous trends to those previously mentioned can be examined through the analysis of articles authored by individuals from different countries and the country of the journal (refer to Figure 7). Upon conducting this analysis, a notable observation is that articles from the countries in question are predominantly published in journals from their respective countries. This trend is particularly evident in the case of Brazilian authors, with 93.7% of their articles being published in Brazilian journals. Chile follows with a mere 1.6% of the total articles. In bibliometric studies utilizing mainstream indexing sources, this tendency is often viewed as academic inbreeding, leading to a negative evaluation. In the subsequent section, we introduce an alternative perspective that challenges the notion of national collaboration being solely attributed to academic inbreeding practices. This perspective is rooted in a comprehensive examination of the specific number of articles authored by Brazilians and published in Brazil.
The case of Chilean authors, where 75% have published in domestic journals, is notable but falls below other instances. Journals in Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico serve as significant platforms for Chilean authors within the region. This distribution pattern could be attributed to the heightened pressure stemming from Chilean institutions' evaluation culture, which steers authors away from publishing in national journals and instead encourages international collaborations, as previously highlighted in the discussion of Figure 3. Conversely, authors from Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico exhibit a tendency to submit their work to domestic journals, albeit not to the same extent as observed in Brazil.
Argentina presents unique characteristics in terms of academic publishing. With only 56.4% of articles in its journals featuring at least one local author, there appears to be a stronger inclination towards international publication compared to Chile. However, this disparity can be attributed to various factors. Notably, Argentine journals are notably underrepresented in the OLIVA database, primarily due to the selective nature of the database itself. This selectivity stems from the evaluation practices at CONICET and national universities, where publications indexed in Latindex are valued equally to those in prestigious databases like SciELO, Scopus, and WoS. Additionally, the ease of indexing in Latindex Catalog 2.0, in contrast to the more stringent requirements of SciELO and Redalyc, contributes to the higher number of Argentine journals in Latindex. A comparison of journals from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Colombia in Latindex Catalog 2.0 and OLIVA reveals a significant difference in representation. For instance, while Chile boasts 144 journals in OLIVA and 167 in Latindex, Argentina showcases 316 journals in Latindex and only 167 in SciELO or Redalyc. Furthermore, Argentine journals not falling under social sciences and humanities are predominantly indexed in SciELO within the OLIVA database, indicating a distinct publishing trend in the country.
Moving on to language trends, the OLIVA corpus stands out for its remarkable linguistic diversity, in stark contrast to the prevalent use of English in mainstream databases. This diversity is attributed to the region's developed infrastructure, incorporating multilingual indexing and publishing protocols. Table 4 illustrates the significant presence of Spanish and Portuguese, with English also making up 23.9% of the articles. French, on the other hand, has a minimal presence, along with other languages that appear sporadically. Portuguese is predominantly found in journals published in Brazil, with 62.4% of articles in Brazilian journals being in Portuguese, while English accounts for 34.6%. This distribution is comparable to the use of English in articles from Puerto Rico (50.5%), Chile (23.7%), and Mexico (17.1%). The prevalence of English in Chilean articles could suggest a stronger influence of mainstream academic standards, while in Mexico and Puerto Rico, it may be attributed to traditional academic affiliations.
Outside of the journals from Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Chile, only an average of 5.4% of articles are written in English. Conversely, the use of Portuguese as a language of publication outside of Brazilian journals is notably low, with figures such as 5.4% in Costa Rican journals, 3.8% in Uruguayan publications, and 2.5% in Ecuadorian journals. In contrast, within the Spanish-speaking region, Spanish overwhelmingly dominates as the language of choice. In countries like Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru, the Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela, Spanish accounts for more than 90% of the articles published in journals.
In journals edited in Brazil (n=396,293), Portuguese dominates with the highest percentage in the Social Sciences and Multidisciplinary-SS&H (85%). English, on the other hand, prevails in Engineering and Technology (65.1%) and Natural and Exact Sciences (54.5%). Significant percentages are also observed in Medical and Health Sciences (44.4%) and Multidisciplinary (42.4%). Spanish, however, exhibits a stronger presence in journals from Spanish-speaking countries, with 8.4% of articles in Multidisciplinary-SSH journals and 7.9% in Humanities being published in Spanish.
In journals originating from Spanish-speaking countries, English accounts for 41.9% of articles in the Natural and Exact Sciences and 28.4% in Engineering and Technology. Portuguese, in contrast, holds a minimal presence, with only 2.9% representation in the Social Sciences. Spanish emerges as the predominant language in the Medical and Health Sciences, as well as across all three divisions of Social Sciences and Humanities, commanding over 91% of the articles in these fields.
Publication in English is typically characterized by a higher number of authors, with an average of 4.3 authors per article. In comparison, articles written in Portuguese tend to have an average of 3.3 authors, while those in Spanish have an average of 2.7 authors. This trend is particularly pronounced in Brazil, where there is a notable inclination for authors and journals to collaborate on articles, resulting in publications with two or more authors. This pattern of decreasing authorship averages across languages (English, Portuguese, and Spanish) is consistent across all academic disciplines.
There is a correlation between the authors' country affiliation and their publication language, particularly in English. Articles solely authored by researchers from outside Latin America and the Caribbean, comprising 8.5% of the 643,929 articles with identified country affiliations, make up 16.9% of the English publications. Similarly, articles resulting from collaborations between authors from within the region and those from outside account for 4.7% of the total articles. In both scenarios, English serves as the primary language of publication, whether in articles with external collaborations (49.9% of 30,307 articles) or those without regional partnerships (52.4% of 54,700 articles).
The evolution of language distribution in publications can be examined over time. In the past decade, English has seen a rise in its relative share, displacing Portuguese, while Spanish has maintained a relatively stable position (refer to Figure 8). A detailed analysis of the primary linguistic contexts, Portuguese and Spanish, reveals notable trends. In Brazilian journals, the proportion of English articles surged from 24% in 2009 to 58% in 2018. The decline in the prevalence of Portuguese articles mirrored this shift, while Spanish articles remained at a modest 3%. This pattern of English dominance is consistent across all disciplines, with a more subdued impact in the Social Sciences and Humanities, but significantly pronounced in Agricultural Sciences, Medical and Health Sciences, Engineering and Technology, as well as Exact and Natural Sciences. The prevalence of English was already evident at the outset of the period, particularly in journals within the latter disciplinary realm.
In other countries, the evolution over the past decade has been marked by a decline in the relative prominence of Spanish in favor of English, although the latter never surpassed the former. Furthermore, there is a notable segmentation by discipline. When considering journals in Agricultural Sciences, Engineering and Technologies, and Natural and Exact Sciences collectively, English's representation increased from 29% of articles in 2009 to 42% in 2018, while Spanish decreased from 70% to 57% over the same period. Essentially, despite the shift towards English, the official language of most Latin American countries continued to be the predominant language in academic articles.
In contrast, other disciplinary areas exhibit comparable patterns. The prevalence of articles in Spanish across these journals decreased from 92.8% at the onset of the selected period to 86.6% by its conclusion. Conversely, there was a notable rise in the proportion of articles in English (from 5.6% to 10.2%) and Portuguese (from 1.2% to 3%). This shift was particularly pronounced in journals originating from Uruguay and Colombia.
The significance of Brazil in the analysis of the scientific journal landscape in Latin America cannot be overstated. Brazilian journals make up 29.4% of the 1,720 journals included in the OLIVA corpus. These journals are predominantly concentrated in the Medical and Health Sciences (34.3%) and the Natural and Exact Sciences (33%). Conversely, they are less prevalent in the Humanities (23.9%), Engineering and Technology (19.3%), and Multidisciplinary-SSH (17.9%). However, the true impact of Brazil's contribution is best understood through the examination of the number of articles published in its journals. A staggering 50.1% of the articles in the OLIVA database originate from Brazilian journals. This percentage is even more pronounced in specific disciplines such as Agricultural Sciences (65.8%), Multidisciplinary (58.8%), Medical and Health Sciences (54.5%), and Natural and Exact Sciences (53.9%).
In this final section, we delve into a supplementary data source to provide a comprehensive analysis of national collaboration within the country. Specifically, we examine the metadata of articles published in journals from the SciELO Brazil collection spanning the period from 2016 to 2020, totaling 104,750 documents. This dataset, retrieved from SciELO in May 2021, has been meticulously standardized in terms of author names and institutional affiliations, facilitating a more precise analysis. Within this corpus, authors from 162 countries are represented. Notably, 74.5% of the articles feature solely authors affiliated with Brazilian institutions, with 23.6% having only one author, while 18.3% exclusively involve authors from other countries. Collaboration between authors from within and outside Brazil is observed in only 7.1% of the documents, mirroring the findings illustrated in Figure 6. It is worth highlighting that a mere 17% of the articles co-authored by Brazilians and foreigners involve collaboration with Latin American countries, a trend largely influenced by linguistic factors, as previously discussed.
However, upon closer examination of the authors hailing from Brazil, a diverse landscape emerges. While articles are contributed by researchers from all 27 Brazilian states, there is a notable concentration in specific regions. Within the dataset of documents featuring at least one author from Brazil with their respective state indicated (n=85,528), a significant 85.7% are attributed to just five states. These states include São Paulo (33.4%), Minas Gerais (15.4%), Rio de Janeiro (13.7%), Rio Grande do Sul (13.1%), and Paraná (10.1%), predominantly situated in the Southeast and South regions of Brazil.
Within this subset of 58,148 documents, 63% are coauthored, revealing discernible trends in within-country collaboration that transcend the conventional dichotomy of academic inbreeding versus cross-breeding. Notably, 59% of the documents are authored by individuals from the same state, while 31.9% entail collaboration between authors from institutions in distinct states. Furthermore, 9.1% involve authors from three or more states, with the maximum spanning 26 different states. Brazil, being an intricately diverse country with numerous universities and scientific establishments, presents a challenge in categorizing collaborations between two Brazilian authors (or publications in domestic journals) as instances of academic inbreeding. Similarly, collaborations between authors from different institutions within the same state warrant a nuanced interpretation.
The absence of data illustrating inter-institutional collaboration necessitates an analysis of inter-state collaboration in Brazil, which introduces a significant nuance in interpreting the forms of collaboration depicted in Figure 6. Notably, 79.6% of articles in the OLIVA database authored by Brazilians involve solely Brazilian authors, contrasting with lower percentages of within-country authorship in Argentina (48.3%), Chile (52.7%), and Mexico (56.5%). Our examination of documents from SciELO (2016-2020) reveals that when Brazilian authors are involved, collaboration occurs in 41% of cases, either between authors from two states (31.9%) or three or more states (9.1%). The remaining 59% represents solely within-state collaboration, a proportion akin to exclusive within-country collaboration in the Spanish-speaking nations mentioned.
Collaboration stands out as a pivotal element contributing to the significant expansion of Brazilian authors' publications over the past few decades. Sidone, Haddad, & Mena-Chalco (2016) underscored the crucial involvement of institutions in the Southeastern states in fostering both intra- and inter-regional collaborations within Brazil. While states like São Paulo maintain their central position in this collaborative landscape, recent trends indicate a growing engagement between states across various regions, with a notable surge in collaborative efforts observed in the Northeast and South regions.
When examining Brazil's research system at a macro level, the intricate interactions within its boundaries can be overlooked due to the high level of aggregation. In Table 5, co-authorship is depicted based on the number of authors from different states, categorized by the disciplinary area of the journals (utilizing SciELO classification). It is evident that journals in disciplines with a tendency for a higher number of authors in their publications exhibit a greater level of inter-state collaboration. Notably, Agricultural Sciences, Exact and Natural Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Multidisciplinary journals show participation from authors across three or more states exceeding 10%. While co-authorship levels in the Social Sciences and Humanities domains are comparatively lower, the percentage of documents with co-authorship between two or more Brazilian states never drops below 29%. A substantial portion of author collaboration now transcends institutional boundaries, emphasizing partnerships between different states.
However, significant disparities exist in the various forms of collaboration among authors from different states. When examining authors from a specific state, the top five states they collaborate with are scrutinized. São Paulo emerges as a prominent collaborator in 26 instances, followed by Minas Gerais with 25, Rio de Janeiro with 21, Rio Grande do Sul with 14, and Paraná with 12. Pernambuco and Brasilia follow with 7 and 5 collaborations, respectively. Interestingly, there are seven states that do not feature among the top five collaborative partners for any other state.
Let us delve into the case of authors affiliated with institutions in the Northeast region. Table 6 delineates the nine states within the region, shedding light on the collaborative patterns of authors from each state with counterparts from either the same state or other states and regions in Brazil. Notably, there exists a significant inclination (slightly exceeding 40%) towards collaborating with authors from the same state. However, when examining collaborations among states within the region and the top five most prolific states (i.e., São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, and Paraná), the distribution appears relatively balanced. Co-authorship with authors from the remaining thirteen states falls within the range of 7.7% to 12.7%. Essentially, the level of collaboration across state boundaries, whether within the same region or with the major scientific hubs, remains consistent. This trend is further accentuated by the limited involvement of other states in intra-state collaborations.
The nine states under analysis demonstrate similar percentages across various types of collaboration, with subtle variations observed in the table, indicating a relative stability in the characteristics of Brazilian scientific production. To reinforce this assertion, we examine a region distinct from the Northeast, focusing on the collaboration patterns of the five most productive states as depicted in Table 7. Notably, a significant aspect is the prevalence of intra-state collaboration, surpassing 50% in all instances, contrasting with the Northeastern scenario. Each state in the table exhibits a comparable level of collaboration with the other four states, as well as with the remaining states in Brazil. This concentration of collaboration within these five states is evident, yet their engagement with less prominent states in the Brazilian scientific landscape is not negligible. Furthermore, the striking resemblance in the collaboration profiles of these states in Table 7 hints at consistent trends in this realm, reinforcing the notion of enduring patterns in collaborative efforts.
The examination of collaboration within Brazil in recent years has shed light on the misconception that low international collaboration in co-authored publications indicates institutional inbreeding or parochialism. The analysis of SciELO documents from 2016-2020 reveals that collaboration between authors from different states is a defining characteristic of the Brazilian scientific production landscape. This practice involves teams situated in distinct environments with varied academic backgrounds and institutional processes, particularly impacting certain disciplinary areas. Notably, inter-state collaboration is less common in disciplines with fewer authors in their articles.
The authors responsible for these documents are primarily concentrated in institutions located in the Southeastern and Southern states; however, this does not discount the significant collaboration with colleagues from various regions across the country. Moreover, states such as São Paulo, Minas Gerais, or Rio de Janeiro are far from homogeneous within themselves, encompassing a diverse array of institutions - federal, state, and private - which likely engage in collaborative efforts in terms of their publications. This complexity adds depth to the notion of academic inbreeding concerning authors' affiliations within the same state. For instance, collaboration between authors from Unicamp (Universidade Estadual de Campinas) and those from USP (Universidade de São Paulo), both situated in São Paulo, cannot be simplistically categorized as a provincial interaction.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, numerous experts raised concerns about the lack of visibility of scientific work originating from Latin America, attributing this to its limited citation in international databases. This issue led Gibbs (1995) to coin the term "lost science of the third world." During this period, efforts were made to fortify the scholarly communication infrastructure in the region, aiming to elevate the significance of research outputs unique to Latin America in terms of disciplines, research agendas, and publication languages. These initiatives spurred the development of policies and regional mechanisms for managing the dissemination of Latin American science, resulting in the establishment of a robust network comprising journals, indexing databases, institutional repositories, regional institute networks, and major national universities that regularly published academic journals. Despite these advancements, the growth of this structure remained fragmented, as achieving interoperable systems to enhance the global recognition, visibility, and appreciation of Latin American scientific production proved challenging. In response to this challenge, the OLIVA project was initiated at the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo in Mendoza, Argentina, with the aim of augmenting the value of assessed and indexed research articles to increase their presence and impact within academic evaluation systems.
The corpus of documents examined in this study originates from a database that amalgamates data from two prominent indexers of Latin American and Caribbean scientific journals - SciELO and Redalyc. Through the collaborative efforts of these institutions and CLACSO, the extensive dedication of these open-access publishing platforms becomes evident, showcasing a Latin American production of remarkable quality that remains inadequately acknowledged within current academic evaluation frameworks. Notably, the analysis reveals the enduring nature and diverse origins of the journals, with some established as far back as the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Furthermore, a broad spectrum of disciplinary fields, collaboration methods, publication languages, authorship types, authors' geographical affiliations, and publishing entities are represented across more than a century of scientific output from Latin America and the Caribbean.
The examination of collaboration structures within the OLIVA corpus delved into the intricate nature of national collaborations, distinguishing between co-authorships within the same institution and those that involve combined efforts from various universities and states. This analysis aimed to explore the geospatial dynamics of national scientific production. Specifically focusing on Brazil, which accounts for a significant portion of the journals, authors, and articles in the OLIVA database, revealed a robust collaboration network among researchers across different states in the country. Furthermore, the study identified states that hold substantial importance within the corpus but also engage in significant collaborations with colleagues from states that carry less weight in the Brazilian scientific landscape.
An analysis of the publishing institutions of journals within the OLIVA corpus reveals notable structural distinctions from mainstream commercial journals, particularly in terms of autonomy and ties to the academic community. Neubert and Rodrigues (2021) conducted a study on Latin American scholarly output in the Web of Science, finding that articles were dispersed across 11,965 scientific journals, with commercial publishers representing 56.48%, universities 18.30%, and associations 19.25%. In contrast, journals affiliated with SciELO and Redalyc exhibit a predominantly academic character, predominantly published by universities, scientific societies, and government entities, offering editorial services rooted in the public domain. Historically, the region has seen scholarly communities spearheading journal creation, with ongoing material support despite academic evaluation systems nudging scholars towards mainstream publication venues.
Scholarly communication in Latin America is characterized by the widespread adoption of Open Access, facilitated by the commitment of research funding agencies, universities, scientific societies, and publishers to establish non-profit infrastructures for global visibility of scientific information. Notably, the entire OLIVA corpus is accessible in open access and full text on the SciELO Network and Redalyc platform websites, as well as on individual journal websites and various thematic and institutional repositories. Apart from the 1,720 journals analyzed, numerous other long-standing journals in the region have played a crucial role in advancing open access, contributing significantly to the expansion of scholarly communication in Latin America.
The examination of publications in SciELO and Redalyc has enabled us to delve into certain assumptions that underlie the acknowledgment of scientific knowledge, specifically the tendency to prioritize journals commonly labeled as "mainstream" while disregarding others. OLIVA sheds light on two key aspects within this scientific communication realm that are indicative of an escalating editorial standard. Firstly, it highlights the diversity and broad scope of themes and languages present. Secondly, it underscores the significance of international and inter-institutional collaborations at a national level, which promotes a perspective that transcends the conventional dichotomy of the "mainstream or global circuit" dominated by prestigious journals and the "regional or local circuits" with limited reach. This dichotomy, perpetuated within the commercialized journal landscape and reinforced as an expectation by assessment systems reliant on Impact Factors, has devalued non-commercial open access publications, such as those under scrutiny in this study. Furthermore, it has overlooked the intricate forms of intra-national collaboration, the intricacies of which we aim to elucidate in this paper, particularly in the context of Brazil. These collaborations are particularly pertinent for research addressing local issues, which are accentuated in this type of collaborative setting. Additionally, we draw attention to the linguistic nuances of Brazil, which significantly influence collaboration trends when domestically produced journals are juxtaposed with mainstream publications.
The collaboration exhibited by journals indexed in SciELO and Redalyc, along with their academic and university affiliations, highlights a system that fosters extensive dissemination and multi-scale research initiatives, effectively meeting the demands of scholarly communication in the era of open science. This is not solely reliant on Latin American expertise in professional scientific publishing, indexing, and open access, but also on its proficiency in generating interoperable regional metrics, as evidenced by joint publications in partnership with key regional indexing systems like PKP and CLACSO (Alperin, Babini, and Fischmann, 2014). Further endeavors in this direction to enhance the visibility and comparability of Latin American scholarly output will empower the region to counteract a significant trend stemming from two increasingly intertwined forces: commercial threats to open science and the pressing need for reform in traditional research evaluation methods. The OLIVA project aims to inspire more collaborative platforms that advance socially impactful and participatory scientific endeavors.
