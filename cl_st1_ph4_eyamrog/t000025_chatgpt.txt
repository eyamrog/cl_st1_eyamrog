This study received partial financial support from the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel in Brazil under Finance Code 001. The funding agency played no role in influencing the study's design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, report writing, or the decision to submit the article for publication.
Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study is to comprehensively review and synthesize the current body of literature pertaining to topical therapies utilized in the management of pain associated with Malignant Fungating Wounds, while also identifying any existing gaps in research within this domain.
Most cancer patients with Malignant Fungating Wounds experience wound-related pain, significantly impacting their quality of life. Despite pain being a crucial symptom in cancer and palliative care, there is a lack of understanding regarding the availability and effectiveness of topical treatments for managing pain in these individuals.
Design: This study employed a scoping review methodology following the guidelines set forth by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI).
Methods: Searches were conducted across multiple databases including CINAHL, LILACS, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane, NICE, Scopus, JBISRIR, and gray literature, encompassing English, Portuguese, and Spanish publications without temporal constraints. Two researchers autonomously assessed all references, with a third arbitrator consulted in instances of discordance, focusing on studies involving topical pain management interventions for Malignant Fungal Wounds in adult populations. Furthermore, a data extraction instrument was devised for the purpose of synthesis and thematic analysis. Adherence to the PRISMA-ScR Checklist was maintained throughout the course of this investigation.
Results: Out of 796 records retrieved from databases, 70 publications were selected for analysis. The selected studies predominantly comprised non-systematic reviews and case studies, with only six clinical trials included. Through narrative synthesis, twenty distinct therapies were identified, encompassing the utilization of wound dressings (58.6%), analgesic drugs (55.7%), topical antimicrobials (25.7%), skin barriers (15.7%), cryotherapy (5.7%), and Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (4.3%). These therapies were typically recommended for application either to the wound bed or the periwound skin. Notably, in 68.5% of the studies, a standardized assessment for pain was not explicitly detailed.
Conclusions: The efficacy of topical therapies in managing pain associated with Malignant Fungating Wounds or periwound areas has been investigated, albeit in a limited number of interventional studies. These findings underscore the necessity for additional primary research to enhance the knowledge base and support evidence-based clinical practices in this area.
Implications for Practice: The highlighted topical therapies recommended for consideration in clinical practice include opioids, anesthetics, and antimicrobials, all of which have shown positive outcomes in randomized clinical trials.
This study did not involve the participation of any patients.
This paper makes a significant contribution to the broader global clinical community by providing novel insights into the efficacy of a new treatment approach for a specific medical condition. The findings presented in this research article offer valuable information that can potentially enhance the current understanding of the disease and improve patient outcomes. By shedding light on the effectiveness of this innovative treatment strategy, this paper has the potential to influence clinical practice and guide future research in the field. Overall, the contribution of this study lies in its ability to advance knowledge in the medical community and ultimately benefit patients worldwide.
Patients suffering from Malignant Fungating Wounds endure a spectrum of pain encompassing physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions, a concept articulated by Cecily Saunders as "total pain." This pain can stem from tumor infiltration, manifesting as either nociceptive or neuropathic in nature, or be triggered by moisture-related periwound skin complications or the manipulation of wound dressings.
Systemic treatments for pain management in cancer patients often fall short in effectively addressing the pain associated with malignant fungating wounds, primarily due to the unique etiopathogenic characteristics of these wounds and their poor superficial tissue perfusion. Furthermore, the lack of clarity surrounding the available topical options for pain control in such wounds further complicates the management of this type of pain.
This scoping review identified 20 potential topical therapies for managing pain associated with Malignant Fungating Wounds, primarily documented in non-systematic reviews, case reports, and a limited number of interventional studies. Among these, eleven studies suggested the application of topical therapies on the peri-wound skin to establish a protective barrier.
The topical products in this study were classified into various categories including anti-adherent, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, absorbent dressings, analgesic drugs (such as gels containing anesthetics, opioids, and oils with cannabinoids), negative pressure wound therapy, cryotherapy, and meticulous irrigation and dressing removal techniques.
The majority of the studies included in the analysis (69%) did not conduct a formal assessment of pain utilizing the appropriate tools.
This study provides a thorough review of the literature concerning topical therapies for MFW pain, showcasing a variety of treatments utilized globally. This analysis not only paves the way for essential primary research and evidence-based implementation initiatives but also offers valuable insights that can inform future studies and contribute to the enhancement of local protocols.
According to the Globocan 2020 report, one in five individuals is projected to develop cancer. The report indicated that 19.3 million people worldwide were living with cancer at the time of publication, with 10 million having succumbed to the disease (Sung et al., 2021). Recent advancements in cancer diagnosis and treatment have resulted in extended survival rates over the past few decades (Sung et al., 2021; Tsichlakidou et al., 2019), thereby exposing cancer survivors to potential chronic complications arising from disease progression and treatments, such as the development of Malignant Fungating Wounds (MFWs) (Hoshi et al., 2019; Tilley et al., 2020).
Malignant fungating wounds (MFWs) are intricate chronic wounds resulting from uncontrolled proliferation of infiltrating malignant cells, leading to the disruption of skin integrity. As time progresses, these wounds undergo a process of evolution and deterioration, becoming more extensive and invasive, as evidenced by various studies (Hoshi et al., 2019; Tilley et al., 2020; Young, 2017). It is estimated that approximately 4% to 15% of cancer patients develop this particular type of wound, with a higher prevalence in areas such as the breasts (62% to 66%), head and neck (24%), and chest due to the proximity of compromised tissue to the skin (EONS, 2015; Firmino et al., 2020; Neves Duarte Lisboa, 2016; O'Neill et al., 2022). According to the Haisfield-Wolfe and Baxendale-Cox staging system, individuals in advanced stages of MFWs experience debilitating symptoms like odor, exudate, itching, bleeding, and pain (Haisfield-Wolde ME, 1999), posing significant challenges for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals alike (Santos & Fuly, 2015; Tilley et al., 2020).
Pain stands as the predominant concern among individuals living with MFWs, representing a pervasive symptom. Yet, pain remains a subjective encounter, challenging to objectively evaluate, with assessments predominantly dependent on self-reported measures (Raja et al., 2020). Consequently, the utilization of validated tools for systematic pain assessment becomes imperative to effectively track and compare the effectiveness of pain management interventions across time (Caraceni & Shkodra, 2019).
The mechanism involved in MFW-related pain is complex and multifactorial, primarily due to the omnipresence of infection caused by a high local microbial load (Vardhan et al., 2019). Additionally, factors such as irritation of exposed nerve endings during dressing changes, tumor growth exerting pressure on body structures, and edema resulting from impaired lymphatic and capillary drainage contribute to the pain experienced by patients. Consequently, individuals may experience nociceptive, neuropathic, inflammatory, or mixed pain, depending on the specific trigger (EONS, 2015; Naylor, 2001).
The existing literature on topical interventions for managing MFWs presents inconsistencies in the use of various topical substances with differing analgesic effects, including opioids, anti-inflammatory drugs, anesthetics, and non-adherent dressings (EONS, 2015). Opting for topical pain treatment over systemic medication is often favored due to the numerous adverse side effects associated with systemic use. Moreover, the altered circulation resulting from malignant infiltration can lead to unpredictable bioavailability of systemic pain medication, making it challenging to effectively control MFW-related pain (LeBon et al., 2009).
A prior systematic review investigated the effectiveness of topical MFW treatments in addressing local infection, odor, and pain. This review encompassed four studies, comprising three randomized controlled trials and a pre and post-test survey focusing on odor and infection management. Ultimately, the authors suggested the need for new intervention studies to better manage MFW-related pain (Finlayson et al., 2017a).
This study sought to comprehensively review and synthesize the current body of literature concerning topical therapies utilized in the management of musculoskeletal facial and jaw (MFW) pain, with a specific focus on identifying any gaps present in the existing research.
A scoping review was undertaken following the JBI® approach, designed to elucidate key concepts, refine definitions, establish subject boundaries, synthesize information, and identify research and clinical gaps (Peters et al., 2020). In contrast to a systematic review, which evaluates treatment efficacy, a scoping review is a meticulous process that involves an exhaustive search for all existing literature on a topic without strict methodological constraints.
The title of this review was documented in the JBI® database (JBI, 2019), while the protocol can be accessed on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform (da Costa Ferreira et al., 2020) and was officially published in the Journal of Wound Care (JWC) (Ferreira et al., 2021).
This study utilized a secondary methodology, specifically a literature review, which did not require an ethical review.
What types of topical therapies and treatments are accessible for pain management in patients with musculoskeletal facial weaknesses (MFWs)?
This review focused on studies involving patients aged 18 years and older who experienced painful myofascial trigger points.
The primary focus of this review was to outline the use of topical therapy in managing pain associated with MFW. Topical therapy, as per the definition provided by Mayba and Gooderham (2018), involves the application of a product to both the wound and the surrounding periwound skin.
The secondary objective of this study was to elucidate the utilization of topical therapies in managing pain associated with MFW and to outline the various instruments employed for pain assessment.
This study examined various care settings for patients with mental and functional well-being issues, including hospitals, outpatient facilities, home care services, long-term care facilities, and palliative care support institutions.
In this review, we systematically analyzed qualitative, quantitative, and review studies that elucidate the efficacy of topical therapies in alleviating pain associated with medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) in adult patients.
Qualitative studies were included if they had a qualitative theoretical and methodological framework. Quantitative studies encompassed experimental (controlled trials with or without randomization, quasi-experimental, before and after) and observational studies (descriptive, cohort, cross-sectional, case, and case series). Systematic, non-systematic, meta-analyses, meta-syntheses, and clinical practice guidelines were also considered. Furthermore, unpublished studies (gray literature) in English, Portuguese, and Spanish without time restrictions were included in the review.
The search process consisted of three main steps. Initially, searches were conducted on the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases using the terms "Wounds and Injuries; Neoplasms; Pain Management; Administration, Topical" to identify new keywords. Subsequently, a comprehensive search was carried out using all the keywords and descriptors identified in the databases. Furthermore, in collaboration with a librarian, search equations were formulated for each database, with the detailed search strategy for CINAHL (EBSCO) provided in Table 1. The search equations conducted from 2019 to 2020 were not constrained by a time limit and were subsequently updated in March 2022. Lastly, an active search was conducted in the reference lists of selected studies to uncover additional relevant research.
The study utilized a comprehensive search strategy that included databases such as CINAHL (EBSCO), LILACS (VHL Regional Portal), Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Medline (PubMed), Cochrane, NICE, JBISRIR, and also incorporated unpublished studies from the Open Access Scientific Repository (Canada), Canadian Dissertation and Thesis Portal, Tesis Doctorales Database - Teseo (Spain), CAPES Thesis Bank (Brazil), Google Scholar (encompassing Textbooks and Congress Proceedings), and the European Thesis and Dissertation Database - Dart-E.
Following the completion of searches, all identified records were collated and organized using MendeleyⓇ (Mendeley Ltd., Elsevier, The Netherlands) for efficient management and removal of duplicates. Subsequently, two independent reviewers assessed titles and abstracts according to predefined inclusion criteria for initial screening. Documents deemed potentially relevant underwent retrieval in full text. Subsequent to this, two independent reviewers meticulously scrutinized the full text of the chosen citations in accordance with the inclusion criteria. In instances of discord between reviewers at any phase of the selection process, a third reviewer was consulted to resolve disagreements.
Two independent reviewers utilized a data extraction tool created by the authors and validated through testing on three articles to evaluate its effectiveness in extracting data. Following the test phase, additional variables, namely "trade name of the therapy," "formulation," and "application form," were incorporated into the data extraction process (refer to Table 2 for details).
The extracted data encompassed general information about the author(s), year of publication, origins, objectives, methods, topical therapies utilized, and outcomes. Furthermore, specific details regarding tumor type, staging, wound location and stage, pain assessment using a designated tool, pain categorization, pain location and duration, and the administration of medication for wound pain management were gathered. To supplement the information, the authors of one of the incorporated studies were contacted for additional data (Ciałkowska-Rysz & Dzierżanowski, 2019). Notably, in line with the methodology of scoping reviews, a critical appraisal of the included articles was not conducted.
Information extracted from the included articles was synthesized narratively to outline all strategies present in the literature, pinpoint potential gaps and limitations in current knowledge, and direct future primary studies aimed at addressing the challenges of managing MFW-related pain effectively.
The narrative synthesis is structured around key conceptual categories and specific subgroups that were identified during the data extraction process, aligning with the objectives and review question. This synthesis adhered to the guidelines outlined in the EQUATOR checklist, specifically the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) by Tricco et al. (2018), as detailed in Supplementary File 1. The results were meticulously categorized and refined to effectively portray the characteristics of the interventions, with the use of figures and tables for clarity and organization.
Out of the 796 studies identified, 564 articles were found to not meet the inclusion criteria. After excluding 145 duplicates, 87 studies were deemed eligible for a full-text reading. Among these, 24 were subsequently discarded as they also did not meet the inclusion criteria, as detailed in Supplementary Table 3.
After conducting a thorough search through the references of the included articles, seven additional papers were identified and subsequently included, bringing the total number of articles analyzed in this scoping review to 70 (refer to Figure 1).
The selected studies exhibited the following characteristics: 54 (88.6%) were published in English, four (5.7%) in Portuguese, and four (5.7%) in Spanish. England emerged as the country with the highest number of publications (18 / 24.3%), closely followed by the USA (16 / 22.9%). Within the last seven years (2015-2022), twenty-two studies (31.4%) were published. Nurses constituted the professional category with the highest publication rate on the topic (54 / 77.1%), trailed by physicians (15 / 24.1%) and pharmacists (1 / 1.4%).
In terms of study types, 32 (45.7%) were non-systematic literature reviews, 20 (28.5%) were case studies, and 18 (25.8%) utilized other methodologies such as control trials, systematic reviews, cohorts, guidelines, and surveys, as outlined in Table 4. Only seven MFW studies (10%) incorporated pain management as a primary outcome, with study sample sizes varying from 1 to 60 patients.
In total, 20 proposals were identified for the topical management of MFW-related pain, categorized into two groups: Topical therapies applied in the wound and Topical therapies applied to periwound skin. The distribution of these topical therapies across the 70 studies is illustrated in Figure 2. Additionally, Figure 3 provides a summary of the identified topical therapies, organized by sources of pain derived from MFW and highlights the main research gaps in this area.
The review identified various topical therapies for managing pain in MFW, such as Analgesic Drugs, Antimicrobial Substances, Dressings, Negative Pressure Wound Therapy, and Cryotherapy. Furthermore, certain studies suggested combining multiple therapies to create an integrated approach for pain management associated with MFW.
This category encompassed non-adherent dressings, hydrogel dressings, absorbent dressings, and anti-inflammatory dressings.
In the analysis, twenty-six articles (37.1%) recommended non-adherent dressings for managing pain associated with MFW. The research encompassed various study designs, including non-systematic reviews (65.3%), case studies (19.8%), randomized clinical trials (3.8%), a guideline (3.8%), prospective cohorts (3.8%), and a survey (3.8%). Notably, twenty-five studies (35.7%) did not prioritize pain management as their primary focus. Across all studies, the use of dressings was combined with other therapeutic modalities such as opioids, anesthetics, and antiseptics. However, none of the studies outlined a standardized protocol for their application or delineated specific pain-related outcomes resulting solely from the use of non-adherent dressings.
Out of the 70 studies analyzed, eleven (15.7%) suggested the utilization of hydrogels for managing pain associated with MFW. These studies encompassed non-systematic reviews (54.5%), case studies (36.3%), and systematic reviews (9.2%). A majority of the studies (72.7%) cursorily mentioned hydrogel as an optional dressing to alleviate pain by maintaining a moist wound environment, lacking in-depth substantiation. Furthermore, the hydrogel was noted as a potential vehicle for administering other active substances like opioids, anesthetics, and antibiotics in the reviewed literature. Notably, none of the studies outlined a standardized protocol for employing this type of dressing, and no conclusive results were presented.
In managing MFW-related pain, ten studies (14.2%) utilized absorbent dressings. These studies encompassed a variety of research types, including non-systematic reviews (50%), case studies (20%), a guideline (10%), randomized clinical trials (10%), and a survey (10%). Notably, the majority (90%) of these studies did not focus on testing absorbent dressings specifically for controlling MFW-related pain. Rather, some studies merely referenced these dressings as an option for patients experiencing pain due to high exudate absorption, thereby potentially reducing dermatitis-related pain resulting from periwound moisture. Across all studies, absorbent dressings were used in conjunction with other therapies such as opioids, anesthetics, and antiseptics. However, none of the studies outlined a standardized approach for utilizing these dressings or presented results solely on pain management without the concomitant use of other products.
Anti-inflammatory dressings consist of absorbent polyurethane foam that contains 0.5 mg/cm2 of Ibuprofen evenly dispersed within the foam matrix, alongside a cream infused with essential oils.
In eight out of seventy studies (10%), the use of foam with Ibuprofen dressing was recommended as a potential therapy for managing pain associated with MFW. These studies predominantly fell into the categories of non-systematic reviews (87.5%) and surveys (12.5%). However, none of the studies specifically delved into evaluating the efficacy of foam with Ibuprofen for MFW-related pain management; rather, they merely referenced it as a dressing option for these patients. Furthermore, none of the studies provided details on the application of the dressing or reported any outcomes resulting from its use.
A cream with essential oils was evaluated in a single case study published in 2014 by Stringer et al., where only 1.4% of the participants were involved. This study focused on 12 patients, predominantly women with breast cancer aged between 40 and 81 years, who were experiencing MFW symptoms. The cream utilized in the study contained 3% essential oils, although the specific ingredients were not disclosed. However, the study lacked standardization in terms of dressings, did not provide details on the cream's form, and failed to specify the frequency of applications on the wounds. Despite these limitations, the authors noted that six patients reported an improvement in pain levels, with the maximum score on a Likert scale decreasing to zero.
Analgesic drugs encompass topical opioids, topical anesthetics, and Medicinal Cannabis.
In thirty-one studies (44.2%), opioids were explored as a topical application for managing MFW-related pain. The research encompassed various study types, with non-systematic reviews (67.7%), case studies (16.1%), randomized clinical trials (.06%) - which notably included a letter to the editor detailing data from an incomplete trial - guidelines (.03%), prospective cohorts (.03%), and systematic reviews (.03%). Among these studies, nearly half identified specific opioids for addressing MFW-related pain, particularly highlighting Morphine. Additionally, two studies referenced Oxycodone without providing details on its formulation or application methods, as outlined in Table 5.
In relation to analgesic drugs, 20 studies (28.5%) suggested the utilization of topical anesthetics for managing pain associated with MFW. These studies encompassed non-systematic reviews (75%), case studies (5%), randomized clinical trials (5%), guidelines (5%), prospective cohorts (5%), and surveys (5%). Among them, nine studies (45%) provided information on dosages and application guidelines for various topical anesthetics, which are categorized and elaborated upon in Table 6. Furthermore, 11 studies (55%) referenced the use of lidocaine, prilocaine, benzocaine, and a tricyclic anesthetic, albeit without specifying the formulation or method of application.
Only one case study (1.4%) (Maida, 2017) suggested the utilization of medicinal cannabis in the form of topical and vaporized oil as a component of the MFW pain management toolkit. This particular case revolved around a 44-year-old male patient who had been diagnosed with squamous cell cancer in the oral cavity, leading to a MFW on the right hemiface. Initially experiencing pain levels rated between 9 and 10/10, the patient underwent treatment involving intravenous analgesia. Following the administration of vaporized medicinal cannabis every 2 to 4 hours, and the application of 1-2 ml of the oil on the wound, both externally and intra-orally, the patient reported a notable reduction in pain, with his pain score dropping to 3 and 4. This positive outcome enabled adjustments to the analgesic regimen. This case study stands as the first documented instance showcasing the potential efficacy of topical medicinal cannabis in managing MFW pain.
This scoping review classifies antimicrobial substances into three main categories: topical antimicrobials, honey, and antiseptics. The term "antimicrobial substances" refers to agents capable of either killing or inhibiting the growth and development of various microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This category encompasses a range of products including antibiotics, antiseptics, and disinfectants, each with distinct properties and mechanisms of action.
Ten studies, comprising 14.2% of the total, suggested the utilization of topical antimicrobials like Metronidazole, Nanocrystalline Silver, and Silver Sulfadiazine for the management of MFW-related pain. These studies encompassed various research designs, including case studies (40%), randomized clinical trials (20%), non-systematic reviews (10%), retrospective cohorts (10%), systematic reviews (10%), and surveys (10%). Among these, six studies (60%) acknowledged the use of antimicrobials, albeit pain not being their primary focus, yet failed to provide details regarding the mode of administration or the resulting outcomes.
One randomized clinical trial (Lund-Nielsen et al., 2011) included in a systematic review (Adderley & Holt, 2014) yielded positive outcomes with the use of antimicrobials in managing MFW odor, exudate, and pain. Among the three studies examining antimicrobial efficacy in addressing MFW symptoms, including pain, two were randomized clinical trials, and one was a retrospective cohort study involving 192 patients with MFWs, predominantly women aged between 47 and 90 years, primarily with breast cancer. These trials utilized verbal numeric and visual analog scales to assess pain levels, with two trials showing pain improvement and one trial indicating no statistically significant impact on pain outcomes (Table 7).
Five articles (7%) discussed the use of topical honey as a therapy for managing pain related to malignant fungating wounds (MFW). While none of the studies specifically focused on pain management, they addressed the general control of MFW symptoms, including pain. Two reviews, one systematic and one non-systematic (Adderley & Holt, 2014; Praptiwi, 2017), incorporated two primary studies that demonstrated positive effects of honey in managing MFW symptoms such as odor, exudate, and pain. These studies collectively involved 384 patients, predominantly women aged between 44 to 90 years, primarily with breast tumors. Notably, only one study (Lund-Nielsen et al., 2011) utilized a visual analog scale for pain assessment (Table 8).
Only a small percentage (4%) of studies examined the use of topical antiseptics such as Polyhexamethylene Biguanide, Octenidine, and other unspecified degerming agents for managing MFW pain. These studies comprised randomized clinical trials (66.6%) and non-systematic reviews (33.4%). Interestingly, none of the studies focused primarily on pain control; instead, they aimed to manage general symptoms, including pain. The collective analysis of these three studies involved 54 patients, predominantly women aged between 24 and 92 years, with primary tumors, primarily in the breast. Pain assessment methods varied, with two studies utilizing verbal classification and visual analog scales. Results indicated that the application of topical antiseptics led to pain alleviation in two studies, while one study reported no significant changes in pain intensity scores (refer to Table 9).
Three studies, comprising 4% of the total, investigated the application of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) in addressing MFW-related pain. Among these studies, 66.6% were case studies, while 33.4% were non-systematic reviews. Notably, none of the studies specifically delved into pain management; rather, they focused on the broader spectrum of MFW-associated symptoms. Interestingly, one study failed to explicitly state its primary objective. These investigations involved a total of six female patients aged between 56 and 62, each diagnosed with distinct primary tumors such as sarcomas, breast cancer, melanoma, and sigmoid cancer. Notably, none of the studies conducted either quantitative or qualitative pain assessments. Despite this, the research findings indicated enhancements in odor, exudate, and pain levels, thereby positively influencing the quality of life for the patients involved, as outlined in Table 10.
In four studies (5%), topical cryotherapy was utilized to manage MFW-related pain as a secondary focus, primarily targeting symptom alleviation, including pain. These studies comprised non-systematic reviews (50%), surveys (25%), and guidelines (25%). However, none of the studies provided detailed information on the application methods or outcomes of the cryotherapy intervention.
Topical therapies applied to periwound skin were the focus of eleven (15.7%) studies that discussed pain management in the periwound skin area. These studies encompassed non-systematic reviews (63.7%), case studies (18.1%), guidelines (9.1%), and surveys (9.1%). The proposed therapies included zinc oxide (ointment and cream), silicone, dimethicone, petrolatum, acrylate and cyanoacrylate, hydrocolloid (paste and powder), and vitamin-rich ointment (A and D), all integral components of pain-control protocols. Notably, all studies were overseen by nurses and published in journals specializing in wounds, palliative care, oncology, and general nursing. Among these studies, two reported pain assessments, with one utilizing a Visual Analog Scale as the measuring instrument. While positive outcomes were documented, they were not elaborated upon in further detail (Table 11).
The application and removal technique of dressings for MFW-related pain management were not classified as a topical therapy in the research. However, numerous studies referenced different dressing application techniques and conditions, highlighting their impact on pain. Twenty-one studies (30%) suggested specific procedures related to dressing techniques aimed at minimizing pain. These studies encompassed non-systematic reviews (66%), guidelines (14%), randomized clinical trials (10%), a case study (5%), and a survey (5%). Generally, the authors recommended cleaning the wound with a suitably warm solution, applying and removing dressings with care, avoiding debridement to prevent bleeding, maintaining a moist wound environment, using soap with an appropriate pH for cleaning, reducing the frequency of dressing changes, and administering analgesia before dressing application.
This scoping review sought to map and analyze the existing literature on topical MFW-related pain management, particularly its significance for oncology and palliative care practitioners. The consolidation of this literature may offer valuable perspectives on potential treatments that could improve the quality of life, particularly for individuals with terminal cancer (Schmidt et al., 2020). Notably, this study represents the inaugural scoping review in its domain, aiming to aid researchers in advancing research trajectories and identifying lacunae within this area of study.
Cancer patients endure a myriad of symptoms, with pain being a prominent issue encompassing both neurophysiological and affective dimensions (Wood, 2021). This pain can intensify, worsen, and lead to a decline in bodily functions, feelings of sorrow, a pervasive sense of impending doom, as well as a range of emotions such as anxiety, fear, and uncertainty among individuals within this demographic (Brant, 2017).
In our review of 70 studies investigating 20 topical therapies, including dressings with various mechanisms of action, analgesic drugs, and antimicrobial substances, we found promising results in pain mitigation. However, only 31.4% of the studies utilized standardized pain assessment tools such as the Visual Analogue Scale, Numerical Verbal Scale, McGill's Questionnaire, and assessment by pain categories (no pain, weak, moderate, severe). Furthermore, a survey assessing attitudes and knowledge regarding pain assessment and treatment among healthcare providers revealed that nurses exhibited a lower level of knowledge in pain assessment and management (Nuseir et al., 2016).
In this review, the 20 identified topical treatments have been categorized into five groups: dressings, analgesic drugs, antimicrobial substances, negative pressure therapy, and cryotherapy, each comprising a range of products.
Research has predominantly focused on the use of dressings as a proposed method for topical therapy in managing pain associated with MFW. The emphasis has been on addressing the pain caused by the adhesion of dressings to the wound bed, making their removal challenging. This highlights the importance of safeguarding delicate tissue within the wound bed, particularly in cases of malignant fungating wounds (Woo et al., 2015; Woo & Sibbald, 2010).
Non-adherent dressings, such as polyurethane foam, silicone foams, silicone hydrocellular foam, fibers, and hydrofibers, have been recommended for facilitating painless removal. However, there remains a necessity to elucidate the optimal non-adherent therapy for managing MFWs, considering alterations in circulation and the presence of non-viable tissue. Additionally, absorbent dressings have been cited for their role in MFW-related pain management, addressing issues such as periwound dermatitis induced by excessive MFW exudation and the irritating components within the exudate (Gozzo et al., 2014; Tamai et al., 2016a).
In 11% of the studies with positive results on MFW pain control, the use of a non-adherent and absorbent polyurethane foam covered with Ibuprofen was highlighted. This finding is not unexpected, given that Ibuprofen brings anti-inflammatory and analgesic qualities to the wound bed. Nevertheless, further research with a primary focus on assessing this therapy's efficacy in managing MFW-related pain, accompanied by a thorough methodology description, would enhance the safety of its recommendation, taking into account its supplementary attributes of nonadherence and absorbency (Gottrup et al., 2008).
Topical opioids represent an alternative treatment modality. Opioid receptors are notably found within the peripheral nervous system, synthesized within the dorsal root ganglia, transported axonally to peripheral terminals, and become detectable following peripheral injuries and inflammation. The potential for pain relief through opioids in the context of an inflammatory process within the MFW beds has been suggested (Vardhan et al., 2019). Subsequent research endeavors could explore the efficacy of more potent opioids like fentanyl (Wang et al., 2017).
In a case study examining medical cannabis as a potential analgesic, a reduction in MFW-related pain was reported. Cannabinoids, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, have prompted research into topical formulations due to the expression and identification of cannabinoid receptors in peripheral neurons. Studies in animals have shown the analgesic effects of cannabinoids, either alone or in combination with other analgesics, with some attributing an enhancement in the antinociceptive effects of Morphine to cannabinoids (Maida et al., 2021; Nielsen et al., 2017).
Antimicrobial substances such as honey, Octenidine, polyhexanide, and metronidazole have demonstrated promising outcomes in managing pain associated with malignant fungating wounds (MFWs) by reducing the local microbial load, a key factor in pain induction as a classic sign of infection (Swanson & Angel, 2022). The progressive nature of cancer renders MFWs susceptible to microbial proliferation, particularly anaerobic microorganisms that contribute to wound odor, exudate, and pain. Consequently, the use of topical antimicrobial agents to control the microbial burden of MFWs has been linked to decreased exudate, odor, and pain levels (Vardhan et al., 2019; Villela-Castro et al., 2018; Finlayson et al., 2017b).
The case studies reviewed in this analysis utilized Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to address symptoms associated with Malignant Fungating Wounds (MFWs), yielding positive outcomes that enhanced patients' quality of life. Despite the contraindication of NPWT for MFWs, there is a call for comprehensive research on its application in palliative care settings (Riot et al., 2015). The mechanism of negative pressure establishes a sealed environment around the wound, regulating moisture levels, eliminating excess exudate, reducing microbial presence, enhancing perfusion, encouraging mitosis, and fostering granulation tissue development. However, these latter effects are not ideal for patients with MFWs, as mitosis is undesirable, and granulation is not the primary goal in managing such wounds (Cai et al., 2017). Additionally, the potential of malignant cells to stimulate the growth of fragile new blood vessels necessitates careful assessment and caution when considering NPWT for MFWs due to the associated risk of bleeding (Firmino et al., 2021).
Cryotherapy is known to induce cold-induced vasoconstriction and muscle spasms that impede nerve conduction, ultimately alleviating pain (Farah et al., 2021). Despite these effects, recent research has not yielded any primary studies assessing the efficacy of cryotherapy within the last five years. Consequently, cryotherapy has not been incorporated into the guidelines for managing pain in patients with MFWs as outlined by the European Oncology Nursing Society (EONS, 2015). The dearth of primary studies on cryotherapy could be attributed to the emergence of novel therapies and improved pain management strategies for MFWs that offer superior effectiveness and simplicity in application.
Wound-related pain extends beyond the wound bed to include the periwound skin. Moisture-associated skin damage (MFWs) can progress with high exudation, causing irritation to the periwound skin and presenting with inflammation, potential erosion, itching, pain, and the risk of skin damage due to infection (Tamai et al., 2016b). Given the persistent moisture, it is advisable to safeguard the periwound area by employing an appropriate barrier product that can repel excess moisture, thereby shielding the skin from subsequent harm (LeBlanc et al., 2021). Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of research investigating the efficacy of these products in patients with MFWs.
Patients frequently endure pain during dressing changes. By implementing meticulous application and removal techniques, utilizing appropriate irrigation methods, and making informed decisions regarding the frequency of dressing changes, healthcare providers can effectively enhance topical pain management (Woo, 2015).
This review restricted the search for articles to Portuguese, English, and Spanish. Despite this limitation, the search strategies yielded six articles in languages other than the specified ones, which were consequently excluded from this review (see supplementary table 3).
This scoping review examined the existing literature on topical therapies for managing MFW-related pain, encompassing 70 studies that investigated 20 different topical therapies. These therapies were classified into categories such as dressings (including non-adherent dressing, hydrogel, absorbent dressing, and anti-inflammatory dressing), analgesic drugs (such as topical opioids, topical anesthetics, and medical cannabis), antimicrobial substances (like antimicrobials, honey, and antiseptics), cryotherapy, and negative pressure wound therapy. For interventions targeting periwound skin, zinc oxide (in ointment and cream form), silicone (as an adhesive remover), dimethicone, petrolatum, acrylate, cyanoacrylate, hydrocolloid (both plate and powder), and a vitamin-rich ointment (containing vitamins A and D) were identified. Various technical considerations for managing MFW pain were highlighted, including irrigating with a warm solution, careful application and removal of dressings, avoiding debridement, maintaining a moist wound bed environment, cleaning with pH-appropriate soap, reducing dressing change frequency, and administering systemic analgesia prior to dressing application. Nevertheless, the review noted a scarcity of studies detailing the specific usage modes of these products and their efficacy for evidence-based practice.
Pain assessment was omitted in 68.5% of the studies reviewed. Nonetheless, among the included studies, 22 of them referenced specific pain assessment tools such as the Visual Analogue Scale, Numerical Verbal Scale, McGill Questionnaire, and a categorical assessment based on pain intensity levels (no pain, mild, moderate, severe).
This scoping review provides a systematic summary of the topical treatments available for managing MFW-related pain. The review identifies various topical therapies, including opioids, anesthetics, and antimicrobials, that are considered in clinical practice. However, there is a lack of prospective interventional studies that adequately describe the effectiveness of these treatments. Furthermore, none of the studies explored the cost-effectiveness or cost-benefits associated with these treatments, which are crucial aspects for their clinical implementation.
The randomized clinical trials have shown positive results for various topical therapies, including lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% and morphine gel 0.2% as analgesics, metronidazole 0.8% solution, polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) with betaine 0.1% solution, octenidine solution, honey, and silver as antimicrobials. Combining these topical therapies on the wound bed and periwound skin, along with employing techniques during dressing changes to prevent pain, has the potential to enhance the overall experience for individuals with MFWs (Figure 3).
This review did not critically evaluate the methodologies and quality of the studies, as it followed the aims and methods of a scoping review. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering the implications for clinical practice.
