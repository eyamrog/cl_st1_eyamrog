3 Abstract 31 Most triatomine bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) are hematophagous, though 32 Belminus species can live off of cockroach hemolymph to complete their life cycle. In this work 33 we described the fixed action pattern (FAP) employed by B. ferroae to identify, approach and 34 suck on a living cockroach. The FAP described here is composed of the following stereotyped 35 behaviors: 1) visual and/or olfactory detection of the cockroach, 2) reaching, 3) cautious 36 approach, 4) antennal exploration, 5) extension of the proboscis, 3) piercing to sedate, 5) walking 37 away and waiting (post sedation behavior), 6) second cautious approach, 7) extension of the 38 proboscis, 8) piercing to suck hemolymph. In order to identify chemicals cues that could elicit 39 such FAP, we examined the behavior of B. corredori, B. ferroae and B. herreri in response to the 40 cockroaches’ odor, fresh cockroach feces and fresh rodent wastes. The last two sources were 41 tested based on the assumption that abundant chemicals near host refuges could serve as cues for 42 host orientation. We found the cockroach odor emanating from a box significantly attracted B. 43 herreri in a still air olfactometer. The three Belminus species approached the captive cockroach 44 after one hour, but avoided to climb the box. Odors emanating from the cockroach feces attracted 45 B. corredori and B. ferroae in a Y-olfactometer. The FAP sequence observed suggests Belminus 46 bugs are not predators like the rest of reduviids (assassin bugs) —but are kleptophagous 47 ectoparasites, since they do not attack and kill a prey but rather steal hemolymph from its 48 invertebrate host. Triatomines and their hosts have intimately shared the same refuge for millions 49 of years. Similar odors occur across invertebrate and vertebrate refuges, and are recurrent in 50 human abodes, thus plausibly explaining how these kleptophagous bugs can readily switch to the 51 domestic habitat. 52

5 Introduction 56 The Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) or kissing bugs are the insect vectors of American 57 trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease. More than 18 million people are infected and approximately 58 120 million live at risk (Añez et al. 2004). However, according to an editorial published in The 59 Lancet (Anonymous 2006), Chagas illness is the most neglected of neglected human diseases. 60
61 Triatomine bugs have a unique way of life, they are nest-living ectoparasites (Guerin et al. 2000) 62 and vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae) –the causative agent of 63 Chagas disease. Triatomines usually live closely associated with their host, sharing the same 64 refuge and, constantly feeding on the same source during the course of their life. In natural 65 conditions most triatomine species bite humans and other vertebrate hosts during the night while 66 they sleep. These blood-sucking bugs acquire the zoonosis by biting an infected vertebrate host 67 (e.g, opossums, armadillos and bats, among others). In the bug the parasite goes into a 68 specialized stage, the epimastigote, which moves onto the rectum where it becomes infectious 69 (Schofield et al. 1987). Infectious T. cruzi are called metacyclic trypomastigotes. Triatomines 70 defecate during feeding or shortly after feeding, thus vectoring the parasites by defecating on 71 another host. The trypomastigotes in the feces are capable of swimming into the host's cells 72 using flagella. They enter the human host through the bite wound or by crossing mucous 73 membranes. The parasite T. cruzi is able to live in the gut of all triatomines, however, some bug 74 species are more efficient vectors than others due to different factors such as, triatomine density, 75 host preference (Gütler et al. 2009) and defecation index –i .e., time between feeding and 76 defecation (Aldana and Lizano 2004). 77 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
6 Triatomines are a coherent taxonomic group among reduviids (Schaefer 2005). They are 78 classified into 5 tribes and 15 genera including about 150 described species, most of which occur 79 exclusively in America (Otálora-Luna et al. 2015). Triatomines exhibit behavioral and 80 morphological features which distinguish them from most Reduviidae (or assassin bugs). 81 Triatomines are unusual among Reduviidae because they are structurally adapted to 82 hematophagy; although, not all are strict blood-sucking species, as we will show later. Reduviids 83 are themselves an unusual family of the large order Hemiptera (or true bugs). Reduviids are 84 unusual among the Hemiptera because almost all are terrestrial predators of other arthropods – 85 most other predatory Hemiptera are aquatic. It is widely accepted that triatomines derived or 86 evolved from primitive zoophagous reduviids (Cobben 1979). However, there is controversy 87 over whether this occurred once (monophyletic hypothesis) or more times (polyphyletic 88 hypothesis) during evolution (Otálora-Luna et al. 2015). Schaefer (2005) strongly suggested that 89 we can learn about the subfamily Triatominae by knowing such phylogenetic relationships. 90 According to this author there is enough consistence between behavioral, physiological and 91 morphological features around triatomines’ way of life to consider them a monophyletic or 92 paraphyletic (i.e., a natural) group. However, taxonomists of Triatominae have drawn more 93 attention to morphological traits than to behavioral patterns (Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979, Páez- 94 Rondón et al. 2019). In some cases taxonomic groups are indistinguishable in terms of their 95 morphological features (Hutchinson 1965), but even the most morphologically similar species 96 have distinguishable differences in their habits (Imanishi 2011). According to Imanishi, 97 ethological studies might serve to distinguish taxonomic groups. Although, behavior is not an 98 ordinary phenotypic attribute as not all behavioral traits are heritable, an important portion of 99 behavior, i.e. instincts, can be considered part of triatomine phenotype and can be accurately 100 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
7 measured if observational conditions are controlled following ethological precepts. According to 101 Lorenz (1966) “coordination of movements” or “phylogenetically adapted motor patterns” 102 characterize species and the concept of homology can be applied to them just as well as 103 morphological descriptions. The approach followed in this study has departed from the 104 mentioned ethological premises. We aim to learn about the subfamily Triatominae by describing 105 behavioral characters as indicators of phylogenetic relationships. The pursuit of a distinctive 106 behavioral pattern that is unique to Triatominae, i.e an autapomorphy, guided our current 107 experimental model. In this respect, we chose the genus Belminus as an experimental model to 108 identify an ethological feature that reveals phylogenetic relationships. 109
110 The genus Belminus (Bolboderini) is among the least well-known groups of triatomines, and is 111 composed of the species: Belminus corredori Galvão & Angulo, 2006; Belminus costaricensis 112 Herrer, Lent & Wygodzinsky, 1954; Belminus ferroae Sandoval, Pabón, Jurberg & Galvão, 113 2007; Belminus herreri Lent & Wygodzinsky, 1979; Belminus laportei Lent, Jurberg & 114 Carcavallo, 1995; Belminus peruvianus Herrer, Lent & Wygodzinsky; 1954, Belminus pittieri 115 Osuna &Ayala, 1993; and Belminus rugulosus Stål, 1859. The geographical distribution of these 116 relatively small (compared to other species of) triatomines is discontinuous and known only from 117 a scarce number of specimens captured in Central America, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, and 118 northern Brazil. B. peruvianus, B. herreri and B. ferroae have been reported vectoring T. cruzi 119 inside human dwellings of Peru and Colombia (Sandoval et al. 2010). Very little is known about 120 the genus Belminus, among other reasons, because it is difficult to maintain these species in 121 captivity. The feeding behavior of Belminus bugs is currently being unveiled, and the most 122 controversial revelation is that these peculiar species live off invertebrate hemolymph to 123 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
8 complete their life cycle. They are facultative bloodsuckers but can survive by exclusively 124 feeding on fluids of other arthropods. Sandoval et al. (2004, 2010) studies on B. herreri and B. 125 ferroae concluded that cockroaches (Blattodea: Blaberidae) are the principal hosts in human 126 abodes, although adults occasionally feed on humans. These authors captured B. herreri and B. 127 ferroae in houses where cockroaches were present; >86% of the intestinal contents tested reacted 128 with Periplaneta americana antiserum, while only a small proportion reacted to human blood 129 antisera. Sandoval et al. (2013) demonstrated that B. ferroae showed a higher fitness when 130 feeding on Blaberus cockroaches compared with mice, i.e. a higher adaptation to the invertebrate 131 host. 132
133 In this study, departing from an ethological approach, we aim to characterize Belminus genus 134 taxonomically by identifying and observing behavioral patterns elicited by sensory cues 135 emanating from the cockroach host. Given that Belminus are synanthropes and are involved in 136 maintaining the life cycle of T. cruzi, there is no doubt about their eco-epidemiological 137 relevance. But, there are phylogenetic concerns about the fact that Belminus, as members of 138 Triatominae, are not strict bloodsuckers. Belminus species feed on blood, however they can 139 complete their life cycle by exclusively feeding on arthropod hemolymph. Indeed, hemolymph is 140 the primary source of food of Belminus species when living in human adobes, as mentioned 141 above. Thus, hemaotophagia is not an obvious autapomorphy within Triatominae, which serves 142 as evidence against monophyly of this subfamily. The feeding behavior that distinguishes 143 Belminus would be a primitive habit among Reduviidae, which suggests that Belminus are 144 phylogenetically closer to their primitive reduviid cousins, the assassin bugs, and more distant 145 from bloodsucking triatomines. However, this bit of evidence add to previous bits of evidence, 146 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
9 which according to Schaefer (2005) “point in so many directions at once that, in fact, they point 147 in none and, so far, prove nothing”. In this work, instead of focusing on the quality of 148 triatomines’ meals (blood or hemolymph) we focused on the natural history of their feeding 149 behavior. We looked for a behavioral pattern that can be recognized as an autopomorphy, i.e. 150 shared by Belminus and all triatomine species. 151
152 When a kissing bug approaches to bite a host, it performs a highly stereotyped behavioral 153 sequence called fixed action pattern (FAP) which is relatively invariant within Triatominae, and 154 within Heteroptera. According to Páez-Rondón et al. (2018) different stimuli, such as 155 temperature, chemical, visual and olfactory cues alone suffice to initiate the FAP associated with 156 triatomine feeding. The behavioral sequence described by these authors starts with orientation 157 to an object; subsequently the following behaviors are observed: visualization, exploring with 158 the antennae, touching with the legs, extension of the proboscis and sucking of liquid. In this 159 work, based on Páez-Rondón et al. (2018) discovery, we described the FAP employed by B. 160 ferroae to identify, approach and suck a living cockroach. The “orientation” approach used by 161 this author and in the current study, according to Roeder (1998), is somewhere between 162 behaviorism (i.e., learning psychology) and ethology. Considering Crist (1998) criticism of the 163 semantic style of the founders of ethology –and considering some stylistic elements used by the 164 pioneers of the behavioral observation of animals (Darwin and Wallace 1858, Darwin 1983, 165 Humboldt 1991)– we searched for the distinctive innate traits that might facilitate the 166 phylogenetic placement of Belminus species. The primary question from an ethological 167 perspective was: how do Belminus species approach their prey compared to the ancestral assassin 168 bugs? Previous studies on triatomine orientation behavior have mainly focused on odors 169 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
10 emanating from the host’s skin and breath (Otálora-Luna et al. 2004, Guerenstein and Lazzari 170 2009, Aldana et al. 2008, Ortiz et al. 2011) which are by-products of the host-associated 171 microflora and host metabolism of vertebrates. For many vertebrates, chemicals present in feces 172 and urine constitute important signals that serve to mark their territory (Young and Henke 1999, 173 Brennan 2001); sylvatic hosts such as opossums, armadillos and bats, as well as synantrophic 174 host such as chickens dogs, cats and rodents cumulate excretory products in or near their nesting 175 sites. Triatomines –as ectoparasites– use emanations from such host waste when searching for 176 resources. Humans are not an exception; we have captured triatomine bugs in bathrooms, 177 latrines, sewers and trashcans in rural and urban endemic areas (Aldana and Otálora-Luna 2019). 178 Otálora-Luna and Guerin (2014) found that amines present in vertebrate waste (i.e. feces and 179 urine) attract Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma infestans and Panstrongylus geniculatus. To the best 180 of our knowledge this is the first time host’s feces were considered as a source of kairomones, 181 indicating a food source for triatomine bugs. These authors designed their experiments and 182 addressed their conclusions hypothesizing that triatomines are ectoparasites closely associated 183 with their host; normally sharing the same refuge. Given our ethological focus, in this study we 184 performed a selection of odor sources based on our previous ectoparasite hypothesis (Otálora- 185 Luna and Guerin 2014) and our previous experimental model, i.e. observation of triatomine FAP 186 (Páez-Rondón et al. 2018). In order to elucidate which chemical stimuli emanating from host 187 excretions trigger the feeding instinct of Belminus, we assessed the orientation responses of B. 188 corredori, B. ferroae and B. herreri to volatiles produced by cockroaches and host wastes, as 189 well as rodent wastes. 190

11 Summarizing, this study aimed to describe a) the FAP associated with feeding in Belminus, b) 192 determine if host volatiles alone elicit the FAP or chemotaxis in Belminus, and c) propose such 193 FAP as a character that distinguish Belminus and all triatomines from other reduviids. 194

12 Materials and methods 197 Insects 198 The fifth-instar individuals of Belminus species used in this study originated from laboratory 199 colonies containing insects that were collected from domiciles in different localities of Colombia 200 (Sandoval et al. 2004, Galvão and Angulo 2006, Sandoval et al. 2010). Collected bugs were 201 captured from the following Colombian locations: B. ferroae specimens were captured in Santa 202 Catalina (07°07′26″N, 72°11′24″) and San Alberto (17°12′40″N, 72°19′12″) in the municipality 203 of Toledo, Northern Santander; B. herreri specimens were captured around a house in the 204 municipality of El Carmen, Santander (6°39′30″N, 73°38′56″) and in dwellings in the 205 municipality of San Martin, Cesar (07°58′47″N, 73°32′26″); and B. corredori specimens were 206 captured in a house in San Gil, Santander (6°33′18″N, 73°04′00″). Colonies started in the 207 laboratory during the following years: B. herreri in 2000, B. corredori in 2002 and B. ferroae in 208 2005. Bugs were fed on cockroaches in laboratory conditions as described by Sandoval et al. 209 (2013). Belminus colony has been at the premises of the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific 210 Research (Mérida, Venezuela) for five years. Insects were kept at 23 ± 2°C, 82 ± 7% RH 211 (relative humidity) in light dark cycle of 12/12 hours, and starved for 8–12 days from emergence 212 before assays. They were fed 5th nymphs of Blaberus giganteus cockroaches (Blaberidae), which 213 were fed food formulated for canines and corn seeds. Belminus bugs and cockroaches shared the 214 same container since hatching for 5 months. Each bug was used only once to avoid bias from 215 learning (Aldana et al. 2008). 216

13 Behavioral observations 218 Three different arenas were used to study the behavior of Belminus species. Bioassays were 219 conducted at 24 °C and 68% RH, and were illuminated by fluorescent ceiling lights (brightness 220 2000 lux, color temperature 4000 K), unless otherwise specified. All experiments were 221 performed in Merida, Venezuela, between 1700 and 1860 meters above the sea level. 222 Arena 1: Ethological responses of B. ferroae were examined in a 10 cm Petri dish made of glass, 223 where a 3-cm living B. giganteus nymph was enclosed with a B. ferroae bug (Fig 1Ai). Phase I: 224 In the first part of the experiment the cockroach was confined in a 5.8 cm plate tight to the center 225 of the arena with a low odor thermoplastic adhesive (tec bond 341, HotMelt), to avoid odor 226 escaping from around the lid. Thus, only visual contact was allowed between the cockroach and 227 the bug. The location and behavior of the cockroach and the triatomine were recorded for 10 228 minutes. Phase II: The cockroach was released, so both individuals could physically interact for 229 10 additional minutes. Controls: These consisted of a second series of two bioassays in which 230 either the cockroach or the bug were absent. Each experiment was repeated 10 times. 231
232 Arena 2: Orientation responses of B. corredori, B. ferroae and B. herreri to an odorous still air 233 were tested in a square glass arena (29 x 29 cm). A living fifth instar B. giganteus was confined 234 in an opaque-black cardboard box (length 6.5, wide 8 cm, height 2.5), placed in the center of a 235 side (Fig 1B). The side of the box facing the center of the arena had 12 holes (dia. 2 mm). A 236 similar empty box was placed as a control at the other end. Each bug was placed in a central 3 237 cm circle. The bug, initially covered with a circular Petri dish (2.8 cm), was released after 2 min 238 of adaptation. We noted which half of the arena the insect preferred during a 5 minute period. A 239 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
14 bug was considered attracted to cockroach volatiles if it preferred the half of the arena where the 240 cockroach was present. In a secondary phase of the bioassay, the position of the bug was noted 241 after one hour of starting each experiment. A bug was considered attracted if it ended next to the 242 box where the cockroach was present, i.e. no more than 3 cm far from the box. As some 243 Belminus individuals may be reluctant to move for long periods (sometimes hours) after being 244 manipulated, insects that did not leave the circle after five minutes were discarded (23%). 245 Stimuli positions were interchanged every 2 insects; the arena was cleaned before making such 246 changes. In order to test for asymmetries in the experimental setup Belminus bugs were observed 247 in an odorless control trial, where two empty boxes were placed in the arena. Each experiment 248 was repeated 20 times. 249 Arena 3: Triatomine responses to an odorous air current were tested in a Y-tube dual choice 250 olfactometer made of glass (Fig 1C). The three Belminus species were tested separately against 251 volatiles emanating from 1) living cockroaches, 2) cockroach feces, and 3) mouse feces. One 252 triatomine bug was allowed to a) walk upwind in the stem (length 22 cm, i.d. 2.370 cm, e.d 2.804 253 cm), and once it reached the junction, b) made a choice between the two arms (length 13 cm) of 254 the Y-olfactometer. Orientation was quantified by recording triatomines’ choice. All individuals 255 walked from the base of the Y olfactometer and made a decision. A preliminary spatial control 256 experiment with two clean arms was performed to test asymmetries, and no significant 257 differences were found. A pump was used to draw charcoal-filtered air (stimulus controller, CS- 258 55, Syntech) from the two arms (10 ± 2 cm/s airspeed as measured by a hot-wire anemometer, 259 2440, Kurtz, accuracy ± 0.01 m/s), one of which was connected to a 500 ml glass gas-wash 260 bottle containing the odor source; the other one held a similar clean (control) bottle. Both air- 261 streams reached the ‘‘Y’’ stem (23± 2 °C and 70 % RH as measured by a thermo-hygrometer, 262 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
15 EA80, Extech Instruments, accuracy ± 3% RH and ± 1 °C). Tubes, fittings and valves were made 263 of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, International Polymer Solutions Inc). Headspace odors –i.e. 264 volatiles emanating from the vapor phase above the sample in a vial– were tested by placing the 265 odorous samples (see next section) in 500 ml glass gas-wash bottles. Bottles were left to 266 equilibrate for at least 10 min before blowing volatiles, and an additional 15 minutes elapsed 267 between experiments so cockroaches and wastes had time to emit more volatiles. Air blown over 268 filter paper and rice hulls dampened with 5 ml of water served as controls for cockroach feces 269 and mouse wastes respectively. The control for cockroaches consisted of a clean gas-wash bottle 270 with a similar wet filter paper. Water served to add humidity to match the humidity produced by 271 organic samples (Otálora-Luna and Guerin 2014). The air-stream passing through the bottles was 272 injected at 150 ml/min. Bugs walking on the Y-olfactometer were stimulated until a response 273 was observed, < 30 min. Flask positions were interchanged for every insect. The Y- 274 olfactomenter was cleaned before changing positions. In order to test for asymmetries in the 275 experimental setup Belminus bugs were observed in an odorless control trial, where two empty 276 bottles were tested. In order to remove odors from the laboratory the experimental setup was 277 positioned near an exhaust hood, which was able to exchange the air in the room 15 times per 278 hour. Mouse waste was not tested on B. herreri as this colony was not large enough to provide an 279 adequate number of naïve individuals. 280
281 Odor collection for arena 3 282 Cockroach odors emanated from three living B. giganteus 5th nymphs. Cockroach feces were 283 collected (20 g) and separated from extraneous material (e.g., dead insects, exuviae, oothecae 284 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
16 and food waste) from the bottom of the containers used for mass-rearing of B. giganteus. Mouse 285 wastes (30 g) consisted of rice hulls impregnated with feces and urine of these rodents (albino 286 mice, strain NMRI). All samples were placed separately in 500 ml glass gas-wash bottles. 287
288 Visual recording of arenas 289 To analyze behavioral details of Arenas 1-3, frontal and top views of the experimental arenas 290 were filmed full-screen using a video CMOS camera (EOS Rebel T7i, Canon) equipped with a 291 zoom lens (EF-S 15-55 mm f, IS, Canon) coupled to a macro lens (close-up +10, 58 mm, 292 Commander) to obtain a field view of 40 mm (in the diagonal) –a pivoting base allowed to 293 visually cover the entire arena. Experiments were conducted in a darkened room. The source of 294 light for arenas 1 and 2 consisted of a LED lamp (2850K, 570 lumens, Reveal, General Electric). 295 The source of light for arena 3 consisted of a LED infrared lamp (840 nm, Cmvision) –the 296 infrared sensitivity of the camera allowed to observe the experiments in the dark. Recordings 297 were analyzed by a computer video software (version 9.1.2.7, Wondershare Filmora9) for 298 playback, tracking and editing. The ethological language used to describe triatomine behaviors 299 followed suggestions of Kogon (1941) and Crist (1998). 300
301 Statistics 302 Comparisons of behavioral responses observed in the arena 1 were made using one-tailed 303 binomial test. Comparison of behavioral responses for each species in the arenas 2 and 3 were 304 made using two-tailed binomial test. A chi-square test of independence was performed to 305 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
17 examine the relation between the Belminus species and orientation responses in arenas 2 and 3. 306 When dependence resulted insignificant in the previous test, Belminus species were treated as a 307 single group –as a genus– for a two-tailed binomial test. When dependence resulted significant, 308 multiple chi-square pairwise comparisons were performed among species, after post hoc Holm- 309 Bonferroni correction (Ruxton and Beauchamp 2008). Statistical analyses were analyzed using R 310 (version 3.5.3, Vienna, Austria; Ihaka and Gentleman 1996). 311

18 Results 314 Arena 1 315 Phase I: B. ferroae nymphs walked along the border (sidewall) of the 10-cm dish; showing 316 positive thigmotaxis (Fig 1A). The bugs hardly ever edged the 5-cm dish, which contained the 317 cockroach (two bugs, each on one occasion). Most bugs depicted a swinging walk along the 318 perimeter of the former dish, alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise directions. 319 This to-and-fro circuit approximated and rarely exceeded 180°. Triatomine walking bouts were 320 not continuous but were punctuated by stops, which comprised 20% of the time. The cockroach 321 showed several attempts to escape by moving into the confined space, occasionally ramming 322 against the sidewall of the dish. There were no obvious sings of interaction between the 323 triatomine and the cockroach despite their proximity. 324 Phase II: Shortly after being released the cockroach moved profusely and showed positive 325 thigmotaxis; although walking tracks were discontinuous ―punctuated by stops. The bug 326 interrupted the positive thigmotactic behavior and remained motionless for 5 seconds. Then the 327 bug faced the cockroach and lifted the anterior part of its body (~40°) through an extension of its 328 forelegs in order to reach higher with its antennae held up (~60° with respect to ground), a 329 behavior referred to here as reaching. The bug continuously waved its antennae (i.e., semaphore 330 movement, ~30°). Eventually, when the cockroach came to a halt, the bug stopped reaching and 331 walked very cautiously to the cockroach (Fig 1B) by bending down the anterior part of its body 332 through flexing of their forelegs (i.e., stalking). Thus, the triatomine walking velocity decreased 333 substantially compared to the previous phase. The bug approached the abdomen of the cockroach 334 and touched it with its antennas (i.e., antennal exploration). Then the bug extended the 335 proboscis, pierced the cockroach abdomen briefly (~2 seconds), and finally walked away. 336 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
19 Proboscis flexibility allowed the bug to pierce the cockroach from below (Fig 1Ca). After 10 337 seconds of being pierced, the cockroach experienced alternating spasms with slow, clumsy and 338 erratic movements. The cockroach displayed obvious sings of disorientation. In such condition, 339 the cockroach did not show positive thigmotaxis but rather slow wide-ranging movements. The 340 occasion was seized to approach the cockroach in the same manner as before –the triatomine 341 bug walked cautiously and eventually inserted the stylets. This time the bug sucked cockroach 342 hemolymph for 2 minutes; repeating this kleptophagic behavior on two or more occasions. The 343 triatomine abdomen swelled prominently. Summarizing the description of Belminus’ FAP we 344 categorized the following stereotyped behaviors: 1) visual and/or olfactory detection of the 345 cockroach, 2) reaching, 3) cautious approach, 4) antennal exploration, 5) extension of the 346 proboscis, 3) piercing to sedate, 5) walking away and waiting (post sedation behavior), 6) second 347 cautious approach, 7) extension of the proboscis, 8) piercing to suck hemolymph. The sequences 348 6-8 were repeated more than once. The cockroach did not die. 349 Controls: During the control experiments, where only one of the two insects was present, the 350 triatomine bug and the cockroach showed similar behaviors to those observed in the phase I. 351 The FAP described in the phase II was not observed during the phase I or during the two 352 controls (P<0.001). 353
354 Arena 2 355 During the first 5 min B. herreri orientated their walks toward the cockroach (78%, P=0.012), 356 however B. corredori (65%, P=0.169) and B. ferroae (58%, P=0.193) orientation did not 357 significantly differ from random (Fig 2). The chi-square test of independence showed that the 358 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
20 three species did not behave differently (P=0.501). Thus, when we tested the three species a as 359 group (n=56); Belminus genus oriented its walk towards the cockroach (68%, P=0.0029). 360 Eventually, after 1 hour, all individuals from the three species ended up approaching the box 361 (100%, P<0.001), and remained 0.5-3 cm close, but the odors or vibrations induced by the 362 captive cockroach prevented the bugs from contacting the box. Bugs made explorative 363 approaches to the box, by touching it with antennae and brief walks, but eventually desisted from 364 climbing. The FAP or proboscis extension were not observed in this arena, only chemotaxis 365 was observed. 366 Controls: During the odorless control experiments, where two empty boxes were tested on B. 367 corredori (n=20), orientation did not significantly differ from random (left: 9, right: 11, 368 P=0.160). 369
370 Arena 3 371 The FAP or proboscis extension were not observed in the Y-olfactometer, only chemotaxis was 372 observed in certain cases. When one arm of the Y-olfactometer was provided with the headscape 373 of living cockroaches and the other with clean air, B. corredori (P=0.005), B. ferroae (P=0.04) 374 and B. herreri (P=0.014) avoided the odorous air current (Fig 3). The chi-square test of 375 independence showed that there was no significant relation between species and behavioral 376 responses (P=0.347); Belminus genus (n=52) avoided volatiles emanating from cockroaches 377 (79%, P=0.000013). 378 Similarly, B. corredori (P=0.001) and B. ferroae (P=0.008) avoided the extreme of the Y- 379 olfactometer when provided with the headscape of mouse wastes (Fig 3). The chi-square test of 380 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
21 independence showed that there was no significant relation between species and behavioral 381 responses (P=0.477); Belminus genus (n=48) avoided volatiles emanating from mouse wastes 382 (79%, P=0.000023). 383 However, volatiles emanating from cockroach feces attracted B. corredori (P=0.019) and B. 384 ferroae (P=0.003), while B. herreri did not show attraction or avoidance behaviors (P=0.0541). 385 The chi-square test of independence showed that there was a significant relation between species 386 and behavioral responses (P=0.0208). When performing multiple pairwise comparisons, chi- 387 square tests showed that the behavioral responses of B. corredori and B. ferroae were not 388 different (P=0.766), the behavioral responses of B. corredori and B. herreri were not different 389 (P=0.0683), and the behavioral responses of B. ferroae and B. herreri were different (P=0.0392) 390 (Fig 3). 391 Controls: During the odorless control experiments, where two empty flasks were tested on B. 392 corredori (n=22), orientation did not significantly differ from random (left: 12, right: 10, 393 P=0.154). 394

22 Discussion 398 Páez-Rondón et al. (2018) exposed R. prolixus, T. infestans and P. geniculatus to a drop of 399 water, a plastic dummy and a piece of guava fruit, and discovered that all of these objects elicit 400 the FAP associated with feeding. In this study, we report for the first time such behavioral 401 pattern in Belminus –from an ethological point of view– which reveals the novelty of our work. 402
403 Furthermore, according to Tinbergen (1963) an ethologist will attempt to recognize elements of 404 animal’s own behavior; we showed that kleptophagy is a phenomena proper (sensu Portmann 405 1967, Kleisner 2008, Kleisner 2015, Aldana and Otálora-Luna 2019) of Belminus genus and the 406 rest of triatomines. The manner in which Belminus bugs approached the cockroach, performing a 407 highly stereotyped sequence that ended in proboscis lifting and sucking, and that did not result in 408 the immediate death of the host, defines its phyloegentic relationship within Triatominae. 409
410 Belminus bite was not toxic to the cockroach but rather analgesic. Furthermore, when rearing 411 Belminus triatomines in our laboratory we have observed that a single cockroach is able to 412 survive after being bitten by a dozens of these bugs for many months (data not shown). Most 413 predator reduviids have highly toxic venoms which kill the prey immediately (Walker et al. 414 2018). Triatomine saliva is not that toxic but is able to inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels 415 which may account for the anesthetic effect (Walker et al. 2016). From these physiological 416 studies and our ethological observations we might conclude that Belminus are not able to kill its 417 prey but to parasite its host. The use of the terms parasite and host could be debated since 418 triatomines do not live directly on the host –as ticks, lice or fleas. However, triatomines closely 419 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
23 share their lives with their hosts, in the same refuge, and that is why Guerin et al. (2000) called 420 them ectoparasites. Alternatively, we could also call triatomines carnivores (Cobben 1979, 421 Livingstone et al. 1998), zoophagous (Boyd et al. 2002) or micropredators (Poulin and 422 Randhawa 2013, Wilson et al. 2017). But these categories are less concrete; for example, 423 contrary to mosquitos, which have been catalogued as micropredators, triatomines live closely 424 associated with their host. In any case, the purpose that prevails here is to behaviorally and 425 phylogenetically distinguish triatomines from the rest of reduviids. The parasitic strategy 426 (kleptophagy) described in this study is found only in one taxon (Triatominae), but not found in 427 any other outgroup reduviid taxa (Reduviidae subfamilies). 428
429 Another aspect worth considering is the form of the proboscis of triatomines which is very 430 different from the rest of reduviids (Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979). Reduviids have a hook- 431 shaped proboscis that when extended points downwards. However, the triatomine proboscis is 432 straight and possesses a membranous joints, a treat used by Lent and Wygodzinsky (1979) to 433 distinguish the Triatominae from other reduviid subfamilies. This morphological feature is 434 associated with the hematophagous –and kleptophagous– habit that distinguish triatomines. 435 Belminus bugs used such proboscis flexibility to pierce the cockroach from below in arena 1. 436 The proboscis behavior performed by Belminus and all triatomines is not possible within 437 predator reduviids which have a hook-shaped proboscis solely capable of piercing its prey 438 from above. Cobben (1979) regards triatomines as an “advanced” subfamily within Reduviidae 439 according to this mouth-part structure and function. Such morphologic-behavioral coupling 440 (sensu Varela 1988) illustrates a structural adaptation (sensu Croizat 1962, Greham 1984, 441 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
24 Otálora-Luna et al. 2017), and deserves special consideration as it might be tracing the course 442 of evolution of kleptophagy in these insects (Aldana et al. 2019). 443
444 Belminus is able to detect thermal cues as they feed on humans and other homoeothermic 445 vertebrates. But, they prefer poikilothermic arthropods as hosts (Sandoval et al. 2013), whose 446 temperature rarely exceeds that of warm-blood vertebrates. Wigglesworth and Gillett (1934 a,b) 447 suggested that triatomines are attracted to their host mainly by warmth. Vinauger et al. (2013) 448 stated that “heat constitutes the only necessary and sufficient signal to trigger the PER” or 449 proboscis extension response (Flores and Lazzari 1996). Haridass and Ananthakrishnan (1980) 450 stated that “unlike predatory reduviids, in the hematophagous T. rubrofasciata, feeding behavior 451 is elicited only by a temperature gradient arising from their vertebrate hosts, as is also the case 452 with other blood feeding insects”. In disagreement with these statements we suggest that feeding 453 behavior in all Triatomine subspecies is not solely driven by heat. In line with previous studies, 454 visual, olfactory and tactile stimuli can also trigger the FAP (Páez-Rondón et al. 2018). In this 455 study we confirmed that non-thermal stimuli from poikilothermic insects elicit positive taxis and 456 the FAP in Belminus species. Such elicitation flexibility of stimuli for triggering orientation 457 behaviors and the FAP was decisive in the change of behavior that permitted the primitive 458 predateous reduviids to become kleptophagous, driving the evolution of Triatominae. 459 Presumably, early triatomines fed on abundant soft invertebrates in the nests and burrows of 460 vertebrates, then later encountered their defenseless newly born offspring, tasted them, extended 461 the proboscis, punctured and penetrated their skin (Otálora-Luna et al. 2015). The peculiar form 462 and flexibility of triatomine proboscis appeared, the quality of their saliva became less toxic and 463 more analgesic, and their FAP acquired a kleptopagous aspect (sensu Portmann 1967), thus 464 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
25 triatomines became an advanced group among Reduviidae. Eventually, this elicitation flexibility 465 also facilitated the process of domestication of several sylvatic species, like Belminus sp. 466
467 The feeding FAP observed here is derived from an ancestral pattern of hemipterans. Hatfield et 468 al. (1983) described similar sequential behaviors associated with feeding in the phytophagous 469 bug Lygus lineolaris (Hemiptera: Miridae). Haridass et al. (1987) distinguish a series of 470 categories where reduviids can be grouped based on their approaching behaviors during feeding: 471 (i) 'blood feeding' type, (ii) 'sticky-trap' type, (iii) 'raptorial' type, (iv) 'wait and grab' type, (v) 'pin 472 and jab' type and (vi) 'chase and pounce' type. Reduviid predators exhibit an “assessing” and 473 “ambush” strategy (Edwards 1962, Ables 1978), which is different from the FAP described for 474 Belminus vis à vis the way the victim is handled. A typical member of the Harpactocorinae sits 475 "pinned” and waits for a prey to arrive on a flower to “jab” it (Haridass et al. 1988, Ambrose 476 1999). Edwards (1962) described the feeding FAP for the harpactocorine Rhinocoris carmelita 477 and the reduviine Platymeris rhadamanthus as follow: arousal, orientation, fixation, approach, 478 (facultative) pounce, extension of rostrum, grasping, apprehension, insertion of styletes and 479 injection of saliva. Srikumar et al. (2014) described the feeding FAP for harpactorine reduviid 480 predators as follow: arousal, approach, capture, rostral thrust, paralyzing, sucking, and post- 481 predatory behaviors. Other authors have described similar behavioral sequences in Reduviidae 482 (Ables 1978, Haridass and Ananthakrishnan 1980). Ables (1978) observed that “smaller, more 483 mobile prey are usually ‘ambushed’, whereas larger, less mobile prey are ‘stalked’” and “when 484 prey were detected the predator became motionless with the fore tibiae raised and the antennae 485 extended.” This author added that “initial contact with prey usually consisted of antennation and 486 then insertion of the predator's proboscis”. According to Srikumar et al. (2014) “after prey were 487 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
26 pinned and jabbed, the reduviids paralyzed them by injecting toxic saliva”. Some reduviid 488 species transport the prey beneath leaves and twigs to a safe and secluded place before sucking 489 out its body fluids (Srikumar et al. 2014). Sometimes they grip it with the fore and mid-legs until 490 the victim succumbs (Edwards 1962). 491
492 Such ambushing, grasping, dragging, apprehension, paralyzing and similar murderous behaviors 493 were not observed in Belminus bugs. The paralyzing (lethal) effect elicited by assassin bugs 494 differs from the sedation effect caused by Belminus, as the latter do not pursue to kill but to 495 ectoparasite. Triatomines have adapted to live together with their hosts. It should be stressed that 496 cockroaches eventually recover from lethargy after being sucked, and shall survive for upcoming 497 bites. Thus, Belminus species are not predators like the rest of reduviids. Belminus are not 498 assassin bugs. As with other triatomine species, Belminus are not real hunters but thieves, i.e., 499 ectoparasites that take advantage of the least carelessness of the host to steal its fluids. 500
501 This suggest that kleptophagy is an ethological (i.e. taxonomic, phylogenetic and evolutionary) 502 characteristic of Belminus as well as of Triatominae. Since, Belminus are not strict 503 hematophagous, this trait might deserve taxonomic revision. We propose to consider 504 kleptophagy as an attribute that groups triatomines. Kleptophagy is a non-aggressive behavior 505 which contrast with the violent predatory behaviors that characterize ancestral reduviids. 506

27 Immelmann (1983) underline that while appetitive behavior might contain taxis components as 508 well as FAP, not all taxis derive in FAP. Clearly, the FAP requires an external stimulus to be 509 triggered but different modalities alone could be sufficient. In arena 1, phase 1, visual cues –if 510 apparent to Belminus bugs– were not sufficient to trigger the FAP or host mediated taxis. 511 Probably, the bug was not able to see the cockroach through the glass. However, we have 512 previously observed that a visual cue –a plastic dummy resembling a drop of water– is sufficient 513 to elicit the FAP (Páez-Rondón et al. 2018). It is difficult to stablish which cues elicited the FAP 514 when the glass barrier was removed (phase 2) but, certainly the FAP was triggered until 515 completion by the presence of the host, and probably visual cues played an important role in this 516 opportunity. Extension of the fixed bug’s proboscis to the cockroach and sucking observed in 517 arena 1 may be catalogued as a reflexes (Páez-Rondón et al. 2018). Approach to the cockroach 518 (arena 1), to the black box containing the cockroach (arena 2) and positive decisions made in the 519 Y-tube (arena 3) may be catalogued as taxis. Taxis, proboscis extension and sucking are clearly 520 part of the FAP, and at some point there is a superposition of all of them (Tinbergen 1951, 521 Lorenz 1977, Eibl-Eibesfeldt I 1979). While, olfaction was required in arenas 2 and 3 to elicit 522 taxis behavior, it was not sufficient to elicit the FAP. 523
524 For future studies, we suggest to test olfaction and visual cues alone, using a cockroach dummy 525 or providing multimodal stimuli on the servosphere –to see whether olfaction is sufficient –or 526 only required– to elicit FAP. We also suggest to combine different stimuli to clarify how 527 convergence between visual (different light treatments) and olfactory cues works (Reisenman et 528 al. 2000, Otálora-Luna and Dickens 2011). 529 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
28 Only B. herreri showed significant attraction to the black box where the cockroach was confined, 530 during the first 5-min period in the still-air olfactometer. Thus, this species was able to detect the 531 cockroach in still air conditions at 10 cm (78%, arena 2). Interestingly, the three species were 532 attracted to the cockroach odors after one hour. Probably, B. corredori and B. ferroae reached 533 the box containing the cockroach by chance after one hour of trial-and-error, but it is worth to 534 note that all tested bugs continued walking close to this box after that hour, thus a short-range 535 attraction effect can be inferred from this experiment; although proboscis extension was never 536 observed. They made attempts to climb the box, but cockroach’s movements, and probably 537 pungent odors, caused the triatomine bugs to keep a distance. Such Belminus’ avoidance reaction 538 merits further ethological and physiological consideration. The difference between the initial 539 attraction and the attraction at the end of an hour could also indicate that the cockroaches were 540 not the preferred host, suggesting that there is a greater latency to react to cues emitted by 541 cockroaches. Probably, these Belminus species have different hosts in nature. Our knowledge of 542 Belminus' sylvatic life is very limited. For future studies, we suggest improvement of these 543 arenas in order to test olfaction alone, without any visual cues, to determine whether olfaction is 544 sufficient (or only required) to elicit the FAP. We also recommend sampling and observing 545 Belminus bugs living in natural conditions, a real challenge! 546
547 Belminus species were not attracted to volatiles emitted by cockroaches in the Y-olfactometer, 548 and indeed the three species B. corredori, B. ferroae and B. herreri avoided this odor. This result 549 was surprising as the three Belminus bugs tested in this study have lived exclusively off 550 cockroach hemolymph. The cockroaches acted stressed, i.e. exhibiting compulsive movements, 551 in the olfactometer flask probably due to the negative pressure produced by the air flow. 552 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
29 Possibly, they were producing allomones (i.e., defensive volatile secretions) during the 553 experiments (Schal 1992), which might explain the avoidance behaviors observed here. Mouse’s 554 wastes were also avoided by B. corredori and B. ferroae. Avoidance of mice feces might be due 555 to potential predation by this vertebrate. However, both species were attracted to volatiles 556 emanating from cockroach feces. Sandoval et al. (2004, 2010, 2013) demonstrated that Belminus 557 species are much better adapted to cockroaches than to mice. These authors found domestic 558 Belminus species closely living in, and feeding on, cockroaches in human houses. In nature, 559 sylvatic Belminus are probably associated with insect-hosts living under rocks or in tree barks, or 560 are associated with invertebrates living inside vertebrate refuges such as caves, borrows, nests, 561 etc. Our result confirmed the hypothesis proposed previously by Otálora-Luna and Guerin (2014) 562 –volatiles from host wastes (i.e. cockroach feces) emanating from host refuges stimulate 563 triatomines searching behavior. 564
565 But, which volatiles are emitted by cockroach feces? Besides specific pheromones (Schal 1992), 566 nitrogenous compounds such as ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine 567 (Sakuma and Fukami 1990) as well as carboxylic acids such as acetic, propionic, isobutyric, 568 butyric, isovaleric and valeric acid (McFarlane and Alli 1985) are major components of the 569 excreta of cockroaches, many of which elicit searching behaviors in other triatomine species 570 (Guerenstein and Lazzari 2009, Ortiz et al. 2011, Otálora-Luna and Guerin 2014). Ammonia 571 attracts triatomines and emanates in large amounts from both vertebrate feces (Otálora-Luna and 572 Guerin 2014) as well as from cockroaches’ feces (Mullins and Cochrand 1972). Belminus 573 avoidance responses to mice wastes and attraction responses to cockroach feces suggest that 574 Belminus species might recognize unknown specific as well as known general volatiles (e.g. 575 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
30 ammonia, CO2, carboxylic acids, aromatics, etc.) emitted by excretory products of their host. 576 Odors from vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, while sharing several molecules, produce 577 ambivalent effects depending on the dose, combination with other molecules, combination with 578 other modalities (e.g. visual cues), physiological state of the insect, among other factors. For 579 example, we know that isobutyric acid and ammonia have different behavioral effects on 580 triatomines depending on the dose. They evoke repellency and scape responses when released “ 581 suddenly” at high doses but are attractive at low doses (Schofield 1975, Guerenstein and Guerin 582 2001, Otálora-Luna and Guerin 2014). Such parsimony or use of the same chemical as a releaser 583 of different behaviors is common in arthropods (Blum 1996). This might explain how the 584 cockroach in arena 1 elicited the FAP while the cockroach in the box (arena 2) or in the bottle 585 (arena 3) did not elicited the FAP. Probably, the visual and/or physical (tactile) presence of the 586 cockroach was required as volatiles were not sufficient. 587
588 The use of waste odors to find resources is a structural adaptation widespread in triatomines, 589 given that the associated volatile organic compounds are end-products derived from generally 590 occurring metabolites of vertebrate and invertebrate gut flora metabolism and, as such, do not 591 vary greatly between hosts (Otálora-Luna and Guerin 2014). These compounds could play an 592 important role in house invasion by triatomine, as has been mentioned elsewhere (Otálora-Luna 593 and Guerin 2014). Belminus species could well make use of the same general chemical cues they 594 use to locate wild hosts for the exploitation of synanthropic invertebrates (e.g., cockroaches) 595 since similar odors occur across invertebrates and vertebrates, thus plausibly explaining how 596 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.892 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
31 these small triatomines can readily switch to the domestic habitat (Otálora-Luna and Guerin 597 2014, Otálora-Luna et al. 2016). 598
599 Strict blood-feeding has been considered a behavioral feature that group Triatominae (Lent and 600 Wygodzinsky 1979). However, as Belminus does not strictly depend on blood, such taxonomic 601 character must be revised. The inconsistency does not necessarily compromises the systematic 602 identification of the group. A proper behavioral category shall comprise Belminus as a 603 triatomine. As kleptophagy is hitherto an advanced and unusual feature in Hemiptera and in 604 Reduviidae itself, we believe Triatominae is a single evolutionary unit that has evolved only 605 once –i.e. Triatominae is monophyletic (sensu Schaefer 2005). During the course of evolution 606 Belminus bugs have selected and adapted those behavioral sequences that fit better to a) their 607 ancestral constraints (Triatominae), b) physiological needs (carnivorous) and c) ecological 608 scenarios (ectoparasitism). One surmises that kleptophagic behaviors of Belminus species 609 detailed here have contributed to their match to the synanthropic niche. The presence of 610 cockroaches in human houses facilitates Belminus species adaptation to the human habitat, where 611 both cockroaches and humans are potential targets. 612
613 A better ethological –behavioral, systematic, evolutionary, etc.– understanding of the 614 Triatominae is essential for the development of novel control programs. In particular, the study 615 of instinctive behaviors of Belminus and other triatomine species is critical in the design of 616 experiments aimed at improving control technologies. 617
