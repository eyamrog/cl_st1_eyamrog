ABSTRACT Objectives: This study aimed at identifying and characterizing the physical activity and/or physical exercise intervention study protocols for breast cancer treatment. The types, frequency, duration, intensity and timing of the therapeutic intervention with physical activity are highlighted, in addition to showing the results found. Methods: Based on the guidelines of PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), a search was carried out in five databases (Cochrane Library; PubMed Central®; ScienceDirect; Scopus Elsevier and Web of science). There was no restriction SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2956 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) regarding idiom or year of publication. The studies found were evaluated manually and with the assistance of the Rayyan software by two researchers, blindly and independently. The following keywords were used as a search strategy: ‘breast cancer’ AND ‘physical activity’ OR ‘physical exercise’, AND ‘protocol study’ OR ‘study protocol’. The inclusion criteria comprised study protocols of randomized clinical trials with the intervention of physical activity and/or physical exercise in women undergoing breast cancer treatment and during post-treatment. Results: 806 articles were found. The duplicates and the ones that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded, thus, 17 articles remained for the review. The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool was used for the methodological evaluation of the studies classified as having a ‘low risk’ of bias, which showed methodological rigor. Aerobic exercises, endurance training, dance, Pilates, exercises guided by applications and internet software were highlighted. Moderate intensity exercises were evidenced, with a frequency of three times a week and duration of 30 minutes. The great majority of the women who participated in the interventions were between stages 0 and III of the disease. The study protocols showed improvement with regard to the physical aspects (physical fitness, physical activity level, cognitive function and body composition), and psychological aspects (quality of life, fatigue, depression and anxiety), which reinforces the use of physical activities for this public. Discussion: Study protocols are essential to provide research transparency, which facilitates the reproducibility and understanding of the interventions, and contributes to scientific advancement. Impact: This scoping review provides a survey that will help further research on physical activity and/or physical exercise for women with breast cancer.

1. Introduction Breast cancer has been considered the most common type of cancer in women worldwide since 2018. That year it accounted for more than 24% of the total cancer cases diagnosed in the female world population, with approximately 2.1 million new cases, in addition to also being identified as the fifth cause of cancer death1. Current evidence suggests physical activity practice as an alternative therapy2,3, which provides health benefits for women undergoing breast cancer treatment or during post-treatment; moreover, such activities can be significantly associated with these women postoperative stage4. Therefore, randomized clinical trials that investigate interventions with physical activity in women with breast cancer have been shown to be effective in improving SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2956 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) fatigue.5–7, quality of life5,8,9, decreased body mass index (BMI) and body weight5, increased muscle endurance5, muscle strength10,11, decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety6,7,9, improvement in shoulder range of motion9,10, sleep disorders12, body image12, pain13 and cardiorespiratory fitness11,13. The search in the databases (PubMed Central®; Cochrane Library; Web of science - main collection, Scopus Elsevier e ScienceDirect) showed that the international literature has published studies on physical activity and chronic diseases since 1983 with the investigation by Metzner et al14.Such study suggested that the practice of physical activity contributes to reduce the risks of chronic diseases. Regarding study protocols, one of the first findings dates from 1955 with the study by Sakheim15 that aimed at validating a study protocol in a psychiatric hospital. Only in 1989, with the investigation by Dickhuth et al16 the study protocols started to associate physical activity. The fact that the publication of study protocols provides transparency to research17 is notorious, in addition to reducing publication bias18. When published, such protocols become significant research instruments, since they help in the reproducibility of interventions by other researchers and contribute to the scientific community to identify what has been produced in a given area17. However, despite their benefits, not all clinical trials are concerned with publishing the physical activity intervention protocols that have worked as an instrument. In this sense, by mapping the scenario of randomized clinical trials protocols that include physical activity for women with breast cancer, the present scoping review can contribute with new perspectives of interventions for the professionals in the area. In addition, this review is intended to collaborate for the improvement in physical and mental health of women with breast cancer through complementary therapies. Thus, this scoping review aimed at identifying and characterizing the physical activity and/or SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2956 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) physical exercise intervention study protocols for breast cancer treatment. The types, frequency, duration, intensity and timing of the therapeutic intervention with physical activity were highlighted, in addition to showing the results found.
2. Methods Protocol The present scoping review is based on the guidelines of PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR)19. The guiding question was formed according to PICOS acronym: what are the characteristics of the physical activity and/or physical exercise intervention protocols for breast cancer treatment?

Search strategy A search was performed in five databases: Cochrane Library; PubMed Central®; ScienceDirect; Scopus Elsevier and Web of science - main collection. The descriptors are shown in Table 1. All the titles and abstracts found in the electronic search were manually assessed by two researchers (JS, VBL), blindly and independently, from January to February 2021. Such researchers are members of a Brazilian laboratory referred to as Laboratório de Pesquisa em Lazer e Atividade Física – LAPLAF/CNPq (Leisure and Physical Activity Research Laboratory). The Rayyan software (Intelligent Systematic Review) was also used to assist in the selection of references. The discrepancies were resolved by a third researcher (ACAG). The reference lists of all the relevant articles were examined to identify other eligible studies.

Eligibility criteria The eligibility criteria for the studies were defined according to PICOS acronym by considering the population, intervention, comparison, outcome and study design (Table 2). Some randomized clinical trials carried out with adult women (≥18 years old) undergoing breast cancer treatment and during post-treatment were eligible for this review. The studies should investigate interventions that included physical activities and/or physical exercise for breast cancer treatment. The abstracts and full texts were available from January to February, 2021. There was no restriction regarding the idiom or the year of publication. The researchers (JS and VBL) carried out the searches on the databases mentioned and, then, they systematized the organization of the articles selected according to the title and abstract. Those that did not meet the objectives of the study were excluded. After this screening, the articles were read in full, so that the selection process of the ones that would be included in this study was completed (Figure 1).

The variables evaluated After searching for the studies to be included in the present scoping review, those that addressed physical activity and/or physical exercise protocols for the treatment and post-treatment of women with breast cancer were selected. Thus, the following variables were investigated: study protocols, breast cancer and physical activity and/or physical exercise.
Study protocols Study protocols provide guidelines for research performance, in addition to being a basis for recording and facilitating the evaluation itself20. These are studies that establish detailed steps and sequences so that an investigation can then be carried out by answering both, the questions that are sought according to the purposes and any other questions that may arise.21.

Breast cancer Breast cancer is characterized by an uncontrolled growth of abnormal breast cells22 and it is the type of cancer with the highest incidence among women worldwide23. The first articles published on this theme date from the 1880s, with the study by Snow24, and in 1889 with the study by Cheyne25. Currently, there is an increasing number of studies related to breast cancer, with more than 500,000 articles in the databases. Such investigations have been in evidence since the 1960s with clinical trials26–28, which increasingly intensified and deepened the search for early diagnosis and types of treatment with the purpose of improving the quality of life of these women.
Physical activity and/or physical exercise Physical activity is defined as any body movement produced by skeletal muscles that require energy expenditure29. According to Krebs, Berling-Ernst, Halle30 physical activity represents a therapy option and support for cancer patients. There are studies related to the practice of physical activity and/or physical exercise during the treatment and post-treatment of cancers29,31,32, especially breast cancer, which recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week33.
Data extraction The analysis and discussion of the study protocols was carried out by extracting the data referring to the authors, year of publication, journal, country where the study was carried out, number of citations according to the Web of Science base (until February 7, 2021), number of databases, search period and whether the 27-item PRISMA checklist SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2956 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) was followed (yes or no). In addition, the objectives, total sample size, intervention groups, control group, age, the location where the study was carried out, the variables investigated (physical and psychological ones), particularities of the intervention with physical activity, duration, number and frequency of the sessions, and duration of the intervention were scored.
Study quality and risk of bias The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool was used34 in order to assess the methodological quality of the studies. The following criteria were evaluated: (1) random sequence generation, (2) allocation sequence hiding, (3) the participants and researchers’ masking, and (4) selective reporting. The masking items regarding the evaluation of the outcomes, as well as the incomplete data were not included in the study, since study protocols do not show intervention results. The researchers' judgment (JS, ACAG) on the review was rated as low, unclear, or as having a high risk of bias.
3. Results Studies included 806 articles were found in the first database search, that is, 290 in Science Direct, 46 in Web of Science, 87 in Scopus, 170 in Cochrane and 213 in PubMed. 102 duplicate articles were excluded. After reading the titles and abstracts, 686 articles were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria, besides being characterized as another type of study or for investigating individuals with other diseases. Thus, 18 articles remained to be read in full and, after doing so, one article was excluded. Therefore, 17 articles were included in this scoping review, all of them characterized as study protocols with randomized clinical trials35–51.

Figure 3. Psychological outcomes assessed
Psychological outcomes assessed in the physical activity and/or physical exercise protocols Figure 3 shows the psychological variables evaluated, that is, quality of life35,36,45,46,48,50,37–44, welfare35, fatigue36,38,40–42,46,47,49,50, anxiety37,42,47,49,50, depression36– 38,40–42,47,49,50, stress37, mood46,49, self-esteem36,49, body image36, sexual function36, sleep quality36,41,50, suffering50, life satisfaction40, psychological health45 and fear of cancer recurrence41.
Quality of the study protocols In general, the study protocols were classified as having a ‘low’ risk of bias in most of the items assessed. Only one study had a ‘high’ risk of bias classification39, and there were two ‘unclear’ studies47,53 concerning the random sequence generation item. Five SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2956 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) studies39,42,47–49 showed an ‘unclear’ classification with regard to the allocation sequence hiding. Considering the participants and researchers’ masking, three studies42,48,49 were classified as having an ‘unclear’ classification. Twelve studies35,36,50,51,37,38,40,41,43–46 showed a ‘low risk’ of bias in all items, which points to a more detailed methodological rigor.
4. Discussion This scoping review aimed at identifying and characterizing the physical activity and/or exercise intervention study protocols for breast cancer treatment by highlighting the types, frequency, duration, intensity and timing of the therapeutic intervention with physical activity, in addition to showing the outcomes found. Seventeen protocol studies met the inclusion criteria adopted in this scoping review, which configured a group of randomized clinical trials registered on official platforms. Considering this universe, the evidence with regard to the risk of bias was adapted, since protocol studies do not show the results. The study protocols followed the standards of the SPIRIT checklist20; thus, after being assessed, such studies were shown to have a low risk of bias because they clearly showed a random sequence generation, allocation sequence hiding, the participants and researchers’ masking, as well as selective reports, which are in accordance with Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool34.
Characterization of physical activity and/or physical exercises The types of physical activity and/or physical exercises found in the study protocols included in this scoping review comprised aerobic exercises, endurance training, dance and Pilates, and exercises guided by applications and Internet software. This shows a wide range of modalities that have been investigated in the context of breast SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2956 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) cancer. Thus, these study protocols provided a series of intervention options, which outlines possibilities and structure, in addition to providing a basis for further randomized clinical trials. Some studies have previously investigated some of these modalities, such as aerobic and endurance exercises, which have been shown to be viable and safe in the literature for women undergoing breast cancer treatment54,55. The results found in the randomized clinical trials by Paulo et al12, García-Soidán et al56, and Sweeney et al57, showed significant improvement in strength, flexibility, musculoskeletal improvement, body composition, reduction of side effects regarding breast cancer treatment, besides improving the quality of life and emotional level of these women after interventions with aerobic and endurance exercises. Regarding the interventions with walking, the study protocols have shown that it can be an effective training to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, physical performance, in addition to being a safe and beneficial intervention for women who have lymphedema due to breast cancer58,59. Walking also stands out for being an accessible physical activity with a low cost and that can be used as a means of dislocation60, which makes it an interesting option in low and middle income countries. The exercises provided by a High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), in turn, are suggested in the study protocols by Tsuji et al41 and Oberste et al51. This new modality has also been addressed for breast cancer patients during chemotherapy with positive effects61. Two study protocols assessed in this scoping review included interventions through dance36,50. Others, such as the ones by Loo et al62 and Ho et al63 showed that dance practice enabled to achieve an increased physical activity in breast cancer survivors. The quality of life was also improved by increasing vigor and reducing problems associated with obesity, and reducing stress and pain in these women. Considering the interventions with Pilates, the study by Eyigor et al64 showed that such a SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2956 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) method is a safe and effective exercise for breast cancer patients, since it enables the improvement of functional capacities, fatigue, quality of life and helps to reduce depression. According to the results shown in the study by Alpozgen et al65, Pilates also provided improvement in pain, muscle strength, besides being effective as a rehabilitation exercise for women with breast cancer. Thus, this method can be considered an alternative treatment for this public. Current modalities seen in the protocols, that is, exercises performed at home with interventions using electronics, such as watches to monitor physical activity, internet software and smartphone applications, have been encouraged for providing changes in living standards, especially considering the pandemic and relocation of professional activities for home-office. In other previously studies, such as that by Dong et al10, the findings of an intervention based on combined exercises of an internet software showed positive effects on muscle strength and quality of life in patients during breast cancer postoperative period. Galiano-Castillo et al66 indicated a physical exercise program that uses an Internet software, through which it was possible to improve and maintain the quality of life of breast cancer patients, as well as to reduce pain and fatigue, and improve muscle strength, which resulted in improved functionality related to daily activities. These strategies, such as the use of online tools and the fact that the interventions are carried out at home, can be adequate alternatives to assist both, researchers and participants, since they provide a larger network for a great number of participants. The current moment, with the recommendations for staying at home, has led us to increase the demand for digital tools, in addition to raising people’s awareness on how much these methods can be explored. It would not be possible to carry out the interventions without such tools. Problems related to the capability of some software, the lack of skills to use the applications, difficulties in accessing the Internet and a possible lack of interest by the SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2956 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) participants are likely to be limitations. However, these strategies can work as a useful tool in changing behavior, besides facilitating and bringing the researchers and participants closer together67. It was also identified that the interventions were mainly proposed to work with moderate intensity exercises, which corroborates with Spence et al33 who recommended physical activity for breast cancer patients at least 150 minutes per week, as proposed in the randomized clinical trial studies by Ligibel et al68, Arem et al69 and Mijwel et al70. Lack of information regarding the intensity of the interventions was one of the limitations of some study protocols. These recommendations should be suggested by the researcher so that benefit is proven, in addition to facilitating subsequent implementation and performance of other intervention study protocols.
Physical and psychological outcomes The physical outcomes most found in the study protocols comprised the physical conditions and limitations of women with breast cancer, such as decreased function of the upper limb71, decreased range of motion and muscle strength19, and cardiovascular consequences72. In almost all studies, the limiting factors related to the disease were investigated, given that there is a concern with the return of these women to daily activities. Thus, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) test, the Sitting- rising test in 30 seconds (30s - SRT) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) were the instruments most often used by the studies assessed. These instruments have a low cost and are fast to be applied. The consequences of the treatments considering the conditions or psychological health of the women undergoing treatment and during post-treatment of breast cancer can lead to problems of anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Thus, SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2956 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) there is a great concern with quality. In view of this, several studies show quality of life as their main outcome, followed by depression and anxiety, which are possibly more often addressed due to the worrying factors related to the disease73. Regarding the instruments used, it is noteworthy that there is a wide range of possibilities, which makes later comparisons between studies difficult. Regarding quality of life, for example, which was shown to be the main outcome in most study protocols, the instruments used included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EuroQol Five- dimensional Instrument (EQ-5D-5L), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B). All of them are validated and used in studies on cancer patients. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is one of the most used instruments to assess depression and anxiety.
Conclusions The study protocols showed different possibilities of intervention through physical activity and/or physical exercise; however, some have limitations due to the lack of information, such as intensity, frequency or timing of the sessions, which are necessary for a better use of these interventions. It should be highlighted that the first study protocol found in this scoping review dates from 2013, which shows that previous clinical trials did not have protocol publications, and that the practice of publishing study protocols is still expanding. Not all scientific journals accept this type of study, and some authors of randomized clinical trials choose not to publish their protocols. Considering the study protocols included in this scoping review, a range of interventions with different modalities of physical activity and/or physical exercise was found, that is, endurance training, aerobic exercises, dance, Pilates, HIIT, Qigong, and SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2956 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) activities by using technologies, such as software and applications and/or watches to monitor physical activity. The frequency of interventions ranged from one to five times a week, lasting from 12 to 48 weeks, in a low-to-vigorous intensity. Regarding the disease stages, the study protocols mainly included stages between 0 and III. Considering the treatment period, the women were mainly undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other adjuvant therapies. Physical fitness, physical activity level, cognitive function and body composition were the main outcomes seen. Quality of life, fatigue, depression and anxiety were the psychological outcomes that stood out the most. Even considering this range of modalities, more study protocols are necessary so that research transparency is obtained, in addition to facilitating the reproducibility and understanding of interventions. These protocols, on the other hand, provide tools to assist in further research and contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge.
Impact Statement The present study provides insight into the characteristics of study protocols with randomized clinical trials by showing which protocols might be more suitable for a given study, as well as which instruments are most used for obtaining physical and psychological outcomes. The survey carried out and shown in this scoping review will help further research that involves physical activity and/or physical exercise for women with breast cancer.
