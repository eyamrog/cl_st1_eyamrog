(Freshwater hyphomycetes in a preserved insular system from Brazil: first records at Parque Estadual da Ilha 
do Cardoso, municipality of Cananéia, São Paulo State). To survey freshwater hyphomycetes from insular water bodies at 
the Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso State Park, in Cananéia municipality, São Paulo State, Brazil, submerged mixed 
leaf litter samples were collected from six sites from June 2012 to February 2013. The samples were taken to the laboratory 
and incubated in Petri dishes containing sterile distilled water at room temperature (20oC). From the 5th day on, until at 
least one month, fragments of the leaf litter samples were examined under the microscope, resulting in the morphological 
identification of 33 taxa. Among those, two are new records for the state of São Paulo and four for Brazil. Descriptions and 
pictures of each new record are presented.

The term ‘aquatic hyphomycetes’ has not 
taxonomical value, but it characterizes, ecologically, 
a group of anamorphic fungi or asexual ascomycetes 
that must have, at least, a part or all of their life cycle 
occurring in freshwater, including also fungi exclusively 
originated in the aquatic environment (Chan et al. 2000).

As a diverse phylogenetically diverse group 
(Belliveau & Barlocher 2005, Duarte et al. 2015), 
aquatic anamorphic fungi are classified into four 
groups according to their tolerance to submergence 
or requirement of water for the conidiogenesis: 
aeroaquatic hyphomycetes, terrestrial aquatic 
hyphomycetes, submerged aquatic hyphomycetes and 
ingoldian hyphomycetes (Goh & Hyde 1996).

Aquatic anamorphs have been considered one of 
the most important ecological group of fungi active 
during the decomposition process of submerged leaf 
litter, as consumers or improving the palatability of 
the substrates by nutritional enrichment for other 
organisms of the trophic chain, such as shredding 
invertebrates (Bärlocher 1992, Cheng et al. 1997, 
Suberkropp 1992, 2003). Therefore, these fungi 
may play a very important role in nutrient cycling 
(Belliveau & Barlocher 2005).

The importance of the aquatic anamorphs has 
been especially emphasized in lotic systems such 
as streams with well-aerated, clean, moderately 
turbulent waters, with its conidia dispersed in foams 
or associated with decaying organic substrates (Ingold 
1975). Eventually, some aquatic anamorphs may be 
found in terrestrial environments, such as in roots of 
plants, including grasses and riparian ferns (Sati & 
Belwal 2005), also in lentic waters (Suzuki & Nimura 
1961, Casper 1965), and more recently in urban, 
eutrophicated waters (Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2009, 
Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2014).

Several studies have expanded the knowledge of 
the geographical distribution of anamorphic fungi in 
the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest (Schoenlein-Crusius 
& Milanez 1989, Schoenlein-Crusius & Milanez 1990, 
Schoenlein-Crusius & Milanez 1998, Grandi 1998, 
1999, Gusmão et al. 2001, Grandi & Gusmão 2002, 
Silva et al. 2019). However, among them, only Silva et 
al. (2019) included sampling points in a lentic system 
on an island.

The first study of the diversity of freshwater 
hyphomycetes in Brazilian insular areas was 
conducted by Moro et al. (2018) for the Ilhabela State 
Park (PEIb). In this same island, two new species of 
freshwater Hyphomycetes, Polylobastipora setulosa 
(Moro et al. 2015a) and Campylospora brasiliensis 
(Moro et al. 2015b) were described, as well as the first 
report from Brazil Peyronelina glomerulata PJ Fisher, 
J. Webster & DF Kane (Moro et al. 2015c).

At the Ilha do Cardoso island, there are already 
studies about the diversity of fungi from the following 
phyla: Basidiomycota (Bononi 1979a,b,c, 1984, 
Bononi et al. 1984, Bononi & Capelari 1984, Capelari 
1989, Gugliotta & Capelari 1995, Gugliotta & Bononi 
1999), Glomeromycota (Trufem et al. 1989, Trufem 
et al. 1994) and more recently, Chytridiomycota and 
Blastocladiomycota (Jerônimo 2014, Jerônimo et al. 
2015). However, until now, there are no records about 
aquatic anamorphic fungi, being the improvement of 
the knowledge concerning its diversity, the main aim 
of the present study. The data of the measurements 
of some abiotic parameters are also presented for 
historical documentation about the island.

Sampling - The State Park of Ilha do Cardoso (PEIC) 
is located in a homonymous island, at the southeastern 
coast of São Paulo State (25º03'05"-25º18'18"S and 
47º53'48"-48º05'42"W). Within the total area of 
22.500 hectares, several types of environments can 
be found: primary and secondary Atlantic rainforest, 
dunes, mangroves, sandbank formations, and one 
larger stream, the Perequê river which runs through 
most of the island, many small ponds, tributaries, 
rivers rapids, waterfalls and brooks (Secretaria de 
Estado do Meio Ambiente 1998).

In the Ilha do Cardoso island, the following 
sampling sites were visited: 1 - Perequê waterfall, 
2 - Cor de Chá river, 3 - Córrego, 4 - Poço das Antas, 
5 - Perequê river.

The site 1 - Perequê waterfall and the site 
5 - Perequê river were visited for collecting during 
all field trips: in June, August and November of 
2012 and February of 2013. Site 2 - Cor de Chá river 
presented water flow enough to be sampled only once, 
in February 2013, while site 3 - Córrego, was visited 
during the first three field trips, and site 4 - Poço das 
Antas, only during the last two (November 2012 and 
February 2013).

During the field trips on the shores and about 30 
cm deep at each site, 10 leaves were selected from the 
submerged mixed leaf litter using tweezers. The leaves 
and water taken from the site were placed in previously 
sterile 200 mL polyethylene bottles. During the entire 
study, 72 samples were collected and transported to 
the laboratory.

At each sampling site, the temperature (oC), 
pH, conductivity (µS.cm-1) and dissolved oxygen 
(mgO2/L) of the water was measured with and Horiba 
U10 and U50 equipment.

Incubation - In the laboratory, the leaf samples were 
coarsely fragmented individually using sterile scissors 
to fit loosely in sterile Petri dishes. Sterile water was 
added to the Petri dishes to cover sufficiently the leaf 
fragments (Ingold 1975). Thus, 172 Petri dishes were 
obtained, which were incubated at room temperature 
(around 20 oC) for 4 to 8 weeks. Whenever the 
proliferation of bacteria was perceptible or the leaf 
fragments emerged, aliquots of sterile water were 
added to the Petri dishes or the entire water was 
replaced in order to keep the substrates as clean as 
possible.

Taxonomical identification - From the 5th day on, 
fragments of the leaf litter samples were analyzed 
under a microscope for least one month and then 
until no new fungi were observed. Fragments of the 
incubated leaf samples were mounted onto slides with 
a drop of sterile water and cover glasses to be analyzed 
under an optical microscope model Olympus BX50. 

The steps of the conidial production were followed 
and morphological relevant features were searched 
to identify the taxa by specific identification keys 
(Ingold 1975, Marvanová 1997, Santos-Flores & 
Betancourt-López 1997). For documentation and ex-
situ preservation purposes, slides were also prepared 
with PVLG (polyvinyl alcohol lactoglycerol) resin, 
deposited at the Herbarium Maria Eneida Kaufmann 
Fidalgo in the Instituto de Botânica, in municipality 
of São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil. Digital images 
were obtained with the aid of an optical microscope 
Leica DM LB2, equipped with a Leica DFRC 280 
digital camera.

Frequencies of taxa occurrence were calculated 
based on Dajoz (1973) and Zak & Willig (2004), 
dividing the number of samples in which the species 
was registered by the total number of analyzed 
samples, multiplied by 100. The fungi were grouped 
in the following constancy categories - C: Constant 
≥ 50%; A: Accessory ≥ 25% e < 50%; O: Occasional 
< 25%.

Abiotic factors - The water temperature was about 
18 oC in August/2012 and 23 ºC in February/2013 in 
all sites (table 1). Regarding the pH of the water, the 
values varied from 5.58 to 8.75 at the Cachoeira do 
Perequê, and from 5.26 to 6.64 at the Rio Perequê. In 
the water of the Córrego the pH values varied from 
5.48 to 7.12 and at the Poço das Antas the values 
varied from 6.14 to 6.28. The only measurement 
of the pH of Rio Cor de Chá, revealed a very low 
value, corresponding to 3.84, and a conductivity 
value of 0.394 S.cm-1. Dissolved oxygen values 
remained constant among the collection sites: from 
8.75 to 10.01 mgO2/L at Perequê waterfall; 6.73 to 
8.90 mgO2/L at Perequê river; 6.50 to 7.82 mgO2/L 
at Córrego; 7.50 a 10.45 mgO2/L at Poço das Antas. 
Only one measurement was performed at Cor de Chá 
river, resulting in 10.17 mgO2/L.

Fungal diversity - A total of 33 taxa of aquatic 
Hyphomycetes were observed in water bodies of 
the Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso, with 97 
occurrences (table 2). In the first sampling, 18 taxa 
(26 occurrences) were recorded. The 2nd sampling 
presented 15 taxa and 3rd sampling 14 taxa, and 
the numbers of occurrences were close (22 and 
19, respectively). On the 4th sampling, 17 taxa (30 
occurrences) were recorded.

The Perequê waterfall was the site with the 
highest number of unique taxa (07) and presented 
40 occurrences. The 1st and 2nd samplings were those 
with the highest number of occurrences (11 and 14, 
respectively), although with lower numbers compared 
to the numbers of occurrence of the 3rd and 4th sampling 
are close (07 and 08, respectively).

The Perequê river presented 24 occurrences and 
two unique taxa, Blodgettia indica Subram. (figure 
1a‑b) and Pyramidospora casuarinae Sv. Nilsson. 
The 1st sampling was with the largest number of 
occurrences (11). Among the 2nd, 3rd and 4th samplings 
there was no significant variation (04, 03 and 05, 
respectively).

The Córrego registered 13 occurrences of aquatic 
hyphomycetes and the Poço das Antas 14. Córrego 
presented Pyramidospora constricta N. Singh (figure 
3d) and Poço das Antas presented Ingoldiella hamata 
D.E. Shaw (figure 2d).

In the Cor de Chá river, only one sampling was 
carried out, totaling the record of six occurrences. 
Nevertheless, this location presented 04 exclusive taxa: 
Dactylellina appendiculata (Anastasiou) M. Scholler, 
Hagedorn & A. Rubner (figure 3b), Isthmolongispora 
minima Matsush. (figure 2f), Pleiochaeta amazonensis 
Matsush. (figure 3c), and Subulispora longirostrata 
Nawawi & Kuthub (figure 4a).

All examined taxa are new records for the Parque 
Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso. The following five 
species are described because they are new records 
for Brazil and one for the State of São Paulo. 

Conidiophore not observed. Conidia hyaline, 
spindle-shaped, 42.5-62.5 µm × 10-12.5 µm, 
1-3-septed, producing 1-2 lateral appendages, hyaline, 
more than 87.5 µm long., 2-2.5 µm wide.

Notes: although among the analyzed specimens the 
presence of curved conidia was not observed, only 
straight conidia, all other morphological features are 
in accordance with the original description.

The species was originally described by 
Anastasiou (1964) with the name Dactyllela 
appendiculata, with the presence of appendages. 
It may have curved conidia when originated from 
curved spore primordium or straight conidia when 
originated from a straight spore primordium. Later, 
Nawawi (1976) described a new genus Laridospora 
recombining Dactyllela appendiculata as Laridospora 
appendiculata, however observing only curved 
conidia and appendages. Rubner & Gams considered 
L. appendiculata as Monacrosporium tentaculatum, 
considering only its predatory behavior. The ecology 
and conidial appendages related to aquatic habitat 
were not taken into account, considering that M. 
tentaculatum is not an aquatic species (Rubner 1996). 
At last, through molecular biology, Scholler et al. 
(1999) proposed M. tentaculatum as synonymous with 
Dactyllelina appendiculata. This is the first record of 
D. appendiculata in Brazil.

Conidiophore not observed. Conidial uniseriate 
chains connected by narrow isthmi, fusiform, 3-celled, 
hyaline, central cell rectangular, ends of the navicular 
cells, 25-33 × 2.5-3.0 µm.

Notes: the genus Isthmolongispora was described 
by Matsushima (1971) for the Solomon Islands and 
Papua New Guinea, together with I. intermedia and 
I. minima. The genus is characterized by the presence 
of free conidiophores and conidial serials, formed by 
cells connected by a small isthmus. Currently, the 
genus is composed of nine other species. This is the 
first record of the species for Brazil.

Conidiophore not observed. Conidial uniseriate 
chains connected by narrow isthmi, fusiform, hyaline, 
2-celled, 10-15.7 × 2.1-4.3µm per cell, entire conidia 
28.6-22.8 µm long.

It is the first record of this species from São Paulo 
State.

Conidiophore not observed. Conidial uniseriate 
chains connected by narrow isthmi, solitary, hyaline, 
4-celled, 54.5-60 × 3-4 µm.

Notes: the conidia of I. quadricellularia are 
morphologically similar to those of the genus 
Wiesneriomyces Koord. The difference between these 
fungi is that in I. quadricellularia the conidiophores 
are free, and Wiesneriomyces presents sporodochium. 
However, W. laurinus (Tassi) P.M. Kirk may have 5-9 
cells composing the conidia in culture medium or 7-8 
cells in the natural substrate as noted by Matsushima 
(1975), more than 15 cells as described by Ellis (1971). 
Matsushima (1975) described 4 cells or rarely 5 cells 
for I. quadricellularia conidia. In the present research, 
although the conidiophore was not observed, the 4 
cells conidia agree with the original description of 
Matsushima (1975) for I. quadricellularia, allowing 
the identification of the collected fungus.

I. quadricellularia is concomitantly cited for two 
completely different biomes in Brazil: the Atlantic 
Rain Forest of Ilha do Cardoso in the southeast State 
of São Paulo (this paper) and in the Caatinga region of 
the northeast state of Bahia (Fiuza & Gusmão 2014). 
The geographical distribution of these taxa seems to 
be broader than first supposed. It is the first record of 
the species for São Paulo State.

Conidiophore not observed. Conidia solitary, 
brown, cylindrical-fusiform, multi-sepated, filiform 
apex curved, composed of a main axis of 160‑185 µm 
9-10 µm long and wide at the thinnest part, 17-19 
septa; two side branches, thin, cylindrical, light brown, 
65-110 × 2.0-2.5 µm, 7-9 septa.

Notes: the genus Pleiochaeta was described by 
(Sacc.) S. Hughes (1951), having the species P. setosa 
as the type species. In addition to this, other five 
species were described. This is a dematiaceous fungi, 
with cylindrical-fusiform conidia with appendages 
(Castañeda Ruíz et al. 1996). This is the first report 
of the species for Brazil.

Conidiophore hyaline, single, 45-70 µm in length, 
bearing one terminal conidia. Conidia formed by a 
main axis of 30-40 µm in length with lateral branches 
8-12 µm in length.

Notes: the genus Pyramidospora was described 
originally by Nilsson (1962), with the type species P. 
casuarinae, isolated from Venezuela, the main feature 
of this genus is the presence of a sizeable narrowing in 
the conidiophore next to where it joins to the conidium, 
forming a twist in this region (Singh 1972). Currently 
the genus consists of nine species. This is the first 
record of the species for Brazil.

Abiotic factors - The water temperature followed the 
climatic conditions (table 1). The values of water 
temperature during the samplings are comparable 
to other studies in the Atlantic rainforest biome. 
Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2009) cited temperatures 
between 20 °C to 26 °C in the Parque Estadual 
das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI), State of São Paulo. 
Nascimento (2007) pointed out temperatures around 
14.3 °C to 21.6 °C in the Parque Estadual da Serra 
da Cantareira, also in the State of São Paulo. These 
values are considered as ideal for the occurrence of 
aquatic Hyphomycetes, which are described as having 
an optimum temperature for growth between 15 ºC to 
25 ºC (Ingold 1975).

Although there has been a high variation in pH 
values between sampling sites (3.84 to 8.75), the pH 
values were similar to those described by Nascimento 
(2007), around 5.8 to 6.6 and Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 
(2009), 3.36 to 9.08.

The conductivity, in general, can be characterized 
as low, ranging from a maximum of 0.057 to  
0.043 S.cm-1. The values of dissolved oxygen were 
expected to be high in view of the fact that most sites 
are running waters, with the exception of Poço das 
Antas, which is a pond. The values varied from 6.73 
to 10.45 mgO2/L (table 1). The values of conductivity 
and dissolved oxygen were larger in relation to 
previous studies in the Atlantic rainforest. Nascimento 
(2007) obtained values between 0.02 to 0.03 µS.cm-1 
of conductivity and 5.1 to 7.8 mgO2/L for dissolved 
oxygen in the Parque Estadual da Cantareira.

The values of the abiotic parameters of freshwater 
the island are compatible with those usually reported 
for the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest.
Fungal diversity - According to Dajoz (1973), species 
with a frequency of occurrence ≥ 50% are classified 
as constant, those with a frequency between 25 and 
50% are accessories and those with a frequency < 25% 
as occasional, showing an interesting connection 
between the number of samplings and fungal taxa.

Among the total mycota, the most frequent 
species were Triscelophorus monosporus (80%), 
Lunulospora curvula (73.3%) and Tripospermum 
camelopardus (66.6%), classified as constant (table 2).

Several studies corroborate the high frequency of 
T. monosporus (Schoenlein-Crusius & Martin 1990, 
Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 1990, Schoenlein-Crusius 
et al. 1992a, Pires-Zottarelli et al. 1993, Schoenlein-
Crusius & Martin 1998, Malosso 1999, Schoenlein-
Crusius 2002, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2014) and L. 
curvula (Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 1990, Schoenlein-
Crusius & Milanez 1990, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 
1992, Malosso 1995, Schoenlein-Crusius & Milanez 
1998, Malosso 1999, Schoenlein-Crusius 2002, 
Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2014). T. camelopardus is 
less reported, being registered to the Guarapiranga 
dam by Malosso (1999).

A total of six taxa showed a frequency index 
between 26.6-40%: Anguillospora longissima, 
Flagellospora curvula, Lunulospora cymbiformis, 
Scutisporus brunneus, Tripospermum myrti and 
Triscelophorus acuminatus, being classified as 
accessory. These species were frequently reported in 
several studies from Brazil (Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 
2009, Fiuza & Gusmão 2011, Fiuza & Gusmão 2013, 
Fiuza et al. 2015, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2015).

Twenty four taxa were less frequent (6.6‑20%), 
and classified as occasional. Blodgettia indica has 
recently been isolated in leaves of Caesalpinia 
echinata and Campomanesia phaea submerged in 
a lake in Parque Municipal Alfredo Volpi (Moreira 
& Schoenlein-Crusius 2012). Flagellospora 
penicillioides was isolated from submerged mixed 
leaf litter from the Cerrado biome by Schoenlein-
Crusius (2002). Heliscus submersus was also isolated 
in submerged mixed leaf litter on Monjolinho river 
and Jacaré river in São Carlos, SP (Malosso 1999), 
Ingoldiella hamata was cited by Schoenlein-Crusius 
(2002) in submerged mixed leaf litter in Itirapina, 
SP. Jaculispora submerged, was recently described 
by Fiuza & Gusmão (2013) in the Serra da Jibóia, 
a Brazilian semi-arid region. Pyramidospora 
casuarinae, was registered as the first citation to 
South America by Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2009), 
Subulispora longirostrata was registered colonizing 
leaves M. cabussu Hoehne and T. pulchra Cogn. in 
Paranapiacaba, Santo André, SP (Gusmão et al. 2001, 
Grandi & Gusmão 2002), Tetracladium marchalianum 
was recently cited for the first time to Brazil by 
Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2014) in submerged mixed 
leaf litter in Parque Municipal do Ibirapuera, SP and 
Tetraploa aristata was observed by Gruppi (2008) 
on mixed leaf litter samples collected in the Parque 
Central in Santo André, SP and by Barbosa et al. 
(2013) in submerged leaf litter in the city of Santa 
Terezinha, Bahia in a Brazilian semi-arid region.

The remaining taxa occurred sporadically 
between samplings, highlighting Pyramidospora 
robusta Moreira & Schoenlein-Crusius (2012) which 
was observed in submerged leaf litter collected from 
an urban park named Parque Alfredo Volpi in the city 
of São Paulo.

The results of this study confirm that the diversity 
of aquatic Hyphomycetes in insular environments is 
fairly higher than has been registered by other studies 
in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest for instances. In 
the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga-PEFI, an 
Atlantic Rainforest reminiscent located in São Paulo 
State, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2009), observed 24 
taxa of aquatic Hyphomycetes, from submerged mixed 
leaf litter in 10 different sampling sites. In the northeast 
Atlantic Rainforest, from Monte da Pioneira, Serra da 
Jibóia north zone, Fiuza & Gusmão (2011) identified 
10 aquatic Hyphomycetes in stream foam.

For the Ilhabela State Park, 39 species of 
freshwater Hyphomycetes have been observed. 
Among them, Camposporidium cristatum Nawawi 
& Kuthub., Chaetendophragmia triangularis 
Matsush., Physalidiella elegans (Mosca) Rulamort 
and Scutisporus brunneus K. Ando & Tubaki 
were reported as new records from São Paulo 
State. Isthmolongispora biramifera Matsush., 
Lateriramulosa ainflata Matsush., Phalangispora 
nawawii Kuthub. and Triscelophorus ponapensis 
Matsush. corresponded to new records for Brazil. 
Fiuza et al. (2017) in a checklist of Ingoldian fungi 
in Brazil reported 85 taxa. Nineteen taxa are reported 
from the Amazon, 53 from the Atlantic Forest, 39 
from the Caatinga and 21 from the Cerrado. Silva et 
al. (2019) reported 23 taxa of aquatic hyphomycetes 
associated to submerged leaf litter of tropical lotic and 
lentic environments in the Atlantic Forest of Northeast 
Brazil.

The identiﬁed taxa are all first occurrences to 
the Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso. Besides, 
these results contribute to extending the knowledge 
concerning the occurrence and distribution of aquatic 
hyphomycetes in areas of the Atlantic Rainforest of 
São Paulo State and in Brazil, introducing studies of 
this group in insular areas.
