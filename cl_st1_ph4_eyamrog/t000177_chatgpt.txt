The global spread of the Coronavirus is instilling a significant level of fear, worry, and concern in societies worldwide, particularly among healthcare workers who face an elevated risk of infection. This paper compiles strategies and guidelines aimed at mitigating contamination in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and hospital environments. Drawing from ASHRAE and REHVA guidelines, the utilization of UV-C Lamps, Pressure control filtration, Restroom protocols, and Humidity control are recommended to combat the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) within ICUs. The importance of infection control in hospital design is becoming increasingly paramount, with a specific focus on the role of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems in minimizing the risk of airborne transmission within built environments through the implementation of best practices.
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The epidemiology of COVID-19 has become more apparent as incident cases increase and researchers enhance estimates of severity, transmissibility, and affected populations. The global spread of the coronavirus is inducing a significant level of fear, worry, and concern in societies worldwide, with approximately one hundred thousand new infections reported daily [1, 2].
Healthcare workers play a crucial role in the frontline response to the COVID-19 outbreak, facing various hazards that increase their susceptibility to infection. These hazards encompass pathogen exposure, extended working hours, psychological distress, fatigue, occupational burnout, stigma, as well as physical and psychological violence [3].
Ensuring the protection of healthcare workers and the readiness of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) to confront an epidemic cluster should be the primary focus. While the role of healthcare workers in transmitting pathogens between patients is widely acknowledged, recent evidence emphasizes the importance of contaminated environments in pathogen transmission, with high-touch surfaces identified as potential reservoirs of infectious agents. Consequently, healthcare workers face an elevated risk of infection [4, 5, 6].
Epidemics possess the capacity to significantly strain intensive care resources, potentially necessitating an expansion of intensive care capabilities. A limited number of intensivists have firsthand experience in rapidly scaling up intensive care services in response to an epidemic. Initial preparations should encompass fit testing of negative pressure respirators, training of additional staff members, procurement of materials for physical modifications to the ICU, and other essential measures [7].
In January, Brazil had 50,000 ICU beds, of which only 22,000 were accessible through the Health Unit System (SUS). The remaining beds were situated in hospitals that exclusively catered to patients through payment or contractual arrangements. As reported by the Globo journal, a staggering 199,768 healthcare professionals were identified as suspected cases of the disease and consequently had to be relieved of their duties [8].
In the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, one-third of individuals infected with the coronavirus are healthcare workers, as reported by the Health Secretariat of Pernambuco. Specifically, 377 health professionals have tested positive for COVID-19, accounting for a significant proportion of the total cases in the state. This elevated figure can be attributed to Pernambuco's proactive approach of being the first state in the country to conduct testing on all symptomatic healthcare workers [9].
The utilization of face masks has become widespread globally. Healthcare workers use both Disposable N95 respirators and medical masks for self-protection, although these masks serve different purposes. N95 respirators are specifically crafted to shield the wearer from inhaling tiny airborne particles, necessitating adherence to stringent filtration standards and a snug fit to minimize facial seal leakage. Conversely, medical masks aim to impede the transmission of microorganisms from the wearer to the patient. These masks are loosely fitted on the face and do not consistently prevent the inhalation of minute airborne particles [10].
The discovery of coronavirus in a hospital air duct has prompted scientists to consider the possibility of the disease being transmitted through air-conditioning units, potentially increasing its contagiousness beyond initial estimations. Instances of COVID-19 presence have been detected in air conditioning vents within certain hospital settings, prompting inquiries into the adequacy of filtration systems in various buildings [7, 11].
Pathogen dissemination through the air is facilitated by droplets and aerosols, commonly produced through actions such as coughing, sneezing, shouting, breathing, toilet flushing, and certain medical procedures. Ventilation systems, while unable to effectively halt the swift descent of larger droplets, can impact the spread of infectious aerosols in the form of droplet nuclei. By implementing directional airflow, it is possible to establish clean-to-dirty flow patterns that aid in the movement of infectious aerosols towards designated exhaust points [12, 13].
This paper compiles strategies and guidelines aimed at reducing contamination within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and throughout the hospital environment.
The assessment of transmission routes for the infectious agent is crucial. In the context of COVID-19, it is commonly accepted that two primary transmission routes prevail: through large droplets (emitted during sneezing, coughing, or talking) and via surface contact (fomite) such as hand-to-hand or hand-to-surface interactions. A third transmission route that is increasingly recognized by the scientific community is the fecal-oral route. Table 1 provides information on the relationship between aerosol droplet size and exposure time. These droplets can be:
Large droplets (>10 microns) are capable of airborne transmission, originating from coughing and sneezing, and typically fall to surfaces within a range of 1-2 meters from the infected individual.
Small particles, measuring less than 5 microns, have the capacity to remain suspended in the air for extended periods and can be carried over long distances. These particles are typically produced through actions such as coughing, sneezing, or even speaking. Droplet nuclei or residue, which are essentially small particles, are created when larger droplets evaporate and desiccate. The coronavirus particle itself measures between 0.80-0.16 micrometers and can remain viable in typical indoor air conditions for up to three hours, persisting on room surfaces for two to three days. These minute particles have the ability to remain airborne and travel significant distances propelled by air currents within a room or through the air ducts of ventilation systems.
In hospitals, air conditioning serves a purpose beyond mere comfort enhancement. It is often a critical component of patient therapy. Research indicates that patients in well-regulated environments tend to experience faster physical recovery compared to those in inadequately controlled settings [15].
Healthcare services must adhere to permanent quality and safety guidelines. Planning strategies play a crucial role in executing urgent operations, particularly during a pandemic, by minimizing the number of individuals in the surgical room to mitigate the risk of contamination [16].
In order to safeguard the health of healthcare workers, it is advisable that critically ill patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 be placed in an airborne infection isolation room with negative pressure, as illustrated in Figure 1. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) has recommended the utilization of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems that can not only protect healthcare workers but also foster confidence by ensuring a safe environment for their interactions with highly contagious patients, thereby reducing exposure to contaminants discharged during procedures. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that adjusting the amount of outdoor air may affect the building's pressure balance and potentially lead to humidity-related issues. As previously mentioned, the small size of coronavirus particles enables them to remain airborne and travel significant distances, carried by airflows within rooms or through the extract air ducts of ventilation systems.
Figure 1 illustrates various methods for altering the pressure or filtration system within the ICU room, as outlined in the Standard 170 "COVID-19 Guidance" for Hospital Isolation Rooms [18]. This standard provides recommendations on HVAC systems, their configurations, and necessary modifications to effectively manage a potential influx of COVID-19 patients.
In Figure 1a and Figure 1b, the first and second options respectively demonstrate the duct discharging to the exterior. Option 1 aligns with the guidelines set forth by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States of America), ASHRAE, and FGI (Facility Guidelines Institute). Alternatively, if the room is furnished with High Efficiency Particulate Arrestance (HEPA) units (Option 2), discharge to the exterior is also permissible.
The third option depicted in Figure 1 (cb) illustrates a scenario where a non-HEPA fan is either discharging directly to the exterior or utilizing the existing TLT room exhaust system.
The fourth option depicted in Figure 1(c) illustrates a scenario where the HEPA system is discharging into the return air. It is crucial for systems to be properly balanced to avoid any downstream effects.
The fifth option depicted in Figure 1 (d) showcases the placement of a HEPA filtered negative air machine in the vestibule, with a duct extending from the vestibule to the corridor. This setup involves keeping the door to the vestibule closed while leaving the door to the patient room open.
The sixth option depicted in Figure 1 (e) illustrates a HEPA unit recirculating air within a room following the process of scrubbing. It is important to note that while this approach is not inherently negative, precautions should be taken to cover the supply to prevent the build-up of high pressure within the system.
All of these options take into account the necessity for returns to be covered, with the exception of Option 1, and require a distance of 8 meters from the final discharge point to the opening into the building.
Decontamination Unit: Compact decontamination units, as illustrated in Figure 2, can be installed either within the room or externally, effectively capturing and expelling air to the outside environment. The consideration of exhaust systems is crucial in areas prone to contamination, particularly in spaces designated for patients with infectious diseases.
Research has shown that effective air filtration plays a crucial role in reducing the transmission of virus particles, often carried by larger particles, to adjacent areas. High-efficiency filters, when correctly installed, have the capacity to capture particles of varying sizes based on their capture efficiency. The National Air Filtration Association (NAFA) has highlighted the advantages associated with appropriately sized portable HEPA filters that are well-maintained and operated, emphasizing their effectiveness in removing particles from the air in a given space. Additionally, a study by the National Air Duct Cleaners Association (NADCA) recommends regular inspections of HVAC systems at least twice a year to ensure optimal performance and air quality.
Elias et al. (21) demonstrated that hospitals equipped with HEPA filtration systems could benefit from localized filtering in high-traffic areas to reduce viral particle counts. An affordable air purifier with a HEPA filter, priced at approximately $100, can effectively refresh the air in a 15m2 room up to 5 times per hour, making it a viable option for widespread deployment in hospital settings. Enhancing airflow velocity within current HVAC systems and preventing air recirculation between rooms are recommended strategies to consider for improving air quality and reducing the risk of viral transmission.
The Federation of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations (REHVA) has issued interim guidance regarding the operation and utilization of building services in regions affected by a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. This guidance is designed to mitigate the transmission of the virus through HVAC or plumbing systems [22].
According to ASHRAE, REHVA, and NAFA, various strategies and guidelines can be implemented to mitigate contamination in the ICU and hospital settings, as illustrated in Figure 3 and elaborated upon in detail.
Special ultraviolet (UV) cleaning equipment designed for supply-air or room-air treatment has demonstrated efficacy in eradicating bacteria and viruses. However, according to the guidance document, this equipment is deemed appropriate exclusively for use in healthcare facilities.
NAFA recommends the implementation of a well-designed and properly maintained UV system, often in conjunction with filtration, humidity control, and airflow management, as a means to mitigate infections from various viruses. UV-C light, when applied, is absorbed by the Ribonucleic acid (RNA) and Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) within cells and microbes, triggering changes (apoptosis) in the DNA/RNA structures that render them incapable of replication. A broad spectrum of microbes, encompassing bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores, are susceptible to inactivation through UV-C light exposure. The degree of inactivation is directly correlated with the UV-C dose received, which, in turn, is contingent upon the intensity and duration of exposure [23, 24].
UV-C radiation, characterized by its short wavelength and high energy in comparison to other forms of UV radiation, operates most effectively in a direct line and over short distances. The high energy associated with UV-C radiation adheres to the inverse square law, resulting in a rapid decrease in light intensity as distance from the source increases. Research conducted by Escombe et al. [24] and Casanova et al. [25] has demonstrated that adequate air circulation within a room is crucial for effectively mixing the air. In high-risk clinical environments, upper-room UV fixtures have proven to be a valuable tool for infection control.
According to Ryan et al. [26], germicidal ultraviolet lamps (eUVGI) were found to reduce microbial proliferation in HVAC systems. The study was conducted in neonatal intensive care units and air conditioning ventilation systems. The research results indicated a decrease in microbial colonization in patients' tracheas and a reduction in antibiotic usage. Various bacteria, fungi, and microbes were identified in HVAC systems, ICU environments, and patients, prompting further testing to validate the efficacy of UV radiation application.
In addition to UVC, alternative methods such as Ozone (O3) and Advanced Oxidation processes can be employed for the same purpose. Ozone is notable for its high oxidative capacity (2.07 mV), serving as a potent sanitizer capable of deactivating various pathogenic microorganisms. However, regulatory bodies like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Brazilian National Environment Council (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente - CONAMA) impose limits on the concentration of Ozone due to its association with respiratory issues at elevated levels. Advanced Oxidation processes, also known as Active Oxidation, feature Photo Hydro Ionization (PHI) cells as a key component. These cells function by utilizing high-intensity UV lamps positioned within the equipment or ducts for air circulation. When the UV light interacts with a specific metallic mesh, it generates Hydrogen Peroxides (H2O2), hydroxides, superoxide ions, and ozone ions in minimal concentrations. Consequently, these chemical by-products engage with airborne and surface-bound microorganisms, rendering them inactive and purifying the surrounding environment. Both methods prove effective in combating pathogens.
Hospital administrators, governments, and policymakers need to collaborate closely with ICU practitioners to anticipate and address the imminent surge in demand for critical care facilities.
To enhance natural ventilation in buildings lacking mechanical systems, it is advisable to rely more on window-driven airflow. Despite the potential for inducing thermal discomfort, the utilization of openable windows is encouraged. In structures equipped with mechanical ventilation, the strategic opening of windows can further augment the overall ventilation effectiveness.
In buildings equipped with passive stack or mechanical exhaust systems in toilets, open windows may lead to the spread of contaminated airflow from the toilet to other rooms. Therefore, it is advisable to keep toilet windows closed in such situations. In cases where there is insufficient exhaust ventilation in toilets and it is not possible to prevent window airflow, it is suggested to keep windows open in other areas of the building to facilitate cross flows throughout the structure.
REHVA research has demonstrated that flushing toilets generate plumes containing droplets and residual droplet residue when flushed with open lids. Recent scientific papers and Chinese authorities have reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in stool samples. It is crucial to maintain continuous operation of exhaust ventilation systems in toilets to prevent the potential transmission of the virus. It is essential to ensure that a negative pressure environment is maintained to minimize the risk of fecal-oral transmission, as illustrated in the accompanying figure.
Transmission of certain viruses within buildings can be mitigated by adjusting air temperature and humidity levels. In isolation rooms, vents are typically positioned at the lower end, with airflow meticulously regulated to prevent air from seeping into adjacent spaces. Research indicates that in air-conditioned environments, maintaining low humidity and temperature levels can facilitate the survival of respiratory illnesses like COVID-19. These minute virus particles can linger in the air, traveling considerable distances propelled by airflow within rooms or bathrooms. For instance, high-risk immunocompromised individuals are often housed in Protective Environment (PE) rooms, specifically designed to prevent external airborne pathogens from infiltrating the space. These rooms are positively pressurized relative to the corridor, ensuring a minimum supply of HEPA-filtered air. However, this positive pressurization can inadvertently lead to aerosols escaping the PE room into the corridor when the door is opened, potentially exposing healthcare workers, patients, and visitors to infectious agents. In contrast, Airborne Infection Isolation (AII) rooms are equipped with negative pressure differentials, expelling room air directly outside to contain aerosolized pathogens and prevent their dissemination into shared areas. While this negative pressure strategy effectively confines pathogens within the room, it can also expose occupants to airborne contaminants originating from the corridor. Both PE and AII rooms may incorporate an anteroom as an additional barrier between common spaces and protected areas, serving as a buffer against pathogen transmission and a designated area for healthcare personnel to don and doff personal protective equipment (PPE). Despite surface contact being a primary mode of transmission, aerosols also pose a significant contamination risk, potentially evading mask protection. Moreover, flushing toilets can release contaminants, leading organizations like REHVA to recommend that maintaining a distance of 2 meters and wearing masks may not suffice for protection against SARS-CoV-2. Implementing measures such as enhanced ventilation can aid in reducing airborne particle concentration.
COVID-19 exhibits resistance to environmental fluctuations and is only susceptible to conditions of very high relative humidity (RH), exceeding 80%, and temperatures surpassing 30°C, parameters that fall outside the realm of thermal comfort standards.
Humidification is recommended during winter months, with levels ideally maintained at around 30%, as nasal systems and mucous membranes are particularly vulnerable to infections in environments with very low relative humidity (RH) ranging from 10% to 20%. However, as March approaches, climatic conditions across European regions naturally yield RH levels exceeding 30%, rendering additional humidification unnecessary.
Figure 5 illustrates that under dry room conditions with 20ºC temperature and 20% relative humidity, as well as in a humid environment with 80% relative humidity, the majority of coronaviruses remain viable for a duration of 2 days, as indicated by the blue line and blue star. Conversely, in a room with air at 50% relative humidity, less than 1% of the viruses retain viability after the same 2-day period, denoted by the red star [25].
Low temperatures have been shown to enhance the longevity of viable viruses on inanimate surfaces, as evidenced in the study conducted on stainless steel (black line). Conversely, high temperatures have been found to diminish the persistence of coronaviruses, as indicated by the yellow line in the study.
At all temperatures tested (4ºC, 20ºC, 40ºC), the rate of inactivation is observed to be most rapid at an intermediate relative humidity level of 50% RH.
Taylor et al. (35) found a correlation between mid-range humidity levels and enhanced mammalian immunity against respiratory infections. In a similar vein, Mousavi et al. (36) noted that relative humidity (RH) values ranging from 40% to 60% represent the most unfavorable climatic conditions for the survival of microorganisms. To achieve the desired mid-range humidity levels linked to reduced infections, it is essential to carefully select, operate, and maintain humidification equipment when introducing water vapor into indoor environments. Drawing from the insights of the SARS study, the connection between relative humidity and virus activation becomes more comprehensible (35, 36).
In their study, Casanova et al. (25) investigated the impact of air temperature and humidity on two surrogate viruses for SARS-CoV, specifically transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). These viruses were chosen as they can effectively mimic the behavior of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, aiding in the modeling of exposure, transmission risk, and control strategies for human pathogenic viruses on healthcare surfaces.
In accordance with the guidelines provided by REHVA [14] and ASHRAE, a schematic depicted in Figure 6 has been devised to illustrate the behavior of aerosols and potential strategies to combat them.
The ICU community needs to be ready to face the challenges posed by this pandemic. It is crucial to streamline workflows for swift diagnosis and isolation, effective clinical management, and stringent infection prevention measures. These efforts are essential not only for the well-being of patients with COVID-19 but also for the safety of healthcare workers and other patients who are vulnerable to nosocomial transmission [38].
The role of healthcare workers (HCWs) in transmitting pathogens from patient to patient is extensively documented. Nevertheless, emerging evidence highlights the contaminated environment as a crucial factor in pathogen transmission. Various elements such as temperature, humidity, and severity may impact the concentration of viral particles in an aerosol sample [38].
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States defines an N95 respirator mask as a respiratory protective device intended to achieve a close facial fit and efficient filtration of airborne particles. Apart from blocking splashes, sprays, and large droplets, the respirator is engineered to prevent the wearer from inhaling very small particles present in the air. Although the overall effectiveness of these masks is a subject of debate, they are widely considered to be the most effective method currently available for safeguarding against the inhalation of highly infectious airborne particles.
Inadequately ventilated buildings have a detrimental impact on air quality and can facilitate the transmission of diseases, as microorganisms can be dispersed through air-conditioning systems. Research indicates that in healthcare settings with a significant number of infectious patients, poorly ventilated structures pose an increased risk of disease transmission for patients, healthcare workers, and visitors. Li et al. (38) have illustrated the correlation between ventilation, air circulation within buildings, and the spread of infectious diseases.
While there remains a lack of precise data to determine and measure the minimum ventilation needs, especially in hospital settings and isolation rooms concerning the transmission of infectious diseases through airborne means, the research does advocate for the utilization of negatively pressurized isolation rooms within hospitals for patients afflicted with such diseases.
We all have a responsibility in mitigating the spread of this disease, with HVAC systems playing a crucial role alongside social distancing, hygiene practices, and the impact of individual behavior. Research by Ryan et al. [26] demonstrated that eUVGI technology can effectively reduce HVAC microbial colonization, leading to decreased microbial presence in environments such as neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and tracheal areas [20, 26].
ASHRAE 55 establishes the standards for comfort parameters, with the PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) index considering relative humidity to a limited extent. Consequently, the implication arising from the spread of viruses suggests that air conditioning should no longer be solely focused on human comfort but rather on human health, emphasizing the significance of relative humidity alongside operating temperature. Reconsidering higher air speeds, particularly in buildings designed for human comfort, coupled with downward air return, could potentially alter the virus trajectory and introduce UV-C lamps into return grids as a preventive measure [39].
Data center rooms frequently incorporate adiabatic systems, leading to energy savings through metrics such as EUED (Energy Usage Effectiveness Design) and TWI (Total Water Impact). The slightly elevated humidity levels (45%-65%) in these environments can support the utilization of adiabatic systems, enabling higher chilled water temperatures for air conditioner input. This, in turn, enhances compression ratios and contributes to overall energy efficiency and cost savings [40-41].
Moreover, forthcoming designs ought to reassess the optimal approach to triage and conduct initial assessments of patients exhibiting symptoms associated with airborne viruses in order to reduce exposure to areas housing other patient populations whenever feasible. Looking ahead, architects, designers, building operators, and healthcare administrators should strive for hospital layouts that can facilitate periods of heightened social distancing and limit interactions and movement between shared spaces, all while allowing for adaptability to optimize space utilization under regular operational circumstances.
The significance of infection control in hospital design is steadily growing, with HVAC systems assuming a crucial role in mitigating the potential risks associated with airborne transmission of infections within the built environment.
Four strategies were devised to transform the perception of air conditioning from a potential source of contamination (owing to small droplets passing through the coil and high-speed pressure ventilation reaching occupants) to a crucial tool for effectively inactivating viruses within indoor spaces.
The effectiveness of various strategies in mitigating contagion sources was assessed in this study (refer to Figure 4). These strategies included: 1) the use of UVC lamps, 2) pressure control and air renewal/filtration systems, 3) specific actions in restrooms, and 4) humidity control measures. Each strategy was evaluated based on its ability to prevent the spread of contagion within the environment under investigation.
Furthermore, a comprehensive perspective on human comfort was proposed, necessitating a reevaluation of the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index, given that humidity exerts a lesser influence on human comfort compared to its impact on health issues.
