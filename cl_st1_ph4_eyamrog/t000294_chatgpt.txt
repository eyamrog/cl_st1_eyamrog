Objective: This study aims to conduct an analysis of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the lessons learned from global efforts to implement preventive measures advised by the World Health Organization. Additionally, it seeks to provide an epidemiological overview of the situation worldwide, with a specific focus on Latin America and Brazil.
Results: The World Health Organization has emphasized that reducing the speed of virus circulation, controlling and decreasing the number of cases and deaths resulting from the pandemic can only be achieved through widespread adoption of essential measures. These measures encompass hand hygiene, the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, practicing proper cough etiquette, surface cleaning, avoiding crowded places, and maintaining social distancing. The epidemiological curve of the disease starkly illustrates the catastrophic impact in countries like Italy, Spain, and the United States, which have surpassed China in terms of death tolls due to delayed implementation of these crucial measures. In Brazil, the alarming rate of progression compared to global and Latin American trends indicates a significant surge in case numbers.
In conclusion, the current pandemic stands out as one of the most severe in recent human history, with its trajectory being significantly impacted by the extent to which both individual and collective behavioral measures are adhered to.
On the global stage, despite its distance from our daily lives, the onset of 2020 was marked by an outbreak of an enigmatic pneumonia linked to a variant of coronavirus, with the initial case surfacing in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The escalating number of cases swiftly classified the infection as an outbreak, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to designate it a public health emergency of international concern by the end of January 2020. This virus was first isolated in 1937 and was officially termed coronavirus in 1965, owing to its crown-like appearance under microscopy. The WHO documented 774 fatalities from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) between 2002 and 2003, and in 2012, 858 deaths were attributed to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-CoV) in Saudi Arabia, both stemming from members of the coronavirus family. Fast forward to 2019-2020, the world witnessed the spread of a mutating RNA virus, particularly through asymptomatic carriers, as an emerging infection with milder symptoms compared to SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV but with heightened transmissibility, leading to significant strains on healthcare systems. While most individuals contract coronaviruses at some point in their lives, particularly children, who may encounter α-coronaviruses 229E and NL63, as well as β-coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1, these strains can occasionally trigger severe respiratory illnesses in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.
Researchers initially isolated the virus in the early cases and identified a genetic mutation in a spike surface protein crucial for the virus's ability to invade the human body and replicate. Gradually, details emerged regarding the virus's incubation period, estimated to be between two and ten days, as well as its mode of transmission through contaminated droplets, hands, and surfaces. This information coincided with a surge in infected individuals, fatalities, and a high rate of transmission in Wuhan, prompting immediate control measures such as the suspension of public transport, closure of entertainment venues, and restrictions on public gatherings. The rapid spread of cases to other regions was facilitated by globalization and a lack of standardized protocols for travelers. Initially, there was a dearth of answers amidst numerous questions, prompting the World Health Organization to take swift action in monitoring cases and the virus's global dissemination. Subsequent research findings confirmed human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus, painting a clearer picture of the situation.
In this context, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and implemented crucial preventive and containment measures. These measures encompassed frequent handwashing with soap and water, or the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers when soap and water are unavailable. Additionally, WHO advised against touching the eyes, nose, and mouth, and recommended practicing proper cough etiquette by coughing or sneezing into a flexed elbow or a disposable tissue to protect those in close proximity. Furthermore, WHO emphasized the importance of maintaining a social distance of at least one meter, avoiding crowded spaces, and wearing a mask in the presence of flu-like symptoms or confirmed COVID-19 infection, as well as for healthcare professionals caring for suspected or confirmed cases.
In Brazil, a public health emergency of national importance was declared on February 3, 2020, through Ordinance 188 from the Ministry of Health, in response to human infection with the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) at a risk classification level 3. This declaration aimed to expedite administrative measures for the country to prepare for the impending pandemic, despite the absence of confirmed cases at that time. The first confirmed case in Brazil was reported by the Ministry of Health on February 26 in São Paulo, prompting nationwide alertness. Measures such as hand hygiene and cough etiquette were reinforced. However, the disease progressed rapidly, transitioning from imported cases to community transmission within a month. Imported cases originate from identifiable sources, often linked to travel from countries like China and Italy. In contrast, community transmission involves cases where the virus's origin cannot be traced, including asymptomatic carriers who pose a significant risk due to their ability to effectively spread the virus. As the country faced this new phase of national transmission, researchers utilized mathematical models to estimate the progression of COVID-19 cases, drawing insights from countries that had experienced virus entry prior to Brazil's notification.
This paper aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the lessons learned from global efforts to implement WHO-recommended prevention measures. Additionally, it provides an epidemiological overview of the situation worldwide, with a specific focus on Latin America and Brazil.
The term "virus" originates from Latin, signifying "poison" or "toxin." Typically ranging from 20 to 300 nm in diameter, viruses possess a genome comprising one or more nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA), encased by a protein coat formed by one or more proteins, and often enveloped in a lipid bilayer. Coronaviruses, specifically, are enveloped positive-RNA viruses with a distinctive replication strategy that allows for variability in pathogenicity and adaptability to diverse environments.
SARS-CoV-2, originating from a novel strain identified in 2019, has not been isolated in humans yet. Therefore, the strategies devised to combat the pandemic primarily focus on eradicating the virus and curbing its rapid person-to-person transmission. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among individuals typically happens through autoinoculation in mucous membranes such as the nose, eyes, or mouth, as well as via contact with contaminated surfaces. This underscores the critical importance of promptly implementing preventive measures to safeguard human health and prevent the spread of the virus to individuals.
One of the most crucial measures for preventing transmission is hand hygiene, recognized as a low-cost and highly effective practice due to hands being the primary vehicle for cross-contamination. Numerous studies highlight the inadequate adoption of this practice among healthcare professionals when caring for patients. The act of hand hygiene through washing with water and soap has been shown to significantly reduce the occurrence of preventable infections, thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality in healthcare settings. However, the complexity of adhering to this measure is substantial and can often be attributed to factors such as human behavior, including misconceptions about invisible risks, underestimation of individual responsibility, and lack of knowledge, all of which can impede compliance with preventive measures. Despite the emphasis on the importance of compliance, various barriers, such as the absence of sinks and essential supplies like soap and water or even paper in public areas with high human traffic, including escalators, restrooms, buses, subways, and communities lacking regular water and sewage services, continue to persist within institutional realities.
Given the virus's ability to persist in the environment for extended periods, it is imperative that facilities and areas suspected of being contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 undergo thorough cleaning before being utilized again. This process should involve the use of cleaning products containing antimicrobial agents proven to be effective against coronaviruses. While there is a dearth of direct evidence regarding their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the general consensus is that cleaning with water, household detergents, and commonly used disinfectants is adequate for routine household cleaning purposes.
In hospitals, various antimicrobial agents have been evaluated against different coronaviruses, including isopropanolol, povidone-iodine, ethanol, and sodium hypochlorite. Some of these active ingredients, such as sodium hypochlorite and ethanol, are readily available in non-medical and non-laboratory settings, enhancing accessibility for the general population. Research indicates that surfaces cleaned with 70% alcohol exhibited effective disinfection against two types of coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus) after just one minute of contact, in contrast to 0.06% sodium hypochlorite. Tests conducted with SARS-CoV demonstrated the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite at concentrations ranging from 0.05% to 0.1% after five minutes when combined with a solution containing SARS-CoV. Furthermore, a study examined the surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV-1, the most closely related human coronavirus. The findings of this experimental investigation are depicted in Chart 1.
The findings suggest that the virus can persist and retain its infectivity on various surfaces for varying durations, ranging from hours to days, contingent upon the initial viral load. This underscores the critical significance of practicing proper hand hygiene following interactions with inanimate objects and surfaces. The prolonged viability of the virus on these surfaces is likely attributed to the expulsion of viral-laden droplets through coughing and sneezing, with even a solitary droplet potentially carrying a sufficient infectious dose.
Additionally, social distancing stands as a crucial priority for institutions aiming to curb the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This practice involves reducing contact between potentially infected individuals and those who are healthy, as well as between groups with varying transmission rates. The primary goal is to slow down the epidemic's peak and mitigate its overall impact, thereby safeguarding the capacity of healthcare facilities. The effectiveness of isolation hinges on key epidemiological factors, including the rate of secondary infections stemming from each new case and the proportion of transmissions occurring before symptom onset. These preventive measures are warranted due to the potential risk posed by asymptomatic carriers who could unknowingly spread the virus within the community until their isolation. This challenge underscores the importance of early adoption of the public health strategies outlined in Figure 1 to mitigate the pandemic's consequences.
A study assessing the effectiveness of case isolation in controlling COVID-19 revealed that isolation could effectively control the virus over a three-month period, particularly when transmission rates were low and before symptom onset. However, isolation alone, without accompanying preventive measures, may not be adequate to contain an outbreak. Therefore, the current emphasis is on the importance of proper hand hygiene practices, mask usage, and surface disinfection measures within society to collectively curb the spread of the virus.
The utilization of surgical masks by patients has been shown to decrease aerosol transmission, particularly when they are in proximity to individuals suspected of having COVID-19 and exhibiting mild respiratory symptoms. This preventive measure should be adhered to from the moment of arrival at a healthcare facility, throughout their stay in isolation areas, and during movement within the facility, including transportation between different sections. Patients are advised to refrain from touching their masks, eyes, mouth, and face to minimize the risk of contamination. (Citation: 22-23)
This measure can help restrict the transmission of respiratory diseases, including the novel coronavirus. However, relying solely on mask usage is inadequate for ensuring a high level of protection and should always be complemented by other essential practices, notably hand hygiene, particularly before and after wearing masks. It is crucial to bear in mind that wearing masks when unnecessary can lead to unnecessary expenses and foster a misguided perception of safety, potentially leading to negligence towards other crucial preventive measures like hand hygiene and disinfection of surfaces that may be contaminated with SARS-CoV-2.
For procedures involving patients suspected or confirmed to have contracted the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that may produce aerosols (such as those inducing coughing, intubation, tracheal aspiration, invasive and non-invasive ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation pre-intubation, sputum induction, and nasotracheal sample collections), healthcare workers are advised to utilize respiratory protection masks (particulate respirators) with a minimum filtration efficiency of 95% for particles up to 0.3 µ (such as N95, N99, N100, PFF2, or PFF3). Ideally, aerosol-generating procedures should be conducted in a respiratory isolation unit equipped with negative pressure and a Hepa filter (high-efficiency particulate arrestance). In the absence of such facilities, patients should be isolated in a room with closed doors (and open windows) and the number of healthcare professionals present during these procedures should be limited.
When using respirators such as N95 or PFF2 masks, it is crucial to ensure that the equipment is properly fitted to the face. The handling, usage, and storage should strictly adhere to the manufacturer's guidelines, and it is imperative that these accessories are not shared among professionals. Prior to use, a thorough inspection of the components, including the nasal bridge strips and material, should be conducted to verify the fit and seal of the mask. Visual examination of the N95 mask is essential to identify any signs of compromise to its integrity, such as dampness, dirt, tears, dents, or creases, as masks exhibiting these characteristics should not be used. It is crucial to avoid layering a surgical mask over an N95 mask or its equivalent, as this not only fails to ensure proper filtration or protection from contamination but also results in the unnecessary wastage of additional Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), a critical concern in the current pandemic scenario. In exceptional circumstances where there is a shortage of supplies during the COVID-19 epidemic, professionals may reuse the N95 mask or its equivalent, provided that strict protocols are followed to prevent contamination during removal. To reduce the risk of contamination, a face shield can be utilized if available. A clean, dry, and intact mask can be reused by the same professional within the same shift for up to 12 hours or as stipulated by the Hospital Infection Control Commission (HICC) of the healthcare facility.
To properly remove the mask, it is essential to first detach the side elastics without touching the inner surface. Subsequently, the mask should be carefully placed in a paper bag or envelope with the elastics facing outwards, which aids in its easy removal for future use. It is important to note that the use of plastic bags may lead to the mask retaining moisture and potential contamination. Additionally, it is crucial to emphasize that these masks cannot be cleaned or disinfected for reuse, and when they become wet, their filtration capacity diminishes.
On the other hand, the recommendation for health professionals to use masks led to a surge in the general population rushing to pharmacies to obtain them, resulting in a shortage for health services caring for COVID-19 patients. Starting on April 2, 2020, the Ministry of Health of Brazil advised the use of masks crafted from materials like cotton and non-woven textiles for individuals in close contact with suspected cases at home or needing to venture out for activities involving potential contact with others, serving as a physical barrier. It is crucial to complement this measure with existing preventive strategies like social distancing, avoiding touching the face, and maintaining proper hand hygiene. While fabric masks can help reduce transmission from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers, they do not offer individual protection due to their lack of microorganism filtration. It is essential to emphasize that these masks should be used individually and not shared, with a strict prohibition on their use in healthcare settings as outlined in Technical Note 4/2020 by the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA, equivalent to the US FDA).
This measure supports the gradual spread of contagion among individuals, thereby preventing a sudden peak in the curve. Consequently, it aids in ensuring that the health system can adequately attend to those who have been infected, with sufficient equipment and personnel, without experiencing the overwhelming burden witnessed in other nations where a large number of infections occurred within a short timeframe.
The various preventive and protective measures in place should be tailored to the specific type of contact and procedure being carried out, as well as the attire required for assisting a suspected COVID-19 patient or carrier. These measures typically encompass the use of gloves, a gown or apron, goggles or a face shield, a head covering, and an apron.
The use of a cloak or apron with a minimum weight of 30 g/m2 is essential to prevent contamination of the skin and clothing of healthcare professionals, who should wash their hands after removing it. For individuals suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, a waterproof apron is recommended. Healthcare providers should evaluate the necessity of using a waterproof coat or apron with a minimum weight of 50 g/m2 based on the patient's clinical presentation, such as vomiting, diarrhea, orotracheal hypersecretion, or bleeding. The cloak or apron should feature long sleeves, a mesh or elastic cuff, and a rear opening, constructed from high-quality, non-toxic material. Following use, the impermeable cloak or apron should be considered contaminated and disposed of as infectious waste after completing the necessary procedures for a COVID-19 patient before exiting the isolation area.
In many regions of Brazil located far from major urban centers, institutions often provide fabric aprons instead of disposable ones. However, amidst the current pandemic, it is crucial that these fabric aprons are promptly sent to laundry after use, with strict recommendations against their reuse during subsequent appointments. Reusing aprons poses a significant risk of contamination and spread, potentially leading to a surge in demand for hospital beds for severe cases and even necessitating the removal of healthcare professionals due to contamination. Similarly, procedure gloves must be discarded before professionals exit patient isolation rooms, while support personnel like cleaning staff should utilize long-barreled rubber gloves. It is imperative that all healthcare workers exercise care and attention, ensuring that glove usage does not substitute proper hand hygiene and that surfaces around patients, whether infected or not, are considered contaminated. These surfaces, including tables and bedside rails, should not be touched with gloves to prevent viral spread in the environment. Misuse of gloves, particularly in isolation units with multiple COVID-19 patients, can lead to cross-contamination and heightened morbidity rates.
The experiences of affected countries, alongside the evolution of the disease and global mortality rates, highlight a clear correlation between the effectiveness of preventive measures implemented by governmental health authorities and the level of compliance exhibited by the population. The stringent enforcement of these measures and their widespread adoption have had a significant impact on the management and trajectory of COVID-19 cases, as illustrated in Figure 2.
What we have observed is that despite the Ministry of Health emphasizing the importance of implementing such measures daily, initial compliance posed a new challenge for the population, particularly concerning restrictions and social distancing. This compliance was hindered by the looming threat of increased unemployment, income reduction, and the tendency to downplay the potential risks of the pandemic. These behaviors have the potential to undermine the effectiveness of the measures and heighten the risk of a resurgence of cases, as illustrated in Figure 2. Health and political authorities in various states have made efforts to urge the population to stay at home in order to flatten the curve and reduce the circulation of the virus, along with revising certain recommendations.
In the context of ongoing daily learning and monitoring of individual cases within states and across the country up to April 18, 2020, an examination of the growth curve of cases in Brazil in comparison to other nations reveals a distinct pattern. As depicted in Figure 3 (left panel), the trajectory of growth in Brazil differs significantly from the alarming situations witnessed in Italy, Spain, and the United States. Initially, a parallel evolution can be observed in these countries, but as time progresses, a noticeable divergence emerges, potentially attributed to increased population adherence to restrictions and the reinforcement of state policies for social containment.
The progression of COVID-19 cases in Brazil, as depicted in Figure 3's right panel, exhibits a notable upward trajectory compared to several Latin American countries, including Peru, Chile, and Ecuador. The graph illustrates the daily evolution of infections following the reporting of a minimum of ten cases in each respective country.
According to data compiled by John Hopkins University up to April 18, 2020, the global statistics reveal a rapid escalation in the COVID-19 pandemic. Just 39 days after the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, the world had recorded 2,317,758 cases and 159,509 deaths across 185 countries and regions. The progression was staggering, with confirmed cases jumping from 100,000 to 200,000 in just twelve days. Within six days, this figure doubled to over 400,000, and within another seven days, it surpassed 800,000. The acceleration continued, with the count climbing from 500,000 to 1 million in a week, and then breaching 2 million infected individuals just 13 days later. This exponential growth underscores the alarming pace at which the global case count was increasing.
It is imperative to account for variations in the spread of infections across different countries on a global scale. Figure 4 illustrates the progression of the doubling time of new coronavirus cases, based on data as of April 18, 2020.
It is evident that the estimated speed of case duplication for Canada and the United States (US) until March 24 was approximately every two and a half days, but by April 7, this interval had extended to around seven days, indicating a decrease in the rate of spread while maintaining vigilance over total case numbers. Conversely, Colombia and Brazil experienced a different trend during the same period, with their doubling times increasing, thereby slowing down the infection spread until March 29 and 30, respectively. However, by April 3, Brazil's speed surpassed that of Colombia, with a doubling interval just over four days, underscoring the urgency for enhanced containment measures to curb the epidemic's progression effectively. By the end of the interval on April 18, the doubling times had generally increased across the board, signaling a reduction in the pace of infection dissemination. In Mexico, Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil, cases were projected to double within up to 8 days, while other countries in the dataset exhibited doubling intervals exceeding eleven days, with Colombia reaching up to eighteen days.
The COVID-19 outbreak, still in its nascent stage with an uncertain duration, necessitates a concerted effort to minimize exposure to the virus in order to effectively control and delay the spread of the disease and mitigate its adverse consequences, including heightened mortality rates and the deterioration of economic and social conditions. Lessons drawn from countries like Singapore, South Korea, and Japan, which swiftly implemented measures such as social distancing and the early suspension of classes, underscore the pivotal role of immediate action in managing cases and conducting widespread diagnoses to influence the trajectory of transmission, ultimately resulting in a reduced fatality rate. For instance, Singapore, initially grappling with a surge in confirmed cases outside mainland China on February 17, 2020, promptly enforced stringent control measures such as isolating suspected or confirmed cases in negatively pressurized rooms, providing comprehensive training and re-education for healthcare professionals on the proper use of personal protective equipment, respirators, and air purifiers, monitoring isolation teams for COVID-19 symptoms using thermal scanners to detect fever, and investing in single-use equipment like disposable bronchoscopes for bronchoscopy and percutaneous tracheostomy. Despite a recent uptick in cases, as of April 18, Singapore has reported a total of eleven deaths and 5,992 confirmed infections, underscoring the efficacy of their proactive approach in containing the outbreak.
South Korea, which reported its first case on January 20, 2020, implemented contact tracing between suspected and infected individuals for epidemiological investigations. The country also established a risk assessment system for potential exposure among individuals in locations with confirmed cases (post-symptom onset) and categorized contacts based on this risk level. Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of infection spread in areas visited by confirmed patients, thorough disinfection measures were carried out in potentially contaminated environments. These systematic investigations proved successful due to a stringent control process grounded in scientific principles and continuous feedback assessment loops to effectively manage the outbreak. Despite the number of patients exceeding 10,600 as of April 18, recent weeks have seen a significant decrease in new infections.
Japan conducted a meticulous surveillance from the initial appearance of the disease in a primary (suspected) case to its development in a secondary (infected) case in order to comprehend the transmissibility of the disease. Through the mapping of suspect/infected data, they were able to effectively manage the spread and transmissibility, particularly by identifying substantial pre-symptomatic transmissions and promptly isolating individuals with COVID-19 within a population of 120 million. Consequently, by April 18, 2020, the reported cases had reached 10,300, with a total of 222 fatalities.
The Chinese special administrative region of Hong Kong, home to a population of 7.5 million, shares a land border with mainland China and reported 1,024 cases and four deaths on April 18, 2020. In this context, both the World Health Organization (WHO) and experts concur that early detection of cases plays a crucial role in curtailing the transmission of a virus.
The active participation of the entire society in consciously embracing preventive measures against COVID-19 necessitates an immediate and stringent shift in both individual and collective behaviors. Within the context of this pandemic, it becomes evident that the progression and repercussions of COVID-19 in Brazil hinge upon the collaborative endeavors of governmental bodies, families, and citizens alike. The global landscape underscores the need for heightened vigilance and can inform decisions regarding the strategies to be adopted in confronting this pivotal juncture, thereby enabling interventions to mitigate the rapid spread of COVID-19.
