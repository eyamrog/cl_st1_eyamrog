The BCG vaccine, originally developed to combat tuberculosis, has demonstrated efficacy in activating and training innate immunity for various purposes. Given the absence of a specific vaccine for the new coronavirus, it is imperative to explore and evaluate its potential protective effects against this novel pathogen.
Objective: This study aims to compare the acceleration rates of COVID-19 incidence and lethality among the main countries affected by the pandemic, based on their BCG vaccination programs.
Methods: The first part of the data survey involved gathering information from official sources regarding the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported between December 31, 2019, and April 11, 2020. This data was used to calculate the incidence, mortality, and lethality acceleration rates, which were then compared among predefined groups based on their BCG vaccination programs.
Results revealed a stark contrast between countries with established BCG vaccination programs and those without. Nations lacking a vaccination program or never having implemented one experienced significantly higher incidence and mortality acceleration rates, with figures reaching 21.36 and 53.21 times higher, respectively, compared to countries with universal vaccination programs. Moreover, countries with expanded vaccination initiatives demonstrated a notable 43% decrease in mortality rates (p < 0.001) when contrasted with nations solely offering vaccination at birth.
In conclusion, a correlation has been observed between the extent of coverage of BCG vaccination programs and the rate of increase in new cases and fatalities within countries. This suggests a potential protective effect in regions where BCG vaccination programs are already in place.
In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, located in Hubei province, China. Subsequent investigations led to the identification of a novel coronavirus, designated as 2019-nCoV. Given the novelty of this viral strain and the missed chance to isolate the initial cases, direct containment efforts became significantly challenging. Early epidemiological data suggested that the elderly population with underlying conditions such as systemic arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus were at higher risk of severe outcomes.
Descriptions of severe cases in young individuals, adolescents, and adults without comorbidities challenge the prevailing hypothesis that fragility is the primary determinant of a severe outcome.
The progression of the pandemic has advanced from East to West, necessitating a thorough examination of the varying mortality and lethality rates in border regions.
Every day, a multitude of hypotheses are formulated, spanning various factors including geographical location, climate, altitude, age distribution, and the community's ability to comply with public health measures like social distancing and quarantine.
The transmission of the coronavirus to humans primarily occurs through mucous membranes. It is evident that the host's response, in terms of both form and intensity, dictates the clinical manifestation of the infection. Following the breach of the mucosal barrier, which acts as a mechanical defense, the innate immune system, comprising macrophages, CD4+ lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, must effectively combat the virus and present antigens to trigger the production of antibodies by humoral immunity. This coordinated immune response is crucial for eradicating the infection and establishing long-lasting immunity. However, failure in this defense mechanism or an exaggerated immune reaction can result in fatal outcomes.
Enhancing the innate immune response through treatment can significantly boost the immune system's effectiveness upon virus entry into the bloodstream. Therefore, comprehending the quality of individual or collective innate responses is crucial. In pursuit of this goal, the authors have examined the correlation between the epidemiological phase of the pandemic in various countries and their BCG (bacillus Calmette–Guérin) vaccination status, known for its role in activating or training innate immunity.
Countries that maintain ongoing and widespread BCG vaccination programs are likely to experience lower rates of COVID-19 incidence and mortality when compared to nations that have either discontinued or never implemented such vaccination initiatives.
The study focused on tracking the incidence of COVID-19 cases and associated fatalities from December 31, 2019, to April 11, 2020. To further analyze the progression of the pandemic, it is recommended that the same data sets be compared for the dates of May 11 and June 11.
The data source for this study is the official publication by John Hopkins Hospital. Countries were selected based on the descending order of the number of cases reported on April 11, 2020, and were categorized into two groups. The first group consisted of countries with either no tuberculosis vaccination programs or with low vaccination coverage. The second group comprised countries with the highest vaccine coverage, either through vaccines administered at birth or at two or more life stages. These categories were further subdivided into seven subgroups, each consisting of the aforementioned countries, along with the rationale for their classification as outlined in Table 1.
Group 1 comprises countries like the United States, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Iran, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. These nations either have vaccination programs tailored exclusively for specific groups, as seen in the case of the United States, or have altogether discontinued their vaccination initiatives.
Group 2 comprises countries including China, Brazil, Portugal, South Korea, Russia, Israel, Ireland, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Hungary, Turkey, Austria, Poland, and India. These nations have well-established vaccination programs or boast high vaccination coverage rates exceeding 90%, exemplified by Austria.
Group 2a comprises the countries from Group 2, with the exception of India and China, primarily because of their large population sizes.
Group 3 consists of Hungary, Chile, Russia, and Portugal, which are countries that implement an extensive vaccination program at two specific points in an individual's life.
Group 4 comprises countries such as China, Brazil, South Korea, Israel, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Turkey, Austria, Poland, and India, where vaccination programs are primarily administered at birth.
Group 5 consists of the United States and Mexico, Spain and Portugal, and the United Kingdom and Ireland. These countries were selected based on their geographical proximity and varying vaccination statuses. They were further divided into two subgroups as follows:
Group 5.1 comprises the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
Group 5.2 comprises Mexico, Portugal, and Ireland.
In detailing the profile description of each group, the analysis includes the presentation of key measures such as incidence, mortality, and lethality rates. These metrics are computed through specific methodologies outlined as follows: <>.
For each rate, the confidence interval was calculated using the method for proportions as outlined in standard statistical procedures.
In order to compare the groups under investigation, the ratios of incidences are calculated by dividing the incidence rates of the respective groups. Additionally, the factors contributing to mortality and lethality are outlined and discussed.
The null hypothesis, which posits equal rates among the groups of interest, was tested using the Z test for comparison of proportions. The analyses were conducted utilizing R software version 3.6.3, with a significance level set at 5%.
Table 1 displays the descriptive incidence, mortality, and lethality rates for each interest group. The incidence and mortality figures are depicted per 100,000 inhabitants, while the lethality rates are illustrated per 100 cases.
The countries comprising group 5.1 (the USA, Spain, and the UK) were specifically chosen for comparison with their counterparts (Mexico, Portugal, and Ireland) due to their notably elevated incidence and mortality rates within the studied cohorts, registering 154.835 cases per 100,000 inhabitants and 9.925 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Upon juxtaposing groups 5.1 and 5.2, it became evident that the incidence, mortality, and lethality rates were markedly higher in group 5.1 when compared to group 5.2, with an incidence rate 8.01 times greater, mortality rate 14.73 times higher, and lethality rate 1.84 times higher than that of group 6.2 (p < 0.001) as illustrated in Table 2.
In terms of mortality rates, groups 1 and 5.1 exhibit the highest values, with 11.586 and 9.925 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. Conversely, group 4 demonstrates the lowest mortality rate at 0.209 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. The inclusion of China in this group may account for this result, given its substantial population size. However, it is noteworthy that group 3, comprising countries with an expanded vaccine scheme, boasts the lowest fatality rate at 1.87 deaths per 100 cases (p < 0.001).
Table 2 displays the incidence, mortality, and lethality ratios for the groups being compared, along with the p-value derived from the hypothesis test for comparing two proportions.
When comparing group 1 to group 2, the ratio estimates suggest that the incidence rate in group 1 is 21.36 times higher than in group 2. Additionally, group 1 exhibits a mortality rate that is 53.21 times higher and a lethality rate 2.49 times higher than group 2. These disparities are likely influenced by the populations of China and India. Excluding these populations for calculation purposes results in a reduction of the incidence ratio to 7.84 and the mortality ratio to 23.24. Interestingly, the lethality ratio remains consistent regardless of the groups being compared.
Another intriguing set of data emerges when comparing groups 3 and 4. Group 3 exhibits an incidence rate 3.12 times higher and a mortality coefficient 43% lower (p < 0.001), potentially indicating a higher diagnostic capacity within the country but with less severe outcomes.
When comparing Group 1 with Group 2a, the incidence ratio was approximately eight, while the mortality ratios were 23.24 and 31.18 times higher when comparing Group 1 with Group 3.
The analysis aimed to enhance comprehension of speed variations in incidence and lethality curves across different countries by calculating initial acceleration (IA) and final acceleration (FA) in cases/d²/100,000 inhabitants. IA was determined from case 1 to case 100, while FA was calculated from case 101 to April 11, 2020. The ratio between current deaths' acceleration (cases > 101) and initial deaths' acceleration (cases 0–100) was then computed, yielding a nondimensional value. Countries with values > 1 indicated an increasing speed of cases, while values < 1 suggested a decrease in mortality speed per 100,000 inhabitants. Among the countries analyzed, only Japan, Israel, Chile, and Hungary exhibited values < 1, signifying a decline in mortality speed. Notably, the United States stood out with the highest ratio, reaching an index of 354.
During the preparation of this article, a study was published where researchers conducted an analysis up to March 21, revealing comparable correlations between the significance of BCG vaccination and the incidence and fatality rates of COVID-19. Despite the shared data source, this current study focused on the initial acceleration rates for cases and deaths (0–100) and subsequent accelerations (from 101 to April 11). The authors plan to extend their investigation by examining accelerations from April 11 to May 11, and concluding with an analysis of accelerations from May 11 to June 11.
Upon analyzing Figure 4, a significant criticism emerged regarding the observed protective effect of BCG vaccination on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in various countries, particularly in those categorized under group 2, which are currently lagging behind in the pandemic timeline. In an effort to mitigate potential selection bias, this study undertook a time standardization process for all countries, commencing from the onset of the pandemic. It is worth noting that such adjustments may not be required for subsequent analyses, as the natural progression of the pandemic is anticipated to provide clarity on this matter, as illustrated in Figure 5.
The increase in mortality rates within the D30 of countries in group 1 continued to be four times greater than in group 2 and 2a. It is anticipated that the foundation of this study on acceleration indices will retain statistical significance in forthcoming analyses scheduled for May 21 and June 21. The significance of these future assessments lies in bolstering the protective hypothesis of the BCG vaccination program, particularly among unvaccinated individuals and high-risk populations susceptible to severe manifestations of COVID-19. Notably, there is currently no dedicated vaccine available for the novel coronavirus.
The reduced incidence of COVID-19 cases and fatalities in nations implementing vaccination programs appears both compelling and biologically feasible. Current data on the pandemic suggest a correlation between program coverage and disease outcomes in studied countries. Further research and analysis are crucial to either substantiate or challenge this hypothesis. Urging controlled studies with user-friendly methodologies is imperative, as this approach could serve as our main defense until a dedicated vaccine materializes.
