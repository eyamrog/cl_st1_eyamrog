ABSTRACT 
Introduction: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is one of the most reported symptoms of COVID -19. 
Previous studies have identified olfactory training (OT) as an important treatment for 
postinfectious OD, but little is known about its effect after SARS-CoV-2 infection and how it can 
be optimized. Objective: To assess whether OT can be optimized if performed intensively, with 
more fragrances over a shorter period in patients with persistent OD after COVID -19. Also, to 
determine the presence of other variables related to OD and treatment response in this 
population. Method: This multicenter randomized clinical trial recruited 80 patients with 
persistent OD with previous COVID-19 for less than three months. The patients were divided 
into two groups, who received treatment with 4 and 8 essences over four weeks. Subjective 
assessments and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) were 
performed before and after treatment. Results: A significant improvement in olfaction was 
measured subjectively and on UPSIT in both groups, but without significant differences between 
groups. In addition, the presence of olfactory fluctuation was associated with higher UPSIT 
scores. Conclusion: These data suggest that intensifying the training by increasing the number 
of essences for 4 weeks does not show superiority over the classical method. Moreover, a 
fluctuating olfactory ability seems to be related to a better score in the UPSIT.

INTRODUCTION 
In December 2019, transmission of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the 
disease COVID -19 began in China 1. The virus is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets 
and contact routes. The most common symptoms of the disease are cough, fever, sore throat, 
shortness of breath, and sudden loss of smell or taste 1. 
Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is now recognized as one of the cardinal symptoms of COVID-
19, with a high predictive value 2. Not only is it one of the most reported symptoms, but the 
magnitude of this manifestation appears to be even greater when assessed with psychophysical 
testing 3. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT®) is a psychophysical 
test for the identification of microencapsulated odors that has been adapted and validated for 
use in different countries, including the Brazilian population 4. Patients with COVID-19 had their 
UPSIT classified as anosmia or severe hyposmia in almost all cases 5. 
Previous studies bring olfactory training (OT) as one of the most important treatments 
for postinfectious OD 6. This therapy consists of daily and repeated exposure to odors over a 
long period of time 7. Hummel et al. initially described an OT method to improve general 
olfactory sensitivity involving four essences (phenylethyl alcohol, eucalyptol, citronella, and 
eugenol), for a period of 12 weeks 8. Altundag et at. observed that changing odors every 12 
weeks can increase the success rate of this therapy in patients with post-infectious OD 7.  
The current study aims to compare the response of olfactory function to OT with 4 and 
8 essences in patients with recent OD post-COVID over 4 weeks. Thus, we prospectively 
investigated whether OT could optimize olfactory rehabilitation when it is intensive, with more 
fragrances, and over a shorter period. In addition, we wanted to prospectively analyze and study 
patients with persistent post-COVID OD to identify other variables related to the disorder or the 
response to OT. 
 
METHODS 
This is a multicenter randomized clinical trial involving individuals aged between 18 to 
60 years with previous COVID -19 infection for less than 3 months, confirmed at that time by RT-
PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) testing, and complaint of olfactory 
alteration which persisted for at least 4 weeks after the onset of COVID -19 symptoms. Patients 
who were unable to provide valid written informed consent and individuals with (1) a history of 
more than one SARS-CoV-2 infection, (2) sinonasal diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis or 
nasal masses, (3) a report of previous traumatic brain injury with olfactory sequelae, (4) OD prior 
to SARS-CoV-2 infection, (5) a neurologic disorder known to affect olfactory function, and (6) 
other current or previous treatment for OD, caused by COVID-19, were excluded from the 
research. 
Patients were invited through the dissemination of the study in the press and social 
networks and followed up in the Otolaryngology services from tertiary hospitals in Curitiba and

Londrina. If the patient agreed and wanted to participate in the research, an informed consent 
form was applied by one of the physicians involved in the study. All participants underwent a 
medical examination by an otolaryngologist, which included nasal endoscopy and the 
application of visual analogue scales (VAS) for subjective assessment of nasal symptoms, 
olfaction, taste, and the effects of OD on the patient's quality of life. The presence of 
chemosensory disturbances, immunization against COVID-19, olfactory fluctuations, and 
complaints related to the nasal function of the trigeminal nerve were also assessed. 
Psychophysical assessment of smell was performed by the UPSIT®. This is a psychophysical and 
clinically validated standardized odor identification test for the "scrape and sniff" format, in 
which microencapsulated odorants are released from a strip when scratched. Out of a total of 
40 points, normosmia is defined as ≥34 for men and ≥35 for women, and an increase of ≥4 points 
can be considered a clinically significant improvement in symptoms 9. Both the UPSIT and 
subjective assessments were performed again within 4 weeks of starting the proposed 
treatment.  
Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to two separate groups for OT. The first 
study group received a classical olfactory training set (COT) with four essential oils: rose, 
eucalyptus, clove, and lemon. The second group received an advanced olfactory training set 
(AOT) with eight essential oils: rose, eucalyptus, clove and lemon, citronella, mint, vanilla and 
cedarwood. 
The guidelines for performing the OT were explained at the first appointment and 
provided in simple and easy-to-understand language booklets. During training, patients were 
exposed to each odor for 15 seconds twice daily, with a 30-second break between odors. 
Patients also received video instructions the day after therapy began and were contacted by 
telephone after completing 1 and 3 weeks of OT by the research team to emphasize the 
importance of treatment adherence. Along with the general instruction booklets, they were 
given a diary to track the training. Those who had not taken the essences for a period of at least 
7 days were excluded from the study. 
The study design was approved by the ethics committee of the institutions involved 
(CAAE: 46698721.5.0000.0096 and 47078821.5.0000.0020).  
Statistical Analysis 
Quantitative variables were described as mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, and interquartile range. To compare the evaluations regarding the presence of OD, 
the binomial test was used. A comparison between two assessments of UPSIT® and VAS scores 
was made using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. Comparisons of more than two assessments 
were made using Friedman’s non-parametric test and Dunn’s post hoc test. For the comparison 
of two groups, concerning quantitative variables, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was 
used. More than two groups were compared using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. The 
analysis of the correlation between two quantitative variables was performed by estimating the 
Spearman correlation coefficient. To assess the association between two categorical variables, 
Fisher’s exact test or the Chi-square test was used. Values of p<0.05 indicated statistical

significance. For multiple comparisons, p values were adjusted by Bonferroni correction. Data 
were analyzed with the computer program IBM SPSS Statistics v.28.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. 
RESULTS 
 
 
Three hundred and forty patients were screened for eligibility, and eighty were enrolled 
in the study. Only one patient required intensive care during the time he had COVID-19, and the 
others had mild or moderate forms without requiring hospitalization. Characterization of all 
study participants revealed a mean age of 36.7 ± 10.3 years, a mean interval between the onset 
of symptoms of COVID -19 and the start of treatment with OT of 63.9 ± 24.2 days (Table 1). The 
mean time for the onset of OD after the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 was 4.6 ± 3.8 days. 
Other characteristics of the analyzed sample are shown in Table 2.

As seen in Table 3, the complaint of anosmia, the complete loss of the sense of smell, 
was reported by 82.5% of patients during the COVID -19 period, whereas it was present in only 
13.8% at the time of the first appointment and was not reported by any patient after 4 weeks 
of OT. During the same period, the prevalence of self-reported hyposmia increased 
progressively. Something similar was observed for complaints of parosmia and phantosmia. 
Similarly, the history of ageusia was present in 63.8% of the patients in the period of COVID-19, 
although the prevalence decreased rapidly thereafter and was only 1.3% at the end of the study. 
Meanwhile, dysgeusia complaint was reported by 23.8% of patients at the time of infection, 75% 
at the beginning of treatment and 63.8% after 4 weeks. At the end of the study, only 3.8% of 
patients denied any chemosensory complaints.

Participants' subjective sense of smell improved throughout the study and between 
medical appointments, as measured by the olfaction VAS. In the general assessment of all 
participants, the olfaction VAS showed a statistically significant difference in the comparison 
between all 4-time points at which it was assessed (before COVID-19, during COVID-19 acute 
phase, first appointment, and follow-up) in general comparison (non-parametric Friedman test; 
p < 0.05) and multivariate (Dunn post hoc test corrected by Bonferroni; p < 0.05) (Table 6). 
Another subjective measurement on a scale of 0 to 10 showed an improvement, the discomfort 
with the olfactory deficit decreased between the first and the second appointment, with a mean 
score of 7.2 ± 2.7 at the first appointment and 6.2 ± 3 at the second appointment (p < 0.05). In 
addition, there was a statistically significant improvement between appointments in the taste 
VAS scores (Table 7).

*Mann-Whitney non-parametric test, p<0.05 
In relation to other measured factors that could be related to the outcomes of olfaction, 
it was observed that patients who reported fluctuations in their olfactory ability at the initial 
appointment (Mann-Whitney nonparametric test) had higher UPSIT scores at baseline (26.8 ± 
6.1 vs. 22.3 ± 7.9; p=0.011) and at final presentation (28.1 ± 4.8 vs. 24.0 ± 7.6; p=0.029) compared 
with participants who did not report this symptom. In addition, these patients with fluctuating 
olfaction had more nasal symptoms at the first visit (5.2 ± 3.4 vs. 2.9 ± 3.0) than patients without 
this symptom (p=0.003). Nevertheless, subjective improvement, as measured by olfaction VAS 
was statistically lower in these patients (1.8 ± 2.5 vs. 2.9 ± 1; p=0.03). The smell fluctuation 
differed between the first visit and return (binomial test; p=0.023). At the first assessment, 
62.8% of patients reported this symptom; at the return, 78.8% reported it. 
There was no association between the reported changes in nasal functions of the 
trigeminal nerve and the presence of any of the chemosensory disorders in any of the moments 
evaluated (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.05). We also found no association between these complaints 
and the mean of the UPSIT scores or the applied VAS (nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, p < 
0.05).

DISCUSSION 
To date, there have been few randomized clinical trials involving olfactory training in 
patients with OD associated with COVID-19, and no study has yet compared variants of this 
therapy in this subset of patients. In addition, this is the first study to evaluate an alternative 
method for OT in patients with OD using eight concurrent essential oils. Another highlight of our 
study was the complete evaluation of patients by an otolaryngologist, including nasal endoscopy 
and the use of a psychophysical test that has been validated for the studied population and is 
widely used in research on the sense of smell. Several associated factors that might be related 
to olfactory complaints or response to therapy were also controlled, such as age, smoking 
history, duration of the olfactory dysfunction, qualification of the disorder, smell fluctuations, 
report of impaired trigeminal function, OT adherence, nasosinusal symptoms, and use of topical 
corticosteroids. Patients also received explanatory videos of the OT on their smartphones and 
were contacted by telephone to ensure adherence. 
The selection of AOT essential oils was made by a fragrance expert in our research group 
based on olfactory training methods used for training recognition and memorization of odors, 
such as the Carles Method 10. We sought to cover different families of odors to improve training 
by enhancing the receptors activated in therapy. In addition to lemon, rose, eucalyptus, and 
clove, representatives of the citrus, floral, aromatic, and spice families, minty, sweet, and woody 
odors were added with essential oils of citronella, mint, vanilla, and cedarwood. We hoped that 
adding more scents to OT would optimize olfactory recovery in patients. However, no statistical 
difference was found in the UPSIT score progression between the AOT (1.0 ± 4.2) and COT groups 
(1.7 ± 3.8) of the study (p=0.281). Similarly, no differences were found between the groups in 
the data collected via the various VAS-scores (Table 8). The data suggest that OT intensification 
does not show superiority over classical training during the 4-week period proposed in this 
study. 
In a study conducted by Altundag et al., a modified form of OT was assessed in which 
patients trained four different essences every 12 weeks over a 36-week period. It was found that 
the group that performed such alternation scored better on the Sniffin' Sticks test than the 
group that performed the classical 4-essence OT 7. It was also found that the shorter the duration 
of the loss of smell, the better the response to the OT. This correlation has also been observed 
in several other papers 11–13. In our study, we sought to include only patients with recent OD, to 
maximize the potential benefit of training and to improve the analysis of differences between 
groups. However, a major difference between our work and that of Altundag et. al. concerns the 
period of use of OT, which is significantly shorter in our study and probably related to the lack 
of benefit of the AOT group. 
In a clinical study comparing periodic alternation of odors with classical training in 
patients with posttraumatic OD, no significant difference was found between the training 
modalities 14. We know that olfactory rehabilitation by OT shows different results depending on 
the etiology of the dysfunction. Patients with posttraumatic etiology respond worse than 
patients with postinfectious OD, for example 11. To date, no study has examined the efficacy of 
modified OT in patients after COVID 19.  
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3301
Another challenge to the analysis and applicability of treatments for OD is OT adherence 
6. As described by Fornazieri et al, adherence to treatment progressively decreases over the 
months of treatment 15. In light of this, the possibility of intensifying OT by increasing the number 
of scents for a shorter treatment duration has been suggested. At the end of the survey, only 
3.75% of patients had discontinued treatment, one in the AOT group and two in the TOC group. 
Regarding daily adherence, none of the patients failed to use the OT for 7 days, so there was no 
exclusion based on this criterion. The occurrence of side effects was limited to mild symptoms 
without the need to interrupt the OT. The most commonly reported complaints were headache, 
nausea and worsening of nasal symptoms. 
Another 
important 
analysis concerns self-assessment 
and 
performance 
in 
psychophysical tests. In our study, 81.3% of participants reported that their sense of smell 
improved, 84.6% in the AOT group and 79.6% in the COT group (p=0.763). Considering all groups, 
the increase in mean UPSIT score was 1.5 ± 3.9 points (p=0.002). Changes to UPSIT of four or 
more points can be considered as a clinically relevant improvement 16,17, but this difference was 
observed in only a few patients in the study. The weak association between these tests and 
subjective assessment has been described in some previous papers 18–21, which underlines the 
importance of assessing patients with olfactory complaints with standardized tests in addition 
to self-assessment. 
The average time reported for the onset of OD (Table 1) after the onset of symptoms of 
COVID -19 was 4.6 ± 3.8 days, which is consistent with what has been reported in the literature 
22,23. 
Several studies have shown that COVID -19-related OD has a short recovery period in 
most patients, occurring on average 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of the disorder 22,24–26. In a 
paper by Vaira et al, a higher risk for a long-lasting olfactory disturbance was observed in 
patients in whom symptoms persisted 20 days after the onset of OD 25. In our study, all patients 
were selected after at least 4 weeks of olfactory complaints to reduce those who would show 
spontaneous recovery regardless of therapy. 
In the present study, similar to the literature, a sudden anosmia was observed in the 
acute state of COVID -19 (Table 3), leading to a progressive recovery that was accompanied by 
the appearance of other qualitative disorders of olfaction 27.  Although parosmia seems to be 
indicative of the recovery of the functions of olfactory discrimination and identification 28, we 
could not find any relationship between the presence of this symptom and a better development 
by UPSIT or by the olfaction VAS. 
In the global analysis of patients by gustation VAS (Table 7), mean values of 6.1 ± 2.7 and 
6.9 ± 2.5 were obtained at the first and second appointments, respectively, corresponding to an 
improvement of 0.8 ± 2.9 (p=0.009). However, the data showed no statistical difference 
between the groups of OT (Table 8), neither in the mean of the first appointment (p=0.608) nor 
in the difference between it and the mean of the return (p=0.491). 
Patients were asked about their perception of fluctuations in their sense of smell during 
both assessments. At baseline, these complaints occurred in 62.8% of patients and at the end in 
78.8%, a more marked prevalence than that reported by Jerome et. al 29. As expected, patients 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3301
with fluctuations in olfaction also had higher VAS scores for nasal symptoms (p=0.003). 
Fluctuations in olfaction are commonly associated with nasal conditions, such as allergic 
diseases 30 and are less pronounced in patients with postinfectious OD 31.  
The presence of this symptom at the first appointment was associated with better scores 
at both the first UPSIT (p=0.011) and the second appointment (p=0.029). These results may 
suggest that the fluctuations are also related to the regeneration of the neuroepithelium.  
Interestingly, olfactory fluctuations were related to worse smell evolution measured by 
VAS (p=0.029). Considering that self-assessment of this sense seems to reflect mainly changes 
in nasal patency and, to a lesser extent, olfactory function 32, this would explain why fluctuations 
in our study were more pronounced in patients with more severe nasal symptoms, who 
therefore reported worse VAS. 
The trigeminal nerve has an important influence on olfactory perception, being 
associated with the sensation of freshness for minty odors and the tickling sensation for 
carbonated beverages 33. Its somatosensory function in the nose was assessed using 
standardized questions during the history at initial presentation. The relationship between 
trigeminal function impairment and reported chemosensory disturbances at three time points 
was assessed: the acute period of SARS-CoV-2 infection; the first appointment; the return. None 
of the reported disturbances were found to be related to trigeminal function, suggesting a 
pathophysiology likely distinct from that of olfaction. 
The main limitation of the present study is the short duration of the proposed treatment. 
The aim is to evaluate an alternative to the TOC originally described by Hummel et. al 8, that is 
performed intensively, including twice as many scents, and with fewer weeks of stimulation. We 
are aware that most of the studies conducted on this topic have maintained olfactory training 
for a longer period, which limits our analysis of the potential benefits of AOT. 
Another possible criticism relates to the psychophysical test chosen to assess patients, 
as the UPSIT limits the assessment to odor identification only and does not take into account 
the discrimination or olfactory threshold abilities present in other tests. However, work 
conducted by Doty et al. suggested that different psychophysical tests measure what would be 
a common source of variation, so that olfactory impairment and improvement can be effectively 
assessed using only the identification of odors 34.  
 
CONCLUSION 
Prospective evaluation with subjective scales and psychophysical tests in patients with 
persistent olfactory dysfunction post-COVID showed an improvement in the smell capacity with 
the OT performed during 4 weeks. However, the data suggest that intensifying the training by 
increasing the number of essences does not show superiority over the four-week classical 
method. Future studies with an extension of the treatment period are needed to analyze AOT's 
potential benefits better. Additionally, the data indicate that patients with fluctuating olfactory 
ability have better scores in the psychophysical assessment.
