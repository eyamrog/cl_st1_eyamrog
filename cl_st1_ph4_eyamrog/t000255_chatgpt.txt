Challenging circumstances have arisen due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. While the impact on newborns (NB) has been limited thus far, the crisis has brought about significant disruptions in neonatal care. These changes have had a profound effect on established practices related to bonding and neurosensory protection that have been carefully developed over recent years.
In light of the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the current circumstances necessitate physical distancing and limited mobility among individuals. This situation calls for a reevaluation of existing procedures and practices, prompting the development of novel strategies to uphold the standard of care. Recent publications have enforced restrictions on visitations from grandparents, siblings, and other members of the support network, ensuring that only the asymptomatic mother and/or father have exclusive access following thorough and secure screenings at the entrance to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).
The challenge faced by neonatal teams lies in ensuring the safety of the newborn (NB), the NB's parents, and themselves, all while adhering to the fundamental principles of humanized care that have traditionally guided neonatal care in Brazil. It is crucial to comprehend and meet the demands imposed by the current global scenario to facilitate necessary adaptations that prioritize the protection of the triad comprising the NB, their family, and the healthcare team.
In order to achieve this goal, it is crucial to prioritize intensive care, specifically directed towards supporting the newborn (NB), the NB's parents, and the healthcare team. Lessons from countries that were early in encountering this disease underscore the significance of this approach. Wang et al. highlighted the elevated stress levels experienced by parents and healthcare staff in neonatal units, emphasizing the necessity for support from social workers and psychologists for both groups.
During times of social distancing, the unrestricted access of parents to and their presence in the neonatal unit is impeded. Various circumstances can result in the absence of parents, such as symptomatic mothers and/or fathers, individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19, or those who have had contact with infected individuals, as well as parents with other children or family members in high-risk categories, those living far away, or facing transportation challenges. As noted by Canvasser (cited in Furlow), the consequences of separating mothers and infants can be severe. In times of crisis, it is essential to adopt thoughtful, adaptable, and individualized approaches. These modifications necessitate the collective effort of the entire team, engaging in a process of collaboration and mutual assistance.
Ensuring consistent care providers for each newborn on every shift establishes a familiar routine for the patient, enabling them to recognize the voices and touches of each professional. This continuity acts as a pillar of safety and trust amidst the numerous changes they experience. Mathelin (year) underscores the significance of the manner in which newborns are touched, the responsiveness to their gaze, and the essential act of addressing them as fellow humans with emotions, thoughts, and desires. Engaging fully with newborns during such vulnerable moments reflects a compassionate approach and serves as a crucial neonatal health intervention that supports their development. The act of holding and handling each baby not only provides biological care but also offers emotional sustenance. The professional's inner availability becomes apparent through their displays of affection, attentive gaze, gestures, and all other elements involved in the caregiving relationship.
In addition to physical contact with the newborn (NB), professionals also engage in verbal communication by narrating the ongoing events. These verbal interactions provide the NB with a sense of understanding and context to their experiences. Initiating introductions, outlining the care procedures to be undertaken, and clarifying the surroundings and the absence of their parents help the NB establish a connection with their personal background. Through verbal communication, professionals offer the NB a comprehension of their circumstances during illness and separation from their immediate family members.
Maternal death poses a significant risk to infants. According to Cyrulnik (10), this situation can have detrimental effects on the well-being of babies.
An early loss in the lives of young children can have catastrophic consequences when there is no emotional substitute available. The disappearance of an attachment figure results in a significant loss in their sensory world. The baby's biological environment permanently loses crucial auditory, tactile, olfactory, and visual stimuli due to the absence of the other individual.
Words must once again spring into action, introducing the presence of another family caregiver alongside the narrative. The aim is to ensure that the baby is not left alone, but rather surrounded by the familiar cultural context of the family.
The number of professionals responsible for caring for the newborn should be minimized to ensure consistency and quality of care. It is crucial to provide support to the family, particularly facilitating interaction between the healthcare team and the family member who will assume the newborn's care. Remaining by the newborn's side, maintaining eye contact, speaking gently, and offering physical support are essential for fostering a sense of integration during moments of extreme vulnerability. According to pediatrician and psychoanalyst Winnicott, these actions are vital for ensuring the newborn's well-being.
The entire team is collectively responsible for facilitating the presence of both the mother and father, whenever feasible, and providing them with the necessary support to convey a coherent framework of senses and meanings to the infant. This approach aims to emotionally stimulate the newborn and utilize language to contextualize their experiences.
In the absence of parents, it is imperative for the team to maintain communication. The use of cell phones within the neonatal unit, traditionally limited, can serve as a crucial tool during such critical moments, bridging the gap between the family and the infant. Nevertheless, the introduction of cell phones into the neonatal unit should be approached with caution, adhering strictly to the regulations of the facility. It has been suggested to encase the device in plastic film following thorough cleaning as a precautionary measure.
A routine of contact facilitated by the team could be established through recorded or written messages, which could also be suggested to siblings and other family members, including grandparents. Photos and/or video recordings, along with brief descriptions of the baby's behavior, characteristics, and daily routine, can be shared with the parents.
When parents are present, they should be encouraged to use their cell phones to capture images to share with their family. The team must provide instructions on how to clean the device and emphasize that their records should not include images of other babies, families, or team members.
Special interventions must be carefully planned in the event of a death within this context, further complicating an already challenging and sorrowful situation. All the structures put in place to aid in connection and the grieving process must now be adjusted, as the anguish of the separation between the family and the infant reaches unimaginable levels. How does one navigate the profound grief of losing a child when the bond was limited or virtually non-existent? How does one cope with this profound loss when the ability to physically see, touch, dress, or hold a vigil for the baby is not possible? These are the harsh realities faced by parents who have tragically lost their newborn children to this pandemic.
Mourning rituals have been halted, and physical contact for support is discouraged. Wakes are constrained, brief, and inadequate in duration. The inability to properly commemorate the death of a child is predicted to cause lasting emotional wounds in both parents and relatives. Cyrulnik emphasizes the consequences of unacknowledged losses, stating that without acceptance or acknowledgment, mourners may retreat to alleviate their pain, resulting in a profound sense of emptiness and a void within. This scenario often leads to significant psychological distress, potentially triggering depressive disorders, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and complicated grief, as outlined by Muza and colleagues.
It is the responsibility of neonatal unit professionals to support parents and relatives who have experienced the loss of their babies without having had the opportunity to know them. To address this sensitive situation, we propose several actions that can be tailored to each individual mother and father, taking into account their unique family values and wishes: offering photographs and videos of the newborn while alive; sharing messages from family members with the newborn; guiding parents on how to communicate the circumstances of the newborn's condition to other family members; and, following the baby's passing, encouraging parents to bring clothing or a small toy to be placed with the baby.
It is advisable for family members residing in the same household to come together and partake in a mourning ritual for the deceased individual. It is crucial to counsel them against hastily discarding the clothing and furniture intended for the departed, urging them to take the necessary time to emotionally prepare for this significant event.
The team can provide identification cards belonging to the baby and a report prepared by the professionals who cared for the newborn during their time in the neonatal unit, detailing any special circumstances. Additionally, it is crucial to offer family members the chance to meet with the team for discussion a few days following the infant's passing, providing necessary information and emotional support.
The neonatal unit staff is confronted with a significant emotional challenge, exacerbated by the strategies outlined in this editorial. Nevertheless, by empathizing with individuals and facilitating their encounter with expressions of love during such poignant moments in their lives, a sense of fulfillment and peace can be cultivated despite the constraints that are in place.
It is imperative to amplify the voices of the healthcare team and address their needs. Accustomed to following precise protocols, these professionals are now navigating uncharted territory. Constantly moving between various hospitals, they face the looming threats of infection and the possibility of transmitting the disease to their loved ones. This reality results in exhausting routines of patient care, stringent hygiene practices, and the meticulous donning and doffing of protective equipment, frequently extending beyond their scheduled shifts and encroaching on their personal time at home.
Team discussions and the support of the psychology and social service departments are crucial for staff members to feel confident in their decision-making regarding recent regulations. Engaging in dialogues with other professionals who comprehend and validate their intentions is imperative for fostering a sense of assurance and competence in their actions.
All these concerns manifest in the expressions and frequent pleas of healthcare professionals on social networks, exemplified by statements like, "We are here for you, please stay at home for us." The shared anxieties, fears, and exhaustion are palpable. We firmly believe that mutual support among professionals is pivotal. The impact of such solidarity is tangible when a colleague extends a helping hand to manage a tube or insert catheters, or when one rests their head on another's shoulder for a clearer view of a newborn.
In interacting with newborns, it is crucial to be mindful of their responses and provide comfort during handling. These experiences will leave lasting but fleeting memories for both the caregiver and the infant, creating a shared sense of connection and security. It is important to approach these interactions with sensitivity and attentiveness, as they can have a significant impact on the emotional well-being of the newborn. By acknowledging and responding to the cues and needs of the baby, caregivers can foster a sense of trust and safety in the relationship, laying a foundation for healthy development and attachment.
Furthermore, it is essential to prioritize self-care and attend to your physical well-being. Consider incorporating exercises that are suitable for the neonatal unit setting. Engaging in moments of silent or guided meditation can enhance breathing awareness and mindfulness. Additionally, the repetition of mantras or prayers aligned with your personal beliefs has been shown to effectively promote relaxation, improve concentration, and alleviate feelings of anxiety. These practices have demonstrated significant benefits in fostering a sense of calm and well-being amidst the challenges of the neonatal environment.
Upon returning home, it is recommended to maintain a routine that includes exercises, meditation, and focused breathing. Within the familiar setting of your home, allow yourself the freedom to engage in activities that bring you joy, such as preparing and enjoying your favorite meals, dressing in comfortable attire, dancing, and singing. Recognize that you embody the comfort and tranquility that these individuals require. Communicate with the newborn, who may not yet have the ability to verbalize their needs. Interpret their cues through the language of their body, which you are entrusted to care for. Extend a warm welcome to the parents during this sensitive period. Additionally, take the time to prioritize self-care during these challenging times, as you have the autonomy to navigate life's complexities in a manner that best serves you. We express our gratitude for your dedicated efforts, resilience, and the invaluable knowledge you impart to our newborns and their families.
