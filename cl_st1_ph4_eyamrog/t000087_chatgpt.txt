Objective: This study seeks to determine the incidence of COVID-19 among vaccinated and unvaccinated groups of adolescents while also detailing their respective symptoms.
Methods: In May 2021, a private indoor event attended by high school adolescents led to a superspreading incident. To investigate this occurrence, an anonymous questionnaire was distributed to all adolescents who had been present at the event, focusing on symptoms, prior COVID-19 history, vaccination status, and behavior during the gathering. Subsequently, two distinct groups were delineated based on vaccination status: one comprising vaccinated individuals and the other unvaccinated individuals. A sample from a fully vaccinated individual displaying symptoms was subjected to sequencing. The general characteristics of these groups were elucidated through the analysis of categorical and continuous data. The incidence of COVID-19 within each group was calculated by dividing the total number of positive cases by the total number of individuals, then multiplying the result by 100 to obtain a percentage.
Results: Out of the 164 adolescents who participated in the private indoor event, 41 individuals (incidence 25%, 95%CI 18.6-32.4) contracted COVID-19. A sample from a symptomatic, fully vaccinated individual who received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine) revealed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant of concern. The incidence of COVID-19 among the unvaccinated was 35.1% (95%CI 25.5-45.6), while among the vaccinated it was 11.4% (95%CI 5.1-21.3). Significantly more unvaccinated teenagers contracted COVID-19 compared to vaccinated ones (ùùå2=12.6, p=0.00), with a crude Odds Ratio of 4.19 (95%CI 1.79-9.8). Nearly all (40 out of 41) individuals experienced multiple COVID-19 symptoms, with an average of 6 symptoms reported by both vaccinated and unvaccinated cases. Common symptoms included fatigue, runny nose, anosmia, fever, cough, and ageusia. None of the adolescents with a history of prior COVID-19 infection were reinfected during the event (N=47). While at least two known positive individuals were present, all other attendees tested negative in a rapid antigen test conducted 24 hours before the event. Participants spent 2 or more hours in a poorly ventilated setting, without social distancing, with minimal mask usage (87.8%), and engaged in social activities with loud music. Fortunately, none of the COVID-19 positive adolescents or their close contacts who subsequently contracted the virus required hospitalization or succumbed to the disease.
Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that unvaccinated susceptible adolescents exhibit a greater prevalence of COVID-19 compared to their vaccinated counterparts. However, upon contracting the virus, both unvaccinated and vaccinated adolescents displayed similar symptoms, such as fatigue, runny nose, anosmia, fever, cough, and ageusia. Notably, adolescents who had recovered from prior COVID-19 infections did not experience reinfection. The absence of effective infection control measures led to a significant superspreading incident.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has infected over 200 million people and resulted in the deaths of more than 4 million individuals globally by August 2021 (Harvey et al., 2021). Since the onset of the ongoing pandemic, numerous candidate vaccines have been developed, with several proving highly effective and subsequently authorized for emergency use within a year of the initial report of coronavirus disease 2019 (Polack et al., 2020). According to the World Health Organization, vaccination stands as the second most effective public health strategy for mitigating and controlling infectious diseases, following access to clean water (World Health Organization, no date). In December 2020, countries initiated an extensive vaccination campaign aimed at safeguarding the most vulnerable populations, particularly the elderly and individuals with heightened exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus due to their high-risk occupations, including healthcare and frontline workers (Russell and Greenwood, 2021).
Previous research has indicated that adolescents exhibit a lower susceptibility to severe manifestations of COVID-19, including reduced rates of hospitalization and mortality in comparison to adults (CDC, 2021; Stein, 2021). Furthermore, certain studies have highlighted that COVID-19 positive adolescents commonly experience mild respiratory symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, or may even remain asymptomatic (Castagnoli et al., 2020). A small fraction, less than 1%, may progress to develop multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) (Hoste, Van Paemel, & Haerynck, 2021), while approximately 5.1% may experience the onset of Long COVID (Mellis, 2021).
The BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine became the inaugural vaccine to receive emergency use authorization for individuals aged over 16 on December 11, 2020 (Office of the Commissioner, 2021). Subsequently, on March 31, 2021, it emerged as the primary vaccine to unveil phase 3 trial results for adolescents aged 12-15, demonstrating favorable tolerability, safety, immunogenicity, and a remarkable 100% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 (Frenck et al., 2021). Nevertheless, there remains a dearth of information regarding the dynamics of COVID-19 in adolescents, encompassing both vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, particularly in settings that deviate from the controlled conditions of a clinical trial.
In April 2021, the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant was first identified in India and subsequently classified as a variant of concern (VOC) on May 11 due to its rapid spread and potential for immune evasion (Singh et al., 2021). This highly transmissible Delta variant of concern has led to an increase in breakthrough infections across various countries and populations (Baral et al., 2021; Lopez Bernal et al., 2021). Among fully vaccinated healthcare workers, the majority of breakthrough infections have been documented as mild or asymptomatic (Linsenmeyer et al., 2021). However, there remains a notable dearth of information regarding the dynamics of COVID-19 in both vaccinated and unvaccinated adolescents up to the present time.
The objective of this research is to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 among vaccinated and unvaccinated groups of adolescents, as well as to outline the symptoms experienced by each group.
In May 2021, a private event catering to high school adolescents aged between 15 and 19 years was held in Mexico City. The event took place in an enclosed room devoid of proper ventilation. Attendance required a mandatory rapid antigen test with confirmed negative results for COVID-19, conducted 24 hours prior to the event. Notably, all vaccinated adolescents had received their vaccinations in the United States, as vaccines were not yet available for adolescents in Mexico at that time. Following the event, multiple cases of COVID-19 were reported, prompting all attendees to undergo a COVID-19 test within a week of the gathering. Subsequently, one of the samples obtained from a symptomatic individual who had been fully vaccinated was sequenced to identify the specific genetic variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
A questionnaire was distributed to all 199 high school adolescents invited to the private event, with 164 attendees ultimately included in the study. Informed consent was obtained at the onset of the questionnaire, adhering to guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO, 2021) that required parental consent for participants under 18. Emphasizing the voluntary and anonymous nature of participation, we conducted an open virtual meeting with adolescents and their parents to outline the study's objectives and methods. The questionnaire comprised close-choice items and one open-ended question, gathering data on age, sex, prior COVID-19 infection, pre-event COVID-19 rapid antigen test results, post-event COVID-19 test outcomes, mask usage, event duration, vaccination status, post-event symptoms, and close contacts who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19.
The general characteristics of the entire studied population were delineated using categorical and continuous data, presented through frequency and percentage for categorical data and mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous data. Two distinct cohorts were established: the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. The vaccinated group comprised individuals who had received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine by the time of the event, while the unvaccinated group consisted of individuals who had not received any vaccine dose. Additionally, we provided details on the number of adolescents who were fully vaccinated, having received all recommended doses at least 14 days prior to the event, as well as the number of adolescents who were partially vaccinated.
The incidence of COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals was calculated by dividing the total number of COVID-19 positive cases in the vaccinated group (numerator) by the total number of vaccinated individuals (denominator), then multiplying the result by 100. Similarly, the incidence of COVID-19 in the unvaccinated group was determined by dividing the total number of COVID-19 positive cases in the unvaccinated group (numerator) by the total number of unvaccinated individuals (denominator), and multiplying by 100. Confidence intervals were established using the exact Clopper-Pearson method as outlined by Desu and Raghavarao (2003).
Following the event, positive and negative outcomes for each participant were ascertained using various commercial COVID-19 test kits at private laboratories, including PCR or rapid antigen tests. Notably, individuals who solely underwent rapid antigen testing, known for its lower sensitivity compared to PCR tests considered the gold standard, were categorized in the COVID-19 positive group if they exhibited over three symptoms, including anosmia, even in cases where the rapid antigen test yielded a false negative result and no PCR test was conducted (Pilarowski et al., 2021). The symptoms within each cohort were delineated using categorical data in terms of frequency and percentage, subsequently subjected to comparison using the ùùå2 test between the vaccinated and unvaccinated subgroups.
The RNA extracted from a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 fully vaccinated patient, with a Ct value of 22.53, was isolated using the TRIzol protocol (TRIzolTM Reagent, no date; Rio et al., 2010) and the RIDAGENE SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR MULTIPLEX kit (R-BIOPHARM AG). Subsequently, this RNA sample was utilized to construct an Illumina library following the Artic v3 protocol outlined in Pipelines R&D et al. (2020). The library containing SARS-CoV-2 amplicons was then prepared and sequenced at the "Unidad Universitaria de Secuenciaci√≥n Masiva y Bioinformatica - UNAM" using the Illumina NextSeq500 platform with a 300 cycle kit and a pair end configuration, resulting in reads with a length of 150 base pairs.
Approximately 3 million paired-end reads were acquired and processed utilizing the ncov2019-artic-nf pipeline (GitHub, 2021) with standard parameters. The resulting genome, presented in fasta format, underwent analysis on the Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner platform (√Ä. O‚ÄôToole, V. Hill, J.T. McCrone, E. Scher, A. Rambaut, 2021) to determine the lineage of the virus that was sequenced.
All 199 individuals invited to the event completed the questionnaire. Among them, 35 were excluded from the study; six due to lack of parental authorization and 29 for non-attendance at the event.
The study population, as depicted in Figure 1, comprised 164 adolescents with a mean age of 16.8 years (SD 1.07), ranging from 15 to 19 years, with 53.7% being male and 46.3% female. Among them, 28.7% (N=47) had previously contracted COVID-19 and fully recovered before the event, with none of these individuals testing positive during the gathering. Of the attendees, 43% (n=70) were vaccinated, while 57% (n=94) were unvaccinated. A significant 98.8% underwent an antigen test 24 hours prior to the event, with the remaining 2 individuals testing negative post-event. The overall incidence of COVID-19 within the studied population was 25% (95%CI 18.6 to 32.4) (N=41), with 2 positive cases identified in the pre-event antigen tests. One positive case was vaccinated and predominantly wore a face mask during the event, while the other, unvaccinated individual removed their mask for most of the gathering. The vast majority (98.4%) had negative antigen test results before the event. Notably, 87.8% only wore masks upon entry or did not use them at all, with 86.4% staying for 2 or more hours and 82.9% predominantly indoors. The presence of high-volume music in the poorly ventilated indoor setting potentially heightened the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as elevated vocal efforts could lead to increased aerosol emissions (Kopechek, 2020).
Following the event, 90.3% (148 individuals) underwent COVID-19 testing, with 33.6% opting for a PCR test and 56.7% choosing a rapid antigen test. Among the participants, 41 individuals tested positive for COVID-19, with 35 receiving a positive test result and 6 either testing negative or not undergoing testing but reporting symptoms such as anosmia.
Among the 41 adolescents diagnosed with COVID-19, a significant majority, 75.6%, reported that no secondary infections occurred around them. Additionally, 19.6% acknowledged infecting 1 or 2 more individuals. Regarding their contact history, 73.2% stated they had no contact with other persons, while 7.3% had contact with 3 to 4 individuals, and another 7.3% had contact with 5 to 6 persons. Notably, none of the adolescents or their close contacts required hospitalization or succumbed to the virus.
Out of the total participants, 70 individuals (42.7%) had received at least one dose of the vaccine, with 50 being fully vaccinated and 20 partially vaccinated. Additionally, 19 individuals (27.1%) had previously contracted COVID-19 and fully recovered before the event, with no cases of reinfection reported. A significant majority, 92.9%, did not utilize face masks during the event. Following the gathering, 8 out of the 70 vaccinated adolescents (11.4%) tested positive for COVID-19, with 7 of them (14%) being fully vaccinated and 1 (5%) partially vaccinated. Notably, only one fully vaccinated individual remained asymptomatic. The prevalent symptoms among those infected included runny nose, anosmia, fatigue, general discomfort, cough, ageusia, and low-grade fever.
Out of the total participants, 94 individuals (57.3%) were identified as unvaccinated. Among them, 28 individuals (29.8%) had previously contracted COVID-19 within the year leading up to the event, fully recovered prior to attending, and did not experience reinfection as a result of the gathering. A significant majority, 83.7%, reported not using face masks during the event. Following the gathering, 33 unvaccinated adolescents (35.1%) tested positive for COVID-19, with no instances of asymptomatic cases within this group. The prevalent symptoms observed among the infected individuals included fatigue, anosmia, general discomfort, runny nose, cough, low fever, and ageusia.
Table 1 illustrates the incidence rates of COVID-19 among unvaccinated individuals at 35.1% (95%CI 25.5 to 45.6) and vaccinated individuals at 11.4% (95%CI 5.1 to 21.3). A statistically significant disparity was observed in the occurrence of COVID-19 between the unvaccinated and vaccinated groups (ùùå2= 12.6, p=0.00). The Odds Ratio for unvaccinated versus vaccinated individuals stood at 4.19 (95%CI 1.79-9.8).
In Figure 2, we present the symptoms reported by both vaccinated and unvaccinated adolescents. The mean number of symptoms was 6 in both cohorts. Vaccinated adolescents reported a runny nose more frequently (87.5% vs 48.5%, p=0.046), while unvaccinated adolescents reported fatigue more frequently (90.9% vs 62.5%, p=0.04). Other reported symptoms, such as anosmia, were present in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (75.0% and 72.7%, respectively).
A symptomatic fully vaccinated individual's sample was sequenced by utilizing the extracted RNA material from the positive qPCR test, following the procedures outlined in our Methods section. The analysis revealed a genome with a coverage of 99.48%, identified as the Delta variant of concern (B.1.617.2) lineage based on the Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner website. The sequence was subsequently submitted to GISAID with the Submission Number: EPI_ISL_3982391.
This study reveals a significant difference in COVID-19 incidence between the unvaccinated and vaccinated adolescent cohorts during the superspreading event under investigation. The unvaccinated cohort exhibited a higher incidence rate of 35.1% (95%CI 26.1 to 46.5) compared to the vaccinated cohort with an incidence rate of 11.4% (95%CI 5.1 to 21.3), resulting in a crude odds ratio of 4.19 (95%CI 1.79-9.8). Notably, almost all COVID-19 positive adolescents (40 out of 41) experienced multiple symptoms, with only one fully vaccinated individual being asymptomatic. Despite the protective effect of vaccines against COVID-19 acquisition, the symptomatology post-infection was similar across both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, encompassing fatigue, runny nose, anosmia, general discomfort, ageusia, fever, and cough. Fatigue was more prevalent among unvaccinated adolescents, while runny nose was more common in vaccinated adolescents.
In the anonymous questionnaire, 47 attendees (28.6%) disclosed a previous COVID-19 infection within the past year, having fully recovered before the event. Among these individuals, 28 were unvaccinated, while 19 had received at least one vaccine dose. Notably, no reinfections were documented following the event, with all 47 previously infected adolescents testing negative and remaining asymptomatic post-event. These findings align with existing research indicating a reduced risk of reinfection in individuals under 65 years of age (Hansen et al., 2021) and preliminary evidence suggesting that natural immunity may offer superior protection against the Delta variant compared to vaccine-induced immunity (Gazit et al., 2021). While the study does not definitively attribute the superspreading event to the Delta variant due to limited sequencing, it does highlight a heightened infection risk among unvaccinated or vaccinated adolescents compared to those with prior natural immunity.
A breakthrough infection is characterized by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a PCR test or a positive rapid antigen test from a respiratory sample taken from an individual at least 14 days after receiving all recommended doses of a COVID-19 vaccine (Bergwerk et al., 2021). Within our vaccinated cohort of 70 individuals, 20 were partially vaccinated, with one (5%) experiencing COVID-19, while 50 were fully vaccinated, with seven (14%) encountering breakthrough infections. Typically, most countries only track breakthrough infections if a fully vaccinated individual requires hospitalization or succumbs to the virus. A study conducted in Israel revealed that healthcare workers with breakthrough infections constituted 2.6% of fully vaccinated individuals, with 19% of COVID-19 cases exhibiting persistent symptoms (COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases: Data from the states, 2021). As of now, there is a lack of data regarding mild breakthrough infections in adolescents.
In this study, 24.4% of participants reported secondary infections among close contacts. None of the adolescents or their positive close contacts experienced severe cases, required hospitalization, or succumbed to COVID-19. These findings align with existing research indicating the high efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing hospitalization and mortality (Mlcochova et al., 2021; Sheikh et al., 2021). Vaccinated adolescents may exhibit mild to moderate symptoms upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet they generally face a lower risk of severe illness or fatality from COVID-19 compared to older age groups.
Understanding the context of the event may elucidate why a quarter of the attendees tested positive. Out of the 164 attendees, 86.4% were present for 2 or more hours, with 82.9% predominantly in an enclosed, non-ventilated space, and 87.8% failing to utilize face masks or adhere to social distancing guidelines. Continuous high-volume music in the indoor non-ventilated area heightened the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to increased vocalization leading to elevated aerosol emissions (Kopechek, 2020; Bergwerk et al., 2021). Among the 41 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19, 90.3% had spent over 2 hours at the event, remained in the enclosed environment throughout, and none had worn face masks. The sole precaution taken by the adolescents was a rapid antigen test 24 hours prior to the event, where two positive cases still attended. One of these individuals, who was vaccinated, consistently wore a face mask, while the other, unvaccinated individual did not. This event exemplifies a lack of awareness, inadequate risk assessment, and reluctance to implement multiple protective measures. The analysis underscores the insufficiency of relying solely on a single measure, such as the 24-hour antigen test, to mitigate infection risks. As per the Swiss Cheese Model by James Reason (Perneger, 2005; Azuma et al., 2020), recognizing the absence of a foolproof mitigation strategy necessitates the implementation of multiple layers of protection to minimize transmission risks. In this instance, the absence of various mitigation strategies like admitting only negative individuals, ensuring proper ventilation, enforcing universal mask-wearing, reducing music volume, and maintaining social distancing led to the occurrence of this superspreading event.
A nasopharyngeal sample from a symptomatic fully vaccinated individual was sequenced, revealing the presence of the Delta variant of concern (VOC), which, at the time, constituted only 2.12% of the samples screened according to the National Genomic Program's June report by the Consorcio de Vigilancia Gen√≥mica in Mexico. While it cannot be definitively concluded that this superspreading event was solely caused by this VOC, as at least two positive individuals attended the event, the detection of Delta is significant as it sheds light on the variant's ability to infect adolescents, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, particularly in the absence of adequate mitigation measures. This study also provides insights into how Delta can lead to breakthrough infections, even in the presence of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine), which was reported to be 100% effective in their phase 3 study involving adolescents, amidst the circulation of other variants. Notably, Delta variant infections have been predominant in vaccine-breakthrough cases in countries like India and the United Kingdom, likely due to a combination of evading neutralizing antibodies and increased virus infectivity.
The study's strengths lie in its high participation rate, with nearly all participants being tested for COVID-19 both before and after the event, and the consistent conditions under which the private event took place for the majority of attendees. However, the study's limitations include the inability to sequence all COVID-19 positive adolescents to confirm the presence of the Delta variant and the fact that not all vaccinated individuals were fully vaccinated. Future research should focus on determining the incidence of COVID-19 in adolescents among larger samples of fully vaccinated individuals to ascertain whether the observed incidence aligns with that in this smaller population and to compare the symptoms between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.
Spreading events have become increasingly prevalent as vaccinated individuals interact with others in social gatherings, often with a significant reduction in safety precautions. It is noteworthy that two positive cases involved adolescents who chose to attend the event despite their health status. Such irresponsible actions not only endanger themselves but also put others at risk of contracting a variant of concern, particularly in areas with high community spread. The findings of this research highlight the need for a comprehensive mitigation strategy, underscoring the critical importance of emphasizing the layering of protective measures to minimize the likelihood of transmission and infection during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
