Abstract
In December 2019, a new human coronavirus, called 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV-2) 
or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health 
Organization, emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. Spreading 
globally, it is now considered pandemic, with approximately 
3 million cases worldwide at the end of April. Its symptoms 
include fever, cough, and headache, but the main one is 
shortness of breath. In turn, it is believed that there is a 
relationship between COVID-19 and damage to the heart 
muscle, and hypertensive and diabetic patients, for example, 
seem to have worse prognosis. Therefore, COVID-19 may 
worsen in individuals with underlying adverse conditions, 
and a not negligible number of patients hospitalized with 
this virus had cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. 
Systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders 
during disease progression may be behind this association. 
In addition, the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE) receptors, more precisely ACE2, to penetrate the cell; 
therefore, the use of ACE inhibitor drugs and angiotensin 
receptor blockers could cause an increase in these receptors, 
thus facilitating the entry of the virus into the cell. There is, 
however, no scientific evidence to support the interruption of 
these drugs. Since they are fundamental for certain chronic 
diseases, the risk and benefit of their withdrawal in this 
scenario should be carefully weighed. Finally, cardiologists and 
health professionals should be aware of the risks of infection 
and protect themselves as much as possible, sleeping properly 
and avoiding long working hours.
Introduction
In December 2019, in the city of Wuhan, China, there 
was an explosion of cases of pneumonia caused by a novel 
coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),1 identified as the agent 
that causes the disease called coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), which is the name officially adopted by the 
World Health Organization. COVID-19 is a condition that 
can affect the lungs, respiratory tract, and others systems. 
Phylogenetic data imply a zoonotic origin,2 and it has been 
shown that the transmission of the virus occurs from person 
to person. It has been detected in sputum, saliva, throat and 
nasopharyngeal swabs.3 Therefore, it can spread through 
small droplets released from the nose and mouth of infected 
individuals. Some of the most observed symptoms are 
fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum 
production, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, and 
prolonged prothrombin time.4 However, one of the main 
symptoms may be shortness of breath.
Although evidence on the specific effects of COVID-19 on 
the cardiovascular system is still little-known, there are reports 
of arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, tachycardia, and a high 
burden of concomitant cardiovascular disease in infected 
individuals, particularly in those with higher comorbidities 
and risk factors who require more intensive care.5
Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 can be made by electron 
microscopy morphology, but the method currently considered 
the gold standard is detection of nucleic acid in nasal swab, 
throat samples, or other respiratory tract samples by real time 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is later confirmed by 
next generation sequencing.6
Finally, it should be noted that the best treatment is still 
prevention, and simple measures such as washing hands 
with soap, using alcohol gel, and disinfecting surfaces such 
as cell phones play an essential role in reducing the spread 
of the virus.
Epidemiology
Adults and the Elderly
More recent data indicate that by April 23 the number 
of confirmed cases of COVID-19 exceeded 2,700,000 
worldwide.7 On January 30, 2020, 9,976 cases of COVID-19 
had been reported in at least 21 countries.8 One month 
later, 83,652 cases were confirmed, with 2,791 deaths 
(3.4% mortality).9 Cases were reported in 24 countries on 5 
continents.10 In Brazil, specifically, by March 3, 488 suspected 
cases had been registered, in 23 states.11 In addition, as of 
April 23, approximately 49,500 cases and 3,313 deaths 
had been confirmed by COVID-19 in Brazil.12 In Italy, on 
February 20, a young man in the Lombardy Region was 
hospitalized with an atypical pneumonia that later proved 
to be COVID-19. In the following 24 hours, there were 
36 more cases, none of which had been in contact with 
the first patient or anyone known to have COVID-19.13 
Unfortunately, despite aggressive containment efforts, the 
disease continues to spread and the number of affected 
patients is increasing. The fatality rate is not low, and it is 
dominated by elderly patients.12 Therefore, special attention 
should also be given to this population.

COVID-19 and Cardiovascular Diesease
Arq Bras Cardiol. 2020; [online].ahead print, PP.0-0
By April 23, the world had already registered 2,707,356 
cases of COVID-19, including 83,880 cases in China. Of 
the 190,743 deaths from the disease as of April 23, 4,636 
occurred in China. Europe had registered 1,193,276 cases, 
with 114,259 deaths,7 making it the region with the largest 
24-hour increase in new infections. Several regions have also 
registered their first cases, including Somalia, Benin, Liberia, 
and the Bahamas.14
There are uncertainties about the estimates of the true 
number of infected people, which is crucial to determine the 
severity of infection and the incidence of mild or asymptomatic 
cases, as well as their possible transmission.15
Children
Epidemiological factors of COVID-19 among children are 
scarce. Dong et al.16 through a retrospective analysis of children 
with a mean age of 7 years included in the Chinese Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention from January 16 to February 
8, 2020, found that there were 731 confirmed cases in the 
laboratory and 1,412 suspected cases. Importantly, more than 
90% of these individuals were asymptomatic or had only mild 
or moderate symptoms. These data draw attention to the fact 
that not only adults and the elderly, but also children of any 
age are susceptible to COVID-19. Therefore, attention and care 
should be directed to the entire population, without distinction.
COVID-19 and the Cardiovascular System 
Respiratory infections and influenza can play an important 
role in the short-term increase of risk of myocardial infarction 
and ischemic stroke.17 SARS-CoV-2 has a pathogenicity that 
can increase damage to the myocardium caused by this viral 
infection. The data suggest that acute cardiac injury, shock, 
and arrhythmia were present in 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7% of 
patients, respectively, and their prevalence was higher among 
patients requiring intensive care.10 Based on the fact that the 
virus can cause damage to the cardiovascular system, careful 
attention should be given to cardiovascular protection during 
treatment of COVID-19.18 In fact, cardiovascular disease and 
hypertension have been associated with an increased case 
fatality rate of COVID-19 in China.19
Myocardial injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 was reported 
in 5 of the first 41 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in 
Wuhan, who had high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels > 28 
pg/ml.20 In another study, conducted in 2019, Panhwar et al.21 
observed that concomitant infection by influenza increased 
risks in hospitalized patients with heart failure. In a survey of 
25 patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-1 infection, 
almost half of them had changes in the cardiovascular system, 
and 60% had glucose metabolism disorders.22 Another study 
included 1,099 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 173 of 
whom had severe disease, with comorbidities of hypertension 
(23.7%), diabetes mellitus (16.2%), coronary diseases (5.8%), 
and cerebrovascular disease (2.3%).23
When evaluating data from 138 patients hospitalized 
for COVID-19 in China, the median time between the first 
symptom and dyspnea was 5 days, and 7 days between the 
first symptom and hospital admission. Computed tomography 
of the chest showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass 
opacity in the lungs of all patients. Approximately 90% of 
patients received antiviral therapy with oseltamivir, and more 
than 60% received antibacterial therapy with moxifloxacin. 
Thirty-six patients were transferred to the intensive care unit 
due to complications, including acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (61.1%), arrhythmia (44.4%), and shock (30.6%). 
Patients who required intensive care were older and more 
likely to have underlying comorbidities, as well as dyspnea. 
On February 3, 34% were discharged and 6 died, representing 
an overall mortality of 4.3%.10
In COVID-19 patients, the incidence of cardiovascular 
symptoms is high, due to systemic inflammatory response and 
immune system disorders during disease progression. Patients 
with underlying cardiovascular disease who are infected by 
COVID-19 may then have worse prognosis. Special attention 
should, therefore, be given to cardiovascular protection during 
treatment for COVID-19.
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Receptors and Angiotensin 
Receptor Blockers 
COVID-19 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
receptors, more precisely ACE2, to penetrate the cell. It has 
thus been hypothesized that the use of ACE inhibitors and 
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) could increase these 
receptors, facilitating the penetration of the virus.24 
In a note, the Brazilian Society of Cardiology recently 
emphasized data on the importance of the use of drugs 
such as ACE inhibitors and ARB, as there is no clear 
evidence to support the association between therapy with 
these drugs and worsening prognosis of the disease.25 It is 
thus recommended that physicians carefully evaluate the 
risk‑benefit balance before suspending drugs, given that they 
are fundamental pillars for management of chronic diseases, 
such as hypertension and heart failure. Likewise, patients 
should not interrupt their use indiscriminately without first 
consulting their physicians.
Final considerations
Coronavirus is a family of viruses that cause respiratory 
infections. COVID-19 is a serious disease, which requires 
special care. Individuals who present fever, cough, and 
shortness of breath should seek medical service. Contrary to 
what many may believe, COVID-19 is not a disease restricted 
to older adults; young people and children can also become 
infected. However, older patients who have cardiovascular 
disease and are infected with COVID-19 may have worse 
prognosis. Frequent hand washing, use of alcohol gel, covering 
the nose with the inside of the arm, and avoiding crowded 
environments can play an important role in reducing the 
spread of the virus and aggravation of the disease, especially 
in patients with cardiovascular disease.
