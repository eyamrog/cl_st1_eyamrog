The concept of a "pan-epidemic Anthropocene" was introduced by Lucey et al. to describe widespread infectious disease outbreaks influenced by human activities that have significantly altered the Earth System. For instance, smallpox, which had been confined to the Old World for millennia, exemplified the first instance of such a phenomenon when European explorers introduced it to the Americas during the 16th century.
The arrival of Europeans in America marked a significant moment in history, representing the first globalization event where two civilizations encountered each other after 12,000 years of separation, albeit on unequal terms. Smallpox, which emerged in January 1519, quickly spread to the mainland of Central America, devastating Native American populations who had no immunity to the diseases introduced by the Europeans. Subsequently, diseases such as influenza, measles, typhus, pneumonia, scarlet fever, malaria, and yellow fever emerged, affecting millions of individuals. Shockingly, an estimated 90% of the Native American population, ranging from 50 to 80 million, succumbed to these illnesses, indicating a staggering loss of approximately 10% of the global population between 1493 and 1650. This tragic event not only resulted in a significant loss of life but also set in motion the globalization and homogenization of the world's species and diseases.
In the 20th century, epidemics and pandemics persisted in claiming the lives of millions. The inaugural pandemic of the 21st century emerged as influenza A (H1N1) in 2009-2010, leading to an estimated 100,000-400,000 fatalities within the initial year. Notably, this marked the first instance where a vaccine was successfully formulated, manufactured, and disseminated globally within the same year.
Globalization, the exchange of species, materials, energy, and culture, along with urbanization and the growth of the global population, have had a significant and likely irreversible impact on the environment and the Earth System's equilibrium, prompting the proposal of a new geological Epoch known as the Anthropocene. Coined by Crutzen and Stoermer in 2000, the term "Anthropocene" underscores humanity's central role in geological and ecological processes. The escalating influence of human activities on the environment has been profound, widespread, and enduring. There is a growing consensus regarding the formal recognition of the Anthropocene as a distinct geological Epoch, separate from the Holocene. Notable Earth System trends, such as the introduction of new anthropogenic materials like plastics and concrete, alterations in sedimentary processes, nuclear weapons testing residues, rising atmospheric methane and CO2 levels, shifts in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles, as well as climate and biodiversity changes, all point to the unmistakable impact of human activities. The socioeconomic landscape of this new epoch, often referred to as the "Human Epoch," is characterized by globalization, urbanization, increased economic activities, transportation networks, and the movement of people, species, and manufactured goods.
Various factors, including political destabilization, civil and international conflicts, have contributed to a rise in poverty, increased rates of maternal and child mortality, and the spread of diseases. Hotez (7) highlighted that these shifts have facilitated the emergence of devastating neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), with notable instances including the outbreak of dengue fever in the 1980s in the Americas, chikungunya and Zika virus infections in Latin America and the Caribbean, and malaria in the Amazonian region of South America. NTDs, alongside infections like leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection, measles, and polio, have also proliferated in the Middle East and North Africa. The Western African Ebola virus epidemic during 2014â€“2015 resulted in significant loss of life, devastated families, and caused socioeconomic disruptions in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
The COVID-19 outbreak serves as compelling evidence of the transformative impact of urbanization and globalization on community living, with advancements in transportation and communication facilitating the swift dissemination of diseases via various modes such as buses, trains, boats, and flights, both domestically and internationally. The heightened population density in residential areas, public transport, workplaces, shopping hubs, and diverse social gatherings like cultural, political, sports, and religious events has significantly elevated the risk of virus transmission within metropolitan areas. Social disparities further exacerbate these risks, particularly in middle- and low-income nations where weaker healthcare systems and limited capacities to manage sudden spikes in cases prevail. Poverty not only fuels the spread of epidemics and pandemics but also perpetuates its cycle by reinforcing long-standing detrimental impacts.
In the absence of specific drugs or vaccines, the containment of the rapid spread of COVID-19 hinges on community mitigation strategies. There is a growing consensus that social isolation, aimed at curbing the transmission of the virus, is not only ethically sound but also economically prudent. It is evident that the breakdown of healthcare systems and the staggering loss of lives would have devastating financial repercussions on nations and societies. Therefore, prioritizing the preservation of human life must be the foremost concern for governments.
The global impact of the pandemic, influenced by factors such as urbanization, transport, and the exchange of people, live species, and goods, is significantly shaped by the decisions made by individual governments. While some governments responded promptly and aligned with the World Health Organization's recommendations, others initially lagged but eventually acknowledged their missteps. Regrettably, there are still instances where governments are disregarding WHO's guidelines on avoiding large gatherings. A recent study by Croda et al. highlighted Brazil's response to COVID-19, drawing on past experiences with health emergencies to showcase the country's scientific capabilities. The authors also examined the initial measures taken to curb the virus's spread and mortality rates. Despite commendable efforts by state governors and city mayors, the actions of Brazil's President have contributed to heightened uncertainty among the populace regarding the health and economic ramifications of the pandemic. In times of uncertainty, effective leadership is crucial in navigating crises, requiring leaders to make informed decisions grounded in science and to construct a cohesive narrative that clarifies issues and unites the population in managing the situation. Addressing global challenges necessitates a collective effort and a commitment from everyone involved.
The pandemic, despite its negative impacts, has also presented new opportunities and showcased instances of solidarity within local communities. It has facilitated the sharing of resources, information, and expertise from countries that are more advanced in their pandemic response or have achieved better results in controlling the spread. Globally, scientific communities have come together, with numerous universities forming groups of researchers and students to contribute to pandemic relief efforts in various capacities.
The pandemic serves as a stark reminder that a fundamental shift in mindset, commitments, and values is imperative for future preparedness. This necessitates a transformative alteration in our current lifestyle and a concerted effort to establish conditions enabling humanity to effectively navigate the Anthropocene era, also known as the "Age of Humans." Renowned British economist Kate Raworth, affiliated with Oxford University, aptly asserts that the primary challenge of the 21st century is to fulfill the needs of all while operating within the constraints of the planet. Raworth's innovative framework, termed "Doughnut Economics," has recently been embraced to steer Amsterdam through the economic aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis. To address inequalities, climate change, and humanity's impact on Earth's delicate balance, essential measures such as environmental restoration, adoption of renewable energy sources, increased investments in scientific research, public health, and education are imperative. Failure to undertake these actions will leave humanity ill-equipped to confront the formidable challenges posed by future pandemics. Through the application of advanced technology and scientific advancements, humans possess the unique opportunity to safeguard not only their own existence but also the survival of all species within the Earth System.
Preparedness is essential for mitigating the health, economic, and social repercussions of future epidemics, as well as for preventing the transmission of other diseases. Pandemics are not random occurrences but rather stem from human interactions with the environment, and can be averted or minimized through scientific advancements and investments in health, education, and transportation, as well as by enhancing living conditions.
This presents a unique opportunity for the global community to leverage the spirit of cooperation, embrace diversity, and reach a crucial common global agreement to collectively govern the future of Earth.
