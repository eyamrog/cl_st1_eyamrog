The rehabilitation of edentulous Indigenous individuals residing in remote villages with dental prostheses has posed a significant challenge for healthcare institutions responsible for Indigenous health due to the logistical difficulties associated with transporting these individuals to urban centers. This retrospective observational study focused on nineteen edentulous Indigenous individuals who underwent rehabilitation using the simplified technique known as "Prosthesis in one day." Prior to prosthesis placement (t0), patients underwent clinical examinations and interviews, including the application of the OHIP-14 questionnaire. Adjustments to the prostheses were made as needed. A follow-up assessment was conducted after one year (t1), which included interviews, quality of life questionnaires, and evaluations of quality, comfort, and chewing ability in relation to the prostheses. The results indicated a significant decrease in the oral health impact on patients' quality of life across all OHIP-14 domains (median t0 = 33.0; median t1 = 0.0; effect size = 4.69). Overall, patients reported high satisfaction with both upper and lower dentures after one year of use, with a noticeable improvement in chewing ability. The "Prosthesis in 1 day" technique emerged as a viable and effective alternative for enhancing the quality of life of Indigenous villagers through successful dental rehabilitation.
Indigenous Brazilians comprise diverse peoples who have inhabited the region prior to Portuguese colonization. Historical estimates suggest that indigenous populations numbered approximately five million individuals, yet these figures have significantly declined over time due to diseases introduced by Europeans and conflicts with colonizers. The most recent census conducted by IBGE in 2010 revealed a population of 896,900 indigenous individuals in Brazil, representing 305 distinct ethnic groups and speaking 274 languages.
The Brazilian Federal Constitution, along with the Organic Health Laws (Law No. 8,080/1990 and Law No. 9,836/1999), acknowledges the unique ethnic and cultural characteristics of indigenous peoples. Addressing the health needs of the indigenous population necessitates a tailored and targeted service model focused on safeguarding, promoting, and restoring health, as outlined in the National Policy for the Health Care of Indigenous Peoples and the Guidelines of the Indigenous Component of the National Oral Health Policy. These policies aim to ensure comprehensive care aligned with the principles and directives of the National Health Service (SUS), while respecting the social, cultural, geographical, historical, and political diversity of indigenous communities. Moreover, they underscore the value of traditional medicine in addressing the specific vulnerabilities that contribute to health challenges within this population.
There is a notable prevalence of edentulism as a significant public health issue in Brazil, particularly among older individuals and residents in the northern and northeastern regions of the country. This issue is further exacerbated among the indigenous population, where the prevalence of edentulism surpasses that of the general population.
It is advised that edentulism be addressed in Primary Care; however, this treatment is frequently conducted in specialized care settings. The common approach involves the placement of removable complete dentures, a process that encompasses five sessions comprising both clinical and laboratory procedures. The Ministry of Health endorses these techniques for complete denture fabrication, as outlined in the manual "Oral Health in the National Health Service." These procedures are recommended to be conducted in Basic Health Units or Specialist Dental Centers, depending on the regional organization of the municipality.
The Pataxó indigenous people reside in the southernmost region of Bahia, inhabiting 36 villages spread across six distinct indigenous territories: Águas Belas, Aldeia Velha, Barra Velha, Imbiriba, Coroa Vermelha, and Mata Medonha. These lands are situated within the municipal areas of Santa Cruz Cabrália, Porto Seguro, Itamaraju, and Prado. Aldeia Velha, situated in Arraial D'Ajuda within the Porto Seguro municipality, spans an area of 2010 hectares, with 80% covered by native forest and a mangrove expanse of around 10 km². According to data from the Indigenous Health Care Information System (SIASI), in 2010, there were a total of 11,436 individuals residing in 19 of these villages, with Aldeia Velha alone housing 928 inhabitants.
According to the 2016 annual management report, the movement of indigenous people to urban centers is hindered by structural and logistical challenges, rendering prosthetic rehabilitation procedures nearly non-existent for the indigenous population of the Special Indigenous Health District – Bahia (DSEI Bahia). This difficulty is exacerbated by the scarcity, and in some cases, the absence of specialized services near indigenous villages. Consequently, the demand for prosthetic services in the region far exceeds the available capacity, creating a significant gap in meeting the needs of the indigenous population in terms of prosthetic rehabilitation.
Assisting indigenous villagers with their denture needs poses a significant challenge due to the complexity of conventional denture-making techniques, which typically involve five clinical and laboratory sessions. Therefore, it is crucial to utilize simplified techniques for prosthetic rehabilitation in this population, as these methods have been proven effective. Randomized, controlled, and blind studies have demonstrated that simplified techniques can yield results comparable to traditional denture-making approaches in terms of patient satisfaction and denture quality. Not only does the simplified technique offer a lower cost and shorter clinical/laboratory period, but it also restores masticatory function to a level on par with the conventional protocol while enhancing oral health-related quality of life.
While previous studies have outlined techniques that can be condensed into three or four sessions, such approaches present challenges due to the necessity of relocating indigenous communities to urban areas. This requirement poses significant logistical and cultural hurdles that must be addressed in order to effectively implement these methods.
The Dentures in One Day Technique, proposed in this context, is founded on four fundamental pillars. The initial pillar involves the utilization of prefabricated, flexible dental arches equipped with adjustable teeth (patent PI0602107-7 B1). Through this innovative technology, artificial teeth are pre-assembled on a flexible support base crafted from acrylic elastomeric material, enabling three-dimensional movement. The elastomer's flexibility facilitates the adaptation of the base to the patient's anatomy, allowing for the simultaneous assembly of upper and lower teeth. Furthermore, the base material permits individual adjustments to the teeth's positioning, should the need arise for correcting aesthetic, phonetic, or occlusal issues. The bases of these prefabricated dental arches are constructed from temporary material, which is entirely removed during the acrylization process of the dentures, subsequently replaced by heat-activated acrylic resin (HAAR) derived from poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA).
The second pillar of this approach involves the implementation of a streamlined technique, which entails creating and fitting the components of the dentures on the very same day. In the morning, patients undergo procedures such as anatomical and functional impressions, intermaxillary registration, and the assembly and testing of the arches. Subsequently, during the afternoon, the laboratory processing stages are executed, encompassing tasks like muffle inclusion, acrylization of the thermally activated acrylic resin in the microwave, and the final steps of finishing and polishing. Consequently, by the conclusion of the day, patients are provided with fully completed conventional dentures.
The third pillar encompasses a mini laboratory equipped with the necessary tools for acrylic and finishing procedures, alongside the presence of a skilled dental technician experienced in resin work. To facilitate the creation of dentures within the same day, collaboration between the prosthetic technician and the dental surgeon is essential. This coordination ensures that procedures are synchronized, leading to expedited processing times.
The fourth pillar of the process entails the fabrication of the final product, where the prosthetic device provided to the patient is in the form of dentures made from heat-polymerized acrylic resin. This involves placing the dentures in a plastic muffle with a silicone barrier, pressing them in a hydraulic press, and subjecting them to a microwave polymerization cycle. Subsequently, the dentures undergo finishing and polishing to ensure a smooth and aesthetically pleasing appearance.
The Dentures in One Day campaign involved a partnership agreement signed between the Special Indigenous Health District - Bahia, the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health - Ministry of Health, Inova/UNICAMP, and the Faculdade São Leopoldo Mandic (São Leopoldo Mandic University) located in Campinas, São Paulo.
The current study aimed to evaluate the quality of life of rehabilitated indigenous individuals and their satisfaction levels regarding chewing ability and the quality of dentures provided during the inaugural "Dentures in One Day/Special Indigenous Health District - Bahia (DSEI-BA)" initiative in Aldeia Velha, Bahia.
The research has obtained approval from the Ethics Committee of the institution overseeing the study (Protocol 4.108.212; CAAE: 32615620.6.0000.5374;).
This observational epidemiological retrospective cohort study was conducted in Aldeia Velha, located in the municipal region of Arraial D'Ajuda, Bahia, spanning from October 1, 2018 (first stage) to November 29, 2019 (fourth stage).
In order to execute the Dentures in One Day/DSEI BAHIA campaign, a collaborative partnership was formed among the following institutions:
Bahia Special Indigenous Health District (DSEI BAHIA) is the federal agency tasked with overseeing Indigenous Health management in the state of Bahia.
The Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health (SESAI) under the Ministry of Health is the federal entity tasked with coordinating and implementing the National Policy for Indigenous Healthcare within the Unified Health System (SUS).
Inova/UNICAMP, the innovation agency affiliated with UNICAMP, is tasked with overseeing the intellectual property produced within the university and granting permission for the utilization of patents such as PI0602107-7 B1/UNICAMP.
Faculdade São Leopoldo Mandic in Campinas, São Paulo, played a crucial role in the production and distribution of eighty complimentary pairs of prefabricated dental arches for DSEI Bahia. Twenty of these pairs were utilized during the Aldeia Velha campaign. Additionally, the institution offered valuable technical and scientific guidance to support the successful execution of the project.
In accordance with the agreement, six dentists from the DSEI Bahia team underwent theoretical and practical training conducted by SLMandic professors in the creation of complete dentures utilizing the Dentures In One Day technique. This training, facilitated by a team of three professors, spanned 32 hours and encompassed comprehensive instruction in both the clinical and laboratory aspects of denture fabrication.
The inaugural "Dentures in One Day/DSEI Bahia" campaign was conducted over a five-day period, during which dentures were fabricated within a clinical setting established at the Cultural Center. Five pairs of dentists from DSEI Bahia operated using portable equipment and school tables to craft the dentures, while laboratory services were provided by two dental denture technicians working in an adjacent mini laboratory. Additionally, the team included three indigenous oral health assistants tasked with maintaining the environment and sterilizing the instruments.
In the collaborative production of dentures, a total of twenty complete dentures, either double or mono-maxillary, were crafted. This involved the utilization of twenty pairs of prefabricated dental arches alongside the creation of two partial dentures.
As part of the "Dentures in One Day/DSEI Bahia" campaign, all patients underwent four distinct phases.
The initial consultation, conducted approximately 45 days prior to the commencement of the campaign, was designed to identify indigenous individuals in need of dentures. During this phase, the village health team's dentist conducted anamnesis, clinical examinations, and selected the individuals requiring rehabilitation. A semi-structured interview was conducted to explore issues related to tooth loss and expectations regarding dentures. All patients completed a socio-clinical-demographic questionnaire and underwent an initial quality of life assessment by responding to the OHIP-14 instrument. This questionnaire, comprising 14 items, evaluates seven dimensions: functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability, and handicap. Each of the 14 questions was rated on a five-point scale, with responses determining the score for each question: Never = 0; Almost never = 1; Occasionally = 2; Almost always = 3; and Always = 4.
The aim of this initiative was to provide a dental dentures service. In collaboration, a team of dentists from DSEI Bahia, assisted by two prosthetic technicians and overseen by professors from Faculdade São Leopoldo Mandic, crafted dental dentures for the Pataxó community. Through this effort, twenty edentulous patients were successfully rehabilitated with complete dentures. The dentures distributed to the patients during the mission were constructed from pressed thermally activated acrylic resin.
This phase aimed to conduct preservation, basal, and occlusal adjustments, as well as evaluate the prosthetic services provided. Indigenous individuals who underwent prosthetic treatment participated in up to four Post-Installation Control and Adjustment sessions, ensuring their comfort with the dentures. These adjustments were carried out by the village dentist in collaboration with a professor from Faculdade São Leopoldo Mandic.
The study was conducted from November 25, 2019, to November 29, 2019, to evaluate the mucosa's integrity and the hygiene status of dentures. Necessary basal and occlusal adjustments were performed during the assessment. Participants completed a questionnaire concerning their satisfaction and chewing functionality with the dentures provided, followed by responses to the OHIP-14 instrument for further evaluation.
Data pertaining to satisfaction and masticatory ability were evaluated through a questionnaire and visual analog scale. The satisfaction analysis encompassed various aspects such as general satisfaction, masticatory ability, stability, aesthetics, phonetics, comfort, and ease of cleaning. Masticatory ability was gauged based on the patient's self-assessment of chewing various foods including bread, cheese, meat, apples, coconut, carrots, tomatoes, and lettuce. Additionally, a semi-structured interview was conducted to elucidate the level of patient contentment with the dentures and the perceived advantages (or lack thereof) derived from their utilization.
The data utilized in this study were derived from questionnaires and interviews conducted with indigenous patients from Aldeia Velha. This information was gathered as part of the Dentures in One Day/DSEI Bahia campaign.
The study sample comprised twenty-two patients from Aldeia Velha, selected according to specific criteria: both male and female participants, either fully or partially edentulous, possessing normal ridges, in good overall health, and demonstrating adequate neuromuscular coordination. Individuals already rehabilitated with partial dentures and those unable to progress to phase IV were excluded from the study.
Initially, the sample was subjected to a descriptive analysis involving the distribution of frequencies, measures of central tendency, and variability. Given that the data did not adhere to the assumptions required for parametric analysis, Wilcoxon's nonparametric tests were employed to assess the impact of oral health on quality of life across different stages (t0 and t1) and to compare patients' perceptions of upper and lower dentures. Furthermore, the evaluation of patients' perceptions regarding chewing various foods was conducted utilizing the Friedman tests. The effect size was also computed as part of the analysis. All statistical analyses were conducted using the R program, with a significance level set at 5%.
In phase I of the project, twenty-two patients were initially selected, but due to various reasons, the final number included nineteen individuals. One patient did not participate in the denture fabrication process, two were fitted with partial dentures, and another did not attend the 1-year reevaluation, citing the expectation of receiving dental implants instead. Consequently, the study comprised nineteen participants in phase I, with four receiving upper dentures and fifteen receiving double dentures. In phase IV, the study involved eighteen individuals based on the exclusion criteria.
In the sample of rehabilitated patients, the average duration of edentulism was found to be 15.3 (± 15.3) years. All patients reported tooth decay as the cause of tooth loss, with eating and smiling difficulties being the most commonly cited issues resulting from missing teeth. Financial constraints were the primary reason for not using dentures. Expectations for the dentures to be made in the village predominantly revolved around improving one's smile and enhancing chewing abilities.
Table 2 illustrates a notable decline in the impact of oral health on patients' quality of life throughout the study stages (p<0.05). This decline was accompanied by substantial effect sizes observed across all domains as well as the total score.
Table 3 presents the outcomes of the descriptive analysis concerning the attributed scores of all patients following one year of denture usage (t1), which were predominantly elevated. Notably, one patient received a score of zero for chewing ability, stability, and comfort with their lower dentures. Moreover, the attributed scores for chewing, aesthetics, and hygiene were notably lower for the lower dentures in comparison to the upper dentures, with statistical significance observed (p<0.05).
Table 4 displays the attributed scores for the food chewing abilities of all denture-wearing patients. Overall, the scores were predominantly high; however, it is noteworthy that the same patient who rated chewing, stability, and comfort as zero for the lower dentures also assigned a zero score for the ability to chew all types of foods.
The prevalence of edentulism among Brazil's indigenous population is notably high, with the rates of tooth loss and demand for dentures among the Pataxó community surpassing those of the broader Brazilian population. This study highlights dental caries and periodontal disease as the primary contributors to tooth loss, further exacerbated by the socioeconomic challenges experienced by indigenous communities and the intrusive nature of public dental services.
The phase I findings regarding the impact of oral health on quality of life align with the notion that edentulous individuals experience physical disabilities or limitations, particularly in eating, speaking, and social interactions, as highlighted by the respondents as the most significant challenges stemming from tooth loss. Among the patient cohort, 68.4% cited eating difficulties and 63.2% mentioned smiling challenges as consequences of missing teeth, underscoring the profound effects of edentulism on their personal, social, and emotional well-being, which extend to speech and chewing impairments as noted by 31.6% and 26.3% of participants, respectively. A notable 42.1% of patients indicated financial constraints as the reason for not using dentures, underscoring the inadequacy of prosthetic rehabilitation services provided by the Brazilian National Health Service in meeting the demand, leaving a significant portion of the population without the means to access such resources or the services available through the public health system, a situation that also impacts the Pataxó indigenous community of Aldeia Velha.
The prosthetic rehabilitation of this population has historically posed significant challenges, primarily due to logistical and structural constraints. Transporting patients from remote villages to urban centers for treatment has been a major obstacle. Although DSEI Bahia has Primary Oral Health teams stationed in all villages, a dedicated dental prosthetics service is notably absent. Even in Aldeia Velha, which is close to urban centers, older adults residing in the village do not venture out to access prosthetic rehabilitation services.
The assessment tool utilized to evaluate the quality of dentures produced in the village was a questionnaire, commonly employed to gauge patient satisfaction and treatment success. The quality of the "dentures in one day" was positively appraised based on patient feedback for upper and lower dentures in satisfaction (9.8 and 8.9, respectively), chewing (9.9 and 8.4, respectively), and stability (9.7 and 8.0, respectively), supporting the notion that simplified techniques are equally effective as traditional methods. The high ratings received may be attributed to the dentures meeting patient expectations, notably enhancing their smile and chewing ability. As highlighted by Owen, documenting patient expectations regarding comfort, function, and aesthetics is crucial in the pre-treatment phase to ensure these aspects are addressed during denture preparation. Establishing a strong dentist-patient relationship is also vital, as psychological factors in prosthetic therapy are as significant as technical considerations for treatment success.
Effective communication plays a crucial role in alleviating anxiety, minimizing misunderstandings, and dispelling doubts, ultimately fostering satisfaction for both the patient and the dental professional. This aspect likely contributed significantly to the positive outcomes observed in the present study. All participating dentists in the initiative are affiliated with the indigenous oral health team, indicating their familiarity and experience in working with indigenous patients. This familiarity not only enhances their cultural competence but also optimizes the dynamics of the dental professional-patient relationship, thereby enhancing the overall quality of care provided.
However, treatment with complete dentures may not always yield successful outcomes, with dissatisfaction reported in approximately 10 to 20% of cases. Silva et al. argue that this dissatisfaction can impact a larger number of individuals, sometimes prompting them to abandon their dentures, as evidenced by a participant in their study. Following an interview-based assessment of twelve patients treated with complete dentures, the authors noted that three patients expressed total satisfaction while nine were classified as dissatisfied. Among the dissatisfied patients, six found their dentures to be acceptable but faced challenges in their usage, particularly with lower dentures, while three were completely dissatisfied due to issues like pain and aesthetics. A subset of patients may never adjust to mucous-supported dentures, influenced by factors such as psychological barriers, age, past experiences with dentures, or unmet expectations. This assertion was supported by the fact that two patients did not wear their dentures during the final evaluation, and one patient rated the lower dentures poorly in terms of chewing, stability, and comfort. Notably, adapting to lower dentures tends to pose more difficulties compared to upper dentures.
Most patients reported that their eating difficulties stemmed from a lack of teeth. After a year, significant improvements were noted in chewing ability, with a median score of 10 across all foods. Notably, coconut flesh, a particularly tough food, received a lower average score of 7.2, aligning with user reports of its challenging texture for denture wearers. These foods are staples in the diets of both indigenous communities and urban dwellers. This outcome supports prior research indicating enhanced self-assessment of chewing function following the provision of new dentures.
During the final evaluation of the upper dentures, an average score of 9.8 was achieved for the phonetic criterion, deviating from the findings of Kawai et al.13, who, utilizing both conventional and simplified techniques, reported a notably lower score in an assessment conducted six months post-denture fabrication. This discrepancy may stem from the timing of the evaluations; Kawai et al.'s study assessed dentures six months post-installation, allowing limited adaptation time, unlike the current study's evaluation, which occurred one year post-installation. Furthermore, the extended period of edentulism experienced by the patients in the study may have significantly impacted their quality of life, underscoring the importance of even minor improvements resulting from the treatment.
Among the patient cohort, 52.6% anticipated an improvement in their chewing ability following the fabrication of dentures. The final interview scores for chewing functionality revealed a mean of 9.9±0.5 for complete upper dentures and a mean of 8.4±3.2 for complete lower dentures. When considering the scores for chewing various food types, it is evident that the dentures crafted using the suggested technique can effectively restore chewing function to a comparable extent as conventional dentures, as previously observed.
The notable decrease in the influence of oral health on the quality of life of rehabilitated Pataxó patients indicates that this method can yield outcomes comparable to those achieved with dentures produced via traditional techniques. The dentures created in a single day, with the assistance of primary care dentists lacking specialized prosthetics training, demonstrated enhancements in the quality of life for indigenous patients.
Despite the limited number of rehabilitated patients, the statistical significance, substantial effect size, and innovative nature of this study validate its findings as reliable and fundamentally important for shaping public policies that facilitate access to rehabilitation for isolated populations residing in remote areas, distant from major urban centers.
The Dentures in One Day technique has demonstrated feasibility, advantages, and effectiveness in rehabilitating edentulous indigenous populations. This approach has successfully addressed barriers that impede access to comprehensive oral health care for indigenous communities, leading to enhanced quality of life for rehabilitated individuals. Furthermore, one year post-fitting, patients have reported satisfactory evaluations of both the dentures' quality and their chewing ability.
