The declaration of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic on March 11th, 2020, has had a profound impact on healthcare systems globally.
If telemedicine enables the remote delivery of healthcare services through electronic communication tools for medical conditions, it is crucial to consider that surgical interventions may not be able to be postponed (1, 2).
Several prominent surgical societies have taken the initiative to release position papers and guidelines aimed at establishing best practices in surgery. Notably, the European Association of Urology (EAU) Robotic Urology Section (ERUS) has recently published its guidelines addressing the challenges of robotic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Guidelines encompassing behavioral good clinical practice rules have been implemented to enhance safety and protect against COVID-19 for patients and healthcare professionals engaged in robotic surgical activities. Adherence to ERUS guidelines for both pure laparoscopic and robot-assisted procedures has been maintained at our institution since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Preoperative health screenings were conducted for all surgery candidates, none of whom exhibited symptoms indicative of COVID-19. Procedures were carried out in a dedicated operating room, with strict adherence to necessary protective measures and general disease transmission prevention protocols. Careful consideration was given to the selection of surgical indications to minimize the involvement of medical personnel and conserve medical resources, resulting in the performance of cystectomies, high-risk disease prostatectomies, and renal surgeries for large renal masses exclusively. Elective surgeries that posed no immediate risk to patients were postponed. Laparoscopic surgeries were conducted at the lowest feasible intra-abdominal pressure (8-10 mmHg) using an intelligent integrated flow system (AirSealÂ®, ConMed, Utica, NY) for system-assisted pneumoperitoneum desufflation. Operating room staff was kept to a minimum, with no external observers, including residents or fellows, permitted. Experienced surgeons employed standardized techniques to reduce operative time and minimize the risk of complications.
At the conclusion of a three-week period, the teams operating in the operating room environment, comprising surgeons, anesthetists, nurses, operating room attendants, and patients' porters, underwent screening using a COVID-19 IgM/IgG rapid test lateral flow immunoassay. This method is currently recognized and validated for the swift diagnosis of COVID-19 (4).
The VivaDiagTM COVID-19 IgM/IgG test was conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. After a 15-minute incubation period, the results were interpreted. In total, over 300 tests were conducted at our institution, with a specific focus on 85 professionals involved in operative room activities. None of these individuals tested positive for either active or previous infection.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in respiratory samples stands as the current gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. However, molecular tests are characterized by their time-consuming nature and the need for specialized operators, which ultimately hinders their widespread application in real-world scenarios.
This is the rationale behind our selection of the VivaDiagTM COVID-19 IgM/IgG test. While it has been reported to have low sensitivity (4,5), its specificity is approximately 92%.
At a cost of 10 euros per person screened, we argue that this could serve as a cost-effective measure for ensuring the immunity of healthcare professionals.
President Ettore Sansavini graciously extended an offer to the healthcare professionals at San Carlo di Nancy Hospital in Rome to undergo the test.
