Objective: This study aims to consolidate the evidence regarding the efficacy of topical treatment in contrast to systemic treatment for pain management in adults with Malignant Fungating Wounds (MFWs).
Approximately 14.5% of cancer patients experience Malignant Fungating Wounds (MFWs) as a consequence of the improved survival rates associated with oncology treatments, with 85% of these patients reporting pain in the wound. While previous systematic reviews have delved into symptoms related to MFWs such as bleeding, foul odor, and exudate, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the management of pain in these wounds. A recent scoping review has identified 20 different proposals for topical treatments aimed at alleviating MFWs-related pain, originating from various study designs. However, there is a pressing need for an effectiveness review to be conducted in order to facilitate evidence-based decision-making in clinical practice.
Inclusion criteria encompass quantitative studies examining the efficacy of topical therapies for pain management in musculoskeletal facial pain (MFW) compared to systemic treatments in adult patients, with a focus on publications in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, without temporal restrictions. Studies failing to meet a minimum of 70% on the methodological quality scale will be excluded from the analysis.
Methods: The effectiveness review will adhere to the JBI methodology. Identified records will undergo a screening process based on their titles and abstracts to determine inclusion. Selected papers meeting the criteria will be thoroughly reviewed for relevance to the study's objective. Study selection will be guided by a predefined threshold for methodological quality assessment using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. Data extraction will be conducted by two reviewers for the identified studies. The findings will be synthesized and presented in a narrative and/or statistical summary format.
In 2020, a total of 19.3 million individuals received a cancer diagnosis globally, with projections indicating that the global burden of cancer will escalate to 28.4 million cases by the year 2040. This escalating trend underscores the increasing significance of the current cancer landscape, particularly in light of advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. These innovations not only enhance patient survival rates but also challenge the previously perceived inevitability of cancer as a fatal ailment.
The increased survival rate of patients with advanced cancer presents challenges, including the emergence of tumor-related wounds known as Malignant Fungating wounds (MFWs). These wounds are chronic, often irreversible injuries resulting from the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant fungating cells that invade locally, causing damage to the skin, subcutaneous and muscular tissues, and even affecting bones. The progression of MFWs is a consequence of oncogenesis, involving a degenerative evolution driven by primary neoplasia and metastasis. The incidence of MFWs generally falls between 5% and 14.5%, with the potential for variation due to cutaneous metastases, which can range from 0.6% to 10.4%.
Malignant fungating wounds (MFWs) are most commonly observed in patients with breast cancer, with a prevalence of 49%, followed by occurrences in the head and neck (21%), extremities and genitals (17%), and the head (13%). These wounds manifest with symptoms such as bleeding, pain, exudation, and foul odor, leading to potential complications like infections, fistulas, and larval infestation. The presence of MFWs not only physically affects the patient but also adds to the emotional burden by progressively altering the body's appearance. Effective symptom management is crucial not only for reducing emotional distress and improving the quality of life for patients but also for potentially reducing healthcare costs by preventing unnecessary hospitalizations and treatments.
Patients with malignant fungating wounds (MFWs) are often treated with a variety of topical interventions. These treatments may encompass antimicrobial agents like silver dressings and manuka honey, substances with analgesic properties such as opioids like topical morphine, anti-inflammatories like topical ibuprofen, and anesthetics like lidocaine gel and topical benzocaine. Additionally, lidocaine and prilocaine in the form of Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) are utilized for pain management. To control bleeding, hemostatic coatings such as calcium alginate and surgical hemostats like gel foam and regenerated oxidized cellulose are employed, along with non-adherent coatings like trilaminate hydro cellular dressing and vasoactive drugs like adrenaline. The use of sclerosing substances is also considered. However, the low level of evidence surrounding these interventions necessitates caution in their clinical application. For managing odor, treatments like topical metronidazole, polyhexamide biguanide, activated carbon dressing, curcumin ointment, and green tea extract are utilized. Traditional phytotherapy, particularly green tea extract, not only exhibits antimicrobial properties but also helps in suppressing malodor. Limited evidence also suggests that foam dressings containing silver may be effective in reducing unpleasant odors.
Pain is prevalent in 85% of patients with advanced cancer in the oral and maxillofacial region. The precise mechanism underlying this physical pain in these patients can be attributed to various factors, either in isolation or in combination. These factors may include accelerated tumor growth exerting pressure and invading structures and nerve endings in the skin, leading to nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Additionally, infections with a bacterial concentration exceeding 105/g, edema, excessive exudate (associated with dermatitis and humidity), and the process of dressing changes can also contribute to the experience of pain in these individuals.
The nature of pain felt by individuals with MFWs is contingent upon various factors such as the site of the injury, extent of tissue impairment, nerve entanglement, and the individual's history with pain-relieving medications. These elements collectively contribute to distinct variations in the type, severity, duration, and perception of pain experienced by the individual.
The clinical management of pain symptoms in MFWs necessitates the utilization of dressings that are supported by empirical evidence, proficiency in employing state-of-the-art treatments, and availability of advanced therapeutic options.
A preliminary search was conducted to identify systematic reviews evaluating the efficacy of topical therapeutics for pain management in individuals with malignant fungating wounds (MFWs). The search utilized the search terms "malignant fungating wounds" AND "pain" across various databases including JBI, Cochrane, Epistemonikos, ACCESS, DARE, MEDLINE, and PROSPERO, without any language or date restrictions. Among the retrieved results, only one systematic review dated 2017 was relevant, albeit not specifically focused on pain management. This particular review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of topical treatments for addressing infection, odor, and pain in MFWs, encompassing articles published between 2008 and 2017. However, due to the specific inclusion criteria, no studies directly addressing pain control in MFWs were found, and the existing evidence within the included studies was deemed insufficient.
In 2019, the JBI journal featured a review registry titled "Topical therapy for pain management of malignant fungating wounds: a scoping review protocol," with the objective of mapping the available evidence on topical therapies and treatments for managing pain associated with MFWs. This review specifically focused on studies examining the efficacy of topical treatments for pain management in malignant fungating wounds. The authors of the review identified 20 proposals for topical therapies aimed at pain control in MFWs from articles published between 1995 and 2020, which were categorized and synthesized accordingly.
Dressings play a crucial role in wound management, with various types available to address specific needs. These include non-adherent dressings, which prevent the dressing from sticking to the wound and causing further trauma during removal. Hydrogel dressings provide moisture to the wound bed, promoting healing and creating a moist environment conducive to tissue repair. Absorbent dressings are designed to soak up excess exudate from the wound, maintaining a clean and dry environment to prevent infection. Additionally, anti-inflammatory dressings help reduce inflammation at the wound site, aiding in pain management and promoting faster healing.
Pain relief medications encompass a variety of options, including topical opioids, topical anesthetics, and medical cannabis. These substances have been studied for their efficacy in managing pain and are commonly used in clinical settings.
Antimicrobial substances, such as honey and antiseptics, have been widely studied for their effectiveness in combating various pathogens. Honey, known for its natural antibacterial properties, has been used for centuries as a traditional remedy for wounds and infections. On the other hand, antiseptics are chemical agents specifically designed to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms on living tissues. The comparison and evaluation of these two types of antimicrobial substances play a crucial role in understanding their mechanisms of action and potential applications in medical settings.
The topical therapies utilized on the periwound skin, as outlined in the review, encompassed a range of substances including zinc oxide in both ointment and cream forms, silicone as an adhesive remover, dimethicone, petroleum jelly, acrylate, cyanoacrylate, hydrocolloid in plaque and powder formats, and vitamin A and D ointment.
After confirming the absence of published systematic reviews, protocols, or registered titles that specifically address the efficacy of topical therapy in managing pain caused by MFWs, it is evident that there is a gap in the existing literature. Consequently, the necessity to conduct the current review is established.
This systematic review holds importance in evidence-based clinical practices and the enhancement of nursing care for cancer patients with malignant tumor wounds, focusing on safety, quality of care, impact on quality of life through symptom improvement, and the well-being of caregivers. The objective is to consolidate evidence concerning the efficacy of topical pain control treatments for malignant fungating wounds in adults, comparing them to systemic treatments.
What is the efficacy of topical dressing-type therapies, analgesic medications, and antimicrobial agents in managing pain in adult individuals over the age of 18 with mucosal frictional wounds (MFWs) when contrasted with systemic interventions?
This review will examine studies involving adults experiencing painful MFWs, without limitations based on race, ethnicity, or gender. As per the World Health Organization's definition, individuals aged 18 and above will be classified as adults.
The systematic review will encompass studies examining the efficacy of topical therapeutics in managing pain associated with MFWs of the dressing type, including non-adherent, hydrogel, absorbent, and anti-inflammatory dressings, antimicrobial substances such as honey and antiseptics, and analgesic substances like topical opioids and anesthetics. All studies detailing the impact of any topical treatment on MFWs will be incorporated. Furthermore, the review will take into account factors such as the type of substance used, frequency of application, dosage, presentation, pain intensity, and the involvement of the multidisciplinary team.
The study will compare systemic pain management treatments for musculoskeletal facial pain in adults aged 18 and above. It will evaluate various factors including the type of medication used, frequency of administration, dosage levels, different forms of presentation, pain intensity levels, and the involvement of multidisciplinary teams in the treatment process.
The systematic review will encompass studies focusing on pain improvement as a primary outcome, evaluated through topical and systemic therapy, utilizing pain assessment scales, questionnaires, and other validated tools. Adverse events, defined as unintended harm caused to the patient from healthcare or intervention, will be considered as a secondary outcome, alongside health-related quality of life and costs. Furthermore, the review will examine standardized sets of results from relevant tests, referencing the international COMET initiative (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) for comprehensive evaluation.
This review will focus on various experimental study designs. In the absence of randomized controlled trials, alternative designs such as quasi-experimental studies, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, before and after studies, and series studies will be examined. Furthermore, observational analytical studies, encompassing prospective and retrospective cohort studies, will also be taken into account for potential inclusion. Studies published in English, Portuguese, and Spanish will be considered without any restrictions on publication date.
The forthcoming systematic review will adhere to the methodology for systematic effectiveness reviews outlined by JBI29 and has been registered on the PROSPERO CRD42022351715 platform.
The search strategy is designed to identify both published and unpublished studies. Initially, a limited search was conducted on MEDLINE and CINAHL to pinpoint relevant articles. Text words from titles and abstracts, along with index terms, were utilized to construct a thorough search strategy for CINAHL (refer to Appendix I). This strategy, incorporating all keywords and index terms identified, will be customized for each information source. There will be no restriction based on publication year, ensuring a comprehensive search. Additionally, the reference lists of all studies deemed critical will be chosen for in-depth analysis.
The study will utilize various databases including CINAHL, LILACS, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane, NICE, JBIEBP, CAPES Thesis Bank (Brazil), Google Scholar (including textbooks and conference proceedings), Teseo (Doctoral Thesis Database - Spain), RCAAP (Open Access Scientific Deposit - Canada), Canadian Thesis, Thesis Portal, Dart-E (European Database of Theses and Dissertations), as well as the international initiatives All Trials and Restoring Invisible and Abandoned Trials to identify both published and unpublished quantitative studies.
Following the search, all identified records will be consolidated and cataloged using Mendeley (Mendeley Ltd. 2020, Elsevier, The Netherlands), with duplicate studies being eliminated. Subsequently, two independent reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts to determine their alignment with the predefined inclusion criteria outlined in the review protocol. Potentially relevant studies will then be retrieved in full, with citation data being integrated into the JBI System for Unified Management, Evaluation, and Review of Information (JBI SUMARI 2017; JBI, Adelaide, Australia). The full texts of the selected citations will be meticulously evaluated by the two independent reviewers against the inclusion criteria. Any full-text studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria will be excluded, and the reasons for their exclusion will be documented and disclosed in the systematic review. In the event of any discrepancies between the reviewers during any stage of the study selection process, these will be resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. The outcomes of the study search and inclusion process will be comprehensively detailed in the final systematic review and illustrated in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) flow chart.
Eligible studies will undergo critical evaluation by two independent reviewers utilizing JBI critical evaluation instruments, with response options including "Yes," "No," "Unclear," and "Not Applicable" for randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and cohort studies. Any discrepancies between reviewers will be addressed through additional dialogue with a third critical reviewer. Findings from the critical evaluation will be presented in both narrative and tabular formats. Following the evaluation, studies failing to meet 70% of the quality threshold will be excluded based on:
The JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Randomized Controlled Trials Instrument comprises 13 evaluation items, with a cutoff score set at 9.1.
The JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies comprises nine evaluation items, with a set cut-off score of 6.3.
The JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Cohort Studies Instrument comprises 11 assessment items, with a defined cohort score of 7.7.
Two independent reviewers will extract data using the modified standardized data extraction tool (Appendix II) and assign a credibility level. The extracted data will encompass specific details regarding populations, study methods, interventions, and results relevant to the review's purpose, providing precise information. Disagreements among reviewers will be resolved through discussion or by involving a third reviewer. In cases where necessary, authors of the articles will be contacted via email to request any missing or supplementary data.
Studies will be aggregated through a statistical meta-analysis utilizing JBI SUMARI, with effect sizes represented as weighted odds ratios (for dichotomous data) and weighted post-intervention final mean differences (for continuous data), alongside their corresponding 95% confidence intervals for analysis. Heterogeneity will be evaluated through statistical means, employing the I2 and standard χ2 tests. The determination of the model (random or fixed effects) and the meta-analysis methodology will be guided by Tufanaru et al.32, with experimental and observational data amalgamated separately for each outcome. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to investigate the influence of study quality, variations in sample size, patient age (adult versus older adult), and insertion technique (blunt dissection versus Seldinger).
When statistical grouping is unfeasible, findings will be articulated in a narrative format, supplemented by tables and figures for enhanced data illustration when deemed suitable. A funnel plot will be constructed to evaluate publication bias in cases where a meta-analysis incorporates ten or more studies. Statistical assessments for funnel plot skewness, such as Egger's test, Begg's test, and Harbord's test, will be conducted as necessary.
The certainty of evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and a Summary of Findings (SoF) will be generated through the GRADEpro software (2020, McMaster University, ON, Canada). This summary will include absolute risks for treatment and control, estimates of relative risk, and an evaluation of evidence quality considering factors such as risk of bias, transparency, heterogeneity, precision, and potential publication bias in the review outcomes.
The outcomes documented in the Statement of Findings (SoF) will encompass pain management through the use of dressings, analgesic medications, antimicrobial agents, and conventional therapies for malignant fungating wounds.
