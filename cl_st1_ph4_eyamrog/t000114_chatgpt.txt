Bryophyta, commonly known as mosses, represent a prolific plant group thriving in humid environments. Within the Atlantic Coastal Forest of Southeastern Brazil, mosses exhibit significant richness and diversity, particularly in montane regions. The Parque Nacional do Caparaó, our study site, is renowned for its mountainous terrain and high elevation. Despite the existence of a substantial number of moss collections from the park's western sector housed in herbaria, the eastern portion within Espírito Santo State remained largely unexplored until our investigation. During a groundbreaking survey, we meticulously traversed the park's primary visitor trails over a span of three intensive days, ultimately identifying 59 moss species across 38 genera and 22 families. Notably, nine species represent novel occurrences for the state, while 14 are exclusive to Brazil. Predominantly, these mosses were observed thriving in soil habitats, with a higher species count recorded at altitudes surpassing 1,500 meters above sea level. Among the diverse families encountered, Sematophyllaceae emerged as the most abundant within the surveyed area.
Bryophytes, encompassing mosses (Bryophyta, Goffinet et al. 2009), liverworts (Marchantiophyta, Crandall-Stotler et al. 2009), and hornworts (Anthocerotophyta, Renzaglia et al. 2009), are nonvascular land plants typically small in size, thriving in diverse substrates and ecosystems excluding marine habitats (Costa et al. 2010, Vanderpoorten & Goffinet 2009). Their reliance on humidity, attributed to flagellated gametes and the poikilohydric mechanism, renders them more prevalent in moist environments like the Atlantic Forest, which harbors nearly 90% of Brazil's bryophyte diversity (Costa et al. 2010, Costa & Peralta 2015). Conservation Units (CUs) play a pivotal role in safeguarding forest biodiversity, with the Parque Nacional do Caparaó (PNC) in southeastern Brazil standing out as a significant CU. Home to the country's third-highest peak, "Pico da Bandeira," soaring 2,892 meters above sea level (a.s.l.), the PNC boasts diverse environments and vegetation types, harboring undiscovered biodiversity. Additionally, the park features inviting waterfalls for swimming, drawing numerous visitors year-round. Tourism data from 2014 to 2017 revealed an average of 10,000 annual visitors, peaking at 2,500 visitors monthly during high season (Jun-Aug) (ICMBio 2021a; OTE-ES 2018). Understanding the biological diversity of these tourist-frequented environments is crucial for conservation efforts, as they are equally vital as preserved areas.
Although the Southeast region of the country has been extensively studied, there is a notable absence of published research on the bryoflora of the PNC. Existing literature only includes a few sporadic collections (Yano & Peralta 2008, Yano 2010, 2012). Scientific works focusing on the state of Espírito Santo remain scarce, with recent contributions limited to Costa & Silva (2003) and Yano (2005) in board forests, Silva & Piassi (2010) in restinga, Silva (2011), Silva & Bastos (2012), Sousa & Faria (2016), and Faria et al. (2020) in Ombrophilous Forest. The primary objective of our study was to conduct a comprehensive survey of mosses along the PNC visitation trails, starting from the entrance of the Espírito Santo section. This research aimed to enhance the understanding of bryophyte flora in the state, within the Atlantic Forest, and to contribute to the conservation of ecologically significant species, particularly those facing threats.
The Parque Nacional do Caparaó (PNC) is situated in the Southeast of Brazil, straddling the border of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo States (20°37' to 20°19'S and 41°43' to 41°55'W). Encompassing an area of nearly 32,000 hectares, approximately 80% of the park, specifically the eastern section, falls within the jurisdiction of Espírito Santo State (ICMBio accessed 06/01/2021a, Coutinho 2015). The park is entirely situated within the Atlantic Forest biome, characterized by Dense Mountain Ombrophilous Forest and Dense High Mountain Ombrophilous Forest in the study area (Coutinho 2015). Apart from forests, the region features high elevation grasslands ranging from 1,600 to 1,700 meters above sea level, showcasing herbaceous to shrubby vegetation and rocky outcrops (ICMBio accessed 06/01/2021a; Coutinho 2015). The climate is classified as tropical in altitude, with average annual temperatures ranging from 19°C to 22°C and annual precipitation between 1,000 and 1,500 mm, with peak rainfall occurring from November to January (ICMBio accessed 06/01/2021b).
Specimens were collected under authorization from the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (number 47090-4). The data collection took place over three days in May 2015, covering the main access road to the camps and trails leading to waterfalls. The main road, spanning 9 km and partially paved, was accessible by car. Visits were made to the waterfalls "Aurélio" and "Sete pilões" via narrow and moderately challenging hiking trails, each extending 1000 and 210 m, respectively (ICMBio accessed 12/02/2020a). The collection aimed to capture species diversity at each site, avoiding repeated collections within the same site. A total of 125 samples were manually collected or with a spatula across various substrates, stored in paper bags following Yano's (1984) methodology, along with environmental data like sun exposure and geographical coordinates. Substrate classification followed Robbins (1952) with modifications, including corticicolous, epixilous, epiphyllous, rupicolous, terricolous, and others. Identification relied on specific literature sources such as Reese (1993), Sharp et al. (1994), Buck (1998), and others. Moss classification adhered to Goffinet et al. (2009) with exceptions, following Carvalho-Silva et al. (2017) for the Sematophyllaceae family. Taxa names were verified using the Tropicos® database (Tropicos 2015). Distribution data were cross-referenced with Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021), Gbif (2021), and Splink (2021) databases, ensuring reliability through specialist identification and multiple collections. Conservation status and endemism information were sourced from Yano & Peralta (2007), Martinelli & Moraes (2013), and Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021).
Four altitudinal zones were delineated based on the predominant vegetation type: (I) below 1,500 m above sea level; (II) between 1,500 and 1,900 m above sea level; (III) between 1,900 and 2,200 m above sea level; and (IV) above 2,200 m above sea level. This classification was established to facilitate the description of family distribution and richness across the surveyed sites.
In this study, we document 59 species of mosses across 38 genera and 22 families (see table 1). Among these, nine species represent new records for the state, notably Physcomitrium falcifolium Müll. Hal. ex Broth and Atractylocarpus brasiliensis (Müll.Hal.) R.S. Williams, classified as Vulnerable and Endangered, respectively, in the most recent red list for Brazil (Martinelli & Moraes 2013). In the red list specific to Espírito Santo (Fraga et al. 2019), Brittonodoxa lithophila (Hornsch.) W.R. Buck, P.E.A.S.Câmara & Carv.-Silva, Itatiella ulei (Broth. ex Müll. Hal.) G.L.Sm. (Yano & Peralta 2007, Fraga et al. 2019), and Schizymenium campylocarpum (Hook. & W.-Arn.) Shaw are categorized as Vulnerable, Vulnerable, and Critically Endangered, respectively. The most diverse families were Sematophyllaceae (8 species), Leucobryaceae (6 species), Polytrichaceae, and Bryaceae (5 species) (see figure 2). Approximately 53% of the species were found exclusively in the Atlantic Forest, with the Cerrado and Amazon Forest accounting for 37% and 35% of the other occurrences, respectively. In terms of global distribution, 31% of the species are neotropical, 15% pantropical, 15% cosmopolitan, 24% endemic to Brazil, and the remaining 15% exhibit disjunct distributions. The majority of our samples were found on terricolous substrates (47%), followed by rupicolous habitats (28%) (see figure 3).
Altitudinal zones II and III displayed the highest number of families, with 12 and 17 respectively (see figure 4). Certain families were exclusive to specific altitudinal zones: Pterobryaceae (1 species) in zone I; Orthotrichaceae (2 species), Calymperaceae, and Rhacocarpaceae (1 species) in zone II; Mniaceae (2 species), Phyllogoniaceae, Pilotrichaceae, and Neckeraceae (1 species) in zone III; Hedwigiaceae (1 species) in zone IV. The family Bryaceae was the most prevalent, found across all zones, but particularly diverse in zone III with a total of four species. Provided below is a diagnostic characterization for endemic and new citations (*), arranged alphabetically by family.
Autoecious plants with tomentose stems, narrow triangular-lanceolate leaves bearing papillae at the distal extremities of the laminal cell, and sporophytes characterized by long seta. These plants are typically found in rupicolous habitats within the Atlantic Forest (both montane and high montane regions) and the Cerrado. Previous records indicate their presence in states such as BA, CE, and RS, as well as in various other regions across the Americas.
Stem leaves exhibit an ovate shape with an acuminate apex and serrate margins, accompanied by strong costae. Branch leaves, on the other hand, are characterized by their distant arrangement, ranging from erect to wide-spreading, and their lanceolate to ovate shape with an acute to short acuminate apex. This species is found in corticolous, rupicolous, and terricolous habitats within the Atlantic Forest, with documented occurrences in the states of ES, RJ, PR, RS, SC, and SP, as well as throughout the Neotropics.
Reddish plants with leaves that are equally spaced, crowded towards the upper part, and shaped obovate to ovate, with a serrulate margin towards the apex. The leaves are bordered by 3-5 rows of long cells, with upper cells being rombic and basal cells quadrate; costae are percurrent to excurrent. These plants are found corticolous, epixilous, and terricolous in the Atlantic Forest, ranging from lowlands to montane regions, and have been recorded in the states of BA, MG, and RJ, as well as throughout South America and Africa. In this study, we adhere to the accepted name for the species as per Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021).
Slender and diminutive plants with julaceous leaves, concave and ovate-lanceolate to shortly ovate, featuring crenulate margins in the upper section and an erect apex. The specimens we collected were discovered on soil and rocks in close proximity to the waterfall, typically manifesting as rupicolous within the Atlantic Forest (high montane region). This species has been documented in the states of ES, MG, and RJ, spanning across tropical regions.
Leaves are distally arranged in clusters, standing erect and ranging from ovate to oblate-lanceolate in shape; their costae either extend shortly beyond the leaf margins or terminate in an apiculate apex. The easily detachable capsula lacks stomata. Distinguished from Crumuscus vitalis Bück & Snider, this species is characterized by the presence of julaceous sterile shoots (Schäfer-Verwimp 1996). Our samples were gathered in high-altitude fields, where it thrives as a rupicolous plant within the Atlantic Forest, spanning from montane to high montane regions, and has been documented in the states of ES, MG, PR, RJ, and SC. This species is endemic to Brazil.
Dioecious plants are characterized by their erect leaves and amplectant base, with justacostal cells that are weakly to non-porous. They are typically found in the Atlantic Forest, specifically in high montane regions, and have been documented in the Brazilian states of ES and MG, as well as across South America.
Long, narrowly acuminate leaves with a subulate shape emerging from an ovate base characterize this species. The laminal cells are notably thickened, with basal cells ranging from long to rectangular in shape. The costa is robust, extending either percurrent or excurrent, and the capsule is cylindric with strong sulcation. This terricolous plant is typically found in the Atlantic Forest, specifically in montane regions, and has been documented in the states of MG, RJ, and SP. It is considered an endemic species of Brazil.
Falcate leaves with lanceolate to linear shapes, featuring an apiculate apex and denticulate upper margin, consist of long cells at both the margin and median portion of the lamina. Our samples were discovered on rocks near streams, typically found as terricolous in the Atlantic Forest (montane) region, with documented occurrences in the states of GO, MG, PR, RJ, RS, and SP. This species, classified as Vulnerable and endemic to Brazil, was not included in the Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021) publication; therefore, we relied on the work of Dias, Peralta & Neto (2018) to supplement the necessary information.
The most distinctive feature of this species is the costae excurrent, which are ridged dorsally and contain stereids on both sides in cross section. Species identification relies on the presence of the sporophyte, which sets it apart from others due to the exothecial oval cells and peristome teeth that are split into 2-3 teeth in 2/3. Our samples were discovered on rocks near streams and typically thrive as terricolous in the Atlantic Forest (high montane), with documented occurrences in the states of BA, RJ, RS, and SP. This species is both endangered and endemic to Brazil.
Long linear leaves with an erect to erect-patent orientation, featuring acute apices and serrulate upper margins, composed of smooth linear to fusiform cells. The costae are frequently sub-percurrent. The capsules are elongated and pyriform in shape. These samples were discovered growing on rocks and soil, a common occurrence in the Atlantic Forest (montane region), with documented presence in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Parana, as well as across Colombia and Bolivia.
Leaves are erect-patent, oblong-lanceolate, with an acuminate apex. This species is characterized by its cylindrically curved capsule, particularly noticeable when dry or empty, and features a single peristome with appendiculate tips. In our samples, it was observed growing along roadsides as terricolous, although it typically occurs as rupicolous in the Atlantic Forest (montane region), with documented sightings in the states of ES, MG, RJ, and RS, showcasing its cosmopolitan distribution. Notably, it is classified as Critically Endangered in the state of Espírito Santo.
The leaves are lanceolate to falcate, with a long acuminate shape and a serrate margin in the apical region with simple teeth. Our samples were discovered in rocks near the stream, occasionally submerged, typically found as terricolous in the Atlantic Forest (sub-montane and montane regions), and have been documented in the states of ES, PR, RJ, RS, and SP. This plant is endemic to Brazil.
The involute leaf margin at the apex is a distinctive feature of this species, with oblong-lanceolate leaves exhibiting a dentate margin. The cells are quadrate to hexagonal, appearing smooth, with percurrent costae. In a transverse section, lamellas are found occupying both the costae and lamina. Peralta & Yano (2010) note the resemblance of this species to Pogonatum campylocarpum (Müll. Hal.) Mitt., but highlight the difference in the simple and rhombic lamellae apical cell. This terricolous species is typically found in the Atlantic Forest, specifically in montane and high fields, and has been recorded in the states of ES, MG, PR, RJ, and SP. It is considered vulnerable in the Espírito Santo State and is an endemic species in Brazil.
Leaves are rigid and imbricate when dry, becoming erect when moist, displaying a lanceolate-linear, acuminate shape. The plant is distinguished by its pyriform and smooth apical lamellae cell, leading Peralta and Yano (2010) to classify it as the largest species within its family. This terricolous plant is predominantly found in the Atlantic Forest (montane) and Pampa regions, with documented occurrences in the states of BA, ES, MG, PR, RJ, RS, SC, and SP, making it a Brazilian endemic species.
Leaves are characterized by their incurvate, oblong-lanceolate shape with a denticulate margin, featuring papillose cells that bear papillae on the lumen. This species is found in corticolous, rupicolous, and terricolous habitats within the Atlantic Forest, with documented occurrences in the states of MG, RJ, RS, and SC. Considered vulnerable within the Atlantic Forest region, this species is also distributed across Tropical America.
Plants exhibit a yellowish to golden hue, with leaves that are densely packed and range from oblong-lanceolate to lingulate in shape, featuring a short-acuminate to apiculate apex and a crenulate margin. The inner basal cells of these plants are reddish-yellow, and they possess percurrent costae. This particular species was commonly found in the high elevation grasslands under investigation. It is known to thrive in both rocky (rupicolous) and terrestrial (terricolous) habitats within the Atlantic Forest, with documented occurrences in the states of ES, MG, RJ, SP, and SC. Furthermore, this species is exclusive to Brazil, making it an endemic plant of the region.
The plants exhibit robust characteristics, featuring oblong-lanceolate leaves with a short acute or cuspidate apex, an unbordered and entire margin. Our samples were discovered in a rupicolous habitat within a humid environment. This species is prevalent throughout the Atlantic Forest, specifically in montane and high montane regions, and has been documented in the states of ES, MG, RJ, RS, and SC. It is considered an endemic species of Brazil.
Long, narrowly lanceolate leaves that are recurved and gradually acuminate, with 2-3 oblong-inflated alar cells arranged obliquely. This species is corticicolous and, in our samples, rupicolous, primarily found in the Atlantic Forest region. It has been recorded in various states across Brazil, including AL, BA, CE, DF, ES, GO, MG, MT, PA, PE, PR, RJ, RS, SC, and SP, indicating its wide distribution within the country. Additionally, it is considered a Brazilian endemic, further highlighting its unique presence within the region.
The leaves exhibit asymmetrics to falcates when dry, with stem leaves being ovate or oblong-lanceolate, while branch leaves are lanceolate with a cuspidate apex. The species displays inflated alar cells and 2-3 rows of supra-alar cells. Our samples were discovered on sun-exposed rocks in an open environment, typically found as corticolous and epixilous in the Atlantic Forest, particularly at high altitudes. This species is commonly recorded in the states of AM, BA, ES, MG, PR, RJ, SC, and SP, indicating its widespread distribution. It is considered a Brazilian endemic species.
The leaves of this species range from squarrose to erect-patent, with a concave base and an ovate shape stemming from a larger base. The upper laminal features smaller cells, with supra-alar cells being larger than alar cells. Capsules are frequently sub-erect and larger than those of D. commutata (Müll.Hal.) W.R. Buck, as detailed by Buck (1994). This species is corticolous, found in the Amazon Forest and Atlantic Forest, with documented occurrences in the states of PA, MG, RJ, RS, SC, and SP, spanning throughout the Neotropics.
Recognizable by its erect to expanded leaves, which are oblong to oblong-lanceolate and strongly concave, with a long acuminate apex and longer apical cells, as well as larger alar and supra-alar cells, our samples were discovered in rocky areas near streams. This species exhibits a terricolous, corticolous, and rupicolous habitat in the Amazon Forest, Atlantic Forest, and Cerrado regions, with documented occurrences in the states of Bahia, Distrito Federal, Espírito Santo, Goiás, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Pará, Pernambuco, Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Rondônia, Roraima, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, and Tocantins. Endemic to Brazil, V. galipense is considered a homotypic synonym of Sematophyllum galipense (Müll.Hal.) Mitt., as proposed by Carvalho-Silva et al. (2017), despite the nomenclatural discrepancies noted in the Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021).
Characterized by lanceolate and strongly falcate leaves with a denticulate margin, inflated alar cells that are slightly obliquely arranged, and leaf cells that may exhibit either conspicuous or nearly imperceptible papillae. This species is coticicolous and epixilous in the Atlantic Forest region, with documented occurrences in the states of MG, PE, PR, RJ, RS, SC, and SP, making it a Brazilian endemic.
The state of Espírito Santo has recently been documented to host 492 bryophyte species, with 263 of them being mosses. However, a previous catalog by Yano in 2012 reported 531 taxa, including 286 moss species spread across 134 genera and 50 families. Despite a noticeable decrease in species numbers, potentially due to synonymous taxa or misidentifications, Espírito Santo still ranks among the top 10 states in terms of bryophyte diversity in Brazil. Various studies conducted in the state have highlighted the rich biodiversity of bryophytes. For instance, Peralta & Yano (2011) identified 89 moss species in the Mello Leitão Museum herbarium, with 21 new records for the state. Silva (2011) discovered 126 moss species, including 35 new occurrences in Dense Montane and Upper Montane Ombrophylous Forests. Yano (2016) documented 67 moss taxa in the state's "Tabuleiro" Forests, with 15 new occurrences. More recently, Faria et al. (2020) reported 102 moss species, with 33 new occurrences in an Ombrophylous Forest. This study contributes nearly a quarter of the known moss diversity in Espírito Santo State, along with 9 new citations. In terms of families, Sematophyllaceae, Leucobryaceae, and Bryaceae are noted as some of the richest families in the Neotropics, including Brazil and the Atlantic Forest. Sematophyllaceae is particularly common in the Atlantic Forest and is considered the fifth richest family in Brazil, alongside Bryaceae. Leucobryaceae, with its global distribution, is frequently found in open environments within montane rainforests, especially the genus Campylopus, known for its adaptations to light and desiccation, such as hyalocysts and hair points. The Atlantic Forest, especially in montane regions, harbors a diverse array of bryophytes.
The bryoflora composition in our study demonstrated a closer relationship to that found in the Cerrado and the Amazon Forest. While the Cerrado biome is geographically closer to the Atlantic Forest, the Amazon Forest stands out as the second richest biome in the country (Costa & Peralta, 2015; Flora do Brasil, 2020, 2021), displaying significant botanical similarities with the Atlantic Forest due to their shared evolutionary history. Many taxa identified, except for the exclusive ones, exhibit distribution patterns in both the Cerrado and the Amazon Forest, aligning with findings from other studies conducted in the region by Sousa & Faria (2016) and Faria et al. (2020).
A significant proportion of species (46%) were observed on terricolous substrates. It is frequently observed that bryophytes colonize areas along roadsides at higher altitudes (Frahm, 2003), and even on exposed rocks. Despite our collections primarily being conducted along partially open trails, we encountered a variety of habitats along these paths, allowing for a substantial representation of species, including those found on diverse substrates.
Corroborating these findings, we identified a greater diversity of mosses and a higher number of families exclusive to the altitudinal zone ranging from 1,500m to 2,100m. This pattern aligns with observations made in other remnants of the Atlantic Forest, such as in Rio de Janeiro (Costa & Lima, 2005), the Serra de Ibitipoca (Siviero, 2010), the Serra do Cipó (Yano & Peralta, 2011), and the northern region of São Paulo (Visnadi, 2005). The presence of diverse microhabitats and microclimates in these areas promotes the establishment of a rich bryophyte community (Costa & Lima, 2005). Consequently, it is imperative to continue conducting studies in this field, particularly in the Espírito Santo State, which harbors a variety of unexplored environments. The significance of the data for the state is underscored by the numerous new records and the expanded knowledge base for the group. In the context of the PNC, there is an urgent need to conduct surveys on liverworts, which, akin to mosses, are expected to exhibit substantial taxonomic diversity. Continuous taxonomic revision studies, species lists, and reports on new occurrences are essential for maintaining up-to-date information. By doing so, we can pave the way for addressing new research questions and contribute to advancing knowledge within the group, thereby bolstering the conservation efforts for the Atlantic Forest and its remnants.
