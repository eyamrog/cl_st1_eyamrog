In less than four months, an unprecedented pandemic 
changed the world scenario, closing institutions and commerce, 
paralyzing 
sports 
championships, 
blocking 
frontiers, 
and 
putting almost all populations in a house quarantine regimen. 
Immunocompromised patients are within the high-risk group to severe 
outcomes from COVID-19. However, there is no clear evidence of the 
association between impaired immune host status and complications 
from SARS-CoV-2 infection so far. The virus is transmitted by 
inhalation or direct contact with infected secretions, and therefore the 
dental office is a highly susceptible environment for such transmission. 
Here, we review the literature and discuss immunological COVID-19 
related issues. We also make suggestions for immunocompromised 
patients’ support in this new emerging context of clinical dental 
practice. Until comprehensive findings are published, individuals with 
impaired immunity should be considered as high-risk. Cross infection 
control procedures for the clinical care of immunocompromised 
patients should follow the same guidelines that are being proposed for 
immunocompetent ones. However, during the active outbreak, people 
under immunosuppressive conditions should not receive elective 
procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or exposure history to 
COVID-19, and in case of emergence, care must be done in a separate 
airborne room. In the pos-pandemic phase, the dental care general 
recommendations should be the same for all subjects. Changes in the 
current guidelines have been proposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection control 
in order to provide the best and safe dental practice. However, they still 
need to be validated by future studies. 

On 12 December 2019, a patient was hospitalized with severe pneumonia 
of unknown etiology, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Clusters of similar 
cases were spreading within the province, and, in early January 2020, the 
unidentified pneumonia was discovered to be caused by a novel viral 
subtype of the Coronaviridae family, designated as severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1,2,3 By the end of January 2020, WHO 
declared SARS-CoV-2 infection as a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern and a few days 
after, officially named the disease as “coronavirus 
disease 2019” (COVID-19). The pandemic state was 
declared on the 12th of March 2020, and, since then, 
the outbreak exponentially advanced worldwide.

Although mild respiratory tract infection 
characterizes most COVID-19 cases with cold 
symptoms, it is a serious global situation.4 Severe 
outcomes usually occur in older male patients with 
secondary comorbidities.5 Hypertension, chronic 
respiratory system diseases, diabetes and cardiopathies 
were highlighted as potential risk factors to severe 
outcomes from COVID-19.5 These findings are 
supported by the current epidemiological evidence 
that recently added obesity into the high-risk group.6 
Serum analysis showed higher plasma levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines in severely ill patients.7 Since 
chronic diseases may lead to low immune function, 
a strong correlation between the host immune status 
and COVID-19 prognosis is highlighted.7 Therefore, 
immunosupressed patients were added within higher 
risk group for severe illness from COVID-19.

The current pandemic is a unique and 
unprecedented situation that represents the biggest 
public health challenge on the 21st century. Several 
guidelines have been proposed for safe dental health 
care practice and pandemic spread control.8,9,10 
However, there are no specific measures directed 
to immunocompromised patient management. These 
patients are frequently affected by a wide range of 
oral diseases requiring prompt care, which in turn, 
increases their increased exposition to high-risk 
environments. Therefore, we aimed to review the 
literature and to discuss immunological COVID-
19 related issues.  We also make suggestions for 
immunocompromised patients’ support in this new 
emergent context of clinical dental practice.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of enveloped, 
nonsegmented positive-sense single-strand RNA 
viruses that have an expansive coding capacity 
and are divided into four subfamilies: α, β, γ and 
δ-CoVs.11 Until the 50s, these species were identified 
in vertebrate animals only.11 Human infections are 
caused by α and β CoVs and emerged as cases of 
the common cold in the mid-1960s.12 The COVID-19 
pandemic is the third CoVs outbreak since the turn of 
the millennium.11 Severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was the etiological agent of 
the first epidemic that started in November 2002 in 
China and ended in July 2003, accounting for 8,422 
confirmed cases and 774 deaths in 26 countries.13 The 
second one  emerged in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia 
and was caused by a novel CoV subtype named as 
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-
CoV).14 The MERS-CoV epidemic remains ongoing, 
and until December 2019 2,499 cases and 858 deaths 
were reported in 27 countries.11 The current pandemic 
has started in China, however, the European and 
American continents are the most severely affected. 

Just like SARS and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 is a member 
of the β-CoV family.3 This  pathogen was included 
within SARSr-CoV species because it shares 87% of 
genomic sequences and 94% of similarities among 
conserved protein domains with SARS-CoV.2 The 
SARS-CoV-2 also shares 96% of overall genome 
sequence identity with the BaTCoV RaTG13, a bat 
coronavirus.2 Phylogenetic analysis showed that 
RaTG13 is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 and 
they form a distinct lineage from others SARS-CoVs, 
which supports the evidence that COVID-19 emerged 
from bats.1,2 

SARS-CoV-2 has the same physical structure as 
other CoVs. Its genomic RNA and phosphorylated 
nucleocapsid protein (N) are buried inside a 
phospholipid bilayer covered by three types of 
proteins: spike glycoprotein trimmer (S), membrane 
protein (M) and envelope protein (E).15 The S proteins 
are responsible for the attachment of CoVs to host cells, 
playing a crucial role in its virulence.2 SARS-CoV-2 
S proteins are longer and molecularly divergent to 
all previously described CoVs, and it exhibits several 
molecular alterations in the N-terminal domain 
and the receptor-binding motif compared with the 
sequence of SARS-CoV.2 

Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
is a type I membrane protein that provides a direct 
binding site for the S proteins, being essential for 
viruses to enter cells.2 SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 with 
approximately 10 to 20-fold higher affinity than SARS-
CoV, which may explain the easier human to human 
transmission when compared to SARS-CoV.16 During 
the invasion of the cells, the S protein is cleaved into 
two subunits (S1 and S2). The receptor-binding domain 
(RBD) is on S1 subunit and directly binds to ACE2, 
while S2 subunit is cut by transmembrane proteases 
and merges with the cell membrane, releasing the 
viral genome into the cytosol.17 A dimeric ACE2 can 
accommodate two S protein trimmers, simultaneously, 
which may facilitate the invagination of the cell 
membrane and endocytosis of the viral particle.17 

Because of the increased expression of ACE2, 
some organs such as the salivary glands, lung, heart, 
esophagus, kidney, bladder, and ileum have a higher 
potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.18 The severe 
lung alveolar damage of some cases is linked to the 
accentuated ACE2 expression by type II alveolar 
cells (AT2), which also express many other genes 
favoring the viral infection.19 The ACE2 expression 
was also detected in male reproductive cells and the 
nervous system,20,21 which explain some neurological 
manifestations presented by COVID-19 patients.21 
Therefore, testis and brain were added within the 
group of SARS-CoV-2 infection vulnerable organs. 

Inflammation is the hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 
infection. Severely ill patients had higher plasma 
levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17 and TNF-α than less 
severe patients.7,22 Even asymptomatic individuals 
showed classic findings related to the inflammatory 
response of the lung cells on chest CT images.7,23 The 
causes of the exuberant inflammation is unknown 
so far, and different possible mechanisms were 
postulated based on the previous knowledge about 
SARS-CoV infection.24 

After contagion via respiratory droplets, direct 
contact and/or fecal-oral route, the viruses enter 
human cells mainly through the ACE2-binding 
described above, infecting epithelial, endothelial and 
immune system cells.24 Fu and colleagues,24 proposed 
a separation of the possible inflammatory responses 
during SARS-CoV-2 infection into primary and 
secondary responses. In the primary inflammatory 
response, the active viral replication may drive ACE2 
downregulation and shedding, and activates host 
viral response with increased cytokine production, 
apoptosis and/or pyroptosis,24 which is a form of 
programmed cell death due inflammation that was 
previously associated with SARS-CoV infection.25 The 
secondary inflammatory response is characterized 
by the appearance of neutralizing antibodies 
(NAb) that can trigger the monocytic/macrophagic 
response through FcR binding, leading to severe 
lung injury. The antibody-dependent enhancement 
(ADE) mechanism, a viral cellular uptake of virus-
antibody complexes, may also occur in this phase, 
mainly in immunocompromised patients.24 These 
patients have an early suboptimal antibody activity 
and cannot completely clear the virus, leading to 
persistent viral replication, inflammation, and 
increased fatality risk.24 However, the role of the 
immunological suppressed status on COVID-19 
severity remains controversial so far.

As discussed above, the biological response to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection requires the activation of the 
innate and acquired immunity.15 In a postmortem 
study, the overactivation of T cells, manifested by 
increase of Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells, 
were related with the severe lung immune injury.26 
Lymphopenia is a common finding in COVID-19 
affected patients, extensively associated with severe 
complications and death,7 and could be caused by 
lung sequestration of  hyperactivated T cells.27 Since 
overactivated immune responses may be the main 
driver for organ damage, the anti-inflammatory 
effects of immunosuppression may be protective, 
mitigating the “cytokine storm” related to COVID-
19 poor outcomes.27

Some studies have reported an overall asymptomatic 
or mild COVID-19 course in immunocompromised 
patients, such as children under anticancer therapy,28 
immunosuppressive chronic drugs users,29  transplant 
recipients,30 and poorly controlled HIV or AIDS 
patients.31 In these reports, the few severely affected 
individuals recovered and low fatality rates were 
registered. Also, immunosuppression was not found 
to be a risk factor either for SARS nor MERS.32 

On the other hand, in a case-control study, 
immunocompromised children were predisposed 
to infection of the lower respiratory tract from 
SARS-CoV33 and a nationwide analysis showed that 
infected patients with cancer had poorer prognosis.34 
Recently, the chronic use of corticosteroids previous 
to SARS-CoV-2 contamination was  associated with 
critical illness outcomes, including a high risk of 
death.7 Moreover, the recovery of a liver transplant 
recipient severely affected by COVID-19 has been 
only achieved after the temporary withdrawal of 
immunosuppression and normalization of immunity.35 

These contradictory observations show that 
the knowledge about the relationship between 
COVID-19 and host immunological status is limited. 
Further studies are required to elucidate the immune 
responses and inflammation features from SARS-
CoV-2 infection.7,15 According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, 
immunocompromised patients remain under the 
high-risk group for severe illness progression.  These 
individuals should be carefully follower-up until 
large case-control cohorts, which provide more solid 
results, are published.

Almost all dental care procedures generate aerosols, 
which represent the most important clinical concern 
within the pandemic situation. The viral aerosol 
spreading was confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 detection 
in air samples up to four meters away from general 
COVID-19 wards,36 and the virus can survive on 
surfaces exposed to infected saliva droplets for at 
least nine days.8,9 On optimal experimental conditions, 
SARS-CoV-2 also showed great viability on stainless 
steel and plastic,37 the major constituents of the dental 
instruments and equipment. Additionally, oral cavity 
tissues express ACE2, especially salivary glands38 and 
epithelial cells of the tongue.39 Hence, beyond being 
a source of infected aerosol spread, oral mucosa is 
highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These 
facts place dental practitioners and patients in one of 
the most vulnerable positions in COVID-19 context.9 

The immunocompromised status is directly 
linked to a wide range of oral pathologic conditions. 
Transplant receivers are at high risk of having oral 
bacterial, fungal and viral infections, oral mucosa 
lesions, as well as neoplastic diseases.40 Oral candidoses 
has already been associated with a poorly controlled 
immunological status of HIV-infected individuals41 
and patients under anticancer therapy.42 Those under 
head and neck cancer radiotherapy are broadly 
susceptible to severe oral health issues, including 
mucositis, dental radiation cavities, among others.42 

There are two main concerns regarding patients 
that suffer from autoimmune and inflammatory 
conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, 
autoimmune bullous diseases, lupus erythematosus, 
Sjögren syndrome and Behcet disease. First, the long-
term immunomodulating approaches employed on 
the treatment of these diseases may inhibit antiviral 
immunity and predispose to worse course of COVID-19.43 
Additionally, a potential exacerbation of the autoimmune-
related oral lesions may occur if the patients are advised 
to discontinue such therapy during the pandemic.44 

Several guidelines have been proposed to SARS-
CoV-2 infection control to provide safe dental 
practice.8,9,10,45 To date, during the pandemic outbreak, 
an initial tele screening has to be made to assess the 
presence of COVID-19 symptoms and evaluate the 
previous exposure to risky situations such as recent 
travel and human-to-human contact history.45 

During the outbreak, elective procedures should 
be avoided for at least two weeks if the individual 
has symptoms or known exposure history and 
should not be performed for SARS-CoV-2 positive 
subjects.45 Urgent care such as acute pain relieve or 
mild swelling must be treated remotely with medicine 
prescription and close follow-up by telephone or 
video conference.45 Emergency care, such as swellings 
compromising the airways, should be performed 
in a negative pressure or airborne isolation rooms, 
following the above-mentioned infection control 
procedures.45 Radiographic evaluations on dental 
emergencies could be done through sectional dental 
panoramic radiography or intraoral radiography with 
adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) use by 
dentists and radiography staff.46 Elective and urgent 
procedures should be avoided in immunocompromised 
patients, even if they are asymptomatic. In the case of 
emergency, care must be done in an airborne isolated 
room, following the recommendations for clinical 
procedures described below.

For immunocompetent patients with no 
symptoms or exposure history,  the dental treatment 
can be performed under specific conditions.45 An 
extensive hand hygiene protocol employing 60% to 
85% hydroalcoholic solution, use of all PPE, and, if 
possible, the 4-handle technique should be used.9,10 
The equipment should be covered with disposable 
physical barriers and anti-refraction valves installed 
on handpieces.9,10 Aerosol generating can be mitigated 
avoiding the use of ultrasound, bicarbonate jet, 3-way 
syringe, and with the use of rubber dams and high-
volume saliva ejectors.8 Preprocedural mount rinses 
with 1% hydrogen peroxide or 0.2% povidone are 
indicated to reduce potential SARS-CoV-2 carriage.9 
The clinical environment should be disinfected before 
and after dental care, with 70% isopropyl alcohol or 
0.1% sodium hypochlorite.10 The garbage must be 
discharged into double-layer yellow color medical 
waste package bags with “gooseneck” ligation.9 

It is worth noting that the current guidelines are 
useful along with the acute phase of pandemic, and 
some changes are needed for daily dental practice 
after the control of the situation. The same guidelines 
for immunocompetent subjects are recommended for 
immunocompromised patients after the pandemic 
phase. The previous assessment of COVID-19 risk 
and the measurement of body temperature using a 
contact-free thermometer should still be performed. 
Suspected patients should be cared for in an isolated 
room, or the definition of a particular scheduling day 
must be adopted. Elective care should not be performed 
in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. These patients 
should be managed following the acute pandemic 
phase guidelines.45,46

Patients with no symptoms or known exposure 
history could be taken care on collective clinical 
places. However, since asymptomatic or mild 
course characterizes most of COVID-19 cases, 
some cautions must be taken. Dental and waiting 
room chairs should be distributed in at least four 
and one meter of distance each, respectively. The 
consultations flow must be reduced, and thirty 
minutes after the end of care should be designated 
for the disinfection of the room. 70% ethanol, masks, 
and disposable shoe covers must be available for 
the auxiliary staff and patients. The protective 
measures regarding dental procedures must still 
be followed.8,9,10,45,46

Elderly, males, hypertensive, patients with 
diabetes, and individuals with chronic respiratory 
and cardiovascular diseases, constitute the most 
well-characterized high-risk group for severe 
manifestations from COVID-19. To date, the disease 
outcomes regarding the immunosuppressed 
patients are unclear. The assessment of symptoms 
and laboratory findings in a greater sample size of 
immunologically impaired individuals will help to 
elucidate the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 
induces exacerbated inflammatory responses. These 
studies will help define the real risk of complications 
and death under immunosuppressive conditions. 

The efforts made worldwide to minimize the 
risk of COVID-19 spreading during dental care 
procedures provided clear and usable guides for best 
dental practices.8-10,45,46 However, the effectiveness 
of the acute phase and post-pandemic infection 
control measures should be verified on prospective 
epidemiological and comparative multicenter studies. 
Here, we discussed the COVID-19 outcomes in 
individuals with an immunocompromised health 
state, and elective procedures, after the end of the 
pandemic, should follow specific cross-infection 
control recommendations.
