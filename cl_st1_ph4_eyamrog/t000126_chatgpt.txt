The primary objective of this study was to examine the impact of occlusion time on the dynamic alterations in autonomic activation observed during reactive hyperemia.
Methods: A total of 30 healthy subjects within the age range of 18 to 25 years were recruited for this study. Vascular reactivity was evaluated by monitoring the dynamic alterations in finger pulse volume amplitude (PVA) and pulse transit time in relation to RR intervals in both the test (occluded arm) and control arm (non-occluded contralateral arm) during 1, 3, and 5 minutes of occlusion, utilizing two distinct Photoplethysmographic sensors. Heart Rate Variability was determined from a concomitantly recorded ECG signal to track the dynamic fluctuations in cardiac autonomic nervous activity. The time-varying analysis of all signals was depicted at 1-second intervals in average response graphs.
Results: The time-varying analysis of vascular and autonomic responses during reactive hyperemia revealed a distinct pattern of response. This pattern included an initial increase in the Sympathetic index and a decrease in the Parasympathetic index at 8 to 10 seconds, followed by a rise in heart rate at 20 seconds, and a continuous increase in PVA within the first 60 seconds post-occlusion, irrespective of the occlusion duration. Additionally, a decrease in pulse transit time relative to RR intervals was observed, followed by a subsequent increase, regardless of the occlusion duration.
Conclusions: The early activation of cardiovascular sympathetic activity appears to be unrelated to the duration of occlusion during reactive hyperemia. This finding implies that such activation is likely a vascular autonomic reflex response that plays a crucial role in the development of the physiological process of reactive hyperemia.
Reactive hyperemia (RH) is a well-established technique characterized by a rapid and exaggerated reperfusion to an organ or tissue when the circulation is restored after a period of complete circulatory arrest. Previous studies have demonstrated a direct correlation between the duration of occlusion and the intensity of the hyperemic response. Peripheral vasoregulation during RH is, in part, mediated by the vascular endothelium. Endothelial dysfunction serves as a predictor of cardiovascular events and is considered a crucial factor in the progression of atherogenesis and the pathophysiology of coronary atherosclerosis. One of the functional consequences of endothelial dysfunction is the impairment in the release of nitric oxide, a relaxing factor derived from the endothelium that possesses significant antiatherogenic properties.
To assess endothelial function, various techniques have been utilized, with angiography being a common method. However, the invasiveness and requirement for skilled operators pose significant challenges. Conversely, non-invasive approaches have been employed, with flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in the arm arteries being a widely used method. FMD assesses arterial response to nitric oxide release during reactive hyperemia but is complex, operator-dependent, and unable to detect microvascular changes. Peripheral arterial tonometry has emerged as a more prominent method for evaluating endothelial function, with a device developed to measure pulsatile arterial volumetric changes using photoplethysmography (PPG) and finger pulse volume amplitude (PVA), independent of observer influence.
NO, derived from the vascular endothelium, is a significant contributor to vasodilatation resulting from reactive hyperemia. However, various studies have indicated a correlation between autonomic nervous system activity and RH. The forearm clamping procedure utilized to induce reactive hyperemia could potentially impact autonomic nervous system activity. The circulatory arrest during the occlusion phase may inherently elevate sympathetic activity, which is involved in vascular tone regulation. Additionally, this sympathetic activation likely plays a crucial role in influencing inter-subject variability in vascular responses and shear rate alterations during reactive hyperemia.
Previous studies have demonstrated that dynamic exercise leads to the release of metabolic byproducts, which in turn elevate sympathetic neural activity to the systemic vasculature through the muscle metaboreflex. This reflex, known for its potent blood pressure-raising effects, is primarily triggered by the stimulation of Group III and IV muscle afferents by metabolites such as protons, lactate, potassium, and diprotonated phosphate, which accumulate in underperfused active skeletal muscle. Activation of the muscle metaboreflex results in a reflexive surge in sympathetic outflow, particularly evident during submaximal dynamic exercise, where it significantly boosts heart rate (17).
Bade et al. demonstrated that a similar response, involving chemosensitive nerve fibers activated by metabolites released by ischemic tissue, which accumulate due to circulatory arrest in the forearm, may be linked to reactive hyperemia (RH) and can trigger sympathetic activation. Additionally, it has been suggested that the conflicting effects of endothelium-dependent vasodilation and sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction likely determine the resulting post-vascular occlusion (PVA) response in the test arm during RH. Nevertheless, the sympathetic activation during reactive hyperemia remains not fully understood. This study aimed to explore the impact of occlusion time on the dynamic changes of autonomic activation during reactive hyperemia. The hypothesis posited that the reflexive nature of sympathetic activation during reactive hyperemia and the transient sequence of this phenomenon could be elucidated using time-frequency methods.
Thirty healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 25 years (Mean=20.3 ± 1.7) were recruited for this study. Exclusion criteria included a history of cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, or neural diseases, with all participants being normotensive (resting blood pressure: systolic 101±11.2 mm Hg / diastolic 63.6 ± 8.5 mm Hg), non-obese (body mass index= 21.9 ± 2.6 kg/m2), non-smokers, and not taking any medications. Prior to testing, participants were instructed to fast for 2 hours and refrain from consuming tea, coffee, alcohol, or engaging in strenuous physical activity for 24 hours.
The experimental protocol received approval from the Research and Ethics Committee for human subjects research at the Universidad de Ciencias Médicas de Santiago de Cuba. Prior to enrollment in the study, written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
All recordings were conducted under controlled ambient conditions with a temperature range of 24-27 °C and dim lighting. Baseline blood pressure measurements were taken following a 15-minute period of supine rest. The sphygmomanometer cuff remained secured on the arm for subsequent arterial occlusion procedures. ECG signals were captured in the bipolar limb lead II mode using disposable Ag – AgCl electrodes. PPG waveforms were obtained using an infrared emitter (LED, 850 nm) and a photosensor (photodiode) positioned on the middle finger of both upper limbs. The ECG and PPG signals from the AngioECG equipment (18), equipped with a bandpass filter (0.5-30 Hz), were digitized at a sampling rate of 1 kHz. During the initial phase of the session, patients rested in bed under the specified environmental conditions until acclimatization was achieved, followed by blood pressure measurements. A control electrocardiogram was recorded to monitor heart rhythm, after which simultaneous ECG and PPG measurements were taken for a duration of 5 minutes. For the reactive hyperemia test, the sphygmomanometer on the right arm was inflated to 50 mmHg above baseline systolic blood pressure for 1, 3, and 5 minutes of occlusion, with concurrent ECG and PPG recording.
Time-varying analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and during the reactive hyperemia test (1, 3, and 5 minutes of occlusion) was conducted using the Kubios HRV Premium Professional program developed by Kubios Ltd in Finland. This software facilitated the pre-processing of the RR interval series and the computation of time-frequency indicators. During the pre-processing stage of the RR interval series, an Automatic correction filter was utilized to identify ectopic beats. The discrimination of the R peaks in the ECG signal and the subsequent calculation of RR intervals were carried out using a robust detection method as described in previous literature. Ectopic intervals were replaced through polytomic cubic interpolation after the removal of low-frequency baseline drift for a smoother analysis. The time-frequency values of heart rate, sympathetic index (SNS index), and parasympathetic index (PNS index) interpolated at 1 Hz were exported to .mat archives for further processing in Octave software.
The construction of the time-varying hyperemia curve followed the recommended procedure by experts (20). Initially, the average pulse volume amplitude of a record at rest in the upper right limb was determined. Subsequently, the pulse volume amplitude of a post-occlusive record of the assessed limb was obtained, along with the ratio of the hyperemic curve of the post-occlusive and rest record. The pulse volume amplitude (onset to peak) was measured for constructing the hyperemic response curve. To identify the clinical interest points of the pulse wave, the method proposed by Carrazana et al. was utilized (21). The time-varying analysis of the temporal sequence of pulse volume amplitudes was interpolated at 1 Hz and then exported to *.mat files for improved statistical management in Octave software.
Pulse Transit Time (PTT) is the duration between the R-peak of the ECG and a crucial point on the pulse wave within the PPG signal, with systolic peaks identified as critical points in this investigation. Relative PTT, on the other hand, is characterized as the ratio of PTT to the corresponding RR interval, under the assumption that PTT falls within this RR interval. The temporal sequence of Relative Pulse Transit Time underwent time-varying analysis, with interpolation at 1 Hz, and the resulting data was exported to * .mat files for enhanced statistical handling within Octave software.
The graphs depicting average values over time-frequency were generated using Octave software version 5.1.0 (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html). These graphs were constructed from matrices (* .mat) containing values derived from the time-varying analysis of heart rate variability and pulse volume amplitude, which were interpolated at 1 Hz.
In Fig. 1, dynamic changes over time during reactive hyperemia reveal an increase in heart rate occurring 20 seconds after cuff deflation, irrespective of the occlusion duration. This response becomes notably more pronounced after three to five minutes of occlusion.
Figure 2 illustrates the temporal progression of the sympathetic component of cardiac autonomic regulation during the reactive hyperemia test with varying occlusion durations. This procedure induces heightened activity within the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), peaking approximately eight seconds post-cuff deflation, regardless of the occlusion period.
Figure 3 illustrates the temporal progression of the parasympathetic aspect of cardiac autonomic regulation during the reactive hyperemia test at various occlusion durations. It demonstrates a consistent reduction in parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity immediately following cuff deflation, irrespective of the duration of occlusion.
Figure 4 illustrates the temporal progression of pulse transit time relative to PP intervals (PTT/PP) in the contralateral arm during the reactive hyperemia test at various occlusion times. The data reveals a consistent pattern of initial decrease in PTT/PP followed by a subsequent increase, irrespective of the duration of occlusion applied.
Figure 5 illustrates a clear correlation between the duration of occlusion and the intensity of the hyperemic response. Specifically, it indicates that as the occlusion time increases, so does the magnitude of the response, as well as the duration of the vascular response measured using the post-occlusive reactive hyperemia technique after cuff deflation.
At rest, the predominance of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity ensures that heart rate (HR) remains at a minimum level necessary to meet the metabolic demands of the organism. Consequently, during the initial stages of occlusion, there is a notable increase in parasympathetic activity, which gradually decreases as sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity intensifies, likely due to the metaboreflex response. This shift becomes more pronounced following three to five minutes of occlusion, indicating that a one-minute occlusion period may not be sufficient to elicit a specific activation of the sympathetic nervous system. It is plausible that during this timeframe, the concentration of various metabolites is insufficient to trigger a robust metaboreflex response (11).
In the current study, a significant rise in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity was observed immediately upon cuff release, peaking around 8 seconds post-release. These results align with Bade et al.'s (2019) findings, indicating an increase in total and low-frequency (LF) power of heart rate variability (HRV) during reactive hyperemia (RH) compared to baseline. Furthermore, after five minutes of occlusion, the sympathetic response appeared to be more pronounced, potentially due to the elevated concentration of metabolites released from ischemic tissues such as adenosine. Contrary to Boushel's (2010) conclusion that adenosine does not trigger the muscle metaboreflex, it was found to enhance sympathetic nerve activity with a delay corresponding to the circulatory time required for the activation of central chemoreceptors.
In the analysis of the evolution of the parasympathetic component, a decrease in PNS activity was observed following cuff deflation. This decrease was accompanied by an increase in SNS activity, aligning with the concept of reciprocal inhibition between the two systems (23). Subsequently, the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system increased, compensating for the central mechanism and counteracting the vasoconstrictor effect of the sympathetic component in cardiovascular autonomic regulation. This adjustment reduced the negative impact of the SNS on the vascular endothelium, leading to an increase in the production and release of NO by the endothelium in response to shear stress. Hijmering et al. (2002)(12) demonstrated that sympathetic stimulation could hinder flow-mediated endothelial-dependent dilatation through mechanisms involving α-adrenergic receptors, highlighting the significance of released transmitters from nerve endings in modulating endothelial function and myogenic response. Additionally, a direct correlation was observed between the duration of occlusion and the magnitude of the hyperemic response. Prolonged occlusion times resulted in delayed and prolonged elevation of bloodstream flow due to an extended period of vasoconstriction induced by SNS activity, impeding the rapid increase in bloodstream flow.
A notable decrease in PVA in the control arm during RH indicates sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction. However, the early onset of vasoconstriction in the control arm, even within the first minute of occlusion, challenges the muscle metaboreflex hypothesis, raising uncertainties about the precise cause and source of sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction. This study demonstrates ANS activation effects on the contralateral arm during reactive hyperemia at various occlusion times, manifesting initial vasoconstriction indicated by a decrease in PTT/PP, succeeded by vasodilation with an increase in PTT/PP regardless of occlusion duration. Another study suggests that the Pulse Transit Time response reflects myogenic elements in the initial phase of RH. These alterations are reactive responses to occlusion during the reactive hyperemia test, further supporting the metaboreflex hypothesis.
The analysis of autonomic nervous system dynamics using time-frequency methods of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) enables the determination of the temporal association of various physiological events involved in reactive hyperemia. This analysis suggests that Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) activity plays a role during the myogenic contraction phase preceding vasodilation. Furthermore, this activity is closely linked to shear stress, which enhances the force of blood shearing on the vascular endothelium, causing endothelial cell distortion and triggering the release of Nitric Oxide (NO) immediately after cuff occlusion. NO, in conjunction with various vasodilator metabolites released by ischemic tissues, is responsible for the increase in blood flow that characterizes reactive hyperemia.
Early cardiovascular sympathetic activation appears to be unrelated to occlusion time during reactive hyperemia, indicating that it represents a vascular autonomic reflex response that plays a role in the initiation of the physiological process of reactive hyperemia.
