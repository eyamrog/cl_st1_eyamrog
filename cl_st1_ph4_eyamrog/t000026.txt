with a mean age of 23.3 years (standard deviation = 4.9). Among the main results, it 
is noteworthy that 39.86% of the students used anxiolytic medication, most of whom 
were veterans (87.9%). The use of anxiolytic drugs was detected in 58.8% of students 
with high trait anxiety and in 60.5% of those with moderate state anxiety. In addition to 
the statistically significant association between medication use and university type, 
there was a significant correlation between age and trait anxiety - weak negative. 
Universities should encourage strategies for managing anxiety and include actions to 
reduce its symptoms in their support programs.

Resumo 
Este artigo teve por objetivo analisar a correlação da ansiedade e uso de ansiolíticos 
entre estudantes universitários da área da saúde. Foi realizado um survey on-line em 
âmbito nacional com 286 estudantes universitários da área da saúde, sendo 77,9% 
do sexo feminino, com a média de idade de 23,3 anos (desvio-padrão = 4,9). Entre os 
principais resultados, ressalta-se que o uso de medicamento ansiolítico era feito por 
39,86% dos estudantes, sendo a maior parte veteranos (87,9%). Foi detectado o uso 
de medicamentos ansiolíticos em 58,8% dos estudantes com ansiedade traço alta e 
em 60,5% daqueles com ansiedade estado moderada. Além da associação 
estatisticamente significante entre o uso de medicamento e o tipo de universidade, 
houve uma correlação significativa entre idade e ansiedade traço – negativa fraca. As 
universidades devem incentivar estratégias para o manejo da ansiedade e incluir 
ações para reduzir seus sintomas em seus programas de apoio.

Entering university is an important milestone in the lives of many young people. 
Indeed, it is a period of maturational transformations, including physiological, 
neurological, and psychological changes that occur during the transition from 
adolescence to adulthood (Silva & Costa, 2012). This transition can be challenging as 
it requires adaptation to a new social role and changes in various aspects of the 
university student’s life (Ferreira et al., 2009; Pereira & Ramos, 2021). 
In view of this, specifically, university students in the health area face challenges 
in their academic experience that can negatively affect their physical and mental health 
(Carli et al., 2022). These challenges include high teaching hours, overload of 
academic tasks, and curricular internships in hospital and primary care settings where 
they can be exposed to stressful situations related to illness and the process of 
becoming ill (Chattu et al., 2020). 
Thus, exposure to a challenging environment during academic training can 
increase susceptibility to the development of anxiety, negatively affecting the academic 
performance and well-being of the university student (Balapala & Indla, 2017). In this 
context, it is highlighted that anxiety is defined as a mental state of restlessness and 
disorder characterized by the presence of worry, avoidance, and emotional reactivity 
or arousal that cause an unrealistic and unpleasant emotional state in the individual 
(Gama et al., 2021). 
It is in this sense that it is clarified that anxiety can be understood in two different 
ways: trait anxiety and state anxiety. In the university space, trait anxiety is understood 
as a stable personality characteristic (Machado et al., 2016), which predisposes the 
student to perceive the university as threatening and dangerous, causing levels of 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4563
 
anxiety disproportionate to the situation (Balapala & Indla, 2017). On the other hand, 
state anxiety is characterized as a transient emotional state (Machado et al., 2016) that 
generates symptoms such as nervousness, worry, and apprehension related to the 
excitement felt in this environment (Gama et al., 2021). 
Global research indicates that the prevalence of anxiety is higher in college 
students than in non-college young adults of the same age group. Auerbach et al. 
(2016) reported a prevalence of 31% (n = 1.572) among students, compared to a lower 
prevalence of 21.4% (n = 4.178) among non-students. In a subsequent study, 
Auerbach et al. (2018) found that 31.1% (n = 13.984) of students had an anxiety 
condition. In the Brazilian context, Demenech et al. (2021) estimated that 
approximately 37.75% (n = 3.193) of higher education students had anxious 
symptoms. 
Given this worrying scenario, anxious symptoms may contribute to the 
inappropriate use of prescription anxiolytic drugs among university health students 
(Pérez et al., 2023). This population is a target for the misuse of these psychotropic 
drugs, as they have a certain degree of economic independence, are free from direct 
supervision by parents or guardians, and are more likely to try them to help cope with 
the overload of curricular activities (Nogueira et al., 2021; Souza et al., 2022). 
To support this perspective, the relationship between the use of anxiolytic 
medications and anxiety has been mainly investigated among university students. A 
global study conducted by Auerbach et al. (2018) revealed that 12.6% of university 
students with anxious symptoms were using these medications. Among the most 
commonly used are benzodiazepines (BZDs; 5.9%), selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs; 3.9%), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4563
 
2.2%). In Brazil, a study found that 24.3% of medical students used antidepressant 
and/or anxiolytic drugs (Souza et al., 2022). 
The literature has also indicated that female university students are more 
vulnerable to anxiety (Blanco et al., 2021) and to taking anxiolytic medication 
(Martínez-Líbano et al., 2023). This evidence suggests the need for a more detailed 
analysis of possible sex-related differences. Although there are studies in this regard, 
the prevalence of anxiety and the use of anxiolytic medications are usually treated 
separately in the national literature. Similarly, national empirical studies on prevalence 
tend to focus on samples of medical students (Chattu et al., 2020; Souza et al., 2022) 
and nursing students (Marchi et al., 2013; Paixão, et al., 2021). 
Considering the scarcity of research in Brazil on the correlation between anxiety 
and consumption of anxiolytic drugs, especially among university students in the health 
area who work directly in the health sector, this article presents a contribution by 
analyzing the correlation of anxiety and use of anxiolytics among university students 
in the health area. 
 
Method 
This is a cross-sectional web survey study with a descriptive and correlational 
approach. For greater methodological rigor, this work follows the guidelines proposed 
by Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) 
(Cevallos et al. 2014). The research setting covered three geographic regions of Brazil 
(Northeast, Southeast, and South). Data collection was online and took place from 
September 15 to October 14, 2021, over a period of 30 days. The sample consisted of 
undergraduate university students in the health area. 
 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4563
 
Participants 
The study included 286 university students from 13 different undergraduate 
courses in biological and health science areas (biology, biomedicine, physical 
education, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, medicine, nutrition, 
dentistry, psychology, chiropractics, and occupational therapy). The participants were 
selected by convenience (nonprobability sampling) and by meeting the following 
criteria: (a) being undergraduate in the health area in Brazilian Higher Education 
Institutions (HEI), (b) being 18 years old or older, and (c) having access to the internet. 
In the present study, the students are from different educational institutions, 
public, private, and community, and from some Brazilian states in the Northeast 
(Alagoas, Bahia, and Sergipe), Southeast (Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São 
Paulo), and South (Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul) regions. 
 
Instruments 
Sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire: addressed questions such as 
age, ethnicity, sex, marital status, state, course, term, university, symptoms (physical 
and psychological) of anxiety, and history of anxiolytic medication use. 
Anxiety Trait-State Inventory (IDATE): created by Spielberger et al. (1970) and 
validated in Brazil by Biaggio and Natalício (1979). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient 
of the instrument is 0.86 to 0.95 (Spielberger et al., 1980). It consists of two 40-item 
scales distributed in a four-point Likert format, ranging from "4-very much" to "1- 
absolutely not". The first scale evaluates the anxiety state (IDATE-E), and the second 
evaluates the anxiety trait (IDATE-T). Each evaluative part consists of 20 alternatives 
(Grös et al., 2007). In this study, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.85, revealing that the internal 
consistency of the data is satisfactory.

Procedures 
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Tiradentes 
University (CAAE No. 20058919.5.0000.5371) and complied with national and 
international standards of ethics in research involving human beings. 
Initially, data collection was carried out through an online questionnaire, made 
available through a Google Forms link sent to the institutional e-mails of university 
students regularly enrolled in health courses at a private university in Sergipe where 
one of the researchers comes from. 
Subsequently, the virtual snowball sampling method was used to disseminate a 
link to access the survey on the social network Instagram. This referral technique, 
known as viral strategy, consisted of sending a message presenting the research and 
requesting that it be shared with the recipient's network of contacts. Thus, university 
students from any health course, educational institution or location could access and 
answer the questionnaire. 
In general, when accessing the questionnaire link, respondents were directed 
to the Informed Consent Form (ICF) screen, which ensured voluntary participation and 
anonymity, in addition to allowing withdrawal from the study without prejudice to 
psychological integrity. Consent was obtained through electronic acceptance, and it 
was necessary to click on "I agree to participate in the research" to continue. Next, 
participants were directed to a page containing the sociodemographic and clinical 
questionnaire and the IDATE, with an average duration of 20 minutes. 
 
Data Analysis 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4563
 
The data obtained were organized in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet through 
double typing and later validation to control for possible errors and later exported and 
analyzed in the software Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 
25.0 so that the sociodemographic and clinical profile data were characterized by 
absolute and relative percentage frequencies (descriptive statistics). The Kolmogorov‒
Smirnov test with Lilliefors correlation was used to verify the normality assumption. 
Then, Fisher's exact test was performed in quadratic tables (rows and columns 
have the same number) and Pearson's chi-square test (χ2) in nonsquare tables 
(number of rows and columns differ), both aiming to evaluate the data distribution of 
the variables in relation to the symptomatic levels of anxiety through the scores of the 
IDATEs (IDATE-T and IDATE-E). 
For the correlational analysis, Kendall's Tau-b test was used to assess the 
correlation of the scores (IDATE) between both indices, analyzing the strength of the 
correlation with the variables age, period and medications used. Additionally, the 
agreement rate between IDATE-T and IDATE-E was verified through the Kappa (K) 
coefficient test. For all analyses, a 95% confidence interval and a significance level of 
p < 0.05 were adopted. 
 
Results 
Table 1 presents the characterization of the sample through the descriptive 
analysis of sociodemographic and clinical data. Of the 286 research participants, the 
majority are female (77.9%), with a mean age of 23.3 years (standard deviation SD= 
4.9). They are veterans (87.9%), enrolled in the Medicine course (44.2%), self-
declared white (49.8%), single (85.8%), attended private universities (80.4%), and 
mostly lived in the state of Sergipe (58.2%).

< Insert Table1> 
Regarding the use of anxiolytic drugs, it was observed that 39.9% of the 
participants used these drugs, while 60.1% did not use them. In this context, Table 2 
presents a correlation analysis between age, period, amount of anxiolytic medication, 
and state-trait anxiety. It is noteworthy that no statistically significant relationship was 
found between age, period, amount of anxiolytic medication, and state anxiety. The 
same occurred between period, amount of anxiolytic medication, and trait anxiety. 
However, there was a weak and significant negative correlation between age and trait 
anxiety (r = -0.114, p = 0.007). 
< Insert Table 2> 
When analyzing the comparison of the use of anxiolytic drugs according to the 
type of university and sex (Table 3), a higher frequency of anxiolytic drug use was 
observed among female students (42.3%) and those attending public universities 
(55.3%). In addition, there was a statistically significant association between the type 
of university and the use of anxiolytic drugs (p=0.042), but not between sex and the 
use of anxiolytics. 
< Insert Table 3> 
Regarding the use of anxiolytic drugs and state-trait anxiety (Table 4), it was 
found that there was a statistically significant relationship between high trait anxiety 
with the use of anxiolytic drugs (p=0.019). 
In terms of the correlation between gender and state anxiety, it was noted that 
a higher proportion of women (68%) exhibited moderate anxiety levels in comparison 
to men (60.3%). Regarding sex and trait anxiety, 51.8% of women had high levels of 
anxiety, while 57.1% of men had moderate levels. These data suggest the existence

of differences in the prevalence of anxiety between men and women, depending on 
the type of anxiety assessed (state or trait). 
Table 4 reveals that, during the data collection period, participants used twenty-
one different medications. Anxiolytic BZDs (Diazepam and Clonazepam) were the 
most commonly consumed, followed by antidepressants of the SSRI class 
(Escitalopram, Citalopram, and Fluoxetine) and ADTs (Amitriptyline), respectively. 
These data provide information on the most commonly used medications by survey 
participants.

Discussion 
This study analyzed the correlation of anxiety and use of anxiolytics among 
university students in the health area. The main findings showed that 58.8% of the 
students investigated reported the use of anxiolytic drugs, with most of the sample 
being veterans. The presence of anxious symptoms leads students to seek quick 
solutions to deal with the overload of curricular activities, including the use of 
medications (Nogueira et al., 2021; Pérez et al., 2023). 
In addition, the university is a critical environment for the use of anxiolytic drugs 
and the development of problematic patterns of consumption of these drugs (Vera et 
al., 2021). One study found that 20% of senior health students use anxiolytics daily 
due to anxiety before exams, difficulties in coping with academic responsibilities, and 
fulfilling curricular and/or extracurricular internship activities (Fond et al., 2019). 
An association was also observed between the type of university and the use of 
anxiolytic drugs. Female students had a higher occurrence of use of these drugs, a 
result in line with the findings of other national studies (Aquino et al., 2010; Bojanić et 
al., 2021; Souza et al., 2022). This result can be partially explained by the greater 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4563
 
exposure of women to medicalization at all stages of their life, greater demand for 
medical care, and educational campaigns more directed at them (Forster et al., 2019). 
On the other hand, the lower percentage of male participants may be attributed to the 
tendency of men to be less likely to seek help to deal with their mental health problems 
(Souza et al., 2022). 
It is also worth adding that, although university students are at higher risk, the 
sample of this study was composed mostly of women, which may have influenced the 
results. Therefore, it is important to consider the composition of the sample when 
interpreting the results and to conduct further research to confirm these observations. 
In general terms, the main finding of the study was that 58.8% of health students 
with high trait anxiety and 60.5% of those with moderate state anxiety used anxiolytic 
drugs. In addition, students attending public universities made greater use of anxiolytic 
drugs. These data are corroborated by a national study conducted by Marchi et al. 
(2013), which revealed that 34% of nursing students at a public university have mild 
anxiety, and 16% of them use or have used some type of anxiolytic medication. 
Another important result of this research was that, compared to male 
participants, female participants showed higher levels of moderate state anxiety. 
Recent research suggests that state anxiety in female university students is related to 
transient anxiety, which varies according to emerging stimuli from their academic 
experiences and can cause temporary negative emotional states (Deer et al., 2018; 
Thomas & Cassady, 2021). 
In contrast, an international study by Nazir et al. (2021) reported that female 
university students had higher levels of trait anxiety (M = 48.45, SD = 12.79, p <0.001) 
compared to males who had higher levels of state anxiety (M = 41.85, SD = 8.91, p 
<0.001). Studies have shown that manifestations of trait anxiety in university students 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4563
 
may be related to personality traits and a stable tendency to experience anxiety in 
academic situations (Bados et al., 2010; Williams & Crawford, 2016). 
The present study also demonstrated that participants use a variety of 
medications to cope with anxiety symptoms, with BZDs being the most commonly 
used, followed by SSRIs and ADTs, respectively. It is noteworthy that the data 
presented provide information on the most commonly used medications by the 
participants at the time of the survey data collection. In this context, anxiolytics are 
considered to be all psychotropic drugs classified as antidepressants, antipsychotics, 
BZDs, barbiturates, and other sedative-hypnotic medications that act on mild to severe 
anxiety symptoms (Morris et al., 2021). 
In addition, it is important to emphasize that if anxiety is not adequately treated 
with psychological monitoring and only the use of anxiolytics is made, this can lead to 
adverse reactions or dependence among university students, resulting in aggravations 
to the physical and mental health of this population (Morcerf & Acero, 2021). 
 
Conclusion 
The results of this research show that just over half of a sample of university 
students in the health field were using anxiolytic medication. There was a higher 
occurrence of the use of these drugs among females and those attending public 
universities. Our study also revealed that a significant portion of university students 
with high trait anxiety and those with moderate state anxiety use anxiolytic 
medications. These results contribute to knowledge in the area, showing the presence 
of state-trait anxiety symptoms among students and the importance of using the IDATE 
for screening anxious symptoms in this population. 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4563
 
In addition, this research can contribute to the practice of health psychology, 
expanding attention to the university context. From this investigation, it was found that 
the prevalence of consumption of anxiolytic drugs among university students was 
higher than expected, considering the context (university) and the stage of the life cycle 
of this population (young adult). 
In the national context, there are no studies investigating the relationship 
between anxiety and the use of anxiolytics in students from different undergraduate 
courses in the health area. Existing research tends to focus on medical or nursing 
students. This gap represents a challenge for universities and researchers, who need 
to conduct studies in this area to reflect the national reality and contribute to the 
implementation of preventive actions, as well as to evaluate their evolution and impact. 
This study presents some limitations that should be considered. The first is the 
cross-sectional design, which prevents conclusions about cause-and-effect 
relationships. Another limitation is the small sample size, which may affect the 
representativeness of the results. However, the data obtained may be useful for future 
longitudinal studies, despite the limitation of sample size. In addition, the use of a self-
administered questionnaire may generate memory bias and interpretation of questions 
by participants. The sample is also limited in terms of types of higher education 
institutions, with low representativeness of public and community universities. 
Additionally, another limitation of the study is the composition of the sample, 
which was mainly composed of women. To overcome this limitation in future studies, 
one could try to balance the proportion of men and women in the sample, using 
stratified or quota sampling techniques. The generalization of the results should be 
done with caution, as convenience sampling resulted in a higher concentration of 
participants from the state of Sergipe, which does not guarantee the 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4563
 
representativeness of the results for the entire Brazilian population. Therefore, new 
research should replicate this study, considering the limitations pointed out. 
Despite presenting limitations, this research is one of the first to investigate the 
correlation between anxiety and anxiolytic use in university students from different 
health courses in the country, which gives merit to the study. The results showed a 
frequency ranging from moderate to high of state and trait anxiety associated with the 
use of anxiolytic drugs among university students in the health area. In view of this, it 
is understood that the university is a favorable environment for health promotion and, 
therefore, studies that evaluate anxiety and subsidize strategies for its management 
should be encouraged in order to reduce the need for medication use among students.
