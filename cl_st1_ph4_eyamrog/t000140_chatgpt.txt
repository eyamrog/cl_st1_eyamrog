In the context of ongoing court battles concerning potential copyright infringement related to the distribution of articles and excerpts assigned to university students, this study examines 3,391 course syllabuses (2015-2020) from nine provinces and 34 universities across Canada. It aims to identify the types and proportions of required readings from both academic and non-academic sources. Academic readings are found in 26.6 percent of the syllabuses, while media articles and trade book chapters are present in 8.3 percent of syllabuses. Among the assigned readings, journal articles are the most common (54.3%), followed by scholarly book chapters (33.5%), media articles (6.0%), and trade book chapters (6.3%). The social sciences predominantly assign journal articles, while the humanities focus more on trade book chapters, with science having the least assigned readings. Textbooks are required in the majority of syllabuses (66.0%), with minimal variation across science, social sciences, and humanities. The data allows for a detailed analysis of the average annual reading load for students, equating to a cost of $0.021 per page based on the Access Copyright tariff of $14.31. A proposed "three-step syllabus rule" is suggested to prevent double-charging students for academic materials (90.1% of readings by pages) while ensuring fair compensation for authors and publishers (9.9%), with an estimated annual charge of $1.40 per student for their assigned readings.
University textbooks, while emblematic of a structured publishing industry that shapes the instructional framework of numerous post-secondary courses, have been eschewed by many instructors in the social sciences and humanities in favor of a disparate assortment of articles, chapters, and excerpts sourced from original scholarly and trade publications. Described vividly by Ehren Helmut Pflugfelder as "an object from the underworld, from the abyss beneath the post-historical university" (2012, p. 249), these compilations have been subject to copyright infringement lawsuits since the advent of copy-shops in the 1980s, which facilitated the practical implementation of this pedagogical approach. Notably, the early Basic Books v. Kinko's Graphics (1991) case in the United States underscored the legal ramifications associated with this teaching strategy.
By the second decade of the twenty-first century, the landscape of scholarly publishing had undergone a significant shift. While traditional paper coursepacks persisted, the predominant mode of access had transitioned to cloud-based online platforms, facilitated by institutional licensing agreements with university libraries. This shift, accompanied by a gradual increase in open access materials, underscored the evolving nature of scholarly publishing. This digital transformation not only accentuated the distinction between scholarly publishing, deeply embedded in the academic ecosystem, and trade publishing, driven by commercial imperatives, but also highlighted the contrasting mechanisms of author compensation. Scholarly authors, supported by universities partly funded through student tuition, relied on their publications for professional recognition and career progression. In contrast, trade authors predominantly financed their work through book sales and media placements. The migration of scholarly journals and books to online platforms, coupled with the adoption of institutional licenses by libraries, facilitated broader access within university communities. Furthermore, the emergence of open access repositories contributed to the increasing availability of scholarly literature, with nearly a third of research journal articles freely accessible by 2017, and a growing albeit smaller proportion of scholarly books following suit (Piwowar et al., 2018).
These advancements have introduced a financial conflict into the distribution of course readings. A study conducted in 2013 by one of the authors of this paper revealed that 45.1 percent of the readings purchased by students in course-packs at Stanford University and Queenâ€™s University were already freely accessible through their respective libraries and open access (Evans and Willinsky, 2013). Similarly, a 2017 study of 12 University of Toronto courses highlighted the issue of "double-charging" students, with 55 percent of assigned readings already licensed by the library and available electronically (Cancilla, Glushko, Orfano & Slaght, 2017). Essentially, students are paying for course readings that the library had already acquired through a campus-wide license funded by their tuition fees. Our study offers a comprehensive update on this matter, analyzing 3,391 Canadian university syllabuses from 34 institutions to showcase the prevalence of double-charging, potentially affecting over 90 percent of assigned readings. By differentiating between academic and trade publications, the study suggests a fair resolution for all parties through a "three-step syllabus rule." Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights for ongoing lawsuits in Canada and the United States concerning universities' management of course readings.
In 2013, Access Copyright filed a lawsuit against York University for its failure to pay the Copyright Board of Canada approved tariff, which covered the extensive copying activities at York from 2011 to 2013. Access Copyright, a not-for-profit collective representing 11,000 Canadian writers, visual artists, and publishers, negotiates agreements with various entities, including universities and provincial ministries of education, to manage royalty payments for course materials. The Copyright Board of Canada has sanctioned an Interim Rate for an annual Access Copyright tariff amounting to $14.31 per university student. However, due to ongoing uncertainties surrounding the application of fair dealing in education, a quarter of Canada's 96 universities have opted not to pay Access Copyright's tariff. In response to the 2013 lawsuit, York University argued that its employees had adhered to the university's guidelines on the "fair dealing" exception outlined in Canada's Copyright Act. York's guidelines stipulate that a single copy of a short excerpt from a copyright-protected work may be distributed to each student enrolled in a class or course. In 2017, the federal court ruled against York, deeming the Interim Tariff mandatory and the university's Fair Dealing Guidelines as unfair, citing their negative impact on the market. However, in 2020, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned this decision, stating that the tariff is not mandatory and that the Copyright Board of Canada's tariff-setting process aims to prevent excessive pricing rather than enforce mandatory payments. The appeal court also upheld the previous ruling that York's Guidelines did not guarantee that copying activities qualified as fair dealing. The case is now set to be heard by the Supreme Court of Canada.
In 2019, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in Canada released its Statutory Review of the Copyright Act Report, which contained a recommendation that partly inspired this study. The committee suggested that a review of the implementation of educational fair dealing in the Canadian educational sector should be resumed within three years, based on new and authoritative information and legal developments (Ruimy, 2019). This study aims to offer fresh and authoritative insights into the realm of educational fair dealing, which could impact previous court decisions and potentially shape future ones, as well as influence the Copyright Act. It delves into the distinctions between scholarly and trade publishing, both old and new, and how these distinctions could play a role in determining the appropriate compensation for individuals involved in student interactions with these types of literature in university courses.
Utilizing web-scraping techniques to target course syllabi across Canadian universities, a total of 5,898 documents were gathered from universities in nine out of the ten provinces in Canada (refer to Table 1). Among these, 3,916 were identified as unique syllabi spanning the years 2015 to 2020. After excluding 525 syllabi that made reference to assigned readings without specifying them (presumably available in coursepacks or online), a total of 3,391 syllabi remained. Within this subset, 2,800 syllabi included listings of required readings and/or textbooks, while 591 syllabi did not mandate any specific materials but occasionally suggested optional or recommended resources for students.
These syllabuses were sourced from 34 out of Canada's 96 universities, spanning nine provinces excluding Prince Edward Island. The distribution of syllabuses varied, with Western University contributing the highest number at 386 (11.4% of the total) and Kwantlen Polytechnic University providing only two (0.1%). On average, each university contributed approximately 99.7 syllabuses. Out of the total 3,391 syllabuses, 86.3% (2,926) were in English and 13.7% (465) were in French. Science courses comprised 42.6% (1,443) of the syllabuses, social sciences 37.1% (1,258), and humanities 20.3% (690). The distinction between graduate and undergraduate syllabuses was not made, as the Access Copyright tariff applies to all university students. While data on the total number of courses taught annually in Canada was unavailable, assuming roughly 1.3 million full-time university students taking 8.2 courses per year in classes averaging 25 students nationwide, this sample of 3,391 syllabuses represents less than 0.9% of the courses offered annually between 2015-2020 (Postsecondary enrollments, 2018).
In this study, a manual count was conducted on the "assigned" or "required" course readings listed on the syllabi, excluding any "optional" or "supplementary" readings. Seventeen undergraduate students, some of whom had proficiency in French, were selected and trained to classify the assigned readings on the syllabi (excluding textbooks and complete assigned books) into four distinct types of readings as outlined in the students' training materials.
In the syllabus bibliography entry, journal articles should be identified by the publication name along with the volume and issue number.
Academic book chapters can be discerned by the scholarly nature of the book title, the inclusion of prominent academic publishers, and the presence of university presses.
Media articles were identified by the title of the non-academic publication, unless the media outlet was already known, and a screen-full was utilized for the "page count."
Trade book chapters and book excerpts were distinguished by their non-academic titles and publishers, as opposed to the academic publishers.
Furthermore, students were tasked with identifying textbooks, for which training was also offered. It is important to note that textbooks allocated to students, along with trade books in general, do not fall under the category of "assigned readings" for the scope of this study. This distinction is made due to the fact that students acquire these materials independently, compensating the authors and publishers directly, as opposed to through an Access Copyright tariff as is the case with assigned readings.
Prior to commencement, students were required to achieve a minimum score of 80 percent on a test comprising syllabuses, which were evaluated based on the reading types by the principal investigator. Subsequently, students were tasked with cross-verifying a subset (ranging from 5 to 20) of their peers' scored syllabuses, with any discrepancies being resolved by a third student (who had demonstrated consistent cross-verification scores), while the principal investigator intervened when necessary. In cases where scoring inconsistencies arose, a select group of proficient students were assigned the responsibility of re-analyzing the data. Furthermore, students documented the page numbers of a subset of readings that included page-number information (refer to Table 2). These page counts were aggregated and then divided by the number of readings sampled to calculate an average pages-per-reading for each reading type.
Approximately 27.2 percent (923) of the syllabuses included in the study incorporated assigned readings as part of the coursework, with the focus of the court case mentioned earlier revolving around the payment for these materials. Among the various types of readings analyzed, journal articles constituted the largest category, with 7,961 articles assigned across 707 syllabuses, accounting for 20.8% of all syllabuses. On average, syllabuses featuring research articles assigned 11.3 articles. This effort signifies a noteworthy pedagogical approach aimed at involving students in the primary works of prominent scholars in a significant portion of the courses examined. Scholarly book chapters, totaling 4,906, were present on a comparable number of syllabuses (702, 20.7%) as journal articles, albeit in smaller quantities, with an average of 7.0 scholarly book chapters assigned on syllabuses featuring such materials.
Non-academic readings were found to be less prevalent in the study. For instance, out of the 873 media pieces analyzed, they appeared on 194 syllabuses, accounting for 5.7% of all syllabuses, with an average cluster size of 4.5 items. Similarly, the 918 trade book chapters were distributed across 148 syllabuses, making up 4.4% of the total, with an average of 6.2 chapters per syllabus. The data revealed a significant overlap in reading types, evident when comparing the total number of syllabuses with readings (923) to the number of syllabuses for each type. This indicates that the majority of syllabuses included more than one type of reading material.
In terms of the distribution of reading types across the three academic areas under consideration, it was observed that syllabuses in the social sciences predominantly assigned journal articles, totaling 5,264 on 457 syllabuses (36.3%). This was followed by the humanities, which assigned 1,656 journal articles across 165 syllabuses (23.9%), with science lagging significantly behind, assigning only 1,041 such readings across 86 syllabuses (5.9%) as depicted in Table 4. Furthermore, the social sciences exhibited a higher number of scholarly book chapters and media articles compared to the other two areas, both in relative and absolute terms. Conversely, the humanities syllabuses excelled in trade-book chapters, with 570 assigned across 64 syllabuses (9.3%).
The variations in reading assignments across the three disciplines impact the assumptions regarding the implementation of a uniform tariff on all students, a topic we will revisit in the subsequent discussion. Additionally, it is essential to contemplate the pedagogical consequences stemming from the infrequent use of journal articles in scientific disciplines. This scarcity results in students having less direct engagement with current research compared to their counterparts in the social sciences and humanities.
Although textbooks are not the primary focus of this analysis, it is important to highlight that the majority of courses in our sample, amounting to 66.0 percent (2,238 syllabuses), had an assigned textbook (Table 5). This figure surpasses the number of syllabuses with assigned readings, which stood at 27.2% (923 syllabuses) (Table 3.a). The distribution of textbooks across the three subject areas was relatively consistent, with 69.3% of science syllabuses, 60.0% of social sciences syllabuses, and 70.0% of humanities syllabuses requiring a textbook. Given the prevalence of textbooks in courses, it is noteworthy that the steady price increases observed over the past few decades have stabilized in recent years, partly due to initiatives promoting open textbooks (e.g., Open Stax, Flatearth), which exemplify the digital transformations specific to academic publishing (Fox, 2020; Jhangiani, 2018).
There is a degree of overlap observed between textbooks and required readings in syllabi, with 361 instances (10.6 percent of all syllabi) necessitating students to acquire a textbook alongside listing at least one mandatory reading. Notably, in cases where an entire trade book (e.g., a novel, play, or nonfiction work) was designated as essential reading on a syllabus rather than specific chapters or excerpts, it was excluded from our calculations. This exclusion stems from the fact that when students purchase a trade book, the publishers and authors receive compensation through that transaction, thereby obviating the need for them to be factored into tariff calculations for assigned readings.
In order to estimate the costs associated with the course readings outlined in the syllabuses, the average page count for each type of reading was calculated (refer to Table 6). This calculation revealed that, on average, students were assigned 82.6 pages per syllabus for all readings. Considering that students typically take 8.2 courses per year, the total assigned readings amount to 677.6 pages annually. When factoring in the Access Copyright annual tariff, which stands at $14.31 per student as approved by the Copyright Board of Canada, the cost per page for the assigned readings across all types comes to $0.021.
A page rate of $0.021 can be evenly divided among authors, publishers, and Access Copyright at $0.007 per page for each party. This $0.007 per page aligns with what authors typically earn from a paperback sale in a bookstore and corresponds to Access Copyright's 35 percent charge for "administrative holdback" as per the Publisher Distribution Guidelines (2020). This rate slightly undercuts the more common 60/40 split between publishers and authors under Access Copyright, although these calculations are subject to scrutiny, as noted by Geist (2008).
Determining a fair price for the use of published materials in Canadian university courses involves several considerations. Primarily, it is crucial to recognize that journal articles and scholarly book chapters, constituting 90.1 percent of assigned pages to students, operate within a distinct scholarly publishing economy separate from trade publishing. This distinction necessitates an alternative approach to handling university course readings, as highlighted by the 2020 Federal Court of Appeal ruling on York v. Access Copyright. The ruling emphasized the need for a more robust justification for fair dealing claims in educational contexts. We advocate for a nuanced approach that acknowledges the differences between scholarly and trade publishing economies, requiring conventions and standards for assigning reading materials. To address this, we propose a "three-step syllabus rule" to ensure fair treatment of assigned readings, detailed in the appendix for technical clarity.
The first step involves checking the university's library holdings and open access resources. An artificial intelligence system would analyze the syllabuses of the university to identify which assigned readings are available to students through institutional licenses and open access. Any materials that the university does not currently have licensed would be considered as recommendations for acquisition. This ongoing process of acquiring academic resources requested by instructors sets the stage for the subsequent step. Non-academic readings lacking institutional licenses would then proceed to the third step for further processing.
Limiting fair dealing is the second crucial step in this approach, focusing on scholarly readings that are not readily accessible to students through the initial step. In this context, a strategic and restricted utilization of the fair dealing exception within the Copyright Act is employed. The justification for this fair use lies in the fact that any potential negative impact on publishers is counterbalanced by the significant reputational advantages authors gain from having their work included in university curricula. This symbiotic relationship between authors and publishers results in authors benefiting substantially in terms of career advancement, surpassing any financial gains from royalty payments and ultimately leading to increased sales for publishers. Even in cases where authors have relinquished their copyright, the Copyright Act acknowledges their moral rights, particularly concerning the safeguarding of their "honour or reputation" (28.2, 1), which is particularly relevant in this scenario. This recourse to fair dealing, exclusive to academic readings not encompassed in the initial step, is further reinforced by the subsequent final step.
In the context of dealing fairly with professional writers, the third step pertains to media articles and trade book chapters, including poetry, that are not institutionally licensed. These works are predominantly crafted by professional writers and their publishers, who we believe should receive royalties. University faculty assign these materials because they are crucial for achieving their instructional objectives and those of their institutions. If academic authors benefit from enhanced reputation, it follows that professional authors equally deserve recognition, rather than being subjected to a blanket exception for the vast Canadian student market, which raises concerns about potential financial and existential impacts, as discussed further below.
In accordance with the proposed three-step method for royalty payments, we suggest that Access Copyright's approved tariff of $14.31 per student should be prorated to exclusively cover media articles and trade book chapters by professional writers, as outlined in step #3. On average, students are assigned 15.4 pages of professional writings per syllabus (refer to Table 7). Given the current rate of $0.021 per page set by Access Copyright, this equates to $0.171 per syllabus for students' utilization of professional writings in media articles and trade book chapters. Considering that students typically enroll in an average of 8.2 courses annually, the $0.171 per syllabus translates to an annual fee of $1.40 per student, based on our analysis of 3,391 syllabuses from 2015 to 2020.
This will ensure that professional writers receive a fair compensation for their work in university classes, comparable to what they earn from bookstore sales. It could be argued that social sciences and humanities majors, who are often assigned more media pieces and trade book chapters than science courses, should be charged a higher fee. Another approach could involve billing students based on the readings assigned in their courses. Currently, the focus is on establishing a general tariff payable to Access Copyright by all students, with $1.40 per student seeming justified based on our syllabus analysis. This approach aims to prevent double-charging students for access to academic works. In total, approximately 1.2 million full-time university students in Canada, or their institutions, would be required to contribute $1,769,888 annually to Access Copyright for the readings assigned to them under this proposed scheme.
If the amounts in question appear to be de minimis in a legal context and therefore not deemed worthy of pursuit, we align ourselves with the sentiments expressed by the "many poets" in Eli MacLaren's examination of Canadian poets' earnings, where royalty payments were found to constitute a mere two percent of their income, yet these poets still acknowledged the significance that even a small amount of money carries (MacLaren, 2017, p. 20). Our three-step syllabus guideline not only validates poets but also acknowledges the contributions of academics. While there is potential for the annual fee of $1.40 per student to increase gradually, it starkly contrasts with the current request of $26.00 per student that Access Copyright is seeking from the Canadian Copyright Board at the time of writing (Copyright Board, 2017).
This examination of Canadian university syllabi highlights the distribution of assigned readings across various publication types, with academic sources being predominant. While this analysis does not prescribe specific policy terms for fairly compensating content creators, it does offer a framework for evaluating policy effectiveness, as demonstrated by our proposed three-step syllabus guideline. This guideline aims to prevent students from being charged twice for materials they already have access to, while acknowledging the economic disparities between scholarly and trade publishing within academia. The prevalence of scholarly readings in these courses underscores the importance of distinguishing between these categories to determine equitable outcomes for students, authors, and publishers.
