There is a growing consensus that the pandemic has the potential to exacerbate pre-existing inequalities within the labor market, with a key concern being the unequal access to remote work opportunities. This research delves into the analysis of remote work disparities in Brazil through both descriptive assessments and Probit regressions utilizing PNAD COVID-19 microdata. The findings reveal that individuals with the least access to remote work options tended to be those who were economically disadvantaged, male, residing in rural areas, non-white, younger, lacking a college education, self-employed or working in the private sector or agriculture. A significant portion of these disparities can be attributed to variations in occupational selection, yet certain factors such as educational attainment and income levels retained notable independent effects. The pandemic has further widened these existing inequalities in terms of remote work feasibility, disproportionately benefiting wealthier, more educated, and formally employed individuals while forcing others to make difficult choices between employment and income security or potential exposure to contagion.
The first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Brazil occurred on February 26, 2020. By early April 2021, the country had surpassed 13 million confirmed cases and recorded over 330 thousand deaths (Brazil, 2021). This devastating pandemic struck as Brazil was slowly recovering from its most severe and prolonged economic downturn since the Second World War (Oreiro, 2017). In the second quarter of 2020, the Brazilian GDP plummeted by 9.7% compared to the previous quarter, marking the largest decline in the historical series that commenced in 1996 (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE/National Accounts, 2020).
The ongoing global pandemic has triggered the most significant economic upheaval since the Great Depression (Campello et al., 2020). Given the unprecedented nature of this health and economic crisis, there is a burgeoning body of literature dedicated to examining the impacts of Covid-19. Jonas (2013) highlights potential demand and supply shocks linked to pandemics: avoidance behaviors and social distancing measures can result in swift and substantial negative demand shocks and supply interruptions; the contagion itself incurs direct and indirect costs, such as reduced production due to worker fatalities and illnesses, as well as absenteeism stemming from the disease; and there are cascading effects when these factors interact.
The existing body of literature focusing on the socioeconomic impacts of Covid-19 has highlighted the significant influence of social distancing and lockdown protocols on various aspects such as labor market dynamics, mental health outcomes, overall well-being, racial disparities, and gender norms (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020; Brodeur et al., 2020; Campello et al., 2020; Montenovo et al., 2020).
Regarding the impact on the labor market, it is anticipated to be profound and enduring (Campello et al., 2020). A significant area of research in this domain has focused on the inequality stemming from the adverse effects of the Coronavirus pandemic. It is widely acknowledged that these effects are disparate and have the potential to exacerbate existing disparities (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020; Bartik et al., 2020; Brussevich et al., 2020; Crowley; Doran, 2020; Gallacher; Hossain, 2020; Gaudecker et al., 2020; Montenovo et al., 2020; Yasenov, 2020).
The findings from Adams-Prassl et al. (2020), Gallacher and Hossain (2020), Gaudecker et al. (2020), and Montenovo et al. (2020) regarding the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, and Netherlands collectively highlight that occupations necessitating interpersonal contact and lacking remote work options experienced more significant job losses. This trend was further exacerbated for individuals engaged in non-traditional labor arrangements and possessing lower levels of education, reflecting the diverse distribution of worker characteristics across various sectors.
The research delves into the challenges posed by jobs requiring face-to-face interactions amidst the backdrop of Covid-19 transmission dynamics and governmental directives on essential activities, prompting an exploration of the feasibility of remote work. Noteworthy contributions from Yasenov (2020), Gallacher and Hossain (2020), Crowley and Doran (2020), Brussevich et al. (2020), and Bartik et al. (2020) have scrutinized this issue across regions like the United States, Ireland, Canada, and OECD countries. Predominantly, the focus has been on developed nations, as evidenced by studies by Balde et al. (2020), Estupinan et al. (2021), Gottlieb et al. (2021), and Khamis et al. (2021). While each study offers unique insights, a common thread emerges concerning the disparities in remote work accessibility based on factors such as income, age, education, gender, and employment terms, underscoring the limited opportunities for marginalized segments within the labor force.
The impact of the pandemic varies significantly among countries due to the numerous institutional differences present in labor markets (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020; Brussevich et al., 2020). Brussevich et al. (2020) highlight the heterogeneity in the feasibility of remote work across countries, which is influenced by varying levels of access to and utilization of technology, the sectoral distribution of the economy, and the selection within the labor market. There exists a strong correlation between the level of economic development and the capacity to work remotely. Therefore, the current study seeks to investigate the disparities in remote work specifically within the context of Brazil.
Research on Brazil has highlighted that job losses during the recent period have disproportionately affected informal workers, exacerbating inequities due to the higher representation of vulnerable groups in the informal sector, particularly in contact-intensive industries (Al Masri et al., 2021; Corseuil et al., 2021; Bridi, 2020). In terms of telecommuting feasibility, a study conducted by GÃ³es et al. (2021) delved into the characteristics of the remote workforce, revealing a predominant composition of formal-sector employees with advanced educational backgrounds, typically aged between 30 and 39, predominantly women, and white individuals.
Our study delves deeper into the issue by examining the demographic and occupational profiles of individuals who engaged in remote work in Brazil, while also assessing the disparities in the likelihood of remote work based on various sociodemographic and work-related factors. To achieve this, we utilized data from the PNAD COVID-19 survey conducted between May and August 2020. Our analysis involved both descriptive and econometric techniques, specifically employing Probit regressions to estimate the relationships between remote work and the identified variables.
Understanding the distribution of these impacts within the labor market is crucial for informing policy decisions. The significance of this analysis is underscored by the prevalence of informality and low-paid positions, as well as the precarious living conditions experienced by a substantial portion of the population prior to the pandemic. For instance, in the first quarter of 2020, 19% of Brazil's employed individuals were wage workers lacking formal contracts, while 21% were either employers or self-employed individuals without registration with the National Registry of Legal Entities (CNPJ). Additionally, data from 2018 revealed that 25.3% of the population earned incomes below the World Bank's suggested threshold of US$ 5.50 PPP per day to classify individuals as living in poverty in countries with medium-high income levels. These statistics highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions to address the vulnerabilities faced by a significant portion of the workforce and population.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the expanding body of literature on the impacts of Covid-19 on labor markets; Section 3 outlines our empirical model and the data sources employed; Section 4 presents the results and corresponding discussions. The concluding section encapsulates our final remarks.
The Covid-19 pandemic has sparked an unprecedented health and economic crisis, leading to a surge in literature dedicated to examining its multifaceted impacts. One prominent area of focus revolves around the repercussions on the labor market, with a flurry of research delving into the uneven effects of the negative shock induced by the Coronavirus outbreak. It is widely acknowledged that these effects are disparate and have the potential to exacerbate existing inequalities. Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) conducted a comprehensive analysis across the UK, US, and Germany, revealing that workers in non-traditional work arrangements and occupations with limited remote work capabilities, lower educational attainment, and women are more likely to experience reductions in working hours, job losses, and earnings declines. Similarly, findings by Montenovo et al. (2020) in the United States underscored that occupations reliant on interpersonal interactions, rendering remote work unfeasible, witnessed more significant job losses. Gallacher and Hossain (2020), focusing on the Canadian labor market, highlighted that individuals with limited opportunities for remote work faced the most severe job losses during the period between March and April.
In their analysis of data from the Netherlands, Gaudecker et al. (2020) discovered that the self-employed experienced a greater reduction in total hours worked compared to employees, as firms typically provide insurance against temporary shocks for their employees. Additionally, individuals with lower levels of education saw a more significant decrease in hours worked, as those with higher education often have the flexibility to work more hours from home. The authors categorized economic sectors into two distinct clusters: one characterized by office occupations with a high proportion of academics, increased hours worked from home, and a lower presence of "essential" workers; and another cluster where manual tasks and social interactions are prevalent, academic participation is low, hours worked from home are minimal, and there is a higher representation of "essential" workers (Gaudecker et al., 2020).
The aforementioned results underscore a pivotal inquiry: the feasibility of conducting various forms of work remotely. Scholars such as Yasenov (2020), Gallacher and Hossain (2020), Crowley and Doran (2020), Brussevich et al. (2020), and Bartik et al. (2020) have specifically delved into this particular concern.
Yasenov (2020) conducted an analysis of the US labor market, revealing that lower-paid workers are significantly less likely, up to three times, to have the option to work remotely. This limitation disproportionately affects individuals with lower levels of education, younger workers, ethnic minorities, and immigrants, making remote work less feasible for these groups. Building on this, Bartik et al. (2020) further support these findings by demonstrating that remote work is more prevalent in industries with higher-educated and higher-paid employees within the United States.
In a study conducted by Gallacher and Hossain (2020) in Canada, it was revealed that 41% of the nation's workforce had the potential to work remotely. The research highlighted that individuals with a lower likelihood of remote work tended to be characterized as poorer, younger, non-immigrant, single, male, and lacking a college education. These individuals were typically employed in the private sector, small firms, and held positions that were seasonal, contractual, or part-time in nature.
Brussevich et al. (2020) conducted an analysis on the feasibility of working from home in OECD countries. Their findings indicate that the ongoing pandemic has the potential to worsen existing inequalities, as individuals who are less likely to work remotely are typically younger, less educated, have atypical employment contracts, work in smaller companies, or are situated at the lower end of the income distribution.
In their study on Ireland, Crowley and Doran (2020) conducted a comparable analysis, revealing a significant disparity in social distancing and remote work feasibility among different occupations and industries. Their findings indicated that individuals in more affluent, larger, and densely populated cities, with higher levels of education and access to superior broadband services, were more likely to have opportunities for remote work.
The existing literature on this subject underscores that workers in roles that cannot be performed remotely face higher probabilities of experiencing reduced work hours, earnings, and job losses. Additionally, it emphasizes significant disparities in the likelihood of being able to work remotely.
The majority of studies have primarily examined the conditions in developed nations. However, Gottlieb et al. (2021) conducted a study focusing on developing countries, specifically Armenia, Bolivia, China, Colombia, Georgia, Ghana, Kenya, Laos, Macedonia, and Vietnam, to assess the feasibility of working from home (WFH). Their findings indicate that the capacity for WFH is generally limited in these nations and is closely linked to per capita income. Moreover, they observed significant variations both between and within occupations, as well as among different worker demographics, with marginalized groups being less inclined to engage in remote work.
In their study, Khamis et al. (2021) utilized high-frequency phone surveys to evaluate the initial impacts of Covid-19 on the labor market in diverse developing nations. Their findings revealed that 34% of participants ceased working, with varying rates observed across regions: 21% in East Asia and the Pacific, 29% in Europe and Central Asia, 48% in the Latin America and the Caribbean region (LAC), 45% in the Middle East and North Africa region, and 26% in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. Specifically within the LAC region, 30% discontinued work in Chile and 36% in Costa Rica, while 59% in Peru and 69% in Bolivia stopped working. The study also highlighted that individuals were more inclined to halt work in the services sector (38%) and industry (40%) compared to agriculture (22%).
Balde et al. (2020) discovered that informal workers in sub-Saharan Africa were at a higher risk of job loss or reduced earnings. Similarly, Estupinan et al. (2021) identified that individuals employed in non-essential industries in India, particularly those unable to work remotely, were significantly impacted by the economic repercussions of the pandemic.
In Brazil, the impact of job losses was particularly severe. Between the quarters spanning January to March and April to June 2020, there was a significant decline of 8.9 million individuals or 9.6% in the employed population, marking the lowest level in the historical series (IBGE/PNADC, 2020). In May, out of the employed population of 84.4 million, 15.7 million individuals or 18.6% were absent from work due to social distancing measures; by June, this number decreased to 11.8 million (14.2%), followed by 6.8 million (8.3%) in July, and 4.1 million (5.0%) in August.
The scientific and technical literature concerning the impacts of Covid-19 in Brazil experienced rapid growth in late 2020 and early 2021, encompassing various perspectives. One of the initial studies relevant to this analysis was conducted by Mattei and Heinen (2020), utilizing data from February to April 2020. Their findings indicated that the first individuals affected by job loss or job infeasibility due to the pandemic were the underemployed, typically engaged in more flexible occupations.
Bridi (2020) concluded that job losses in Brazil during the second quarter of 2020 were notably higher for informal workers, whether comparing salaried employees with and without formal contracts or entrepreneurs with or without CNPJ. Corseuil et al. (2021) also highlighted the intensified impact of the current crisis on informal occupations, revealing that more vulnerable worker groups are disproportionately represented in the informal sector, leading to significant negative implications for equity. Al Masri et al. (2021) further identified that the most substantial declines in employment were observed among informal, self-employed, and younger workers in the second and third quarters of 2020. They noted a decrease in workforce outflow for men by the third quarter, contrasting with a continued increase for women. Additionally, industries with higher levels of physical contact experienced the most significant job losses. Notably, none of these studies specifically delved into remote work and its influencing factors.
In the realm of research concerning telework feasibility in Brazil, notable contributions come from the reports crafted by researchers affiliated with the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA). Drawing on data spanning from May to November 2020, GÃ³es et al. (2021) discovered that the demographic makeup of the "remote workforce" primarily consisted of individuals employed in the formal sector, possessing a full college education, aged between 30 and 39 years, predominantly women, and of Caucasian descent. These findings underscore the significance of considering the proportional representation of each demographic group within the workforce.
Since 1967, the IBGE has consistently conducted comprehensive research on various aspects of the population, education, labor, income, and housing in Brazil through the implementation of the National Household Sample Surveys (PNADs). In 2016, the PNAD evolved into the Continuous PNAD, a quarterly survey designed to track changes in the labor force and overall socioeconomic metrics.
In response to the pandemic, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) conducted a supplementary survey known as PNAD COVID-19, commencing on May 4, 2020. This data collection initiative involved telephone interviews with approximately 193,000 households nationwide. The survey questionnaire was divided into two sections, one focusing on health-related inquiries and the other addressing labor-related concerns.
We utilized monthly PNAD COVID-19 microdata spanning from May to August 2020. To ensure the relevance of our analysis, we specifically included individuals aged between 16 and 65 who were actively employed and not enrolled in any educational institution, aiming to mitigate potential conflicts between work and study commitments. The filters applied to the initial sample and the resulting final sample are detailed in Table 1. Our focal variable, 'worked-from-home,' was assigned a value of 1 for respondents who confirmed engaging in remote work when asked, "Last week, were you in remote work?" Conversely, a value of 0 was assigned to those who reported no change in their work routine activities. The final dataset comprised 419,840 responses, with 46,261 individuals (11.02%) indicating that they were indeed working from home.
Initially, we utilized graphical and Kernel density analyses to examine the work-from-home situation across various socioeconomic, demographic, and work-related factors outlined in Table 2. For a detailed overview of descriptive statistics, please refer to Table A1.
In our empirical model, we employed Probit models to estimate the conditional probability of individuals working from home (ð¦ð= 1|ðð) based on various observable characteristics. This choice was made because OLS regressions do not account for the discrete nature of the dependent variable, and they do not impose constraints on probabilities falling within the range of zero to one. Following the approach outlined by Cameron and Trivedi (2005), the Probit model defines the probability (ðð) as 0 < ðð< 1, as shown in equation (1): <>. Here, Î¦ represents the cumulative distribution function for the standard normal, and ð¥ð denotes the vector of covariates detailed in Table 2. The Probit model's marginal effects can be expressed as (2): <>.
Estimates were derived using Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE), which are consistent through the optimization of first-order conditions as outlined in <>
The selection of variables in Table 2 aligns with the primary objective of our study, which aims to examine disparities in the likelihood of remote work based on various socioeconomic and work-related characteristics. These variables were chosen based on two main criteria: i) established literature such as Mincer (1962) for labor force participation decisions, Heckman (1974) for shadow prices and market wages, and Mincer (1974) and Willis (1986) for earnings functions; and ii) recent empirical research on labor market dynamics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, including studies by Bridi (2020), Mattei and Heinen (2020), Pouliakas (2020), Yasenov (2020), Al Masri et al. (2021), Corseuil et al. (2021), and GÃ³es et al. (2021).
To elucidate our findings, we calculated the marginal effects of a regressor's change on the conditional probability of ð¦= 1 using the means of the variables. Additionally, our Probit models' outcomes were adjusted to incorporate the sample weights of the PNAD COVID-19 dataset.
Based on data sourced from PNAD COVID-19, the proportion of individuals who were employed and actively working remotely within the employed and active population, excluding those on leave, stood at 13.3% in May. This figure subsequently declined to 12.7% in June, further dropping to 11.7% in July, and eventually reaching 11.1% in August. In terms of absolute figures, the count of remote workers in Brazil amounted to 8.7 million in May, which then decreased to 8.4 million by August.
The pandemic necessitated the implementation of various remote work arrangements for a significant portion of the workforce in Brazil, with the feasibility of continued employment in such conditions being contingent upon the nature of one's occupation. Consequently, the examination of outcomes commences with a delineation of the tasks carried out in the workplace, as this factor plays a pivotal role in determining the feasibility of remote work. Illustrated in Figure 1 are the proportions of individuals engaged in telecommuting across different categories of job types, positions, and functions.
The disparity between the upper and lower values of the shares, as depicted in Figure 1, is striking. Among the various categories examined, kindergarten, elementary, and high school teachers, along with college professors, exhibited the highest proportion of remote work, averaging close to 80% over the specified period. This particular category also demonstrated considerable potential for remote work, a finding that aligns with the results of a study conducted by Crowley and Doran (2020) in Ireland.
With over 40% participation in remote work, various professionals including pedagogues, teachers in languages, arts, and music, as well as individuals with higher education backgrounds like lawyers, engineers, accountants, and journalists were involved. These categories align closely with the broader sector characterized by high levels of remote work hours, as outlined by Gaudecker et al. (2020), which primarily consists of individuals with higher education qualifications and office-based occupations.
At the other end of the spectrum, occupations that are not conducive to remote work include domestic workers, daily cleaners, cooks in households, agriculture assistants, farmers, animal breeders, delivery bikers, truck drivers, janitors, bricklayers, painters, electricians, joiners, machine operators, production assistants, bakers, butchers, confectioners, vehicle mechanics, and drivers, among others. These roles involve tasks that are inherently incompatible with remote work due to their hands-on nature and physical requirements.
The disparity in the capacity to work remotely across various job types, roles, and functions highlights concerns regarding inequality, stemming from the systematic disparities among these categories in terms of the inclusion of socially vulnerable worker groups. Initial findings from Figure 1 indicate that individuals with lower incomes were confronted with the challenging trade-off between employment and health risks, whereas those with higher incomes were more inclined to opt for remote work. To delve deeper into this observation, we introduce Figure 2, which illustrates the proportion of remote work across different income brackets.
Figure 2 exhibits a clear and easily discernible monotonic trend. The proportion of employees engaged in remote work experiences a notable surge, particularly beyond the 60th percentile, and accelerates even further past the 80th percentile. Consequently, the repercussions of the pandemic have exacerbated the prevailing disparities within the Brazilian labor landscape, as individuals with higher income levels were disproportionately more inclined to possess the privilege of working remotely.
Similar findings were reported by Yasenov (2020) in the context of the United States and by Gallacher and Hossain (2020) in their analysis of Canada. This trend is further supported when comparing across different countries. Brussevich et al. (2020) examined OECD countries, while Gottlieb et al. (2021) focused on a diverse range of developing nations, both concluding that a significant correlation exists between economic development levels, per capita income, and the capacity for remote work.
The labor market comprises a diverse array of workers with varying general characteristics, whether observable or not. Workers belonging to different demographic categories or sub-populations are sorted into various jobs within sectors and occupations in a differential manner. It is likely that the disparities in observed probabilities are indicative of broader sociodemographic inequalities present in the labor market.
To investigate this matter, Erro! Fonte de referÃªncia nÃ£o encontrada. examines the distribution of remote workers based on gender, race, educational attainment, residential setting (urban/rural), employment status, age, and industry sector. The proportions of individuals working from home are computed for each of these demographic and occupational categories.
Research findings indicate that remote work participation rates are notably higher among women (15.88%), white individuals (14.26%), non-young workers, urban residents (12.95%), and those employed in the service sector (16.8%). Conversely, remote work participation rates are lower among men (7.56%), non-white individuals (8.14%), younger workers, and employees in agriculture (1.37%), industry (3.9%), and retail (4.53%) sectors, as illustrated in Figure 3.
The gender results align closely with previous studies by Yasenov (2020), Gallacher and Hossain (2020), and Brussevich et al. (2020), while the findings on race are in agreement with Yasenov's (2020) research. In terms of age, a significant difference in participation was observed only among individuals aged 16 to 19 years. The consensus in the literature supports the notion that young workers exhibit lower engagement in remote work, as evidenced by studies conducted by Brussevich et al. (2020), Gallacher and Hossain (2020), and Yasenov (2020).
In terms of economic sectors, the findings from Crowley and Doran (2020) regarding Ireland indicate that industries such as agriculture/forestry/fishing, construction, transportation and storage, and mining and quarrying have limited potential for remote work. In these sectors, workers are faced with the dilemma of either halting production or assuming the health risks associated with continuing operations, as remote work is not a viable option (Bartik et al., 2020).
While the differences in remote work participation based on various factors are noteworthy, they are not as significant as those observed in relation to employment statuses and schooling levels. For instance, there is a substantial gap in participation rates between public sector employees at 34.58% and self-employed individuals at 5.15%. Similarly, the variance in participation rates based on schooling levels is striking, with only 0.45% of individuals without formal education engaging in remote work compared to 34.38% of those with a college education. It is evident that the attainment of higher education plays a pivotal role in significantly increasing participation in remote work opportunities.
The consensus among studies, including Bartik et al. (2020), Gallacher and Hossain (2020), and Yasenov (2020), is that more educated workers exhibit a higher capacity for remote work. In the context of Brazil, GÃ³es et al. (2021) discovered that over 70% of remote workers had completed college education. Bartik et al. (2020) highlighted that the presence of highly educated workers in an industry is a strong predictor of remote work feasibility, comparable to Dingel and Neiman's (2020) influential measure. This underscores the robust association between education level and remote work capability. Yasenov's (2020) findings for the US and Gallacher and Hossain's (2020) results for Canada further emphasize the pivotal role of college education in determining remote work potential.
In terms of employment status, a notable disparity emerges within the public sector. Consequently, the disparities in engagement with remote work among salaried employees in the formal and informal sectors appear to primarily mirror the distinction between the public and private sectors, with the public sector being disproportionately represented in the "formal" sector. Within the private sector, the variance in remote work involvement between individuals with formal contracts (9.52%) and those without (8.42%) was marginal.
It is crucial to emphasize that job losses in Brazil were notably more pronounced for employees lacking a formal contract. As per Bridi (2020), the private sector witnessed a decline of 8.9% in the number of workers with formal contracts and a substantial 21.6% decrease among those without formal contracts between the first and second quarters of 2020. Interestingly, among informal workers who managed to retain their jobs, the engagement in remote work closely mirrored that of the formal private sector, as depicted in Figure 3.
The results presented thus far regarding the various attributes of workers are likely significantly influenced by the sectoral and occupational composition of the workforce. Our latest analysis aims to evaluate whether there exist any independent effects of these attributes on the likelihood of remote work, while accounting for factors such as the nature of work, position, or function.
The analysis involves estimating Probit models of remote work, with the results presented in Table 3 as marginal effects for conditional probabilities. In column (1), the model was initially estimated without controls for federation units, months, and the 36 categories of labor activities. Subsequently, columns (2) to (4) sequentially incorporate fixed effects for these variables, with column (4) representing the model controlling all fixed effects. Probit estimates can be found in Table A2.
The initial noteworthy finding pertains to the substantial reduction in coefficients upon the inclusion of Types of work F. E., or fixed effects for labor activities, as evidenced in column (4). This outcome underscores the significance of the composition effect in the labor force participation rate across various labor activities, which plays a substantial role in explaining the disparities in the likelihood of engaging in remote work.
In this particular context, a notable aspect of interest pertains to the substantial decrease in the public-sector impact when considering the various types of work. The descriptive analysis reveals a noteworthy disparity in the engagement of remote work among public sector employees compared to individuals in other employment categories. Further examination, as depicted in Table 3 by comparing columns 3 and 4, indicates that this discrepancy stems from a compositional effect, likely influenced by the prevalent types of tasks within the public sector. Additionally, when examining employment statuses, the case of self-employed workers emerges as distinctive, displaying a reduced likelihood of engaging in remote work in comparison to salaried employees lacking a formal contract, even after accounting for observable characteristics.
A surprising finding emerged when examining private sector workers with formal contracts, revealing that they were 0.98 percentage points less inclined to engage in remote work compared to their counterparts without formal contracts. This unexpected trend, observed after accounting for fixed effects related to different types of work, suggests that the increased propensity for remote work among formalized employees is influenced by a composition effect. Existing literature on informality within the labor market during the Covid-19 era underscores two key points: firstly, the heightened vulnerability of informal jobs, leading to relatively greater losses (Balde et al., 2020; Bridi, 2020); and secondly, the limited potential for remote work in informal sectors due to the prevalence of physically demanding, manual, and contact-intensive tasks (Hatayama et al., 2020; Garrote Sanchez et al., 2021). Upon incorporating Types of work Fixed Effects, our study reveals a marginal decrease in the likelihood of remote work associated with having a formal contract.
In column (4), the positive impact of hourly earnings on the likelihood of remote work persisted, suggesting that higher income correlates with a higher probability of working from home for similar workers. Notably, the most significant effect in the column (4) model was attributed to college education. Individuals with a college education experience an 11.78 percentage point increase in the likelihood of engaging in remote work compared to those without formal education. However, this effect diminishes by almost half when adjusting for labor activities, implying that the higher prevalence of remote work among educated workers may also be influenced by occupational choices in the labor market. Gaudecker et al. (2020) suggest that the enduring significance of education, even after accounting for income, underscores that the feasibility of remote work is primarily shaped by task compositions rather than the availability of home office resources.
As highlighted by Gottlieb et al. (2021), the finding that individuals with higher levels of education and salaried positions (excluding self-employed individuals or employers) exhibit a greater tendency to work remotely, even when accounting for specific job characteristics, suggests that the inclination towards remote work differs across various occupations. Moreover, this trend also underscores significant diversity within these occupational categories.
The models suggest that the likelihood of engaging in remote work is higher for individuals aged 16 to 19, except when compared to those aged 60 to 65. Despite the marginal effects associated with age being relatively small, this finding is significant as it appears to contradict the trends observed in Figure 3. When all other observable characteristics are held constant (Table 3), younger workers exhibit a slightly higher propensity for remote work compared to their older counterparts. However, the actual participation of young workers in remote work is lower than that of other age groups when uncontrolled for other attributes (Figure 3). As highlighted in Yasenov (2020) and Gallacher and Hossain (2020), the diminished involvement of young workers in remote work, relative to their total population, likely stems from their concentration in occupations that are less conducive to remote work. Specifically, 41% of workers aged 16-19 are engaged in occupations such as store sales, farming, office clerical work, bricklaying, and production assistance, all of which have minimal remote work opportunities (as depicted in Figure 1). Furthermore, only 1.2% of young workers are employed in the public sector. Therefore, the findings in Figure 3 are more indicative of the occupational distribution of young workers rather than a direct age-related effect.
In terms of gender dynamics, the control over labor activities resulted in a decrease in the coefficient; nevertheless, an independent effect emerged showing that men are 2.19 percentage points less inclined to engage in remote work compared to women. Brussevich et al. (2020) also observed that, on average, men exhibit lower participation in work that can be conducted remotely compared to women, primarily due to disparities in occupational and sectoral choices between male and female workers. Despite this, the negative independent effect for men may indicate that in Brazil, the gendered division of domestic responsibilities, such as family care and child rearing, predominantly impacts women. According to Duarte and Spinelli (2019), in 2017, women spent approximately 20.9 hours per week on domestic tasks and caregiving, while men devoted 10.8 hours, with women shouldering a greater burden of household duties irrespective of their educational attainment.
The aim of this study was to examine the demographic and occupational profiles of individuals engaged in remote work in Brazil, as well as to assess the disparities in the likelihood of working remotely based on various sociodemographic and employment-related factors. To achieve this, we employed descriptive graphical representations, Kernel density analyses, and Probit regressions utilizing microdata from the PNAD COVID-19 survey.
The findings from the descriptive analysis revealed that during the period spanning from May to August 2020, the demographic subgroups with the lowest rates of engagement in remote work, relative to their respective subgroups, were individuals belonging to lower income brackets, males, rural inhabitants, non-white individuals, the youngest age bracket (16 to 19 years old), those lacking a college education, self-employed or salaried workers in the private sector, and individuals employed in the agricultural sector.
The research findings revealed a notable trend of increased participation in remote work among individuals with a complete college education and those employed in the public sector, showcasing a substantial disparity when compared to individuals with different levels of education and employment statuses. Additionally, a clear and consistent correlation was observed between engagement in remote work and labor income, with a sharp rise in remote work participation evident beyond the 60th percentile and accelerating even further beyond the 80th percentile.
The empirical model's results indicate that a significant portion of the observed pattern in the descriptive analysis can be attributed to variations in the selection process for occupations and sectors. This is evident as nearly all coefficients experienced a notable decrease upon the inclusion of fixed effects related to the nature of work, position, or function. Particularly noteworthy was the substantial reduction in the public sector-effect, revealing that the apparent prevalence of remote work among public sector employees highlighted in the descriptive analysis is primarily a result of a composition effect or the specific types of tasks commonly found within the public sector.
Several variables retained significant independent effects even after adjusting for types of work fixed effects. Notably, college education, salaried employment (excluding self-employed or employers), and labor income were found to have positive impacts on the likelihood of engaging in remote work. This suggests that the inclination towards remote work differs not only across various occupations but also within them. Additionally, when all other factors are held constant, it was observed that younger individuals, females, and white workers exhibit a slightly higher tendency to work remotely.
The pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities in the labor market, particularly favoring wealthier, more educated, and more formalized workers in terms of remote work opportunities. This situation has forced others to make a difficult choice between employment and income or risking exposure to contagion. The study's findings underscore the importance for policymakers to take into account these disparities, as the lasting effects of the pandemic on the labor market are expected to persist even after economic activity resumes.
