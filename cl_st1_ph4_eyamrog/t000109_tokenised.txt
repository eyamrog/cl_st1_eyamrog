SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) ABSTRACT In this paper, an agent-based model that predicts a daily evolution of the number of people hospitalized in intensive care due to COVID-19 is presented, including results for 2020. In addition, the number of deaths, reported cases, asymptomatic individuals and other epidemiological variables of interest, discriminated by age range, are considered. The most relevant characteristics of the climate in Paraná city (Entre Ríos, Argentina), its social dynamics and public transportation are considered as inputs, taking also into account the different phases of isolation and social distancing. By means of a set of Hidden Markov Models, the system reproduces virus transmission associated with people’s mobility and activities in the city. Spread of the virus in the host is also simulated by following the stages of the disease, and by considering the existence of comorbidities and a proportion of asymptomatic infected people. By adjusting the model to match the data on hospitalizations in intensive care units and deaths due to COVID-19 in the city under study, the system can be operated to analyze the impact of isolation and social distancing measures on the population dynamics. In addition, it allows simulating combinations of characteristics leading to a potential collapse in the health system due to lack of infrastructure, as well as predicting the impact of social events or the increase in people’s mobility. Keywords: Agent based model, Hidden Markov model, COVID-19, epidemiology, georeferencing, virus transmission, virus spread.



SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) INTRODUCTION In March 2020, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that produced the COVID-19 outbreak infected more than 270,000 people all over the world and killed more than 11,300 [1]. The epidemiological analysis of the different outbreaks of this disease, which have been recorded worldwide, has helped develop different models, mainly mathematical, to track and anticipate the spread of epidemics [2][3][4][5]. It is within this context that the present work arises, with the aim to provide an alternative that allows including more factors of reality and to predict the impact of different social and health policies. According to current epidemiological reports, this pandemic has characteristics rarely seen for other infectious diseases [6]. Some of the particularities of COVID-19 are: its high basic reproduction number (R0) of up to 2.79 [7]; an asymptomatic infectious period of up to 14 days, in which there is a group of individuals with no symptom onsets and the disease can be detected only through a serological test; and a great variability in time and clinical repercussions [8]. It has been proven that the dynamics of this epidemic varies mainly according to the climate [9], social and health local habits [10] [11], comorbidities [12] and age range [13], among other variables. The multiplicity of factors influencing this pandemic requires a different approach, as it is necessary to focus on the formulation of more complex and realistic computational models, which include specific characteristics for each area under study, rather than on conventional models, mainly mathematical ones. Thus, this paper proposes a novel model that incorporates local aspects, such as social, cultural, geographical and climatological variables, linked to the epidemic under study and to its transmission modes. SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Much of the reported literature on modeling and simulation of epidemics, in particular COVID-19, proposes global models based on differential equations of SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) type or similar ones, with their different variants adapted to this disease [14][15]. However, the epidemic modeling community has been using local or fine-grained models [16], including agent-based models (ABM) [10][13][17][18], such as the one used in this work. These models allow greater expressiveness and control of different aspects of the epidemic, the inclusion of the randomness inherent in these systems, and the possibility of time-space monitoring of the simulation runs [10][11][19]. On the other hand, they require greater computational power and access to a large amount of local data in order to be adapted to particular situations. ABM are computational modeling and simulation methods used to study the organization and dynamics of complex systems. They consist of an artificial society integrated by autonomous and heterogeneous agents that interact in a non-trivial way with each other and with the environment, according to certain rules, forming a social architecture. The social aspect is given by the heterogeneity, autonomy, interdependence, and social embedding that characterize the computational agents [20]. To our knowledge, few models with this characteristics have been applied to COVID-19 [10][11][21][22][23]. Furthermore, most of these models have been designed for specific situations in some region or country and it is difficult to extrapolate them to new particular situations, as lot of scientific and technical knowledge is required for this purpose. This paper presents a novel model called Agent-based model for COVID-19 Simulation (AbCSim) that allows the modeling of the group of people with COVID- SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 19, either symptomatic or asymptomatic cases, together with those considered to be susceptible or recovered population [24]. This model takes into account the complexity of the dynamics of the pathology and the interpersonal relationships of the populations, along with geographical and climatological information relevant to the pandemic. In addition, it implements a host transmission block based on a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) [25][26][27], which reflect the main aspects of the mobility and social activities of the agents within the modelled geographical region. AbCSim runs on the computational simulation platform Repast [28] and is open source (via GitHub)1. The proposed model allows the simulation of the entire population, on an individual, one-by-one basis, at city scale (or larger). It was tailored for Paraná city, (Entre Ríos, Argentina)2 and tested under different situations to predict the local evolution of the epidemic. METHODS Proposed model: Agent-based COVID-19 Simulator (AbCSim) 1. Description and general scheme of the model Repast [29] is a platform with a set of open source modeling and simulation tools based on agents that runs on different operating systems. For each experiment or new scenario tested, a computer cluster is required to run several instances of the model simultaneously, which generates results based on central trends, given the stochastic nature of the phenomenon under study. This platform allows the implementation of agents’ characteristics, behaviors and interactions with each other and with their environments. The general scheme of the model is presented in Figure 1, and it shows different levels of detail. The first general level represents the complete model (black

The second level shows the main blocks of the system (blue blocks): a block for the simulation of the spread of the virus for each host (left side) and another for the transmission of the disease between hosts (right side), as proposed by other authors [30]. The next level (green blocks) shows the submodels of Epidemiological characterization and Infectivity for each agent and their corresponding parameters. It also presents Interpersonal contact, Location and Mobility/Activity submodels, and the specific parameters for this submodel. Finally, the third level also shows the Transport and Infectious trail submodels (magenta blocks). Each submodel will be described in further detail in the following sections.

Vertical solid line arrows represent the relationships between various model elements, and vertical dotted line arrows, the corresponding parameters (see details in text).
2. Agents, attributes and general behaviors. Since it is an ABM, the core of the model is constituted by agents named human (Ha). Each Ha has the ability to acquire and transmit SARS-CoV-2 virus; to change the SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) symptoms and health state, according to the infection spread, and to change behaviors accordingly (Infectivity submodel, Section 3.1). Besides, each Ha has specific characteristics and attributes corresponding to specific risk factors and comorbidities (Epidemiological characterization submodel, Section 3.2). The most important relationships between human agents, regarding COVID-19 epidemiology, are represented in the Interpersonal Contact submodel (Section 4.1). This submodel also presents human agents’ relationships with each other, with the plots of land, and with the environment. These relationships are affected by average distance in the different places they attend, how long the stay and the observance of mask use and social distancing rules (Sections 4.1 and 4.2). For Location submodel, a specific geographic information system (GIS) module of Repast platform is used, which will be further described in Section 4.2. This system makes it possible to differentiate and characterize family residences, buildings, stores, squares, means of transportation and other relevant locations where people stay. The geographical environment and each plot in which the city is subdivided are defined as agents, with their own methods and attributes. Furthermore, the most important means of public transportation are represented in the model as other specific location for people gathering. This can be seen in Transportation submodel (Section 4.2.1). The level of detail and quality of the specific geographical information in this system are vital to accurately represent the mobility and activities of each Ha in this simulated society. On the other hand, each Ha has a particular behavior according to its age range, habits and neighborhood where it lives, randomly assigned at the beginning of each simulation, following the population statistics for the city. Considering this, each Ha moves individually according to probabilities (𝐴 𝜖 𝜆ℎ,𝑒,𝑙(𝐴, 𝐵, 𝜋)) associated with SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) state change matrices (activities/locations) of a set 𝜆ℎ,𝑒,𝑙 of HMM that represent the Mobility/Activity submodel. Each HMM corresponds to a place (l) (neighborhood/city/area) where Ha lives, to its age range (e) , and to the time slot (h) it is in at the time of the simulation. The description of this submodel will be resumed in Section 4.3. Finally, the permanence of active virus in different locations/environments is represented by the Infectious trail submodel described in Section 4.3.1. 3. Block of Virus Spread in the Host. 3.1. Infectivity Submodel. AbCSim infectivity submodel is based on a mathematical model proposed by Arenas et al. [31], which was translated to Repast as the virus spread process in human agents. Each Ha has a state attribute according to one of these seven epidemiological compartments in which the metapopulation is divided3: S: susceptible; E: latent or exposed; I: symptomatic infectious; A: asymptomatic infectious; R: recovered; D: dead and H: hospitalized. Figure 2 shows the different components, relationships and parameters of this submodel as a diagram.

3 Although the concept "compartment" is more commonly used in epidemiological literature, from a formal point of view, this submodel can also be seen as another finite state stochastic automaton. SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Figure 2: Spread submodel with seven compartments: S: susceptible; E: latent or exposed; I: symptomatic infectious; A: asymptomatic infectious; R: recovered; D: dead, and H: hospitalized. Modified from Arenas et al. [31] (see parameters details in the text). This submodel comprises all the COVID-19 pandemic specific characteristics, such as important epidemiological effects caused by asymptomatic infectious individuals (A) or with mild symptoms. The fraction of individuals requiring hospitalization in intensive care (H) is also considered and it is assumed that all human agents have the possibility of accessing a respiratory ventilator, since the local healthcare capacity was not exceeded in the city under study. Taking into account the aforementioned characteristics of human agents, this submodel operates as follows: the susceptible Ha becomes infected with a probability 𝛽 due to interpersonal contact with another infected Ha either symptomatic (I) or asymptomatic (A). This probability of infection is modulated by a variable v, dependent on daily mean temperature. If the susceptible individual (S) becomes infected, Ha becomes part of people exposed to the virus (E). Exposed individuals, 1 𝛼 days later, become asymptomatic or symptomatic, according to a characteristic probability 𝜂 , depending on Ha’s age range. Once infected, there are two possibilities. The first option is that Ha requires hospitalization (H) in intensive care unit (ICU), with a certain probability 𝛾, according to Ha’s age range, comorbidities and risk factors. Risk factors or comorbidities are attributes of each Ha, and the increase in the probability of moving to ICU that they represent is shown in Table 2 in the following section (Epidemiological characterization submodel). If Ha, after 1 𝜇 days is not transfered to ICU, then it is considered recovered and not re-infected, at least for an average period of 11 months, according to [32]. During the stay in ICU, individuals SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) have a death probability 𝜔 [33] after an average period of 1 𝛹 days [34][35]. After this period,4 Ha vacates the ICU bed and moves to Recovered compartment. Human agent population were divided into five age ranges: children, young people, adults, older adults and elderly people. Transition constants between epidemiological compartments presented in Figure 2 are specific to each age range, and are shown in Table 1.

SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Infectivity submodel makes behavior of Ha change according to its epidemiological compartment. If Ha is in the Susceptible compartment, then Ha meets the daily activities and movements pre-established as attributes and defined by Mobility submodel. However, if Ha is in a compartment different from Susceptible or Exposed, then Ha stops moving, since it is assumed that it remains at home to avoid transmiting the disease to other Ha. From that moment on, the household members are in the Exposed compartment. Finally, in AbCSim the transmission probability from an interpersonal contact is a parameter linked not only to strictly epidemiological aspects, as 𝛽 is also multiplied or modulated by the variable v, which evolves throughout the year and is inversely proportional to daily mean temperature, according to studies that define COVID-19 as a seasonal disease [36][37][38]. In this way, 𝛽 value is affected by the variable v(Temp), which reaches its maximum value (the unit) on July 15 and its lowest value (0.5) on January 15, when daily mean temperature is higher in the southern hemisphere. 3.2. Epidemiological Characterization Submodel. As mentioned in the previous section, each Ha has specific epidemiological values that affect the Infectivity submodel parameters shown in Table 1. Among these attributes, we can highlight: the existence of comorbidities or risk factors and the existence of symptomatic infected household members. Comorbidities increase the probability 𝛾 of going from infected to inpatient in ICU according to the percentage value presented in Table 2 [33].

Finally, there are two attributes linked to the Ha’s behavior which have epidemiological consequences: the observance of social distancing (distancing) and the effectiveness and observance of mask use (mask).Although both attributes complete the epidemiological characterization of each agent, its functioning is described in Interpersonal Contact submodel (Section 4.1). 4. Host Spread Block 4.1. Interpersonal Contact Submodel For each Ha, there is a method that measures whether there is another agent within a 2-m range [39][40][41]. If this proximity lasts for 15 minutes or longer and either agent is infected (symptomatic or asymptomatic), then the epidemiological state attribute of the not infected Ha changes to exposed (E), with probability 𝑣(𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝) ∗𝛽. For each Ha, the model considers the current national definition of “close contact "5. This routine causes an automatic state change from susceptible (S) to exposed (E) for the household members who live with a symptomatic infected, regardless of whether

In addition, as previously mentioned, each Ha has an attribute that expresses the observance of mask use. This attribute makes 𝛽 to be affected by another coefficient, named mask. This coefficient modulates 𝛽 when there is a close contact, subtracting a 30% [17][21][42][43] of its value when Ha shows a high level of observance of mask use. When this level of observance is low, then mask coefficient is not applied. Finally, this submodel takes into account an attribute of each Ha that is defined by the level of observance of social distancing. This attribute, distancing, has two possible values: high or low. In the event that Ha has high level of observance, before taking any position in the geographical grid that does not correspond to its home, it checks that there is no other agent in a diameter of 1.8 m. If this condition is verified, then Ha takes the place. If not, it waits until the corresponding capacity allows it. On the other hand, if distancing has a low value, then, when this Ha moves, it takes the corresponding place, regardless the allowed capacity. 4.2. Location Submodel. With the aim of achieving an approximate representation of locations where citizens live, work, consume and perform leisure activities, GIS tools included in Repast were used. This information, together with movements verified during the day, configures the gregarious habits of each Ha. These habits were determined through 441 individual field surveys, complying with age and sex quotas, and with the requirements of the Ethics Committee in charge of evaluating and authorizing the structure, anonymization and informed consent of the surveys6.

Tools such as Google Maps and Google Places® were also used7, with which a first mapping of different areas of the city under study was obtained. A visual inspection of the plots and their labels was then performed in situ, in order to verify the information provided by the resources mentioned. In this way, assisted by tracking tools based on GPS, the GIS map was completed with the field survey. With this information in the system start routine, each Ha is assigned the attributes linked to this submodel, until filling the entire map with the number of human agents corresponding to each plot of land.

SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 4.2.1. Transportation Submodel. This block represents the influence that public transportation has in COVID-19 epidemiology. Different public transportation lines were represented as places or fixed positions on the map, where each bus stop is a plot of 10x4 m. This simplification aims to represent only the main characteristics of public transportation dynamics relevant for this study. Human agents can enter this plot once every 20 min (average frequency of local transportation), and remain at an average distance of 2 m, for 20 min. Distancing is not met only for one minute, which would represent the time that takes to go from the entrance door to the seat and from the seat to the exit door. After 20 minutes, each Ha can either move to a new position on the map or stay in the transportation position for another equal period of time (depending on a transition probability defined by Mobility/Activity submodel, which will be discussed in the next section). As described above, public transportation also has its specific capacity, but there is a probability of close contact, which is modulated by the Ha's observance of mask use and social distancing (as it occurs in any other location of the model).
4.3. Mobility/Activity Submodel This submodel helps simulate the mobility or movements of human agents living in a district or neighborhood of the model, considering age range and time slot being simulated. It also establishes the type of activity that each Ha will perform in the location where it is to be at the next period of time considered. Some of these activities are unique to each Ha throughout the simulation (e.g., type and location of SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) work or study) and others are obtained at the moment they are to be conducted (e.g., type of leisure activity). To calculate the position of each Ha at each instant, AbCSim generates a series of waypoints in specific geographical locations from a set of HMM [25]. Each of these HMM defines the probabilities of moving from one position to another one, depending on the position occupied by Ha in the previous instant and on the activities defined for the Ha's particular attributes. It is considered that the behavior linked to each Ha’s mobility is different at different times of the day, so specific HMM are generated for different time slots. The same occurs for age ranges. According to their age range, each Ha has a characteristic type of mobility and activities shared by all the human agents of the same neighborhood or district. Assuming that virus transmission in streets is practically negligible and that, therefore, it has no impact on the model, it is postulated that, for Ha, mobility on foot from one plot to another is immediate. As described in the previous section, only dynamics of mobility by public transportation are represented, where appropriate, since this type of mobility is considered as a possible activity for the state Others, which will be discussed below. The set of HMM that comprises Mobility submodel is defined as 𝜆ℎ,𝑒,𝑙(𝐴, 𝐵, 𝜋). There is a particular 𝜆ℎ,𝑒,𝑙 HMM for each Ha, based on age range (e), neighborhood (l) and time slot (h) corresponding to simulation time. As shown in the state graph in Figure 4, all HMM have four states. Each state represents a different type of location or activity, namely: Home (C), Work (T), Leisure (E) and Others (O). In turn, each HMM has its own transition matrix 𝐴ℎ,𝑒,𝑙, SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) which presents state change probabilities 𝑎ℎ,𝑒,𝑙(𝑖, 𝑗), that is, to move from a type of location (j) to another (i); a matrix 𝐵ℎ,𝑒,𝑙 that shows output probabilities 𝑏ℎ,𝑒,𝑙(𝑘, 𝑖) for each state (for the k possible places where Ha in the state i could go to) and a vector 𝜋 of initial location probabilities. Vector 𝜋 is always (1,0,0,0) for the beginning of the day, as it is assumed that all citizens start the day at home.
Figure 4: State graph of a Markov submodel. The four states, circled, represent C: House; T: Work; E: Leisure; O: Others. Rectangular blocks show possible outputs for each state, i.e. each waypoint. States H and W have only one possible output (defined in the attributes of each Ha), therefore, that output has a probability 1 of being chosen. State L has different possible outputs selected from a list with locations 𝑙𝑒𝑛 that depend on Ha's neighborhood. State O selects its output randomly.
The possible states have the following specific characteristics: ● C: This location represents Ha’s home and, therefore, has only one possible outcome. The specific location in the geographical map of the city that means the output for this state is defined as an attribute for each Ha and is part of the Location submodel. This attribute is randomly chosen from a geographical SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) area of the city defined as habitable at the beginning of the run and is the same throughout the simulation. ● T: This state represents the work or study location of each Ha. This point on the geographical map can be shared by multiple human agents. For some Ha, it coincides with that of their home (for those who do not work or study). The work/study location is fixed for each Ha, and it is selected at the beginning of the run from a list of possible places. Each place has different probabilities of being selected for human agents according to their age ranges. ● E: The location defined as "leisure" represents a place usually visited by people routinely and is shared by several Ha. Examples of these locations can include cinemas, parks or shopping centers. There is a list of locations with an associated probability, which varies according to the habits of the inhabitants in each particular neighborhood. ● O: Those defined as "other locations" are less frequent. As examples, ATMs, warehouses, restaurants, supermarkets, pharmacies and public transportation can be mentioned. Time slots are defined as follows: ● Morning: 8:00 -12: 00, time slot 0; ● Early afternoon: 12:00 - 16: 00, time slot 1; ● Afternoon: 16: 00 - 20: 00, time slot 2; ● Evening: 20: 00 - 24: 00, time slot 3 Age ranges are defined as follows: ● Children: 5-14 years old, age range 0; ● Young people: 15-24 years old, age range1; SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) ● Adults: 25-39 years old, age range 2; ● Older adults: 40-64 years old, age range 3; ● Elderly people: over 65 years old, age range 4
As an example, Table 3 shows matrix values 𝐴ℎ,𝑒,𝑙 for the HMM of a particular neighborhood l for age range 0 (Children) and time slot 0 (Morning). So, a0,0,l(i, j) has the probabilities that a child (e = 0) of neighborhood l, during the morning (h = 0), moves from state i (row) y to the state j (column). In particular, a0,0,l(1, 2) = 25 is the probability value (multiplied by 1000) that a child from the neighborhood l, within the time slot 0 leaves work/study (1) and goes to a leisure location (2).

4.3.1. Infectious Trail Submodel This submodel represents the possibility of Ha to become infected due to the contact with surfaces previously contaminated by another Ha. According to some studies [44] [45], SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) the most common everyday materials to human contact are plastics. There, the virus can last for a time that depends exponentially and inversely on ambient temperature. If an infected Ha remains in a given location longer than 16 minutes, it is possible that it leaves an infectious trail on the objects handled (fomites). This can be mathematically modeled [44] as: 𝑃(𝑡) = 𝑒((−𝑏).𝑡) Where b is: 𝑏= 𝑒 (−(4.9)+(𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝 10 ))
Here P(t) represents the probability of being in contact with the virus through a plastic surface; t is the time elapsed since the fomite was handled, in hours, and temp is the daily mean temperature. This formula was implemented in the system GIS projection, making each cell where an infected Ha remained able to infect another Ha with the corresponding probability P(t). This factor has been included for model completeness reasons, since it is related to several hygiene measures adopted for the prevention of this disease. In practice and in most recent literature it has been shown that it has no significant impact. 5. Obtaining and adapting AbCSim parameters. As described in previous sections, the model consists of different blocks and submodels, each of them with its own characteristic parameters that need to be adjusted for its correct functioning. Due to the heterogeneous nature of AbCSim, each submodel uses different mechanisms to obtain, adjust and adapt parameters. Some of the constants were SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) obtained directly from the literature, while others were adjusted using the grid search method and comparing simulation outputs with available real data. Finally, as the model represents many aspects of reality through different parameters in an explicit way, the information obtained was assessed ad hoc and the parameters were adjusted by an expert. The particularities of each block are described below, while Appendix A details the main parameters of the model, in order to provide reproducibility to this work and its results. 5.1. Block of Virus Spread in the Host. Based on the values proposed by the literature [31], an initial calibration of parameters linked mainly to virus spread in the hosts was generated. To adjust the parameters values of virus spread in the host, information on the evolution of epidemic variables from March to May 2020 in the municipality of Vo (small village in northern Italy) [46] was used and, in addition, the geographical, climatic, demographic and habits data of its inhabitants8. To validate the model, the initial conditions and parameters related to host transmission in the city of Hoyo de Manzanares were applied9 [47]. In this case, following the methodology presented by other epidemiological models based on

SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) agents [13][48], it was verified that AbCSim outputs agree with data collected on field, and that the model output dispersion, measured in terms of the interquartile range, is acceptable. Finally, in order to test the model against habits verified for Argentine cities, a simulation was run with actual data obtained from the district of Loncopué, Neuquén province10 11. For this implementation not only local habits were considered, but also a phase change of PMSI. Since the reported daily case data for this city are compatible with the model outputs, this information can be used as a measure of AbCSim validity, thus defining the values presented in Table 1.
5.2. Host Spread Block The values of mask and distancing in Interpersonal Contact submodel were set in agreement with the literature presented in Section 4.1. As the isolation and distancing phases changed, the increase in people's mobility was verified, which was reflected in the information provided by Google Mobility12. The change in people’s mobility towards activities of normal pre-pandemic life is reflected in the changes in parameters of matrices A and B of various HMM presented in Appendix A.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This section presents the simulation output results obtained with AbCSim, with data and adjustment of the parameters corresponding to the city under study, from June 12,

SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) 2020, when local cases began rising most significantly, through December 30, 2020. Model was fed with city climograph, changes in isolation/distancing phases, and the initial number of infected people corresponding to this period. Figure 5 shows the comparison between the number of ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 positive patients, obtained from Entre Ríos province Critical Units Monitoring Program (Programa de Monitoreo de Unidades Críticas, PMUC), during the period under study, and the estimate obtained by the model. This information is extremely important in order to anticipate a possible local health care system strain. In addition, this data set that can be obtained from reality quite accurately. This figure confirms that weekly reports of ICU beds occupancy with COVID-19 patients are compatible with the model output values. Figure 6 shows the number of daily COVID-19 cases (symptomatic and asymptomatic) estimated by the model in the period under analysis. In this case, official numbers only consider a sample of the actual total cases, since official reports are highly dependent on testing policies and on cases monitoring, appart from the difficulty in detecting asymptomatic cases. The model estimates that the number of actually infected people is larger than that showed by official reports. This agrees with the bibliography reported for other case studies [49]. Finally, Figure 7 shows accumulated number of deaths from COVID-19 estimated by the model in the period under study. This model output is directly verifiable with data field, and it follows that the number of accumulated deaths matches the amount reported by the UTN FRCU - COVID-19 GIBD Research Group Databases 13 for Paraná city.

CONCLUSIONS This work presents an agent-based model called AbCSim, capable of reproducing the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic at a local city scale. The model explicitly incorporates various aspects of the epidemic, which facilitates its adjustment to different case studies. The methodology used to adjust the system's parameters is provided, as well as the methodology to consider changes in social distancing measures, in people's activity and climate variations over time. As a case study, the model was applied to Paraná city in the second half of 2020. The results obtained are consistent with those reported by different official sources, such as PMUC, in particular with the number of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients in the city. It was also verified that model outputs agree with the number of deceased people reported for the period of time considered. It can be concluded that the model SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2654 Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) can be used to predict the most likely evolution of the number of cases and number of beds to be occupied in the short term. AbCSim provides information that can be used to quantify the effects of the implementation of different health policies at local level. These features make this model a useful tool for decision making with the goal of assessing the utilization of the health care system, preventing it from collapsing, while including a contextualization of people in their local economic and social environment. Future works will present several case studies in this regard, including the results of the application of this model to other cities or even at state scale. The extension of this model to consider the effect of vaccination campaigns and different virus variants will be also presented.

The values in Table A.1.1 to A.1.5 determine the mobility and activities of the agents according to their age range and neighborhood of residence. In each row, the values related to the representative areas of neighborhoods with a high index of satisfied basic needs (SBNI) are displayed in the left half and those corresponding to neighborhoods with a low SBNI, on the right.

Given that the set of Hidden Markov Models used by AbCSim has two visible states (there is only one possible activity for that state) and two hidden states that can emit different outputs, the emission probabilities of the hidden states corresponding to the states "Leisure" and "Others" are shown below.
