Here, our 7 resulting electronic catalogue, containing records for 72,624 of the specimens, including all of the 8 available provenance information associated with each of them, is published online through the 9 speciesLink network <http://www.splink.org.br/search?collectioncode=FIOCRUZ- 10 COLFLEB&group=animais&lang=pt&action=openform> and the Sistema de Informação sobre a 11 Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr) <http://ipt.fiocruz.br/ipt/resource?r=fiocruz_colfleb>. 12
13 Research areas: Animal and Plant Sciences, Biodiversity, Taxonomy 14
15 Biological collections are repositories of biodiversity that house specimens, and information about 16 those specimens, which can be used in various areas of scientific research [1], and are especially 17 important for insects of medical and veterinary importance, where accurate taxonomic identification 18 of the latter is necessary for understanding and intervening in the epidemiology of vector-borne 19 diseases [2]. The “Coleção de Flebotomíneos” (the “Collection of Phlebotomines” as it is called in 20 Portuguese) – held at the Instituto René Rachou, Fiocruz Minas (FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB), a federal public 21 health research institution in the city of Belo Horizonte, in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil – is a 22 biological collection of sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae, Phlebotominae): small insects of 23 considerable medical and public health importance because their blood-feeding adult females 24 transmit protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania, the etiological agent of leishmaniases, in 25 addition to other bacterial and viral pathogens, which infect both human and non-human 26 Auto-generated PDF by ReView GigaByte MSColflebsubmitted.docxMainDocument GigaScience Review Copy Only 4 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3782 vertebrates [3]. The insect specimens deposited in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB come from many different 27 research projects carried out over the last 80 years or so in many different areas of disease 28 transmission, and also from wild environments where there are no records of the disease. The 29 deposited sand flies were usually collected in light traps and are identified by highly-trained 30 specialists using the available taxonomic keys [2,4]. The specimens can support research in the areas 31 of taxonomy and systematics [5,6,7], and the associated data can be used, for example, in ecological 32 niche / species distribution modelling [8], among other applications [9]. 33 The data set reported here are the metadata for each individual sand fly specimen deposited 34 in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB since 1953. Our dataset has 57 fields describing for each individual sand fly 35 specimen their: (i) taxonomy (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, specificEpithet, 36 infraspecificEpithet, scientificName, scientificNameAuthorship, taxonRank, vernacularName, 37 typestatus), (ii) collection details, including the collectors (recordedBy), the collection date, trapping 38 method, trap identification number, collection site description (occurrenceRemarks, eventDate, 39 eventTime, habitat, samplingProtocol, samplingEffort, eventRemarks), (iii) geolocation data (country, 40 countryCode, stateProvince, county, Island, waterbody, locality, locationRemarks, decimalLongitude, 41 decimalLatitude , georeferenceRemarks), (iv) catalogue reference data (occurrenceID, 42 catalogNumber, OtherCatalogNumbers). The associated data for each physical object in our 43 collections has a paper card with many fields referring to specimen provider, location, quantity of 44 specimens, etc.. The data from these cards have been digitized by a dedicated member of the 45 collection staff since 2010. The data are provided in the Darwin Core format [10]. Our data is 46 available in the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr), an online platform 47 that integrates data and information about biodiversity and ecosystems and is the Brazilian Node of 48 the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) [11], an internationally-recognized resource for 49 collation of biological occurrence data, where our data set has been submitted, and is publicly 50 available for use by others at: https://doi.org/10.15468/sxcpfp. 51 CONTEXT 52 Auto-generated PDF by ReView GigaByte MSColflebsubmitted.docxMainDocument GigaScience Review Copy Only 5 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3782 Phlebotomine sand flies are considered insects of medical importance because they are involved in 53 the transmission of pathogens between human and non-human animals. Approximately 1,000 sand 54 flies species have been described, of which 530 are known to occur in the Neotropical and Nearctic 55 regions [12]. 56 The collection was officially started in 1953, as part of the work of Professor Amilcar Vianna 57 Martins and Alda Lima Falcão, in collaboration with the technician João Evangelista da Silva, who 58 participated in all fieldwork [13]. The number of specimens in the collection increased considerably 59 during the 1960s and 1970s, and during the last 20 years fossil specimens, as well as voucher 60 specimens from DNA-based barcoding studies and other epidemiological studies involving fieldwork, 61 are still being deposited in the collection [7,14]. 62 FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB contains 922 type specimens belonging to 151 species, including 63 holotypes, allotypes, paratypes, plesiotypes, cotypes, topotypes, homeotypes, syntypes and 64 neotypes. COLFLEB also has a diverse collection of fossil species of Neotropical sand flies, currently 65 consisting of 47 ambers from the Dominican Republic, within which 162 sand flies of 9 species are 66 preserved. Additionally, FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB has in its collection over 700 voucher specimens 67 deposited from on-going DNA barcoding studies. 68 Since 2010, the metadata of the biological specimens held in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB is being 69 digitized, and, among the various biological collections of Fiocruz [15], it has the most published 70 online data. Our online catalogue is also integrated into the the speciesLink network 71 <http://www.splink.org.br/search?collectioncode=FIOCRUZ- 72 COLFLEB&group=animais&lang=pt&action=openform> and the Sistema de Informação sobre a 73 Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr) <http://ipt.fiocruz.br/ipt/resource?r=fiocruz_colfleb>. 74
75 METHODS 76 The sand flies held in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB are adults and were collected using a variety of diverse 77 methods, including resting collection from artificial and natural surfaces using either mechanical or 78 Auto-generated PDF by ReView GigaByte MSColflebsubmitted.docxMainDocument GigaScience Review Copy Only 6 SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.3782 manual aspirators (“pooters”), human-landing capture, unbaited and CO2-baited CDC-like light traps, 79 and Shannon traps, operated in different environments, ranging from the domestic and 80 peridomestic (e.g., houses and their surroundings in urban, suburban and rural areas) to the 81 relatively undisturbed sylvatic and wild (e.g., remote forest areas). Our specimens are from 20 82 different countries in the Americas and all 27 states of Brazil are represented. 83
The live-caught insects are permanently mounted on glass microscope slides and preserved 84 in either Berlese medium or Canada Balsam, while the fossil specimens are kept in plastic vials. All 85 types are labelled with colour-coded labels. 86

87 DATA VALIDATION AND QUALITY CONTROL 88 Insects were identified by keys available in the literature (Galati 2003; Young and Duncan 1994) by 89 experienced taxonomists. 90 The dataset is in Darwin Core format 57 terms are available. All mandatory fields are present and 91 have gone through screening in the FIOCRUZ IPT, metadata fields are also available on the online 92 pages. 93
94 RE-USE POTENTIAL 95 The data associated with the biological specimens deposited in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB are of importance 96 because they describe the distribution of sand flies in different parts of Brazil and have a good 97 temporal coverage since some specimens’ date back from 1939 and the last deposit was recorded in 98 2021. The data can be used for many different applications, from different research areas (taxonomy 99 and systematics [5,6,7], ecological niche modelling [8], among other applications [9]) to vector 100 control activities [16,17]. 101 DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT 102 Declarations (https://gigabytejournal.com/data-release-description) 103
