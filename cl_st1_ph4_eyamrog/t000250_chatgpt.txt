Objective: This study aims to assess the relationships between moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), and sedentary behavior (SB) with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms (D&A) amidst the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.
Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among individuals in self-isolation. Participants self-reported their levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), and sedentary behavior (SB) as exposures, along with their depressive and anxiety symptoms assessed using the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI and BAI). Logistic regressions were employed to explore the associations between MVPA, VPA, MPA, and SB with prevalent depressive symptoms (BDI>9), anxiety symptoms (BAI>7), and combined depressive and anxiety symptoms (BDI>9+BAI>7), with results presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Additionally, linear regressions were utilized to examine the relationships with symptom severity, while adjusting for potential confounding factors in the models.
Results: In the study, a total of 937 participants, with females comprising 72.3% of the sample, were examined. Those engaging in at least 30 minutes per day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) or 15 minutes per day of vigorous physical activity (VPA) exhibited reduced odds of experiencing prevalent depressive symptoms (ORMVPA=0.71, 95%CI=0.53-0.96; ORVPA=0.60, 95%CI=0.43-0.82), anxiety symptoms (ORMVPA=0.71, 95%CI=0.54-0.96; ORVPA=0.70, 95%CI=0.51-0.96), and concurrent depression and anxiety symptoms (ORMVPA=0.71, 95%CI=0.52-0.96; ORVPA=0.59, 95%CI=0.41-0.83). Conversely, individuals spending more than 10 hours per day in sedentary behavior were found to have a higher likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms (OR=1.39, 95%CI=1.02-1.90). Furthermore, for each hour spent in sedentary behavior, there was a corresponding increase of 0.22 (95%CI=0.10-0.33) points on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and 0.16 (95%CI=0.02-0.31) points on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).
In conclusion, elevated levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA) are linked to reduced likelihood of experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and comorbid depressive and anxiety (D&A) symptoms. Conversely, increased sedentary behavior (SB) is correlated with heightened odds of depressive symptoms.
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged as a significant global public health crisis. As of May 13th, more than 4 million cases and 280 thousand deaths have been reported worldwide, with Brazil accounting for over 160 thousand cases and 11 thousand deaths. In response to the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has advised national governments to implement physical distancing measures. In Brazil, the Ministry of Health's epidemiological report number 05 has recommended social distancing strategies, including self-isolation in areas with community transmission. Self-isolation protocols aim to restrict individuals' movement within society, thereby reducing contact with others. In Brazil, individuals are advised to stay at home and venture out only for essential activities like grocery shopping, pharmacy visits, or accessing critical services such as medical care. While the national guideline emphasizes staying at home, each of Brazil's 27 federative units retains the authority to decide on the adoption and enforcement of more stringent measures like quarantine or lockdown.
Prediction models indicate that the prompt adoption of physical distancing measures could prevent nearly 90,000 fatalities in Brazil's most populous urban center. Although self-isolation protocols are crucial for curbing the spread of the virus, their implementation, coupled with the pervasive "pandemic fear," may contribute to adverse effects on mental well-being, potentially exacerbating symptoms of depression and anxiety. Consequently, it is imperative to develop and implement strategies aimed at alleviating the current and anticipated mental health challenges stemming from these circumstances.
A significant body of evidence indicates that engaging in regular moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), which involves bodily movements requiring energy expenditure at moderate or vigorous intensities, is correlated with a reduced prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the general population, including those in low-middle income countries. Furthermore, MVPA has been shown to decrease the likelihood of developing depression and anxiety on a global scale. Conversely, high levels of sedentary behavior (SB), characterized by activities with an energy expenditure ≤1.5 METs while sitting, reclining, or lying down, are linked to an increased risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms.
Physical distancing and self-isolation measures have led to a decrease in opportunities for engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) due to the closure of stadiums, parks, and gyms. Additionally, individuals in self-isolation often resort to sedentary activities like watching television or engaging in seated computer activities. Given the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on lifestyle behaviors, as well as the known correlation between depressive and anxiety symptoms, it is crucial to explore the potential link between MVPA and sedentary behavior (SB) with depressive and anxiety symptoms within the context of the pandemic.
To date, no research has investigated the correlations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior (SB) with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and the co-occurrence of both during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study seeks to address this gap by 1) assessing the levels of MVPA and SB in Brazil amidst the pandemic; 2) examining the prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring depressive and anxiety (D&A) symptoms in the Brazilian population; 3) investigating the relationships between MVPA, SB, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and D&A; and 4) exploring the connections between different intensities of physical activity (vigorous physical activity [VPA] or moderate physical activity [MPA]) and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and co-occurring D&A.
This paper presents data from a cross-sectional study conducted through an online survey. The study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Santa Maria and the National Commission of Ethics in Research [CONEP] (30244620.1.0000.5346).
Participants for this study were sourced through social media channels and by disseminating invitations within established researcher networks. Eligibility criteria included Brazilian adults aged 18 years and above, presently located in Brazil, and adhering to self-isolation measures necessitated by the COVID-19 outbreak. Self-isolation, in this context, referred to individuals who opted to remain at home and ventured out solely for essential tasks like grocery shopping, accessing medical supplies, or seeking healthcare services. Upon recruitment, participants were guided to a secure data platform (www.qualtrics.com) where they provided their informed consent subsequent to reviewing an informational document.
The co-primary outcomes of the study encompassed the assessment of symptoms related to depression and anxiety, as well as the presence of both conditions occurring simultaneously.
Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a 21-item questionnaire. Each item comprises four statements reflecting the severity of depressive symptoms, with scores ranging from 0 (minimal) to 3 (severe). The total score on the BDI ranges from 0 to 63, with scores of 0-9 indicating minimal or no depressive symptoms, 10-18 indicating mild to moderate symptoms, 19-29 indicating moderate to severe symptoms, and 30-63 indicating severe symptoms. In this study, depression was categorized as either absent (0-9) or present (10-63).
Anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), a tool comprising 21 items. Each item represents a distinct anxiety symptom, with participants rating how they have experienced each symptom over the past month on a scale from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Severely, it bothered me a lot). Total scores on the BAI can range from 0 to 63, with scores falling within specific ranges indicating varying levels of anxiety: 0-7 for minimal/no anxiety symptoms, 8-15 for mild anxiety symptoms, 16-25 for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 26-63 for severe anxiety symptoms. For the purposes of this study, anxiety was categorized as either absent (0-7) or prevalent (8-63) based on these established thresholds.
Participants who exhibited significant depressive symptoms, as indicated by a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score exceeding 9, and significant anxiety symptoms, as indicated by a Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) score exceeding 7, were categorized as having co-occurring symptoms of depression and anxiety. The presence of co-occurring depression and anxiety symptoms was considered as a binary variable in the analysis.
Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was evaluated through two specific inquiries: 1) "How much time, on average, do you engage in vigorous physical activity daily since the onset of self-isolation?"; and 2) "How much time, on average, do you dedicate to moderate physical activity daily since self-isolating?". These questions were supplemented with detailed clarifications: "Consider all the vigorous and moderate activities you typically undertake daily during self-isolation. Vigorous physical activities entail strenuous physical exertion, causing significantly increased breathing compared to normal. Moderate activities involve a moderate level of physical effort, resulting in somewhat heavier breathing than usual." In the logistic regression models, MVPA, moderate physical activity (MPA), and vigorous physical activity (VPA) during self-isolation were treated as binary variables. MVPA and MPA were categorized as 1 = <30 minutes per day or 2 = ≥30 minutes per day, while VPA was categorized as 1 = <15 minutes per day or 2 = ≥15 minutes per day. These thresholds were selected to align with the established public health guidelines recommending 150 minutes of MVPA or 75 minutes of VPA per week.
The duration of sedentary behavior (SB) was evaluated through the question: "Since beginning self-isolation, what is the average daily duration you spend sitting?". SB was categorized as a binary variable (1= <10 hours of sitting per day; 2 = ≥10 hours of sitting per day), following the methodology employed in prior research studies23, 24.
Demographic data were systematically gathered, encompassing sex (male or female), age (categorized in 10-year intervals), ethnicity (including asian, black, caucasian, mixed, other), marital status (single, separated/divorced, widowed, or married/in a domestic partnership), employment status (Unemployed, Student, Military, Self-employed, or Retired), household income (categorized as <R$1254, R$1255-R$2004, R$2005-R$8640, R$8641-R$11261, >R$11262), and the Brazilian state of residence. Participants were queried about their self-isolation status and the duration of their self-isolation period. Substance use was assessed, specifically current smoking status (yes or no) and current alcohol consumption (yes or no). Self-reported history of chronic physical conditions (e.g., obesity, hypertension, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, other coronary diseases, other cardiac diseases, varicose veins of lower extremities, osteoarthritis, chronic neck pain, chronic low back pain, chronic allergy [excluding allergic asthma], asthma [including allergic asthma], chronic bronchitis, emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, cataract, peptic ulcer disease, urinary incontinence or urine control problems, hypercholesterolaemia, chronic skin disease, chronic constipation, liver cirrhosis, other hepatic disorders, stroke, chronic migraine, other frequent chronic headaches, haemorrhoids, cancer, osteoporosis, thyroid disease, renal disease, and injuries) and psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or others) were also evaluated through self-reported inquiries, with a comprehensive list of the aforementioned conditions provided for participant reference.
Sample characteristics were presented for the entire sample and stratified based on the duration of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (≥30 minutes vs. <30 minutes per day) and sedentary behavior (SB) (<10 hours vs. ≥10 hours per day). Descriptive statistics were reported using mean (standard deviation) or median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables, while categorical variables were expressed as total numbers and percentages. The differences in median levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms across MVPA and SB categories were assessed using Mann-Whitney U tests. Logistic regression models with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were employed to examine the associations between MVPA or SB and the prevalence of depressive, anxiety, or co-occurring depressive and anxiety (D&A) symptoms. These associations were further explored across various intensities of physical activity (vigorous, moderate, and light). Initially, unadjusted models were tested, followed by adjustments for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, family income, days in self-isolation, smoking status, alcohol consumption, history of chronic diseases, psychiatric disorders, and daily sitting time or MVPA duration. Results from logistic regression analyses were presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Adjusted mean differences (AMD) in depressive and anxiety symptoms based on MVPA or SB levels were calculated using analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs), controlling for the same variables as in the logistic models. Linear regression analyses were conducted with continuous MVPA, vigorous physical activity (VPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), SB, and mental health symptoms. The significance level was set at p < 0.05, and all statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corporation).
A total of 937 adults were included in the study, with the sample predominantly composed of women (72.3%), young adults (52.6% aged 18-35 years), Caucasians (76.0%), singles (50.1%), currently employed (50.1%), and with a monthly household income ranging from R$2005 to R$11261 (56.9%). The majority of participants were non-smokers (94.9%) but were consuming alcoholic beverages during self-isolation (68.8%). The overall cohort reported engaging in a median of 30 (IQR=60.00) minutes of MVPA per day and spending a median of 10.0 (IQR=5.0) hours per day in SB. Of the participants, 500 (53.4%) spent ≥30 minutes of MVPA per day, and 311 (33.3%) spent ≥10 hours in SB per day. The prevalence of self-reported previous diagnosis of chronic physical conditions (any disease) was 93.3%, while the prevalence of self-reported previous diagnosis of psychiatric disorders (any disorder) was 41.0% (depression=20.0%, any anxiety disorder=24.4%, bipolar disorder=2.0%, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders=0.1%). Further details of the overall sample, categorized by time spent in MVPA and SB, can be found in Table 1.
In the overall sample, the median of depressive symptoms was 9.00 (IQR=10.00), with a mean of 9.98 (7.60) points on the BDI scale. Participants who reported engaging in ≥30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day exhibited lower depressive symptoms compared to those spending <30 minutes in MVPA (AMD= -0.707; 95%CI= -1.160 to -0.253, p=0.002). Similarly, individuals who spent <10 hours in sedentary behavior (SB) per day demonstrated lower depressive symptoms than those who spent ≥10 hours in SB per day (AMD= -1.736, 95%CI= -2.704 to -0.768, p<0.001).
In the overall sample, the median of anxiety symptoms was 6.00 (IQR=11.0), with a mean of 9.01 (9.12) points on the BAI score scale. Individuals who engaged in ≥30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day reported lower anxiety symptoms compared to those who spent <30 minutes in MVPA (AMD= -0.759; 95%CI= -1.312 to -0.206, p=0.007). Similarly, participants who spent <10 hours in sedentary behavior (SB) per day exhibited lower anxiety symptoms than those who spent ≥10 hours in SB per day (AMD= -1.665; 95%CI= -2.869 to -0.461, p=0.007).
In the cohort, the prevalence rates for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety were 43.6%, 43.3%, and 31.9%, respectively. Figure 1 illustrates the prevalence of these symptoms within the MVPA and SB groups.
Participants who reported engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) exhibited reduced odds of prevalent depressive (OR=0.71, 95%CI=0.53-0.96), anxiety (OR=0.72, 95%CI=0.54-0.96), and co-occurring depression and anxiety (D&A) symptoms (OR=0.71, 95%CI=0.52-0.96) after adjusting for potential covariates. Conversely, individuals spending 10 or more hours per day in sedentary behavior (SB) were more likely to display prevalent depressive symptoms (OR=1.39, 95%CI=1.02-1.90) in the most comprehensive analyses. The logistic regression models' detailed outcomes can be found in table 2. Furthermore, linear associations, accounting for pertinent covariates, revealed that each additional hour spent in SB corresponded to a 0.22-point increase on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (95%CI=0.104-0.338) and a 0.16-point rise on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (95%CI=0.021-0.313). The linear models for MVPA and SB are delineated in table 3.
When examining various MVPA intensities, engaging in VPA for at least 15 minutes daily is linked to reduced odds of prevalent depressive (OR=0.60, 95%CI=0.43-0.82), anxiety (OR=0.70, 95%CI=0.51-0.96), and concurrent D&A (OR=0.59, 95%CI=0.41-0.83) symptoms. Similarly, dedicating at least 30 minutes daily to MPA is associated with a decreased prevalence of co-occurring D&A symptoms (OR=0.72, 95%CI=0.53-0.98) as shown in Table 4. Linear regression analyses revealed that each additional 10 minutes spent in VPA corresponds to a reduction of 0.18 (95%CI=0.041-0.335) points on the BDI and -0.21 (95%CI=0.034-0.400) points on the BAI scales, respectively, as demonstrated in Table 5.
This study represents the first investigation into the correlation between MVPA, VPA, MPA, and SB and the presence of depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring D&A symptoms among adults in self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately half of the participants reported engaging in ≥30 minutes of MVPA daily, with a third spending ≥10 hours in SB per day. The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was around 40%, while a third reported experiencing co-occurring D&A and anxiety symptoms. Our findings suggest that individuals engaging in ≥30 minutes of MVPA daily were roughly 30% less likely to exhibit depressive, anxiety, and D&A symptoms, even after adjusting for relevant covariates. Those reporting ≥15 minutes of VPA daily were approximately 40% less likely to exhibit prevalent depressive and D&A symptoms, and 30% less likely to exhibit prevalent anxiety symptoms. Conversely, individuals spending ≥10 hours daily in SB were 39% more likely to exhibit prevalent depressive symptoms in the adjusted models.
The current study identified a high prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and comorbid D&A symptoms within a sample of the Brazilian population amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. While the average severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the sample falls within the range of mild symptoms, the prevalence of depressive symptoms is approximately four times higher than those reported in previous studies in Brazil utilizing similar screening tools. Comparable findings of elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms have been observed in other regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as Paraguay (depression=59.6%, anxiety=47.2%), Turkey (moderate to severe depression=18.6%, moderate to severe anxiety=26.5%), China (depression=48.1%, anxiety=22.6%, D&A=19.4%), and the Basque region of Spain (depression=20.8%, anxiety=29.0%). It is important to note that our study is not representative of the general population, and caution should be exercised in interpreting the results due to potential self-selection bias. Additionally, the screening tool utilized is not capable of diagnosing depressive or anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, the high prevalence of symptoms suggests that the pandemic and self-isolation measures are impacting mental health. Therefore, there is a need for epidemiological studies to accurately assess the true mental health burden in the population. Despite the limitations of our study, the findings imply that governmental bodies should implement measures to alleviate the mental health burden during periods of mandated isolation.
During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a cross-sectional study revealed that nearly 60% of participants failed to meet the physical activity (PA) recommendations of less than 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week. Additionally, a correlation was identified between PA levels and reduced negative affect. Our research aligns with the findings from China, indicating that engaging in over 30 minutes of daily MVPA is linked to a decrease in concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms. Within our study, engaging in 15 minutes or more of vigorous physical activity (VPA) daily was associated with a lower prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, we observed a linear relationship between the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, suggesting a dose-response connection. However, after adjusting for covariates, no linear relationships were evident in our study between moderate physical activity (MPA) or MVPA and depressive and anxiety symptoms. This lack of association could potentially be explained by the fact that during pandemics, time spent in MPA may be heavily influenced by household activities, as most household tasks fall within this intensity range. Conversely, VPA may more accurately reflect leisure-time physical activity, which previous evidence suggests is more likely to yield positive mental health outcomes compared to household activities. Individuals who spend extended periods engaged in household activities may not be reaping the same mental health benefits as those participating in leisure-time physical activities.
Significant associations were discovered between extended periods of sedentary behavior (SB) and the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms, even after adjusting for covariates like moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Additionally, individuals who spent more than 10 hours per day in SB were found to have a higher likelihood of experiencing prevalent depressive symptoms, although this was not the case for anxiety or concurrent depression and anxiety symptoms. This discrepancy could potentially be attributed to the requirement of periods exceeding 10 hours of SB per day to significantly impact the presence of notable anxiety symptoms.
While our data are cross-sectional and directionality is unclear, previous longitudinal, mendelian randomisation, and randomised trials support the notion that moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) protects against and improves depressive and anxiety symptoms. Assuming that MVPA is protective against depressive and anxiety symptoms, these effects can be explained by some underlying mechanisms. Firstly, MVPA can increase the release of endocannabinoids, which have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Secondly, MVPA improves neuroplasticity and functions on the brain, reflected by the increase of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF). The changes in BDNF levels seem to be associated with the antidepressant effects of exercise. Thirdly, evidence suggests that MVPA can fortify the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant systems, which are increased in depressive and anxiety disorders. On the other hand, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that sedentary behavior (SB) increases depressive symptoms, and this effect is partially mediated by an increase in inflammatory markers. Additionally, there is a significant body of literature highlighting the risks of consuming anxiogenic content during self-isolation, making the time spent in MVPA a potential distraction from such negative stimuli. Social connectivity may also play a crucial role in the antidepressant effect of exercise, as individuals who are more physically active tend to engage in more social interaction, whether through group exercise classes or online platforms. Lastly, there is evidence suggesting a bidirectional relationship between MVPA and SB with depressive symptoms and anxiety, indicating that individuals with these symptoms are less likely to be active and more sedentary.
Strategies aimed at promoting moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) should be tailored to the current context, taking into consideration both the ongoing response to COVID-19 and efforts to mitigate its future impact on mental health. While exercise has been shown to potentially lessen the severity of acute respiratory symptoms in the general population, there remains a gap in research regarding the protective effects and safety of exercise for individuals with COVID-19 infection. It is advisable for exercise professionals to remain vigilant for potential signs of COVID-19 infection, suggesting the need for a brief screening of symptoms before engaging in MVPA. If any signs or symptoms of infection are identified, participants should abstain from MVPA and adhere to the guidelines provided by local health authorities.
The current study has several limitations. Firstly, the cross-sectional design hinders the ability to establish causality in the relationship. Longitudinal data would be essential to elucidate the potential protective impact of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) against the onset of depression and anxiety during periods of self-isolation. Secondly, the sample predominantly consisted of females and young adults recruited through social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and emails distributed within a network of researchers. While participants hailed from 24 out of the 27 Brazilian states, a significant proportion (62%) originated from Rio Grande do Sul, with 14.8% from Rio de Janeiro and 6.5% from Ceará, thereby limiting the generalizability of the findings. Thirdly, the study may have been subject to sampling bias, as individuals experiencing heightened levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms might have been more inclined to participate (self-selection bias), potentially inflating prevalence rates. Fourthly, data collection relied solely on self-reported responses via an online survey, which can introduce recall bias and be influenced by social desirability. Lastly, the study did not differentiate whether physical activity occurred during leisure time or in other contexts. Future research should explore the impact of various domains in which physical activity is undertaken on the relationship between MVPA and depression and anxiety amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
Individuals who engage in higher levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA) are less likely to exhibit symptoms of depression, anxiety, and distress during periods of self-isolation. Conversely, individuals who report higher levels of sedentary behavior (SB) are more likely to experience prevalent depressive symptoms. Implementing strategies aimed at promoting increased MVPA and VPA while reducing SB on a population-wide scale could play a crucial role in alleviating the mental health challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative that public health recommendations clearly communicate safe exercise practices to the general population.
