Dental caries and periodontal disease stand out as the most prevalent biofilm-dependent diseases, prompting a continuous quest for safe therapeutic alternatives to chlorhexidine due to its various side effects. This study sought to assess the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of extracts derived from Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. bark against five oral microorganisms, alongside an analysis of their phytochemical composition and thermal degradation profile. Liquid-liquid partitioning was conducted using hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate, followed by the identification and quantification of the chemical marker. Antimicrobial activity was gauged through minimum inhibitory concentration testing, while cytotoxicity was evaluated based on hemolysis potential. Thermal degradation profiles were established using two distinct methods. Gallic acid emerged as the primary compound in the samples, with the highest concentration found in the chloroform fraction. All samples effectively inhibited the growth of tested microorganisms without displaying any cytotoxic effects. The ethanol extract exhibited lower heat absorption compared to the fractions, with all samples demonstrating an exothermic peak consistent with gallic acid degradation. These findings suggest that the samples hold promise as potential candidates for inclusion in dental formulations aimed at biofilm control.
The increasing resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics poses a significant challenge for medicine, prompting the exploration of novel antimicrobial therapies with enhanced efficacy against these pathogens (Pereira et al., 2011). Consequently, there is a gradual rise in research focusing on herbal products. Within dentistry, these investigations primarily center on evaluating the impact of bacteria and fungi on prevalent oral conditions like dental caries and periodontal disease, both of which are biofilm-dependent (Lima et al., 2014; Santamaria Junior et al., 2014; Sponchiado et al., 2014).
Dental caries is a prevalent global disease issue (Bagramian et al., 2009), characterized as a multifactorial chronic infectious condition caused by tooth-adherent specific bacteria, primarily Streptococcus spp, which metabolize sugars to produce acid, leading to the demineralization of tooth structure over time (Abranches et al., 2018). Streptococcus mitis, S. oralis, and S. salivarius are implicated in the initial adhesion of bacteria to teeth, serving as a gateway to other members of the oral microbiota, including other streptococci and periodontopathogens (Butler et al., 2017). Additionally, there have been documented cases of meningitis attributed to S. salivarius (Falomir et al., 2014; Suy et al., 2013; Vignier et al., 2014), while S. oralis and S. mitis have been linked to increased virulence factors of Candida albicans (Palma et al., 2019) and bloodstream infections in pediatric patients (Basaranoglu et al., 2019). S. mutans is the predominant microorganism associated with caries development, initiating tooth demineralization by acidifying the microenvironment and tooth surface (Abranches et al., 2018; Baker et al., 2016). Furthermore, S. mutans has been connected to bacteremia and endocarditis (Nakano et al., 2005; Nakano et al., 2009), underscoring the importance of researching solutions to minimize these infections.
Numerous studies have explored the use of bioactive compounds and plants, as evidenced by research conducted by Lima et al. (2014), Macedo-Costa et al. (2017), Veloso et al. (2020), Sette-de-Souza et al. (2014), and Silva et al. (2012). Within this realm, Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. has been traditionally employed in folk medicine to address a range of ailments such as toothache, diarrhea, flu, and inflammations, as documented by Agra et al. (2006), Albuquerque (2006), Albuquerque et al. (2007), and Albuquerque et al. (2012). The bark of S. brasiliensis is known to contain polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, and saponins, as highlighted by Chaves et al. (2015) and Fernandes et al. (2015), with various bioactive compounds having been successfully isolated, as reported by Cardoso et al. (2005), Cardoso et al. (2015), and Santos et al. (2017). Notably, Santos et al. (2014) identified the presence of flavonoids and tannins in the hydroalcoholic extract of S. brasiliensis bark, noting the absence of toxicity. It is worth mentioning that the phenolic compounds in the bark of this plant are susceptible to degradation at temperatures exceeding 125 °C, as indicated by Fernandes et al. (2013).
The aim of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria and the cytotoxicity of extracts and fractions derived from the bark of S. brasiliensis Engl., while also examining its phytochemical composition and thermal degradation profile.
The bark of Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. was gathered from the semi-arid region in the State of Paraíba, Brazil. A voucher specimen was meticulously prepared and identified in the herbarium of Professor Jayme Coelho de Morais at the Federal University of Paraíba, assigned the unique identifier EAN-14049.
The plant material was dried at 40 ± 1 °C, following which the ethanolic extract (EE) was acquired through the percolation of bark powder. This process involved utilizing ethanol (Merck - Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany) as the solvent over a period of five days, conducted in three cycles at 30 ºC. Subsequently, the extract was concentrated in a vacuum rotary evaporator operating at 40 °C and 55 rpm until complete solvent removal was accomplished.
The ethanolic extract (EE) underwent liquid-liquid partition, followed by solubilization in a solvent system consisting of ethanol and water (80:20, v/v) in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. The EE solution was transferred to a separatory funnel, where hexane (Hex), chloroform (Chlo), and ethyl acetate (EtAc) solvents (obtained from Merck, Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany) were successively added in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio and stirred. After allowing the funnel to stand for approximately 10 minutes to facilitate phase separation, this process was repeated thrice for each solvent to obtain the desired fractions. Subsequently, each fraction was concentrated using a vacuum rotary evaporator (operating at 40 °C and 55 rpm) until complete solvent evaporation was achieved.
In this stage, the standard strains utilized were the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains of Streptococcus mutans (25175), Streptococcus oralis (10557), Streptococcus mitis (903), and Streptococcus salivarius (7073), all of which were sourced from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ-RJ).
The determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) followed the guidelines outlined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2009). To begin, the inoculum was standardized in tubes containing 5 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution. The microbial suspension was adjusted using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-mini 1240 – São Paulo, Brazil) at a wavelength of 625 nm, corresponding to 106 Colony Forming Units per mL (CFU/mL). The extract and fractions were solubilized in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO - Merck - Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany) for this procedure. Subsequently, 100 microliters of each fraction or extract at a concentration of 500 mg/mL underwent serial dilution in brain heart infusion broth (BHI – Difco - Detroit, MI, USA) within a 96-well plate (TPP - Trasadingen, Switzerland), alongside the positive control (0.12% Chlorhexidine - Sigma-Aldrich - St. Louis, MO, USA). Ten microliters of the microbial inoculum were then added to the wells, followed by incubation at 37 ± 0.5 °C for 24 hours. Bacterial growth was assessed by introducing 20 µL of aqueous resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich - St. Louis, MO, USA) at 0.01%, with a subsequent two-hour incubation at 37 ± 0.5 °C. Viable bacteria reduced the dye, causing a color change to blue, and the MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of the test substance that prevented the color change of resazurin.
The red blood cells were prepared for the cytotoxicity assay following the method outlined by Cruz-Silva et al. (2000). Whole blood, type O+, was obtained from a voluntary individual in our laboratory and anticoagulated with heparin. After centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes, the plasma was removed, and the erythrocyte suspension was washed thrice with 1% saline solution. The erythrocytes were then re-suspended in the same solution, adjusting the volume to 5%. Subsequently, 1.5 mL of 5% erythrocyte suspension was combined with 1.5 mL of test solutions at concentrations of 1.0 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL, and 5.0 mg/mL in tubes, and left at room temperature for 1 hour to induce hemolysis. Following this incubation period, each tube underwent centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was collected for spectrophotometric analysis at 540 nm using a Shimadzu UV-mini - 1240. Turk's solution 1% served as the positive control, while 1% saline solution acted as the negative control. The experiment was conducted in triplicate. The hemolyzing potential was calculated using the formula: Hp = Ae − Ab / At x 100, where Hp represents the hemolyzing potential in percentage, Ae is the absorbance of the test sample, Ab is the absorbance of the negative control, and At is the absorbance of the positive control (Cruz-Silva et al. 2001).
The data obtained from the linearity curve of each sample facilitated the determination of the optimal concentration of each extract required to induce 50% hemolysis of red blood cells (IC50). These findings were instrumental in calculating the selectivity index (SI) of each extract towards the tested bacteria, following the methodology outlined by Protopopova et al. (2005). The calculation involved the formula: SI = IC50 MIC, where SI represents the Selectivity Index, IC50 denotes the concentration of each extract causing 50% hemolysis of red blood cells, and MIC stands for the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration against the specific test microorganism.
The total flavonoid content was determined following the method outlined by Meda et al. (2005). In this procedure, aluminum chloride (AlCl3) was introduced to the extract and subsequently diluted in 2% methanol. Following a 10-minute incubation period, the sample was subjected to spectrophotometric analysis at an absorbance of 415 nm using a Shimadzu UV mini-1240 instrument. Calibration was achieved through the use of quercetin solutions, enabling the quantification of flavonoids in milligrams equivalent to quercetin.
The quantification of total tannins was conducted following the methodology outlined by Makkar & Becker (1993). A 4% (w/v) vanillin solution in methanol was introduced to the extract, followed by the addition of 1.5 mL of concentrated HCl (37%). Subsequently, the absorbance was measured at 500 nm using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV mini - 1240). The final result was calculated by interpolating the absorbance values of the samples against a calibration curve generated from catechin standards and reported as mg catechin equivalents per gram of extract.
To determine the total polyphenol content, the method outlined by Chandra and Mejia (2004) was employed, involving the addition of Folin-Ciocalteu 1N to the aqueous extract. Following a 2-minute interval, a 20% sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution was introduced and left to react for 10 minutes. Subsequently, the absorbance at 757 nm was measured using a Shimadzu UV mini - 1240 spectrophotometer. The calibration curve was constructed using gallic acid solutions, enabling the quantification of polyphenols in milligrams of gallic acid equivalents.
All analyses were conducted in triplicate.
Each sample underwent analysis using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to quantify gallic acid, following the method outlined by Schieber et al. (2001). The chromatographic assessment was carried out on Shimatzu equipment from Shimadzu Corporation in Kyoto, Japan, equipped with a diode array detector (model SPD-M10A) and a C-18 column (Phenomenex Gemine - 4.6 mm x 250 mm x i.d. 3 µm) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The analysis was performed at a wavelength of 272 nm, with the column maintained at 30 °C. The mobile phase consisted of 1% formic acid in methanol (90:10, v/v), and each sample was injected in a volume of 10 µL.
The thermogravimetric curve (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were conducted using a DTG-60 instrument manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation in Kyoto, Japan. The samples underwent heating at a rate of 10 °C/min, starting from 25 °C and reaching 900 °C, all within a nitrogen atmosphere. Each sample, weighing approximately 7.0 mg, was placed in an alumina crucible as described by Sette-de-Souza et al. (2018).
In Table I, it is evident that all tested samples exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration against microorganism growth, with the additional observation of the absence of cytotoxicity across all samples.
Table II presents the results of the quantitative phytochemical characterization conducted on the extract and fractions of S. brasiliensis Engl. It is evident that tannins are absent in all fractions, with the exception of the Ethanolic Extract, where tannins are detected.
The quantitative analysis of phytochemical extracts and fractions of S. brasiliensis Engl. revealed significant levels of polyphenols. Consequently, gallic acid was selected as a marker for further quantification of the samples. Across all samples examined, a predominant abundance of gallic acid was evident, with a retention time of approximately 3.0 minutes (refer to Figure 1).
Based on the standard curve (y = 61635x - 11502; R² = 0.9957), the chloroform fraction exhibited the highest concentration of gallic acid at 52.02 mg/g, followed by the ethyl acetate fraction at 50.39 mg/g, and the ethanol extract at 15.56 mg/g. Conversely, the hexane fraction contained the lowest amount of gallic acid at 6.51 mg/g.
The TG and DTA curves of the ethanol extract, fractions, and gallic acid are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. The peaks corresponding to each event are detailed in Table III.
All tested extracts exhibited higher MIC values against the bacteria compared to the positive control (0.12% chlorhexidine). As noted by Castro et al. (2009), this disparity can be attributed to the presence of biological compounds in the natural products, in contrast to the synthetic nature of chlorhexidine. It is crucial to acknowledge that despite its efficacy, chlorhexidine is associated with adverse effects that restrict its prolonged use. In a systematic review by Haas et al. (2014), chlorhexidine demonstrated effectiveness in reducing biofilm and gingivitis, yet its usage is recommended for short durations due to potential side effects. Natural agent-based products, on the other hand, are deemed more suitable for daily use. Consequently, the hexane fraction of the EE of S. brasiliensis Engl emerges as a promising candidate for inclusion in preventive and therapeutic dental products, given its efficacy against Streptococcus mitis, S. oralis, and S. mutans, which play pivotal roles in tooth surface colonization and the development of dental caries and related conditions. Additionally, Duarte et al. (2006) have documented the efficacy of phenolic compounds against S. mutans biofilm, providing further rationale for the utilization of the extract in this context.
The samples exhibited no cytotoxicity at the tested concentration, a finding consistent with Santos et al. (2014). Bézivin et al. (2003) explain that the Selectivity Index (SI) quantifies the relative effectiveness of a test product against specific target cells compared to human cells. For a compound to be deemed an ideal prototype for a new drug, it is generally expected that the SI surpasses or equals 10 (Protopopova et al. 2005). As highlighted by Reimão et al. (2010), an increasing SI value suggests heightened toxicity towards microorganisms while being less harmful to human cells. Given that the SI values of all tested samples exceeded the threshold set by the authors, the outcomes of this study hold significance in the pursuit of natural product development, as low toxicity, coupled with satisfactory antimicrobial activity, emerges as a promising attribute.
Other studies on S. brasiliensis Engl. have demonstrated a separation of phytochemicals with increased polarity (Santos et al., 2014). None of the fractions studied exhibited tannins equivalent to catechin, although the ethyl acetate fraction showed 15.83 mg/g of tannins. This discrepancy could be attributed to the varying polarities of the solvents used, potentially resulting in the inadequate extraction of compounds with similar polarities to catechin. This, however, does not imply that the samples derived from S. brasiliensis Engl. bark lack tannins. The flavonoid content in each fraction exceeded that of the ethyl acetate fraction, likely due to the higher concentration of compounds in the fractions compared to the ethyl acetate extract. Santos et al. (2014) qualitatively identified aurones, catechins, chalcones, flavonones, saponins, and tannins in the ethyl acetate fraction, while the hexane and chloroform fractions exclusively contained steroids and triterpenes, respectively. Unlike our study, these authors did not quantify the compounds but rather observed their presence or absence without utilizing a standard compound, potentially accounting for the discrepancies observed in the ethyl acetate fraction. Furthermore, when working with natural products and compounds, it is crucial to consider factors influencing the production of secondary metabolites in plants, such as collection period, rainfall, seasonality, and natural predators (Gouvea et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014; Moore et al., 2014). Therefore, the differences observed may be attributed to the collection of Schinopsis brasiliensis parts in a different region and time period by those authors compared to our study.
In the differential thermal analysis (DTA) curve, it was noted that the EE exhibited lower heat absorption compared to the fractions. All samples displayed an endothermic peak within the temperature range of 85.0 to 130.0 °C, which aligns with the loss of humidity, water, and/or volatile solvents present in each system. The thermogravimetric (TG) curve of the EE revealed three distinct thermal decomposition events. The initial event, occurring between 30.00 and 86.96 °C, was attributed to the evaporation of water and solvent from the extract, resulting in a mass loss of approximately 4.55% of the total sample. The subsequent event (87.01 to 205.75 °C) likely corresponds to the degradation of phytochemical compounds like tannins and flavonoids within the sample, leading to a mass loss of 21.54% (1.33 mg). The final event (starting from 205.85 °C) could be linked to the degradation of gallic acid present in the sample, as evidenced by the temperature alignment with the second step where phenol degradation accounts for 51.33% of the total sample mass (3.17 mg). The chloroform fraction exhibited a curve closely resembling that of the EE, showing similar thermal decomposition peaks and mass percentage losses in each step.
The thermal gravimetric (TG) curve of the ethyl acetate fraction exhibits three distinct stages of thermal decomposition. Initially, between 29.35 and 225.23 °C, a similar pattern to that observed in EE is noted. However, apart from the expected loss of moisture and residual solvent fraction, there appears to be an additional compound undergoing degradation, accounting for 16.97% of the total mass (1.13 mg). The subsequent phase, occurring between 225.30 and 327.87 °C, is likely associated with the breakdown of flavonoids and gallic acid within the sample, with the latter contributing to 26.42% of the mass loss (1.76 mg), given its exothermic degradation peak around 263 ºC. The final decomposition phase initiates at 328.00 ºC, possibly indicating the degradation of carbonaceous residues, which do not undergo complete degradation, resulting in a mass loss of 46.23%.
The thermogravimetric (TG) curve of the hexane fraction exhibits two distinct degradation phenomena. The initial degradation, spanning from 29.78 to 201.52 °C, is attributed to the evaporation of water and residual solvent components, accounting for 9.72% of the total mass. The subsequent degradation, occurring between 201.53 and 479.82 °C, results in a significant mass loss of 81.97%, equivalent to 5.80 mg of the fraction. This phase essentially decomposes nearly all compounds present in the sample.
The endothermic peaks observed in the DTA align with the degradation temperature ranges identified in the sample TG curves, with no exothermic events detected. Comparatively, the more polar fractions exhibit distinct endothermic peaks in contrast to the peaks of the EE and ethyl acetate fraction. This suggests that both the hexane and chloroform fractions necessitate lower heat levels to initiate their degradation processes.
The ethanolic extract (EE) of Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl bark has demonstrated promising antimicrobial activity against bacteria responsible for the initial colonization of tooth surfaces and the onset of caries. Furthermore, its low cytotoxicity and high selectivity make it a viable candidate for inclusion in dental formulations aimed at controlling oral biofilm. The findings suggest that all samples of this extract have the potential to serve as effective ingredients in oral care products.
