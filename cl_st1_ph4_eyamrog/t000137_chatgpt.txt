Recent perspectives have underscored the significance of maintaining physical activity levels during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Despite this emphasis, limited research has delved into the potential link between physical activity and the exacerbation of clinical outcomes, hospitalizations, or mortality rates associated with the novel coronavirus.
The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between physical activity levels and mortality due to Covid-19 in the major cities of Brazil.
Methods: An observational cross-sectional ecological study was conducted to analyze data on the prevalence of leisure time physical activity and deaths due to Covid-19 in 26 Brazilian capitals and the Federal District. Data on the prevalence of leisure time physical activity, obesity, and hypertension were collected from the Risk Factors Surveillance System for chronic non-communicable diseases of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Information on accumulated deaths, lethality of the disease, and mortality rate was extracted from Brazil's Unified National Health System (SUS). Analytical data on COVID-19 in Brazil, available on the website of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, was also utilized. For data analysis, simple Pearson correlation and multiple regression were employed with a significance level set at 5%.
Results indicate a significant inverse correlation between leisure time physical activity and accumulated deaths (r = -0.44, p = 0.03), mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants (r = -0.43, p = 0.02), and the lethality of the disease (r = -0.51, p = 0.01). Furthermore, the findings reveal an inverse association between leisure time physical activity and accumulated deaths (β = -485.1, p = 0.04), as well as with the lethality of the disease (β = -0.21, p = 0.02), even after adjusting for confounding variables.
Conclusions: Engaging in leisure time physical activity can serve as a significant asset in managing the challenges posed by Covid-19. The inverse relationship identified between physical activity levels and the rates of deaths and disease severity underscores the need for critical evaluation of the strategies adopted by governmental bodies at both state and municipal levels in promoting physical activity among the populace.
The scientific community widely acknowledges the significant benefits of physical activity on cardiometabolic, immunological, and mental health. Regular physical activity plays a crucial role in preventing obesity, high blood pressure, and other cardiometabolic disorders, which are known risk factors for the severity of hospital admissions related to Covid-19. In terms of the immune system, individuals who engage in regular physical activity may possess more robust defense mechanisms, potentially reducing the inflammatory response triggered by the interaction between the virus and immune cells. Consequently, mitigating the inflammatory process in the lungs could lead to a less severe clinical condition for patients, potentially averting the need for more aggressive interventions like mechanical ventilation.
In a recent publication, it was highlighted that physical inactivity poses a significant risk factor for hospital admissions due to COVID-19, emphasizing the potential benefits of adopting a more active lifestyle in reducing the severity of Covid-19 infections. Some perspectives underscore the importance of maintaining physical activity and minimizing sedentary behavior amidst the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, urging government authorities to recognize physical activity as essential when implementing population movement restrictions. Furthermore, it is noted that alongside the current Covid-19 crisis, other pandemics like physical inactivity and obesity are also impacting global health significantly, underscoring the urgent need to address these issues for the well-being of the world population.
Research on influenza/H1N1, extrapolated to the current pandemic, indicates that higher levels of physical activity in the population are linked to reduced mortality rates and less severe cases of COVID-19. A recent study analyzing public domain data from 45 African countries found a correlation between inadequate physical activity levels and increased mortality from COVID-19.
Publications emphasize the significance of regular physical activity in mitigating the severity of infection caused by the novel coronavirus. Some even propose the administration of doses of physical activity as a preventive measure for future pandemics. Additionally, research indicates that physically active elderly individuals experience enhanced protective effects from the influenza vaccine, a phenomenon that could potentially extend to the current pandemic as well.
Given the scarcity of original studies linking physical activity to the exacerbation of clinical outcomes, hospitalizations, and mortality associated with COVID-19, alongside numerous perspectives underscoring the significance of physical activity amidst the backdrop of the novel coronavirus, as well as a body of research on physical activity and influenza with findings extrapolated to the ongoing pandemic, this study has the potential to enhance existing knowledge regarding the relationship between physical activity and Covid-19, thereby enriching comprehension of this subject matter.
The study aimed to investigate the correlation between physical activity levels and mortality due to Covid-19 in major Brazilian cities.
This study is an observational cross-sectional ecological study that analyzed data on the prevalence of leisure time physical activity (LTPA), accumulated deaths, disease lethality, and mortality rates due to Covid-19 in 26 Brazilian capitals and the Federal District.
Data from the Risk Factor Surveillance System for chronic non-communicable diseases (VIGITEL 2019) published by the Ministry of Health of Brazil in 2019 was utilized to gather information on the prevalence of LTPA, obesity, and arterial hypertension. Additionally, data on deaths up to January 22, 2021, was extracted from the Analytical SUS: data on COVID-19 in Brazil, available on the Ministry of Health of Brazil's website. This data included accumulated deaths by Covid-19, lethality of the disease, and mortality rate by Covid-19 per one hundred thousand inhabitants, specifically focusing on Brazilian capitals and the Federal District.
Initially, Pearson's simple correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between Leisure-Time Physical Activity (LTPA) and various Covid-19 related variables including accumulated deaths, lethality, and mortality rates per 100 thousand inhabitants. Subsequently, a multiple regression analysis was performed to further explore the association between LTPA and the aforementioned Covid-19 metrics, while controlling for obesity and arterial hypertension. The adequacy of the final model was assessed through various statistical tests including analysis of residuals, adjusted determination coefficient, sum of squares of regression residues, normality test of regression residues, and identification of any outliers. The significance level set for the analysis was <0.05. The statistical software STATA 12.0 was utilized for data analysis.
Data regarding the prevalence of the variables examined in the study, along with the cumulative Covid-19 related deaths, the lethality of the disease, and the mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants in each of the Brazilian capitals can be found in Table 1.
The research article presents Figures 1, 2, and 3 illustrating the straightforward correlations among Leisure-Time Physical Activity (LTPA), cumulative deaths, lethality of the disease, and COVID-19 mortality per 100,000 individuals. These figures demonstrate an inverse and statistically significant relationship between LTPA and metrics such as accumulated deaths, mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants, and disease lethality.
The tables presented in this study display the results of multiple regression analyses conducted to examine the relationships between the variables under investigation. Notably, statistically significant regression coefficients were observed in the associations between Leisure-Time Physical Activity (LTPA), accumulated deaths, and disease lethality, even after accounting for confounding variables. However, when considering the multiple regression analysis between LTPA and the Covid-19 mortality rate per 100 thousand inhabitants, the previously observed statistical significance in the association was no longer evident.
The study conducted an ecological analysis to examine the relationship between physical activity, cumulative deaths, COVID-19 lethality, and mortality rate per 100,000 individuals. Findings revealed a negative association, persisting even after controlling for confounding factors, between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), cumulative deaths, and disease lethality. Despite the inherent limitations of ecological studies, the insights gleaned from these analyses can provide a foundation for future research endeavors.
In this context, given the recent nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, our review of the literature revealed a scarcity of studies examining the relationship between physical activity levels and the exacerbation of clinical outcomes, hospitalizations, and mortality due to Covid-19. Among the limited research available, a study conducted in England highlighted physical inactivity as a significant risk factor for Covid-19-related hospital admissions. It is noteworthy, however, that the data on physical activity levels were collected between 2006 and 2010, approximately a decade prior to the emergence of the pandemic.
A more recent study, mirroring characteristics akin to our own, conducted across 45 African countries revealed a correlation between physical inactivity and Covid-19 mortality. Notably, this association was evident solely in cumulative deaths, losing statistical significance when adjusted for deaths per million inhabitants. Our study, on the other hand, successfully showcased an inverse relationship between physical activity and cumulative deaths, deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, and Covid-19 lethality. Furthermore, a recent publication highlighted that athletes exhibit lower probabilities of hospital admission, ICU admission, or mortality from Covid-19 compared to non-athletes.
Despite the existing gap in the literature, recent perspectives have emerged regarding physical activity and Covid-19. The first viewpoint, originating from Wuhan, China, the initial epicenter of the disease, underscored the significance of maintaining physical activity during the pandemic, even advocating for home-based exercises. Subsequently, researchers from Spain and the USA, focusing on the elderly population, highlighted the therapeutic benefits of engaging in physical exercise outdoors or at home to alleviate the physical and mental repercussions of quarantine imposed by the Covid-19 crisis. Furthermore, the American College of Sports Medicine weighed in by recommending the continuation of physical activity, whether outdoors or indoors, amidst the ongoing pandemic.
The "Manifesto for the Promotion of Physical Activity in Post-COVID" was recently published in Brazil, aiming to sensitize and mobilize diverse population groups, governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private initiatives towards promoting a more active lifestyle. This initiative recognizes the preventive effects of physical activity in mitigating pandemics like COVID-19.
A publication by Italian researchers discusses lessons learned from studies on influenza and physical activity in obese patients, suggesting that these findings may be applicable to Covid-19. The authors highlight the significance of physical activity in boosting the positive immunomodulation associated with light to moderate intensity exercise, particularly in obese individuals.
A strong relationship between physical exercise and extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD) enzymes has been noted in recent studies. It has been demonstrated that moderate-intensity exercise can increase EcSOD enzymes while simultaneously reducing the cytotoxic activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) cells. EcSOD, known as a molecular transducer of the health benefits of exercise, has also been linked to lower levels of endothelial tissue damage. These findings underscore the importance of physical activity in promoting the production of EcSOD enzymes and protecting against oxidative stress-related damage in the body.
Another significant study that has garnered considerable attention delves into the impact of the Irisin hormone on the immune system. This groundbreaking research, conducted by scholars at São Paulo State University (UNESP), posits that Irisin, a hormone released from muscles in response to physical activity, may hold significant therapeutic potential for individuals afflicted with COVID-19. Through an analysis of adipose cell gene expression, the researchers discovered that Irisin could modulate genes linked to the replication of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 within human cells. Their findings indicated that in uninfected adipocytes, Irisin altered the expression of genes responsible for regulating ACE-2, a protein crucial for the virus's invasion of human cells.
It is important to note that while only one study has been identified regarding the link between physical activity and Covid-19 mortality, there are several publications discussing the relationship between physical activity and influenza. For instance, a study conducted by researchers in Hong Kong revealed a lower mortality rate among individuals who engaged in low to moderate intensity exercise. Additionally, another publication suggested that higher levels of physical activity could potentially decrease the risk and severity of influenza infection in individuals under the age of 65. These findings underscore the potential benefits of physical activity in mitigating the impact of respiratory illnesses such as influenza.
Our findings reveal a significant inverse relationship between physical activity and the cumulative deaths caused by Covid-19, as well as the lethality of the disease. Examination of Tables 3 and 4 illustrates that with every 1% rise in physical activity prevalence, there is an estimated decrease of around 485 Covid-19 related deaths and a 0.21% reduction in disease lethality. It is noteworthy that the World Health Organization (WHO) outlined the Global Action Plan for physical activity 2018-2030 in 2018, urging all nations to strive for a 10% reduction in physical inactivity by 2025 and 15% by 2030.
The study's strength lies in being among the first to examine the relationship between physical activity and Covid-19 related deaths. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the findings due to the ecological nature of the study, which analyzes groups rather than individuals, potentially leading to a lack of detailed information on the variables under analysis. Furthermore, the absence of average age and socioeconomic data from Brazilian capitals in VIGITEL hindered the use of these variables as potential confounders. It is important to note that the data utilized is from VIGITEL 2019, as 2020 data will only be available later in 2021. Regarding mortality information, it is crucial to acknowledge that the results presented may evolve over time, given the changing number of deaths in response to the ongoing pandemic.
The findings of this study suggest that engaging in leisure time physical activity could serve as a valuable tool in managing the challenges posed by Covid-19. The observed inverse relationship between physical activity, Covid-19 related deaths, and disease lethality prompts critical reflections on the strategies adopted by governmental bodies at both state and municipal levels. The preliminary data indicating that a mere 1% increase in physical activity prevalence could potentially lead to a reduction of around 485 Covid-19 deaths, alongside a 0.21% decrease in disease lethality, underscores the urgent need for policymakers to internalize these insights. It is imperative that concrete and secure measures are devised to enhance physical activity levels within the populace, thereby fortifying our readiness for the ongoing pandemic and any potential future outbreaks resembling the current scenario. Notably, aligning the outcomes of this study with the World Health Organization's objective of boosting global physical activity prevalence by 10% theoretically suggests a 2.1% decline in disease lethality, potentially eradicating mortality in select Brazilian cities. Future research avenues, including prospective and retrospective observational studies, as well as clinical trials, are recommended to validate the findings of this ecological study.
