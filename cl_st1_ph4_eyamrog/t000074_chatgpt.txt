The psychology of religion has its roots in mainstream psychology, with psychologists increasingly turning their attention to studying religion from a scientific standpoint. This shift in focus has led to the exploration of religion from a psychological perspective. This essay aims to trace the history of the psychology of religion, examining the key historical developments and methodological approaches employed by scholars in America and Europe. It recognizes the intriguing evolution of the field from a primarily philosophical concept to a psychological one, while also shedding light on the methodological challenges that continue to be encountered from both American and European viewpoints. The psychology of religion presents itself as a captivating yet demanding area of study, marked by numerous changes, refutations, and limitations due to the complex nature of religion and spirituality. Nevertheless, this article asserts that significant progress has been made through the combined efforts of American and European scholars.
Loewenthal (2008) posited that the history of the psychology of religion traces back to Wilhelm Wundt in 1879, a widely acknowledged figure in the field. While stationed at the University of Leipzig during that year, Wilhelm transformed psychology into a scientific discipline by establishing the inaugural psychological laboratory. Despite this consensus, there are dissenting voices claiming that American psychologist William James played a pivotal role in the development of the psychology of religion. Nelson (2009) highlighted James' significant contributions, noting that in 1891, James released his seminal work "The Principles of Psychology," followed by "The Varieties of Religious Experience" in 1902. Despite primarily being a philosopher and lecturer in Harvard University's philosophy department, James' "The Varieties of Religious Experience" notably influenced his subsequent psychological writings.
During this period, psychologists aimed to distinguish psychology from philosophy and the study of religion from theology, as noted by Upton (2008). Upton also highlighted Max Muller's significant works, "The Introduction to the Science of Religion" in 1873 and "Natural Religion" in 1889, along with E.B. Taylor's "Primitive Culture" in 1871. These publications marked a pivotal moment in the development of new methodologies for studying religion, signaling the onset of applying these emerging methodologies in the field.
Connolly (1999) noted that American scholars are credited with pioneering psychological investigations into the study of religion, although European scholars like Francis Galton, with his statistical investigations into the efficacy of prayer in 1869, also made contributions to the scientific study of religion, albeit not to the same extent as their American counterparts. It was highlighted that an American psychologist, Stanley Hall, established the first school of religious psychology at Clark University. Loewenthal (2008) emphasized that Hall played a pivotal role in inviting Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung to America in 1909, aiming to further psychological discoveries. Hall's expertise lay in the moral and religious education of children, and psychologists of religion commonly trace the origins of their field back to 1882 when Hall delivered an address on moral and religious education.
The historical breakthrough occurred when two major trends in studying religion within psychology were recognized. Kruger (1981) identified these trends as descriptive and explanatory. The descriptive trend delves into religion from an internal perspective, drawing from religious texts like scriptures and spiritual works such as St. Augustine's confessions. On the other hand, the explanatory trend examines religion from an external viewpoint, tracing its roots back to ancient Greek philosophers like Euhemerus and extending to the Enlightenment era with thinkers like David Hume, who suggested that religion stemmed from fear rather than genuine belief. This approach seeks to interpret religious phenomena beyond traditional religious texts. Philosophers such as Euhemerus and Lucretius, along with psychologists like Ludwig and Freud, played pivotal roles in advancing this perspective. Upton (2008) observed that while scholars could potentially utilize both trends, the emphasis typically falls on one, as seen throughout the psychology of religion literature. These trends ultimately paved the way for methodological approaches in the study of psychology of religion.
In the history of psychology of religion, two prevailing methods have been identified: quantitative and qualitative research methods, with instances of their combination in mixed methods studies. Kruger (1981) noted a preference among American theorists and psychologists for quantitative methods, contrasting with their European counterparts who lean towards qualitative methods. Quantitative research methods are often associated with a "scientific approach," exemplified in the works of American scholars such as Clarke, Hall, Starbucks, and Leuba. Kruger further observed that European psychologists and scholars tend to adopt internal approaches in studying religion, diverging from the rigorous scientific methods that rely on externally verifiable data derived from sensory experience.
Kruger (1981) noted that Francis Galton was among the first to conduct scientific studies on religion, particularly focusing on the objective efficacy of petitionary prayer. Durkheim, following a similar scientific approach, explored the statistical correlations in his work "The Elementary Forms of Religious Life." Additionally, psychologists like Stanley Hall introduced the questionnaire method to collect religious data, with his students Starbuck and Leuba adopting these scientific approaches in their own research. Upton (2008) highlighted Starbuck's use of statistical analysis, including frequency distributions and percentages, in studying the psychology of conversion. Notably, many American scholars during this period favored laboratory tabulation and statistical references in their religious studies, reflecting a broader trend of seeking to explain the psychology of religion through scientific methodologies.
The biological foundations of religion approach in America have sparked controversy due to its focus on the relationship between the mind and body. Connolly (1999) posits that this approach seeks to demonstrate the significant impact bodily conditions have on an individual's psychological states. It suggests that various religious rituals and practices engage our senses. Hall, as noted by Connolly (1999), was the pioneer in applying this approach in his study on adolescent conversion. Another proponent of this method, according to Connolly (1999), is L.L. Dawson, who explored the comprehension of cults. However, it is worth noting that some scholars argue that Sir Francis Galton was actually the first to utilize this approach when he conducted the initial experiment in the psychology of religion, focusing on the objective efficacy of petitionary prayer.
In contrast, European psychologists of religion have employed diverse methodologies in their examination of religious phenomena. Connolly (1999) highlighted Wilhelm Wundt's approach, which involved painstakingly reconstructing the history of religion and proposing an evolutionary framework to explain it. Additionally, Karl Girgensohn from the Dorpat School utilized experimental introspection as a method to investigate religious experiences.
German psychologists such as Sigmund Freud, a Moravian-born pioneer, along with Oskar Pfister and Carl Jung, utilized the psychoanalytic method in their work. Freud, who posited that religious beliefs and practices stem from childhood fears and desires, laid the groundwork for this approach. Religion, in this context, is seen as fulfilling the unconscious mind's needs. Additionally, the development of religion is linked to psychosexual stages of development, as highlighted by Loewenthal (2008).
Moran (2000) noted that Europeans, including Rudolf Otto and Friedrich Heiler, were proponents of the phenomenological approach. According to Creswell (2013), Phenomenology is characterized by its use of qualitative research methods and its emphasis on the shared lived experiences within a specific group. The primary objective of this approach is to provide a detailed description of the essence of a particular phenomenon. This necessitated a paradigm shift in religious studies, where researchers were required to set aside their personal beliefs, suspend judgment, and refrain from imposing academic theories on the subject of investigation prior to conducting the study.
Upton (2008) posited that the Cognitive Developmental approach to religion has been pivotal in elucidating how children adapt to their environment and interpret events. He highlighted Jean Piaget's assertion that cognitive structures, termed schemata, underlie organized behavioral patterns, and that mental activities progress from observable behaviors to symbolically representing these structures with age and experience. Nelson (2009) further expounded on this, emphasizing the correlation between age and mental development. This theory laid the groundwork for religious theorists to expound on religion and its components, inspiring subsequent theories like Lawrence Kohlberg's moral development and Ronald Goldman's religious development in the 1960s. James Fowler, in the 1970s, extended Piaget's stage theory to religious development, broadening its application. Piaget's approach gained traction in Europe as a significant method for studying religion by linking it to child cognitive development.
European psychologists like Ivan Pavlov and B.F. Skinner employed Behaviorism as a tool to investigate religious behavior. Upton (2008) contended that the Behavioristic approach to studying religion aimed to elucidate observable religious behaviors in connection with environmental stimuli. He also noted that the theory is rooted in empiricism, prioritizing sensory experience over reason as the basis of knowledge. This methodology operates under the premise that core tenets of faith can be quantified.
The humanistic approach to the study of religion delves into the essence of individual human existence, focusing on the capacity to make choices and seek fulfillment. Scholars in this field underscore personal accountability for actions and the autonomy to plan and select behaviors, as articulated by Nelson (2009). A prominent figure in this realm is William James (1891), renowned for his seminal work "The Varieties of Religious Experiences," which underscores the humanistic perspective. Another significant contributor is the European humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow (1908-1970), who employed humanistic methodologies to explore religious satisfaction and experiences. However, Upton (2008) posited that while American theorists may have initiated this approach, it was more enthusiastically embraced by their European counterparts. European scholars tended to prioritize qualitative research methods in their exploration of religion through a humanistic lens, in contrast to American scholars like Starbuck, Coe, and Leuba, who favored a more rigorous scientific approach.
As previously discussed, psychology boasts a rich historical background. However, the study of religion presents numerous challenges when approached from a scientific and psychological standpoint, primarily due to its connections with metaphysical concepts and human experiences that resist easy empirical analysis. Nevertheless, the diverse array of methodologies employed in the psychological study of religion, spanning from external to internal perspectives, has proven successful in elucidating the nature of religion and its various components, as evidenced by the aforementioned research findings.
