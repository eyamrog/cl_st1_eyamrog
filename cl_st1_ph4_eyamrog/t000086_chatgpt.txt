Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a common treatment for various diseases, yet it can lead to significant complications such as Oral Mucositis (OM) and Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) serves as a peripheral biomarker of systemic inflammation and an independent prognostic factor in numerous inflammatory conditions. The objective of this study was to assess the correlation between NLR levels and the occurrence of OM and GVHD in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. The study included patients who had undergone allogeneic HSCT at the Bone Marrow Transplant Service at the Hospital de Clínicas Complex of the Federal University of Paraná. Sociodemographic information and blood count data were extracted from patients' medical records, with NLR values calculated and then analyzed in relation to OM and GVHD. The results, based on a cohort of 45 patients, revealed that NLR levels were notably elevated in individuals with OM and oral GVHD compared to those without these conditions, although no statistically significant difference was observed. In conclusion, while both OM and GVHD are linked to inflammatory responses and immune system reactions, no direct association with NLR was established in this study. Future investigations incorporating additional variables related to HSCT may uncover potential associations, thereby enhancing patient care and preventive strategies.
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is widely regarded as a curative therapy for a range of neoplastic and non-neoplastic hematological disorders that result in bone marrow abnormalities, including anemia, leukemia, and lymphoma. This process involves the replacement of recipient cells with infused hematopoietic progenitor cells.
Oral mucositis (OM) and Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) are potential complications following Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). OM, characterized by mucosal inflammation, affects around 75% of patients undergoing ablative chemotherapy or total body irradiation as part of the conditioning regimen for HSCT. This condition typically peaks within the initial two weeks post-transplantation, leading to challenges in food intake due to associated pain and discomfort [5].
The pathophysiology of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains incompletely understood [6]. However, current knowledge indicates that it arises from an immunological assault by donor immunocompetent T cells on the recipient patient's tissues [7], either directly or through heightened inflammatory responses following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), occurring in 30 to 50% of cases [7, 8, 9]. GVHD can impact various body sites and is recognized as a major contributor to morbidity and mortality post-HSCT. The oral cavity is commonly affected, particularly in chronic forms that emerge after the 100th day post-HSCT, affecting 25% to 83% of patients [1, 3, 8, 10].
The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), as initially described by Zahorec et al. [11], serves as a peripheral biomarker of systemic inflammation and an independent prognostic factor in various inflammatory, cardiovascular diseases, as well as solid and hematological neoplasms [11, 12, 13, 14]. This ratio represents an indirect measure of the imbalance between the innate immune (neutrophils) and adaptive or humorous (lymphocytes) systems, calculated by dividing the absolute count of neutrophils by the absolute count of lymphocytes. Notably, it stands out as a biomarker due to its low cost, reliability, and ease of collection through a routine peripheral blood count [11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Widely applicable in a range of inflammatory conditions [11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], the NLR emerges as a crucial marker for poor prognosis, overall survival, and disease-free survival [19].
Limited evidence exists regarding the utilization of NLR as a biomarker post-HSCT, with potentially no indication of its relevance in assessing OM and GVHD following the procedure. Both OM and GVHD represent exacerbated inflammatory processes that significantly influence the patient's prognosis post-allogeneic HSCT. Hence, it becomes imperative to explore markers that could aid in predicting, managing, and treating these conditions effectively. Given NLR's relevance in various inflammatory disorders, this study aims to investigate the correlation between NLR levels and the occurrence of OM and GVHD in allogeneic HSCT patients.
This longitudinal observational study included a convenience sample of 45 patients aged 18 years and older who were admitted to the Serviço de Transplante de Medula Óssea at the Complexo Hospital de Clínicas of the Universidade Federal do Paraná and underwent allogeneic HSCT.
The study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Complexo Hospital de Clínicas at the Universidade Federal do Paraná, with the reference number 4.414.355. Participants who consented to be part of the study signed the Informed Consent Form. Inclusion criteria encompassed patients over 18 years undergoing HSCT, while exclusion criteria included those undergoing autologous HSCT and individuals with Fanconi Anemia as an underlying condition. Sociodemographic information and blood count results were extracted from patients' medical records. The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) was computed using Excel for Windows. Oral mucositis (OM) and Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) were evaluated through physical examinations and categorized based on the MASCC/ISOO guidelines 2020 and NIH 2014 classifications, respectively. NLR data for OM association were gathered from blood counts taken 15 days post-HSCT, a period known for severe manifestations. For GVHD, patients were monitored for 180 days post-HSCT on a monthly basis. NLR data for GVHD association were obtained from blood counts on the day of GVHD diagnosis, while data from patients without GVHD symptoms were collected during the final follow-up visit, 180 days post-HSCT. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM - Armonk, New York).
The sample comprised 45 patients, predominantly male (61.7%), with an average age of 37 years. The most prevalent underlying condition was Severe Aplastic Anemia (31.9%), succeeded by Acute Myeloid Leukemia (29.8%). Sixty-six percent of donors were related, with 55.3% being matched.
In this study, it was observed that men exhibited a higher frequency of oral mucositis (OM) in comparison to women. The predominant underlying disease associated with OM was Severe Aplastic Anemia. The majority of allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) cases were related, and individuals who secured an unrelated donor with a favorable match predominantly experienced OM. Interestingly, patients displayed symptoms of OM irrespective of graft compatibility.
The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) exhibited a notable increase in patients with Oral Mucositis (OM) compared to those without the condition. However, no statistically significant variances were observed in OM occurrence concerning sex, underlying disease, donor relation, match, age, and NLR. The distribution of the sample based on sex, underlying disease, donor relation, and match in relation to the presence or absence of OM is detailed in Table 1.
In terms of oral GVHD, the study found that the majority of the sample consisted of men. The most prevalent underlying hematological disease observed was Severe Aplastic Anemia, followed by Acute Myeloid Leukemia. In terms of the donor relation for allogeneic HSCT, the majority were related and matched. A notable finding was that over 30% (10 out of 31) of the sample developed oral manifestations of GVHD. Furthermore, the analysis of the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) revealed that the results were higher in patients with oral GVHD compared to those without.
In the case of non-oral GVHD, comparable outcomes were observed: a significant portion of the cohort comprised males, predominantly diagnosed with Severe Aplastic Anemia, often having a related and matched donor. Those who developed non-oral GVHD exhibited notably elevated NLR levels in contrast to patients who did not experience this complication.
No statistically significant difference was observed for oral and non-oral GVHD in relation to the variables of sex, underlying disease, donor relation, match, age, and NLR, except for the donor relation in non-oral GVHD, as depicted in Tables 2 and 3.
The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) serves as a straightforward parameter for evaluating an individual's inflammatory status. Extensively studied, it has emerged as a robust prognostic indicator across various cancer types, significant cardiac events, and as a marker for inflammation, infectious diseases, and postoperative complications [26, 27].
Ohtaka et al. (2018) noted a continuous increase in NLR values during follow-up in cases where malignant diseases developed post-kidney transplantation. The correlation between NLR and bullous pemphigoid prognosis can be attributed to the inflammatory processes linked with blistering. In a recent review by Doo et al. (2020), a low NLR was linked to a favorable prognosis in sensorineural hearing loss. Various studies have highlighted elevated NLR levels in a range of inflammatory conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Kawasaki disease, allergic rhinitis, psoriasis, acute appendicitis, chronic hepatitis C, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, Behçet's disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune encephalitis, rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic syndrome, and notably in severe COVID-19 patients. Consequently, NLR serves as a valuable biomarker for evaluating these inflammatory diseases, their activity, severity, and prognosis.
In light of the known association of NLR with inflammatory diseases, along with the recognition that OM and GVHD are linked to the activities of inflammatory cells, our hypothesis posited that NLR could potentially function as a biomarker for these manifestations. Our study revealed a heightened occurrence of NLR in patients exhibiting OM, both oral and non-oral GVHD, likely tied to the inflammatory processes at play in these scenarios. Despite this observation, our findings did not demonstrate a statistically significant correlation. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this investigation represents the initial exploration linking NLR with complications arising from allogeneic HSCT.
Malignant blood diseases, such as leukemia and lymphoma, inherently leading to bone marrow suppression, are frequently linked to oral complications. Oral lesions can act as a gateway for bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, particularly in patients receiving myelosuppressive or immunosuppressive chemotherapy for cancer treatment. These individuals experience oral issues at a significantly higher rate compared to those undergoing treatment for solid tumors. The findings of this study support this notion, as the majority of patients with malignant blood diseases exhibited oral mucositis (86.7%), highlighting the potential utility of a prognostic biomarker in managing this condition. Conversely, oral graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) showed a low prevalence within the study sample.
Research indicates that patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT are more prone to developing OM compared to autologous transplant recipients [11]. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding a direct comparison between related and unrelated grafts in allogeneic HSCT. In this study, it is observed that related HSCT accounts for the majority of allogeneic transplants (66.66%), highlighting the significant number of patients experiencing OM following HSCT from a related donor in contrast to those receiving unrelated HSCT.
In this study, no statistically significant differences were found in relation to gender when assessing patients who developed oral and non-oral GVHD. However, it is worth noting that when hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is conducted from a female donor to a male recipient, the risk of developing GVHD is heightened. It is important to highlight that the study did not specifically evaluate the impact of donor and recipient sex on the development of GVHD.
The predominant underlying condition observed in patients exhibiting symptoms of both oral and non-oral GVHD following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), accounting for 40% in oral GVHD cases and 50% in non-oral GVHD cases. This finding aligns with previous studies [33, 36], where Carlens et al. (1998) proposed AML as a potential risk factor for acute GVHD.
Although no statistically significant difference was observed in terms of age, donor relation, and match in oral and non-oral GVHD, a lower frequency was noted in individuals who were younger, had a related donor, and received a matched transplant. These findings support previous research, highlighting that recipient and donor age, HLA mismatch, and unrelated donors are clinical risk factors that heighten the likelihood of GVHD development. Studies by Castro Jr. et al. (2001) have shown that patients undergoing transplantation with unrelated donors face up to an 80% risk of developing GVHD.
An exception was noted in the donor relation in non-oral GVHD, where a statistically significant difference was detected (p = 0.029), as none of the patients who underwent an unrelated transplant developed GVHD. This finding contradicts the outcomes of previous studies [3, 33, 34, 35] that suggest a higher incidence of GVHD with unrelated donors. It is important to note that our results do not imply causation within this sample, as the limited number of patients exhibiting oral and non-oral GVHD could be attributed to the predominance of young adults in the sample and the prevalence of related and matched transplants among the individuals.
In our sample, no statistically significant difference was found for the NLR associated with OM, oral GVHD, and non-oral GVHD. Nevertheless, this study represents the first analysis of this association. The quest for biomarkers that are easily accessible, cost-effective, and can provide crucial insights into the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of subsequent manifestations following allogeneic HSCT is of utmost importance. The challenge lies in obtaining a larger sample where NLR can be matched by age, underlying disease, conditioning regimen, donor relation, and match, among patients who do or do not develop OM, oral GVHD, and non-oral GVHD. Therefore, we believe that future multicenter studies can contribute to inferring the results of NLR associations with OM, oral GVHD, and non-oral GVHD for the broader population of patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT.
