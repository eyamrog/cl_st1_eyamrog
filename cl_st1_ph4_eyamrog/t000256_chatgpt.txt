A 69-year-old Caucasian man presented with fever (38Â°C), abdominal pain, left posterior chest pain without cough or dyspnea, and mild occipital headache that persisted over the next few days. Eleven days later, he woke up experiencing binocular diplopia and a severe stabbing occipital headache. There were no peripheral signs of systemic vasculitis. Neurological evaluation revealed bilateral paresis of the IV cranial nerves. The patient had well-controlled arterial hypertension and denied any history of trauma or use of other medications. COVID-19 infection was confirmed through reverse transcription technique followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a nasopharyngeal swab. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with MRI angiography and vessel wall study indicated signs of vasculitis in the vertebrobasilar system, as well as inflammatory radiologic signs in the periaqueductal region, along with the topography of the trochlear nuclei. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed peripheral ground-glass parenchymal opacities, suggestive of viral pneumonia. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis showed 2 cells/mm3 (69% lymphocytes, 29% monocytes, 2% macrophages) and slightly elevated proteins at 46 mg/dl (with 17.01% gamma globulin). CSF antibody tests were negative for syphilis and other viruses, ruling out rheumatological causes, hypovitaminosis, and thyroid dysfunction. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 33 mm/h. The patient received IV methylprednisolone for 5 days, resulting in complete resolution of pain and diplopia. This case represents the first reported instance of cerebral vasculitis associated with COVID-19 infection in an adult patient, underscoring the importance of recognizing headache as a potential warning sign of cerebral vasculitis in these individuals.
