The regulation of research ethics has been predominantly influenced by a biomedical sciences model, resulting in a normative approach to addressing moral questions. This article seeks to present arguments regarding the capacity of research practices to shape morality. To achieve this, it integrates theoretical research, focusing on the mimesis concepts of Adorno and Benjamin, with an examination of responses from an online questionnaire completed by undergraduate students in the humanities and social sciences who have engaged in undergraduate scientific research (USR). The article asserts the formative potential of USR, highlighting it as a valuable platform for studying mimetic behavior and facilitating the learning process for novices through observation and the practical application of moral concepts within the research domain.
Research ethics is a delicate and crucial area, given its historical association with significant ethical breaches, notably during World War II. The proliferation of norms designed to safeguard the moral landscape has rapidly increased in recent years, particularly within educational institutions. It is essential to prioritize a formative approach to addressing research ethics within these settings. In response to past transgressions, a rigorous normative movement emerged to oversee research practices, initially focusing on preventing the recurrence of ethical violations primarily within the biomedical sciences. However, this regulatory framework has extended to other research domains, often without due consideration for the unique characteristics of the scientific disciplines being regulated (Israel and Hay, 2006).
In Brazil, there is a notable and justified resistance among researchers in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) towards the movement aimed at regulating research, particularly in opposition to Resolution No. 510/2016 of the National Health Council (NHC). Despite originating from a health-related entity, this resolution serves as the primary regulatory framework for SSH research in Brazil. However, it fails to acknowledge and respect the unique methodological approaches that have been established over time within SSH research, characterized by the incorporation of ethical considerations tailored to the specific scientific domains within these disciplines.
In order to further combat the ongoing normalization of unethical practices, it is imperative for the educational sector to enhance and promote formative initiatives that cultivate researchers' moral autonomy as a more suitable alternative to mere normative regulations. This article seeks to provide insights that support the development of a formative approach towards addressing ethical concerns in research by revisiting the concept of mimesis and its application within the context of undergraduate scientific research (USR) as a potential avenue for nurturing researchers' moral development.
The concept of mimesis, rooted in the notions of imitation and representation (Gebauer and Wulf, 2004), holds significant importance. The idea of learning through imitation, whether directly associated with mimesis or not, has been extensively explored by researchers and scholars across various fields within the humanities and social sciences. It can be argued that there exists an intrinsic connection between imitation and education in Western cultural contexts (Carvalho, 2019). According to Christoph Wulf (2016), individuals, regardless of age, acquire societal behaviors predominantly through mimetic processes. This form of learning often occurs through active participation in rites and rituals, facilitating the transmission of knowledge that becomes ingrained in practical action.
In philosophy, the relationship between education and mimesis has been a subject of contemplation since Ancient Greece, where it was viewed as a representation of nature intricately tied to artistic expression, notably influencing the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle (Schlesener, 2009). To elucidate the aim of this article, the theoretical framework primarily draws upon the interpretations of Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin regarding the concept of mimesis. This selection is motivated by Adorno's incorporation of arguments from the aforementioned Greek philosophers, enriching them with insights from French ethnology and Freudian psychoanalysis, which identified a regressive element in mimetic conduct. The engagement with Walter Benjamin was pivotal in reshaping Adorno's conception of mimesis (Gagnebin, 1993), hence both scholars were chosen as the foundation for the analysis presented here, offering complementary perspectives on mimetic behavior that are instrumental in contemplating the experience of USR.
The selection of USR6 as the initial phase of a researcher's career was deliberate, given that undergraduate students engage in research activities throughout their academic journey. However, USR stands out as a pivotal training ground for scientific research due to its structured guidance and mentorship by seasoned researchers within a genuine research setting. This assertion finds validation in the regulatory framework of the Institutional Program for Scientific Initiation Scholarships (PIBIC), the longest-standing policy in Brazil aimed at fostering USR. This program serves as a cornerstone for other forms of undergraduate research. Aligned with Normative Resolution No. 017/2006 issued by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), the primary objective of USR is to cultivate a scientific mindset and nurture potential talent among university students by involving them in research projects under the supervision of qualified researchers (Brazil, 2006).
Based on the fundamental characteristic of Undergraduate Student Research (USR) - which involves shifting training away from a direct mentorship model towards a more independent approach - the concept of mimesis emerges as a potent and fitting theoretical framework for addressing ethical training in research. It will be contended that within this educational dynamic, beyond a mere technical transfer, there lies an emphasis on cultivating practical research skills that inherently encompass ethical considerations. By utilizing USR as a foundational platform and integrating the theoretical construct of mimesis, drawing notably from the philosophies of Adorno and Benjamin, the aim is to underscore the significance of instilling moral values in novice researchers within the framework of research regulation.
In order to accomplish the stated objective, this article will proceed as follows: firstly, it will present the construction of the concept of mimesis in the selected authors' works; secondly, it will justify the applicability of this concept in University-Community Service Learning (USR) for moral education in research; thirdly, it will elaborate on the methodological choices made; fourthly, it will analyze the feedback from undergraduate students who participated in USR, gathered through an online questionnaire specifically designed for this study; and lastly, it will present the conclusions drawn from the research.
Mimicry is a phenomenon not exclusive to humans, as evidenced by studies in the biological sciences that explore its occurrence in various other animals such as flies, butterflies, and snakes (Futuyma, 1997; Ricklefs, 1996). One of the most well-known examples is the chameleon, which changes the color of its skin to blend into its surroundings when threatened. Another form of mimicry, observed in certain fly species, involves mimicking predators rather than the environment, serving as a defense mechanism against being identified as prey. Beyond its fundamental role in survival, mimicry also serves as a means of communication and learning through imitation in mammals. This behavior has been scientifically documented in specific species of bears, some primates (Taylor et al., 2019), and notably in humans, who are considered "by far, the most qualified to learn by mimicry" (Wulf, 2016: 555).
Plato (1997) posited that the impulse towards mimetic behavior is inherently irresistible to human beings, driven by the pleasurable allure of mimetic experiences that offer a sense of aesthetic fulfillment and connection to the natural world. Through observation of their surroundings and the subsequent imitation of images and behaviors, individuals engage in a process of learning through the representation and internalization of these models. Plato (1997) believed this inclination towards imitation was so potent that it warranted restricting young people's exposure to artistic production in education, viewing art as an imperfect reflection of reality (with conceptual reasoning being the preferred route to true knowledge) and potentially containing negative examples that could influence impressionable minds (particularly in the context of Greek tragedy and comedy) (Gagnebin, 1993; Wulf, 2008). Additionally, Plato (1991) criticized mimesis for its passive nature, arguing that it merely replicates existing phenomena without any creative input from the mimicker. Consequently, it can be inferred that Plato disapproved of utilizing mimetic behavior as an educational tool for young individuals.
In contrast to Plato, Aristotle (2000) reevaluates the concept of mimesis and its relevance to the realm of education, viewing it as possessing positive stimuli that can be harnessed through educational practices. His examination focuses on the capacity of mimetic behavior to facilitate learning, emphasizing that this process is more crucial than the mere act of imitation itself. While both ancient Greek philosophers acknowledge the innate presence of mimesis in human nature, particularly in children, Aristotle (2000) asserts that this behavior does not hinder intellectual development; instead, it serves as a tool that "stimulates and nurtures the process of acquiring knowledge (emphasizing the importance of playfulness)" (Gagnebin, 1993: 71). Aristotle (as cited in Carvalho, 2019: 20) thus redirects the discourse on mimesis, previously centered on the inherent flaws in representation according to Plato, towards two positive dimensions: the creative potential activated within individuals to engage in imitation and the enjoyment derived from this activity, which is a universal trait among human beings.
Adorno's engagement with Plato begins with a critical stance, particularly evident in his collaboration with Horkheimer in "Dialectics of Enlightenment," before later embracing and reevaluating the concept of mimesis in works like "Negative Dialectics" and "Aesthetic Theory" (Bassani and Vaz, 2011). Some critics argue that Adorno failed to establish mimesis as a coherent theoretical category, as seen in Freitas' work (2001). However, defenders of Adorno argue that the evolution of his concept of mimesis across his oeuvre allows for a more comprehensive analysis, a perspective that this article finds particularly compelling.
According to Adorno and Horkheimer (1985), the primal drive for self-preservation is the foundational basis of mimetic behavior. Initially, mimesis functioned as a mechanism to alleviate the anxiety stemming from the unfamiliar, the mysterious, the intimidating, and the menacing: through imitation or performance, individuals could blur the distinctions with that which evoked fear. The utilization of mythology, mystical ceremonies, dances, and other practices served as tools to integrate the enigmatic, rendering it less daunting once it was absorbed through diverse modes of expression (Gagnebin, 1993).
Adorno's theoretical rejection of the archaic moment of mimesis stems from the nullification of the subject's subjectivity, leading to thoughtless incorporation into the context and the utilization of non-rational mechanisms to alleviate fear. Plato (1997) similarly warns that the use of mimicry in education jeopardizes the construction of a rational understanding of the world by enticing individuals towards the pleasures of nature and the arts. Building upon this critique from a modern perspective, Adorno and Horkheimer (1985) argue that the archaic form of mimesis poses a threat to the process of elucidating nature through reason.
Similar to Plato's critique of mimetic behavior, Frankfurtian authors also acknowledge the strong human inclination towards this practice. Furthermore, Adorno highlights the presence of an "unavoidable moment of mimesis that is intrinsic to all human knowledge and practice" (Adorno, 2009: 131). Adorno (2009) argues that the rational emancipation sought by the Enlightenment movement should be founded on transcending this initial and inherent mimetic engagement with reality. Building on Freud's influence, Adorno and Horkheimer (1985) caution that failing to rationally overcome this primary mimesis could lead to regressive behaviors, with the most severe being a manifestation of a "deeply ingrained tendency in living beings, the overcoming of which signifies evolution: the inclination to lose oneself rather than actively asserting influence on the environment, the inclination to surrender, to revert to nature" (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1985: 187).
On the contrary, excessive rigidity in the execution of rational clarification and oversight of the mimetic impulse may lead to its suppression.
The elevated cost can be interpreted as the shift from the original mimesis, which was both pleasurable and threatening, to a distorted mimesis that mirrors the subject's insensitivity and rigidity, reflecting the challenges faced in adapting to reality and transitioning from childhood to adulthood, as posited by Freud. This subsequent mimesis emerges from repressing the initial one, defining individuals who resist regressing but sacrifice the original vitality and flexibility of life in the inevitable struggle, potentially risking more than just vitality. (Gagnebin, 1993: 73).
Adorno and Horkheimer (1985) posit education as a pivotal aspect in comprehending modern society, emphasizing its instrumental role in the process of clarification, particularly within formal educational settings. The authors critically assert that "a pedagogy that makes children unaccustomed to being infantile – is the very condition of civilization" (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1985: 85). In the contemporary educational framework, rather than evolving from mimesis towards the development of rationality, the process commences by repressing mimetic tendencies to regulate juvenile instincts.
In the early stages of schooling (reflecting humanity's origins), mimetic behavior is primarily driven by physical stimuli and physiological responses aimed at survival, with fear playing a prominent role. Individuals tend to mimic the actions of the strongest or blend into their surroundings. Adorno (1993) draws a connection between primitive mimicry and its persistence in childhood, viewing it as a pre-conceptual phase for understanding and engaging with the world. Gebauer and Wulf (2004) further argue that Adorno positions mimesis as a key element in the educational process (Bildung), playing a crucial role in social interactions and forming the basis for moral conduct through imitation.
The initial phase of mimesis holds significant importance as it marks the period where the family and school emerge as the primary institutions shaping the worldview of new generations. This influence is predominantly exerted through example and the environment they create rather than verbal instruction. In the absence of a well-structured conceptual framework, children grasp reality by assimilating and imitating behaviors observed around them. Rituals, gestures, and reactions become ingrained in the subconscious of children, shaping their lifelong outlook. In environments that suppress bodily expression, mimesis retains its primitive nature, characterized by immediacy and instability, rooted in the fear of difference. This fear, as per Gagnebin's analysis of Adorno, can lead to a social process of perverse identification, where individual apprehension of regression fuels a collective regression, epitomized by fascism. Totalitarian regimes exacerbate this fear of the other, offering identification with a charismatic leader as a remedy, exploiting simplistic interpretations of reality through facile rhetoric.
Benjamin (1985) adopted a perspective on mimesis akin to Aristotle's, emphasizing the active nature inherent in human mimetic behavior (Gagnebin, 1993). This perspective highlights the knowledge relationship involved in mimetic behavior, where the subject actively participates in forming an image of the environment rather than merely recognizing similarities; the subject must produce similarities (Benjamin, 1985). Unlike a chameleon, humans cannot change their skin color at will; they must imagine the object or subject to be imitated and devise rational mechanisms for representation. Imperfect copies necessitate the subject to creatively fill gaps based on subjectivity. Benjamin (1985) illustrates this with writing, where even the seemingly simple task of imitating letters is imbued with the writer's personal traits.
Imagination, defined as the capacity to generate mental images, is underscored by the ancient notion that "the things themselves before the word are an object of reading" (Freitas, 2008: 365). It is crucial to note that Benjamin employs the term "archaic" to encompass "the genesis of humanity and history [as well as] the phase of discovering the world and socializing the child in preparation for adult life" (Schlesener, 2019: 256). In both contexts, imitation is purposefully cultivated to facilitate integration into society.
Benjamin (1987) delves into the concept of mimesis primarily through texts centered on childhood, both personal and general, emphasizing the significance of this developmental stage in fostering rationality. Susan Buck-Morss (1995: 288, translated) asserts that, apart from Jean Piaget, no modern thinker has accorded children such profound consideration in the construction of a cognitive theory. While Piaget emphasized the benefits derived from the evolution towards abstract thinking supplanting childish cognition, attributing fantastical explanations to cognitive errors, Benjamin, in contrast, aimed to comprehend the detriments stemming from the gradual relinquishment of mimetic behaviors upon entering adulthood (Schlesener, 2019).
Benjamin (as cited in Buck-Morss, 1995: 290) posits that the decline in mimetic ability during adulthood stems from the diminished capacity to perceive non-sensory similarities, those lacking a rational basis (in contrast to scientific rationality). Benjamin (as cited in Lavelle, 2014: 82) highlights specific mimetic practices inherent in children's play, which historically underpinned a magical worldview. He draws a connection between the diminishing value of mimetic behavior over time, replaced by the inductive reasoning of modern science, and its decline within an individual's life, notably marked by a waning imaginative capacity prevalent in children's play. Within this context, the author implicates schools as the primary agents stifling the mimetic impulse in children (Schlesener, 2019).
According to Benjamin (1994), limiting one's perception to only the similarities already recognized leads to a diminished experience. In his work "On the Program of the Coming Philosophy" (Benjamin, 2001), the philosopher outlines his intention to develop a concept of experience that encompasses what he terms the experience of thought. He argues that experience is not merely constructed from isolated and firmly fixed data in memory, but rather from a collection of data, often unconscious, that gradually accumulates in memory. This notion is reiterated in his text "Doctrine of the Similarities," which focuses on mimesis, where Benjamin emphasizes the importance of this approach.
Even in contemporary times, it can be argued that men only consciously perceive a small fraction of the numerous instances where similarities influence them, with many occurrences going unnoticed. This notion, as posited by Benjamin (1985: 109), suggests that individuals are often shaped by similarities without explicit awareness of their impact.
Benjamin (1985) posits that art serves as the privileged dimension for the manifestation of genuine experiences, emphasizing the artist's unique capacity to create non-sensible similarities and perceive connections that elude others. This concept, central to Adorno's Aesthetic Theory, is believed to have been influenced by his interactions with Benjamin (Gagnebin, 1993). Despite Adorno's acknowledgment of the potential pitfalls, his works like Negative Dialectics and Aesthetic Theory suggest a nuanced view on mimetic behavior. Adorno does not outright condemn mimetic tendencies but stresses the necessity for a thoughtful and rational engagement with reality. He argues for a process that goes beyond immediate or repressed mimesis, advocating for a transformative approach that alters both the subject and the object of imitation (Adorno, 1982: 364).
The initial mimesis process plays a crucial role in shaping moral conduct according to Adorno. The author posits that morality stems from a drive to alleviate suffering (Adorno, 2009). During the initial phase of mimetic behavior, characterized by a lack of distinction between the self and the external world, emotions of closeness, recognition, and notably, empathy towards the pain of others can be established: "The impulse, the unadorned and visceral physical fear, and the sense of solidarity with suffering bodies, as Brecht's phrase suggests, the impulse inherent in moral conduct..." (Adorno, 2009: 238).
The characteristics of Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR) suggest that it serves as an initiation ritual into the academic realm. The term "initiation" conveys more than just the commencement of an activity; it implies a ceremonial and experiential process. According to the Houaiss dictionary (2020), initiation is defined as "The act of giving or receiving the first elements of a practice or the rudiments relating to an area of knowledge. Ex.: initiation scientific." Within USR, students are introduced to the scientific 'game' and engage in experiences associated with a research project, all of which are structured and overseen by a professor (Massi and Queiroz, 2010: 175).
It is justifiable to assert that the term initiation implies that Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR) offers a more comprehensive learning experience beyond theoretical knowledge, emphasizing the interaction between an experienced researcher and a novice. This dynamic positions USR as a valuable platform for mimetic learning. This notion is reinforced by relevant legislation, which underscores the pivotal connection in USR between a "qualified researcher" (as defined by Normative Resolution No. 017/2006) and a novice researcher. In the context of laboratory work, Neves (2001: 84) highlights that...
In the realm of undergraduate research, learning occurs predominantly through the act of observing and emulating the actions of seasoned individuals. During a practical internship, a participant disclosed that her successful execution of a particular task was attributed to a unique scissor-holding technique imparted by a senior staff member; without this guidance, progress would have been impeded. Consequently, implicit knowledge plays a significant role in scientific practices, necessitating aspiring scientists to dedicate substantial periods within laboratory settings to further their expertise and proficiency.
The author highlights the undervaluation of tacit knowledge, particularly in laboratory practice, within the context of SSH. This undervaluation is attributed to the more tangible nature of research practices in the biological sciences. While learning by imitation is prominently observed in biological sciences, SSH typically emphasizes rational learning without direct materialization in the physical realm. Nonetheless, mimetic learning plays a crucial role in training researchers in SSH, as demonstrated when a novice student learns interview techniques by emulating a senior researcher's approach and methods.
In this article, the focus is on emphasizing the significance of Undergraduate Student Research (USR) for mimetic learning within the moral domain, a principle that extends universally across scientific disciplines, be it biological, Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), or mathematical sciences. While grasping the correct technique for handling scissors might necessitate a level of theoretical abstraction that proves daunting for a novice, the comprehension of metaphysical constructs underpinning moral reasoning, and the subsequent practical application of these constructs in research, presents an even greater challenge. Nonetheless, through USR, students can observe firsthand how seasoned researchers implement moral concepts, such as ethical considerations, into their research practices, thereby facilitating a more tangible understanding of these abstract principles.
The experience of Undergraduate Research (USR) provides a unique opportunity to comprehend metaphysical concepts by observing their manifestation through actions. This holds significant educational value as moral concepts, being inherently metaphysical, pose challenges in objective understanding (Lavelle, 2018), particularly for novice researchers. It can be argued that USR aligns closely with Benjamin's notion of the experience of thought, achieved through the visualization of symbolically rich images. Consequently, USR enables beginners to witness researchers' ethical conduct and construct mental representations of ethical principles applied in real-world scenarios, such as navigating ethical dilemmas with conviction.
The formative potential of Undergraduate Student Research (USR) lies in its ability to facilitate the human inclination towards learning through imitation, a concept acknowledged by the foundational authors of this text. In his work "Minima Moralia," Adorno (1993: 147) asserts that humans have a natural tendency towards imitation, suggesting that true humanity is achieved through emulating others. This notion is crucial when considering USR as a unique opportunity for the development of researchers' moral compass, as Adorno (2009) posits that the process of human development involves mimicking individuals who embody universal qualities, such as humanity.
One of the central controversies surrounding the formative potential of mimesis dates back to the debate between Plato and Aristotle, focusing on the perceived passivity inherent in mimetic learning. While asserting that USR promotes moral learning through mimetic behavior, it is crucial to note that this does not guarantee the student's eventual graduation as a seasoned researcher. Wulf (2016: 559), echoing Benjamin, emphasizes that imitation is not about mere replication but rather about crafting an image that is inspired by a model yet distinct from it. This concept underscores the active nature of imitation, where individuals engage in the process of creating similarities by bridging gaps, as illustrated in the aforementioned example. Therefore, the educational essence of mimesis lies in the active process of imitation, where individuals, such as young adults aspiring to enter the academic realm, strive to immerse themselves in a world they are not yet fully a part of, as elucidated by Benjamin (1987).
Recognizing and empathizing with others, perceiving them as intentional beings, and actively engaging with them are essential skills that contribute to a child's mimetic desire to emulate and resemble adults, ultimately aspiring to become like them (Wulf, 2016: 555).
The connection between mimesis and education can be further explored by delving into the etymological roots of the verb "to educate" (e/ducare, from Latin), which implies a process of guiding (dúcere) the child beyond oneself (e-ex) (Martins, 2005) in order to equip them for life in the world. In this sense, education can be seen as a formative journey.
From the perspective of pedagogical authority, it is widely believed that the most honest and demonstrable license to teach is one that is based on leading by example. Effective teaching is considered to be ostensive in nature, emphasizing the act of showing rather than simply telling. This concept of "ostentation," which fascinated Wittgenstein, can be traced back to its Latin roots in dicere, originally meaning "to show" and later evolving to include "to show by saying"; this idea is further explored in the English terms token and techen, which carry implicit connotations of "what shows." Additionally, in German, the word deuten, meaning "to point," is closely linked to bedeuten, which translates to "to signify." This interconnectedness highlights the importance of not only showing but also signifying meaning in the act of teaching.
In the process of teaching and demonstrating, beginners are encouraged to imitate researchers, fostering meaningful learning driven by a desire to acquire knowledge. Drawing on these concepts and arguments, the following data will be presented to elucidate the impressions of CHS students regarding their USR experience.
This research article is a component of a project initiated in 2016 by the Research Group (name omitted for confidentiality). The core methodology involves gathering data via online questionnaires distributed to SSH researchers at various career stages, including senior researchers (comprising leaders and vice-leaders of research groups), doctoral students, and researchers in training (defined as students with USR experience). The study also extends to an international context, aiming to generate insights into the impacts of normative interference (specifically heteronym imposition) on the development and practice of moral autonomy among researchers.
At this juncture, the initiation of a researcher's profession is being considered, with a focus on the potential approach of research training through the orientation process of the end-of-course paper (TCC). However, it is noted that in most cases, Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR) precedes the TCC orientation chronologically, serving as the initial exposure to research. Furthermore, the guidance provided during the TCC process varies across institutions and is generally less stringent compared to USR in terms of adherence to research methodologies and ethical protocols. Within USR, aspiring researchers are assimilated into established research groups, reliant on funding and thus obligated to adhere strictly to regulatory procedures, fostering more robust connections with the university and society - aspects that tend to be less emphasized in TCCs.
This phase of the research aimed to gather responses from USR scholarship recipients enrolled in the Graduate Programs in Education (PPG/Edu) who were evaluated with grades 6 and 7 by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Capes). In October 2019, the respective USR directorates of the universities hosting the three PPGs meeting the specified criteria in the South Region were contacted via email. Two of the three USR directorates responded positively, agreeing to distribute the questionnaire link to their students engaged in USR activities, while the third did not provide any response to the communication.
While the number of respondents (26) may have fallen short of the intended target, it is important to note that the sample size is deemed adequate for the exploratory nature of this study. The analysis of responses serves as a valuable complement to the theoretical discussion at hand. Additionally, the questionnaires utilized in this research are comprehensive, providing a rich dataset that aligns well with the primary objective of this article.
The data collection instrument, an online questionnaire, was initially developed in 2016 and has since undergone minor modifications to better suit the diverse target audiences across different research phases. This instrument is registered with the Scientific Committee of (omitted for anonymity) and adheres to all research ethics protocols. For the current research phase, the questionnaire comprised eight closed questions, 13 open-ended questions, and one utilizing the Likert Intensity Scale. To streamline the response process, certain questions pertaining to respondent profiling from earlier phases were omitted.
Out of the 26 respondents, 46.2% (12) commenced their activities in the USR when they were under 20 years old, 34.6% (9) between the ages of 21 and 24, 15.4% (4) falling within the 24 to 30 age bracket, with only 3.8% (1) initiating their involvement over the age of 30. These statistics reveal that a significant 80.5% (21) of the participants were below 24 years old when they began their engagement with the USR, aligning closely with one of the primary objectives of the USR, which is to encourage young individuals to embark on research activities, as stipulated by CNPq in Normative Resolution No. 017 (Brazil, 2006).
It is noteworthy that only 7.7% (2) of beginners remained in the survey for less than 6 months, while 65.4% (17) stayed for more than a year and 26.9% (7) between 6 months and 1 year. In response to an open-ended question, 96.2% (25) of participants positively evaluated their experience in USR. When asked to rate their dedication to activities in USR on a scale of "1 to 6", 61.5% (16) scored "6", 30.8% (8) chose "5", and 7.7% (2) represented their dedication with the number “4”. These findings suggest that USR is a well-received pedagogical strategy among students, as evidenced by their enthusiastic feedback: terms such as “great” (R1, R6, R7, R11), “determinant” (R3), “very good” (R4, R8, R9), “incredible” (R5), “rewarding” (R10), “enriching” (R12, R13), “necessary” (R15), “best choice” (R16), “contributed immensely” (R18), “fantastic and essential” (R22), and “most impactful experience of my student life” (R25) were used to describe their experiences. One response particularly stands out:
The USR research program offers a valuable opportunity for undergraduate students embarking on their academic research journey, enhancing their training experience. It underscores the significance and intricacy of scientific research in constructing robust knowledge, while promoting ongoing learning, whether during their academic tenure or post-graduation. Engaging with USR highlights the requisite dedication and conducive environment necessary for effective immersion in academic research, encompassing elements like a supportive atmosphere, scholarship incentives, effective communication between mentors and mentees, and a recognition of the importance of the field of study and training. (USResearcher 02, Questionnaire, 2021).
The positive outcomes of Undergraduate Student Research (USR) can be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that student participation in this activity is driven by their own initiative. The responses gathered indicate that all participants (100%) actively sought out USR opportunities independently, as exemplified by a respondent's statement: "The USR is your initiative and you need to pursue it" (R26).
The motivations behind this decision, which was the subject of an open question, can be categorized into four distinct groups. Specifically, 38.5% (10 participants) expressed their interest in the research itself, 26.9% (7 participants) aimed to enhance their training, another 26.9% (7 participants) indicated a desire to pursue a career in research, and 7.7% (2 participants) mentioned their interest in receiving remuneration.
Research has shown that a significant percentage (65.4%) of students are motivated by a desire to enhance their education and supplement their training. This motivation stems from the recognition that solely relying on theoretical instruction, which is a common feature of predominantly expository undergraduate courses, is deemed inadequate by students.
Regarding the 26.9% (7) of participants who expressed a desire to pursue a career in research, they embody the mimetic desire to become researchers as discussed by Wulf (2016: 555). Beyond the scientific inquiry, a crucial element of the educational dynamic surfaces, emphasizing the human connection at its core. Noteworthy is a response highlighting the primary motivation for engaging in Undergraduate Student Research (USR) as the "opportunity to collaborate with Prof. [name withheld]" (R9). Similarly, other responses underscored the mentorship aspect as the most positive attribute of the USR experience.
The experience was highly rewarding as I had the privilege of working with an exceptional advisor who guided me throughout the research process. This opportunity allowed me to discover my passion for conducting research, sparking a newfound enthusiasm for academic inquiry (USResearcher 01, Questionnaire, 2021).
My supervisor, without boasting, serves as an exemplary model for all supervisors. Their guidance not only instills a high level of motivation for research but also grants us the autonomy to independently develop our projects. This sentiment was echoed by a participant in the 2021 questionnaire conducted by USResearcher 08.
While students may view having a good advisor as a positive aspect of the Undergraduate Research (USR) experience, it is important to acknowledge that the opposite perspective exists as well. This highlights the notion that mimetic experience does not result in exact replicas but rather offers models for observation. Therefore, the significance of USR in shaping the ethical development of researchers should not be automatically deemed as beneficial. Drawing from Adorno (1995), it is evident that some individuals suppress their mimetic impulses to emphasize their rationality, subsequently feeling justified in perpetuating acts of violence against others. This trend is becoming more prevalent in the competitive and often unhealthy academic setting, as reflected in responses to what students liked least about USR.
In my initial scholarship experience, I resided in a shared accommodation with an instructor who exhibited an overly stringent approach towards the students, requiring a higher commitment of hours than what was initially anticipated. This observation was documented in the questionnaire conducted by USResearcher 05 in 2021.
Pressure from my advisor was reported by a participant in the study (USResearcher 14, Questionnaire, 2021).
In the questionnaire conducted in 2021, a US researcher (USResearcher 20) noted instances where their advisor exhibited a lack of comprehension towards their doubts and displayed rudeness in their interactions.
In the realm of research, the role of an experienced researcher as a potential model for emulation is a subject of debate. It is argued that mimicking behavior is not merely a passive act; rather, the act of observing a model can actively influence a novice researcher's decision-making process, prompting them to strive for personal validation rather than simply replicating the actions of the model.
When asked about which context they believed had fostered greater autonomy, 92.3% (24) of respondents indicated that it was in the Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR) setting, while 7.7% (2) pointed to regular classes. These figures align with the notion that providing opportunities within a particular model does not equate to promoting passivity among students; rather, the model serves as a foundation for the development of independent thinking and action. This sentiment was reflected in responses when participants were probed about the factors influencing autonomy within each context.
The experience at USR has been pivotal in shaping my ongoing interest in research work. It has offered a wealth of learning opportunities, yet, more significantly, being a part of a research group has fostered a sense of autonomy and responsibility within me. As noted by USResearcher 03 in the questionnaire from 2021, this involvement has been instrumental in my professional development and commitment to furthering research endeavors.
I was fortunate to have an advisor who was highly involved in the academic journey of undergraduate students. This support granted me the autonomy to cultivate my own academic research, ultimately culminating in my TCC, a project that could have been further developed in subsequent stages (USResearcher 13, Questionnaire, 2021).
It is intriguing to observe a consistent emphasis on the material aspect in the responses detailing the USR experience, aligning with Benjamin's (1985) concept of mental image formation. This aligns with the human inclination to initially interpret the world through images. Respondents frequently employed verbs associated with the senses, like seeing and looking, and utilized terms that give tangible form to abstract ideas, such as distancing. These choices highlight mimetic learning as a holistic experience that engages both the body (senses) and the mind (reason).
In the classroom, the teacher instructs me on the tasks at hand and provides guidance on how to approach them. Engaging in scientific initiation has enabled me to experiment with novel methodologies, allowing me to observe firsthand the intricacies of research. While my advisor offers unwavering support and assistance with any queries I may have, the responsibility for charting the course and navigating each new step ultimately rests with me, a level of autonomy not typically afforded within the confines of the classroom (USResearcher 23, Questionnaire, 2021, emphasis added by the authors).
One of the most significant insights gained was the perspective of a researcher (USResearcher 14, Questionnaire, 2021, emphasis added by the authors).
In traditional classroom settings, a noticeable gap was observed by the researchers between educators and the educational development of students (USResearcher 13, Questionnaire, 2021, emphasis added by the authors).
The findings support the notion that the aesthetic dimension of the Undergraduate Research (USR) experience, serving as a form of training facilitating mimetic learning, enhances comprehension of abstract concepts, particularly those central to the foundation of moral conduct. This tension between theory and practice within USR, notably in the moral realm, is exemplified by the significant proportion of respondents, 73.1% (19 individuals), acknowledging encountering ethical dilemmas during their research endeavors, juxtaposed with 80.5% (21 participants) admitting unfamiliarity with Resolution NHC No. 510 (Brasil, 2016). In essence, students demonstrated the ability to identify ethical quandaries despite their limited acquaintance with the relevant regulatory framework.
It is crucial to highlight the significance of these findings, particularly in light of the fact that only 23.1% of respondents reported having taken a course on ethics during their graduation. This statistic underscores a potential gap in ethical education among the participants. Furthermore, the data reveals that a similar percentage, 23.1%, admitted to not actively seeking alternative methods to enhance their understanding of ethics. This lack of proactive engagement with ethical principles could be attributed to the limited exposure to formal ethics training during their academic pursuits. These results underscore the need for further investigation and potential interventions to address the apparent deficiency in ethical education among the surveyed individuals.
Based on the presented percentages, it is evident that Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR) plays a crucial role in shaping researchers' ethical standards. However, it is concerning that USR is underutilized in Brazil, as indicated by 50% of respondents referencing the lack of recognition for students' research efforts. The devaluation is exemplified by the mention of the scholarship amount, set at R$ 400.0011 for 20 hours of research per week, which has remained unchanged since 2012. Moreover, USR programs are facing a reduction in scholarship opportunities due to the current decrease in funding for education and science in Brazil.
Based on the theoretical arguments and data presented, it can be asserted that mimetic behavior plays a central role in the experience offered by USR and, therefore, can serve as a significant resource for shaping the moral development of individuals. Consistent with Benjamin's (1985) assertion, this resource has the capacity to engage the aesthetic dimension, which is often neglected within formal education settings, and becomes particularly pertinent in a landscape marked by the proliferation of regulatory norms that frequently disregard the interests and necessities of the humanities and social sciences domain.
Drawing from Adorno's work (1982, 2009), it is crucial to acknowledge that while mimetic behavior plays a vital role, it is not adequate on its own. It must be complemented with the cultivation of students' conceptual reasoning abilities, which can only be achieved through structured and guided theoretical contemplation. While mimetic stimuli serve as effective sensitizers, they must be coupled with the cognitive efforts of the individual, as failing to do so risks perpetuating the oversimplified and potentially hazardous notion that the moral foundation is uncomplicated. This caution becomes particularly pertinent in a landscape saturated with self-proclaimed ethical standards, concealing underlying control motives within scientific practices and regulations governing research endeavors.
The optimal approach appears to involve a harmonious blend of mimetic stimuli and the cultivation of theoretical reasoning, as excessive reliance on discursive transmission via lectures is deemed inadequate for effective training, as indicated by survey participants. It is recognized that the dynamic between researcher and novice in USR cultivates a mimetic bond that can serve as a potent form of moral education in research, offering a more genuine and effective training experience within the specific field compared to mere reliance on external standardization.
