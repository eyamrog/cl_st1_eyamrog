The world is facing a new challenge, the novel 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by 
a betacoronavirus named severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), phylogenetically 
identical to the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus) and the MERS-CoV (Middle 
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) responsible for 
innumerable deaths in China in 2003 and in the Middle 
East in 2012, respectively. 

On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was 
characterized as a pandemic by the World Health 
Organization (WHO).1 Twenty-three days after that 
announcement, the cases reported reached 1,056,777 
in 182 countries, with 55,781 deaths, most of which 
occurring in Italy, Spain, France, China and Iran. So far, 
Brazil has registered 8,195 cases and 335 deaths, while 
Portugal, 9,886 cases and 246 deaths, figures that have 
increased steeply since the beginning of the pandemic.2 

In the face of this exponential increase, mainly in São 
Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states, multiple safeguarding 
measures to prevent further spread of the virus, such 
as school dismissal, event cancellations, reduced bank 
hours, closure of commerce, except for essential sectors, 
recommendation for home confinement, and cancellation 
of public transportation between municipalities and 
states, have been taken in Brazil, as well as in Portugal 
and other countries. In the absence of a vaccine and 
specific therapy, that is actually the only way to restrain 
viral spread and to prevent the health system overload, 
which might lead to its collapse, as seen, for example, in 
Italy and Spain. Person-to-person spread via respiratory 
droplets disseminated during sneezing, coughing and 
talking, as well as transmission through contact with 
contaminated surfaces justifies those measures.3 The PCR 
assay for viral RNA detection on respiratory tract samples 
has been used for the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19; 
moreover, wide-scale testing has been adopted to contain 
the pandemic in other countries.3 Other types of tests 
are being developed to assess the population acquired 
immunity. These tests identify individuals who have 
developed immunity to the virus, and who can therefore 
safely return to their usual activities. This will be essential 
in the second phase of the pandemic. 

Analyses by the Imperial College with projections 
from the COVID-19 cases have estimated, if no action 
is taken, 7 billion infections and 40 million deaths 
worldwide in 2020. Furthermore, they have reported that 
mitigation strategies focused on protection could cut that 
burden in half, saving 20 million lives, but not without 
overloading healthcare services, a situation that might be 
even more severe in lower income settings.4 This scenario 
should be avoided at any cost by implementing strict 
measures that limit the movement of people, as well as 
social distancing or even isolation. It is worth noting that 
underreporting, undertesting and delayed confirmatory 
test results might jeopardize the statistics of any country 
that does not adopt a strict policy for test performance, 
as recommended by the WHO.

A study conducted in China with 72,314 patients 
with COVID-19 (44,672 laboratory-confirmed cases, 
16,186 suspected cases, and 10,567 clinically diagnosed 
cases) has reported mild clinical severity in 81.4% of the 
sample, severe clinical severity in 13.9%, and critical 
clinical severity in 4.7%.3 The most common symptoms 
were fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and 
diarrhea.3,5 Other signals and symptoms have been 
reported, such as sore throat, chest pain, mental 
confusion, and lethargy. 

Almost 5% of the infections will have a severe 
course with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 
pulmonary bleeding, severe lymphopenia, kidney 
failure, circulatory shock, and failure of multiple 
organs.3,5 The  case-fatality rates by age group in 
Italy (1,625  cases) and China (1,023 cases) differed 
substantially, 7.2% and 2.3%, respectively, which can 
be partially explained by the older age distribution in 
Italy, as well as the presence of more comorbidities 
among Italians.6 

One fourth to half of the patients with COVID-19 have 
chronic conditions, especially cardiovascular (CVD) and 
cerebrovascular diseases, which increase the risk for a 
severe course of disease and death. A meta-analysis of 
six studies conducted in China, including 1,527 patients 
with COVID-19, has assessed the prevalence of CVD 
and reported the following proportions: hypertension, 
17.1%; heart and cerebrovascular diseases, 16.4%; and 
diabetes, 9.7%.7 Another study with 44,672 confirmed 
cases of COVID-19 in China has shown preexisting 
comorbidities, such as CVD (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), 
and hypertension (6%), which related to a case‑fatality 
rate of 2.3%.3 Those studies have evidenced the 
importance of not only chronic diseases but also of 
age and host immune status to COVID-19-related 
mortality, characterizing a complex, multifactorial and 
bidirectional model that can comprise the drugs used 
to treat those pathologies.8,9 

Acute and chronic cardiovascular complications have 
been observed and attributed to several mechanisms, 
such as relative ischemia, systemic inflammation 
and pathogen-mediated damage, with increased 
levels of biomarkers, such as troponin I, BNP, and 
d-dimer.9-11 Myocardial damage was observed in 7.2% 
of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, shock in 
8.7%, and arrhythmia in 16.7%, leading to intensive care 
admission.9 A meta-analysis with four studies, including 
341 COVID-19 patients, has reported a significantly 
higher standardized mean difference in cardiac troponin 
I levels in patients with severe disease as compared to 
those with milder disease (25.6; 95%CI: 6.8-44.5 ng/L).10 
In a retrospective multicenter cohort study in China, 
elevated d-dimer levels at admission (> 1µg/mL) have 
been associated with in-hospital death even after 
adjustments (OR 18.4; 95% CI: 2.6-128.6 µg/mL).11

Venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 has been 
reported, probably due to vascular inflammation, 
hypercoagulable states and endothelial dysfunction.8 
Fulminant myocarditis and heart failure have been 
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; moreover, 
preexisting coronary artery disease has been associated 
with a possible predisposition to that infection..12-14 
In a case series with 150 patients with COVID-19, 7% 
of the 68 deaths were attributed to myocarditis with 
circulatory failure.12 Other studies have described 
fulminant myocarditis with high viral load and the 
post-mortem finding of mononuclear inflammatory 
infiltrates in the heart tissue.13,14 New and important 
knowledge was recently presented in a case report: 
the lack of any pulmonary manifestation in a patient 
with myopericarditis and significant left ventricular 
dysfunction, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 
was successfully treated with dobutamine, lopinavir/
ritonavir, steroids, chloroquine, and the usual medical 
therapy for heart failure.15 In another study, heart failure 
has been observed in 23.0% of the COVID-19 patients, 
being associated with non-survivors (51.9% vs. 11.7%); 
in addition, the contribution of previous ventricular 
dysfunction to that outcome remains inconclusive.11

Murine models and human post-mortem samples have 
shown that SARS-CoV can regulate the myocardial and 
pulmonary angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), 
mediating myocardial inflammation, pulmonary edema 
and acute respiratory failure, and might explain the 
cardiovascular involvement of severely ill patients.16 
However, data available are still insufficient to determine 
whether these observations readily translate to humans, 
and no study has evaluated the effects of renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with COVID-19.17

Some studies have suggested that ACE inhibitors 
(ACEI) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) can 
up-regulate ACE2, thus increasing susceptibility to the 
virus; other studies, however, have shown that ACEI / 
ARB can potentialize the pulmonary protective function 
of ACE2.18,19 The Brazilian Society of Cardiology, the 
European Society of Cardiology and the American 
College of Cardiology recommend the individualized 
assessment of the patient, suggesting that the abrupt 
withdrawal of therapeutic schemes currently being 
practiced should not be performed, as that might cause 
clinical instability and adverse health outcomes.

At the current time there is neither a vaccine against nor 
a specific treatment for COVID-19. Chloroquine blocks the 
viral infection by increasing the endosomal pH necessary 
for the virus/cell fusion and has shown an inhibitory effect 
on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir and 
remdesivir are antiviral drugs being tested in prospective 
studies. It is worth noting that the lopinavir/ritonavir 
association alters heart conduction, with QT-interval 
prolongation and advanced atrioventricular block. 
In addition, those drugs interact with antiplatelet agents, 
anticoagulants, statins and beta-blockers .8,20

When approaching patients with COVID-19, 
cardiologists should be alert to new clinical manifestations, 
such as arrhythmias, left ventricular dysfunction and 
systemic embolism, which might be related to that 
condition, since there is much that is still unknow about it.

The COVID-19 pandemic came to change, in a 
previously unimaginable way, the dynamics and 
functioning of societies worldwide. The challenges are 
gigantic, mainly concerning the strain they represent to 
national health systems, which have never been submitted 
to such a radical stress test. However, this can also be an 
opportunity to reorganize and strengthen health systems, 
and, at the same time, to highlight the pivotal role of health 
professionals in our society. Policymakers should pursue 
the most effective way to guarantee the sustainability 
of health systems, while ensuring that healthcare 
professionals receive just reward and due recognition for 
their effort and dedication, often ignored in times of Peace.

The world has responded to this scenario of global 
crisis with unprecedented widespread solidarity. In light 
of the enormous challenges that lie ahead, we must 
ensure that this matter remains close to heart.
