In this research article focusing on the fern flora of Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, specifically addressing the families Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and Saccolomataceae, we offer a taxonomic treatment of these early divergent lineages of leptosporangiate ferns. Our work is part of a continuous project dedicated to studying ferns and lycophytes in the Viçosa region, where we have been actively sampling remnant forest patches since 2012. Additionally, we conducted a thorough review of the herbarium VIC and various online collections such as F, IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. Within the Viçosa region, we identified six taxa from these families: Dennstaedtia cicutaria and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Dennstaedtiaceae); Lindsaea lancea var. lancea, L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta var. stricta (Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma elegans (Saccolomataceae). Notably, L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, while the others have a broader distribution across the Neotropics. Our study includes keys, descriptions, illustrations, examined specimens, and insightful comments on these taxa.
In the era when plant Classification Systems primarily relied on morphological data, Dennstaedtiaceae was perceived as a large family encompassing three subfamilies (or tribes) and approximately 17 genera (Tryon & Tryon 1982, Kramer 1990). However, the introduction of molecular data led to the elevation of these subfamilies to the family level, the creation of new families, and a redefined representation of early-diverging leptosporangiate ferns. Presently, this group includes Cystodiaceae (one genus), a more precisely defined Dennstaedtiaceae with 11-12 genera, Lindsaeaceae (seven genera), Lonchitidaceae (one genus), Saccolomataceae (one or two genera), and the extensive Pteridaceae family with over 50 genera (Smith et al. 2006, PPG I 2016, Shang et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2020).
Brazil is represented by Dennstaedtiaceae with eight genera and 26 species, Lindsaeaceae with one genus and 34 species, Lonchitidaceae with one genus and one species, and Saccolomataceae with one genus and nine species, while Pteridaceae is excluded for further discussion in a separate paper (Kramer 1957, Pena et al. 2020, Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd & Pena 2020). These plants typically exhibit plesiomorphic characteristics reminiscent of early-diverging Polypodiales lineages, including rhizomes with hairs or primitive scales, large dissected leaves, marginal sori protected by inner and outer indusia, and trilete spores (Tryon & Tryon 1982, Kramer 1990, PPG I 2016, Schwartsburd et al. 2020).
Pteridium, found worldwide with the exception of Antarctica, holds significant importance for mankind due to its direct impact on local human populations. Acting as a pioneer weed, it invades croplands and spreads through its underground rhizomes, making eradication challenging. Furthermore, it poses a threat to livestock such as cattle and horses, causing intoxication. Ingestion by humans can also lead to toxicity, with some studies highlighting the transmission of its toxins, specifically the psilatoquinis, through cow milk (Tryon 1941, Evans 1976, Page 1976, Marrs et al. 2000, Martini-Santos et al. 2010, Oliveira et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2018).
In the State of Minas Gerais, Dennstaedtiaceae comprises 14 species, Lindsaeaceae includes 11 species, and Saccolomataceae consists of three species (Pena et al. 2020, Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd & Pena 2020, Schwartsburd 2022). This study presents the taxonomic treatment of these families in the region of Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, as part of an ongoing project on the Fern Flora of this area. Various fascicles are currently in preparation, with some already published, including works by Miranda & Schwartsburd (2016 - Salviniales), Rabelo & Schwartsburd (2016 - Schizaeales), and Gonçalves da Silva & Schwartsburd (2017 - Polypodiaceae).
In the Viçosa region of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, the existing forest patches are categorized as Semi-Deciduous Seasonal Forest according to IBGE (2012). The local elevation varies between 600 and 900 meters above sea level, as observed personally, while annual temperatures fluctuate between 5° and 30°C based on data from INMET (2021).
Since 2012, we have been conducting sampling in remnant forest patches. Specimens were gathered and dried following standard fern collection methods as outlined by Windisch (1992) before being integrated into the herbarium VIC, with duplicates intended for dispatch to other herbaria. Our study also involved a comprehensive examination of the herbarium VIC's collection and online collections from various other herbaria, including F, IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. While the classification system utilized in previous fascicles was derived from an adaptation of Kenrick & Crane (1997) and Smith et al. (2006), we have now transitioned to the system outlined by PPG I (2016). Morphological terminology adheres to the guidelines provided by Lellinger (2002).
The Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and Saccolomataceae families collectively encompass four genera and six species within the Viçosa region. Among these taxa, four species possess infra-specific classifications, which are considered in this study. Specifically, the six taxa identified are Dennstaedtia cicutaria (Sw.) T. Moore and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Kaulf.) J.A. Thomson from Dennstaedtiaceae; Lindsaea lancea (L.) Bedd. var. lancea, L. quadrangularis Raddi subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta (Sw.) Dryand. var. stricta from Lindsaeaceae; and Saccoloma elegans Kaulf. Notably, only L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are exclusive to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, while the others have a broader distribution across the Neotropics. In contrast to previous studies on families like Salviniaceae (Miranda & Schwartsburd 2016), Anemiaceae (Rabelo & Schwartsburd 2016), and Polypodicaeae (Gonçalves da Silva & Schwartsburd 2017, where half of the taxa were recollected, we did not find D. cicutaria, L. lancea var. lancea, or L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis during our fieldwork. It is likely that these species have become locally extinct over time due to forest fragmentation and human-induced disturbances, as they were last collected in the 1930s and have not been observed since.
Rhizomes typically exhibit long-creeping growth patterns, characterized by solenostelic structures, although dictyostelic or polycyclic forms are occasionally observed, often adorned with hairs or primitive scales. The leaves are generally monomorphic; their stipes frequently feature epipetiolar buds and typically contain an omega-shaped vascular strand. The laminae are typically 2-5-pinnate, occasionally less dissected; veins are usually free, with rare instances of anastomosis, lacking included veinlets. The indumentum consists of hairs, glandular hairs, or may be absent altogether. Sori are typically marginal or submarginal, linear or discrete, introrse or extrorse, shielded by outer and/or inner indusia, or occasionally unprotected. Spores are either tetrahedral and trilete or reniform and monolete, as described by Smith et al. in 2006.
The family is cosmopolitan, comprising eleven genera and approximately 270 species (PPG I 2016, Shang et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2020). The clade that includes Dennstaedtia, Leptolepia, Microlepia, and Oenotrichia requires further recircumscriptions, primarily due to the polyphyletic nature of Dennstaedtia (Schwartsburd et al. 2020).
Rhizomes are short to long-creeping, either glabrous or bearing catenate hairs. The leaves are notably large, reaching up to 4 meters in length, with laminae that are 2-4-pinnate and veins that are free. The indument on the leaves can consist of catenate hairs, acicular hairs, or may be entirely absent. Sori are located marginally, discrete, and positioned at the tip of single veins. The inner and outer indusia are fused, forming purse- or cup-shaped, or hemi-globose structures, as described by Smith et al. in 2006.
Dennstaedtia, as currently circumscribed, is considered polyphyletic according to Schwartzburd et al. (2020), encompassing approximately 70 species. Within Brazil, there have been documented occurrences of six species (Schwartsburd & Pena 2020), although personal observations suggest that the actual number of species present in the region may range from eight to ten.
Terrestrial plants with long-creeping rhizomes bearing brownish catenate hairs. The leaves are 1-3.5 m long, with stipes measuring 0.5-2.5 m, brown proximally and lighter brown above, featuring acicular hairs or becoming glabrescent. The laminae range from 0.5-2 m in length, being proximally 3-pinnate-pinnatifid to 4-pinnate; rachises are light brown, pilose, with brownish catenate hairs, lacking proliferous buds. Basal pinnae are 25-100 cm × 12-35 cm, subequilateral, with sessile pinnules that are lanceolate to oblong, with dentate margins. Both costae and costules are pilose on both sides, with light brown to reddish catenate hairs. Veins are free, hirsute on both sides, with erect, light brown to reddish acicular hairs; laminar tissue between the veins also bears catenate and acicular hairs. Sori are oblong or rounded, located at the tip of single veins, within segment sinuses; indusia are purse-shaped, typically adorned with acicular and catenate hairs.
Dennstaedtia cicutaria is distinguished by its densely veined laminar tissue, which is interspersed with catenate and acicular hairs. The indusia of this species are purse-shaped and adorned with acicular and catenate hairs.
Rhizomes are long-creeping, adorned with setose hairs. The leaves are notably large, reaching up to 4.5 meters in length, with laminae that are 3-5-pinnate and veins that are free. The indument is comprised of catenate hairs, acicular hairs, arachnoid hairs, and/or minute gnarled hairs. Sori are situated marginally, appearing linear and continuous along the laminar margins, and are borne on comissural veins. The inner indusia are vestigial, while the outer indusia are linear, as described by Smith et al. in 2006.
Currently, two species along with two species of hybrid origin are acknowledged in the literature (Thomson 2012, Zhou et al. 2014, Schwartsburd et al. 2018, 2020). Furthermore, approximately 20 morpho-taxa are identified as infra-specific entities, encompassing subspecies, varieties, forms, or combinations of multiple ranks (e.g., Tryon 1941, Page 1976, Thomson 2012, Schwartsburd et al. 2018). Within Brazil, the recognized taxa include Pteridium caudatum (L.) Maxon, P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, P. esculentum subsp. campestre (Schrad.) Schwartsb. & J. Prado, P. esculentum subsp. gryphus Schwartsb., P. esculentum var. harpianum Schwartsb. & A. Yañez, and P. esculentum var. paedomorficum Schwartsb. & J. Prado (Schwartsburd 2020). Predominantly found in southeastern Brazil, P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum is the most prevalent taxon, known for its encroachment on crops and its toxicity to cattle, horses, and humans upon ingestion (Schwartsburd et al. 2018).
Terrestrial plants with a tufted growth habit, characterized by long-creeping rhizomes adorned with hair-like structures. The leaves are sizable, ranging from 1.5 to 4.5 meters in length, with stipes measuring between 0.75 to 2.5 meters. The stipes exhibit a color gradient, being dark brown at the base and transitioning to a straw-like hue towards the top, devoid of any hair. The laminae are 0.75 to 2.5 meters long, displaying a proximally 3-4-pinnate-pinnatifid arrangement. The rachises are straw-colored and hairless, while the basal pinnae are equilateral, measuring 60-100 by 25-70 centimeters. Both pinnae and pinnules feature free lobes interspersed between the segments, with compound distal segments showing an irregular, caudate apex. The costae and costules are adorned with reddish catenate hairs on the abaxial side, while being hairless on the adaxial side. Veins are lanose underneath, sporting loose, cobweb-like hairs, and smooth on the upper surface. The tissue between the veins is hairless on both sides. Sori are linear and marginal, aligning with segment margins and emerging at the terminus of multiple veins, with vestigial inner indusia and linear outer indusia.
Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum is distinguished by the presence of free lobes between the segments on the pinnae and pinnules distally, abaxial veins adorned with arachnoid hairs, and a smooth, hairless laminar tissue between the veins. Notably, this subspecies consistently exhibits outer indusia, even in sterile leaves.
Rhizomes range from short to long-creeping, typically protostelic with internal phloem, occasionally solenostelic, and adorned with basally attached, nonclathrate scales or hairs. The leaves are monomorphic, featuring laminae that can be simple, 3-pinnate, or occasionally more dissected; veins are typically free, with occasional anastomosing, lacking included veinlets, and generally devoid of indument or occasionally adorned with 2-celled glandular hairs. Sori are typically marginal or submarginal, extrorse, elongate to linear, shielded by outer (unmodified) and inner (modified) indusia; spores are typically tetrahedral and trilete, occasionally bilateral and monolete (Smith et al., 2006).
Rhizomes are short-creeping, characterized by primitive scales. The leaves range in size from small to medium, measuring approximately 20 cm to 1 m in length. The laminae can be simple to 3-pinnate, with an indument that is either absent or composed of 2-celled glandular hairs. Veins are typically free, while sori are marginal or submarginal, elongate, and situated on comissural veins. The inner indusia are elongate and modified, whereas the outer indusia remain unaltered (Smith et al., 2006).
Approximately 180 species are known, with 34 of them being found in Brazil (Kramer, 1957; PPG I, 2016; Pena et al., 2020).
Terrestrial plants with short-creeping rhizomes bearing dark brown, lanceolate scales. The leaves are 30-50 cm long, with stipes measuring 15-25 cm in length; the stipes are dark brown at the base and stramineous above, quadrangular in shape, and adorned with dark brown, acuminate scales and sparse 2-celled glandular hairs. The laminae are 15-25 cm long and 2-pinnate, with non-winged, stramineous rachises bearing sparse 2-celled glandular hairs. Basal pinnae are equilateral, measuring 10-15 cm × 2.5-3.5 cm, with petiolulate, dimidiate pinnules that are 1.5-2 cm long. The costae on both sides are sparsely covered with 2-celled glandular hairs or are glabrescent, while the veins are glabrous on both sides. The laminar tissue between the veins is also glabrous. Sori are continuous, located at the tip of multiple veins, with inner indusia that are membranaceous to papyraceous, featuring entire, wavy, and glabrous margins.
All Lindsaea species found in Viçosa exhibit similarities in their 2-pinnate laminae and dimidiate pinnules. However, distinctions can be observed among them: Lindsaea lancea var. lancea stands out due to its continuous sori, L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis is characterized by reddish-brown, winged rachises, and L. stricta var. stricta is distinguished by its terete abaxial petioles. Furthermore, the pinnule lengths vary across the three taxa: ranging from 1.5-2 cm in L. lancea var. lancea, 1.2-1.5 cm in L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, and up to 1 cm in L. stricta var. stricta.
Terrestrial plants with short-creeping rhizomes bearing light brown, lanceolate scales. The leaves measure 40-75 cm in length, with stipes 25-40 cm long, entirely reddish-brown and quadrangular. Proximally, they exhibit light brown, acuminate scales and sparse 2-celled glandular hairs. The laminae are 20-40 cm long and 2-pinnate, with winged reddish-brown rachises adorned with sparse 2-celled glandular hairs. Basal pinnae are 10-18 × 2-3 cm, with short-petiolulate, dimidiate pinnules measuring 1.2-1.5 cm long. Costae on both abaxial and adaxial sides feature sparse 2-celled glandular hairs, while veins are glabrous on both sides. The laminar tissue between the veins is sparsely covered with 2-celled glandular hairs on the abaxial side and is glabrous adaxially. Sori are interrupted, located at the tip of multiple veins, with membranaceous indusia exhibiting dentate margins and being glabrous.
Terrestrial plants with short-creeping rhizomes bearing dark brown, lanceolate scales. The leaves measure 35-80 cm in length, with stipes ranging from 15-50 cm, dark brown at the base and stramineous towards the top. The abaxial side is terete while the adaxial side is flattened, initially adorned with dark brown, acuminate scales. The laminae are 20-35 cm long, either 2-pinnate or occasionally 1- or 3-pinnate; the rachises lack wings, are stramineous, and may have sparse 2-celled glandular hairs or be glabrescent. Basal pinnae are 12-25 cm × 1-2 cm, with short-petiolate, dimidiate or flabellate pinnules up to 1 cm long. Both abaxial and adaxial sides of the costae bear sparse 2-celled glandular hairs or are glabrescent, while the veins exhibit a similar pattern. The laminar tissue between the veins also shows sparse 2-celled glandular hairs or is glabrous. Sori are interrupted, located at the tip of multiple veins, with membranaceous inner indusia featuring dentate margins and a glabrous surface.
Rhizomes are typically erect, occasionally short-creeping, and may develop into small trunks, exhibiting a dictyostelic structure and adorned with peltate scales. The leaves are monomorphic, with stipes featuring an omega-shaped vascular strand, and laminae that are 1-4-pinnate, with free veins. The indument on the leaves is typically composed of caduceus scales, occasionally interspersed with scattered catenate hairs. Sori are found either marginally or submarginally, discrete, extrorse, and shielded by outer (unmodified) and inner (modified) indusia. The spores are tetrahedral-globose and trilete in nature (Smith et al., 2006).
One pantropical genus comprising approximately 24 species has been extensively studied (Rojas-Alvarado 2010, Luong et al. 2015, Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd 2022). The decision to assign the Paleotropical species to the genus Orthiopteris is supported by phylogenetic evidence, although it lacks morphological backing; therefore, it is deemed more appropriate to consider only Saccoloma within the Saccolomataceae family (Schwartsburd 2022). In Brazil, a total of nine species have been officially identified and acknowledged (Schwartsburd 2022).
Terrestrial plants with erect to decumbent rhizomes that are stout to trunk-like and glabrescent. The leaves are 1.2-2.2 m long, with petioles that are proximally burgundy and stramineous above, measuring 40-80 cm long, and proximally wrinkled to minutely spiny. Petiolar scales are peltate, blackish, with or without lighter, dentate margins. The laminae are 1-pinnate, 80-140 cm long, with stramineous, glabrous rachises. Basal pinnae measure 15-25 × 2.5-3.5 cm, with abaxially and adaxially glabrous costae. Veins are commonly 1-furcate, occasionally simple or 2 or 3-furcate at the base of pinnae, and are abaxially and adaxially glabrous. Sori are marginal, discrete, born at the tip of single veins, placed side by side, and open extrorsely. The outer indusia are not modified, while the inner indusia are hemi-umbonate, often forming wings that connect adjacent sori.
