The native plant Parkinsonia aculeata L., commonly known as palo verde, thrives in semidesert regions and seasonally dry tropical forests. A more in-depth analysis of its biochemical composition could provide valuable insights for its potential application in pest and disease biocontrol for economically significant agricultural species. This study sought to assess the levels of polyphenols and flavonoids in hydroalcoholic extracts derived from the stems and leaves of P. aculeata, as well as their phytotoxic effects on tomato seedlings during early growth stages. The extracts were administered at 15, 25, and 35 days after emergence (DAE). Notably, the leaves exhibited higher concentrations of polyphenols compared to flavonoids, with the polyphenol levels surpassing those of flavonoids. Both stem and leaf extracts displayed a phytotoxicity rating of 5 in tomato plants at 15 DAE, which diminished by 25 DAE and was absent by 35 DAE, except when the volume applied was 5 mL Plant-1. A significant interaction between organ type and volume was observed. The findings suggest that leaf and stem extracts could effectively control fusarium wilt without causing harm to tomato plants from 25 days onwards, using volumes ranging from 1 to 3 mL plant-1.
Phytopathologists and producers, adopting an organic approach, utilize various agrotechnical alternatives to mitigate the contaminant load resulting from the excessive use of broad-spectrum fungicides. One such alternative involves the application of plant extracts for pest and disease management (Báez et al., 2021). Notably, extracts from plants like the governor (Larrea tridentata (DC.) Coville) and oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) have shown efficacy in controlling phytopathogenic fungi belonging to the Fusarium genus, known to cause substantial crop losses in economically important crops (Figueroa et al., 2019).
Plants produce a significant amount of primary and secondary metabolites as a regulatory response to various pests and diseases, prompting research into their potential use for environmental protection through integrated management (Zoppolo et al., 2008). These metabolites serve as defenses, acting as repellents or directly eliminating microorganisms and pests. For instance, saponins, amygdalins, and norhydroguaiaretic acid are utilized for controlling fungi and bacteria (Martínez-Olivo et al., 2020), while protocatechotic acid demonstrates efficacy in pathogen control and specifically in preventing basal rot in tomatoes (El-Nagar et al., 2020). Polyphenols (PP), derived from the shikimic acid biosynthetic pathway, are among the synthesized metabolites by plants (Santos-Sánchez et al., 2019). PP function primarily as antioxidants, safeguarding foliar organs from damage induced by biological oxidation due to abiotic stress or caused by insects and microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi (Lee et al., 2020; Rivera-Solís et al., 2021).
Several species in semidesert environments exhibit characteristics of tolerance to pests and diseases, surviving under challenging conditions like salinity and drought (Gonzáles et al., 2021). One such species is P. aculeata, commonly referred to as "palo verde or bacaporo" (Adhikari & White, 2014). This particular species has been extensively researched in different regions worldwide, primarily for medicinal purposes (Divya et al., 2011; Franco et al., 2022). Phytochemical studies have been conducted to identify various metabolites that could potentially be utilized for biocontrol against pathogens, such as Fusarium oxysporum (Arvizu-Quintana et al., 2021).
These studies hold significant importance in preventing environmental contamination, as they have demonstrated minimal to no phytotoxic effects on economically valuable plant species. A crucial aspect involves assessing the impact of extracts derived from model plants like paloverde on the physiological, biochemical, and agronomic aspects of plants. Additionally, a key consideration is the potential replacement of certain chemical pesticides with these natural products.
The substitution could potentially decrease the levels of pollutants in agricultural areas. In light of these factors, a study was conducted to ascertain the levels of polyphenols and flavonoids in hydroalcoholic extracts derived from the stems and leaves of P. aculeata. Additionally, the research aimed to assess the phytotoxicity on tomato seedlings when these extracts were applied during the early stages of their growth and development.
The experimental area for this research was situated in the Biotechnology Laboratory of the National Institute of Technology of Mexico, Valle del Yaqui Campus, located in the municipality of Bácum, Sonora, Mexico. Leaf and stem samples of P. aculeata plants were collected from the semidesert region of Sonora to produce hydroalcoholic extracts through percolation, following the methodology outlined by Fecker et al. (2020). Each sample, weighing 100 g, was soaked in 1 L of 76% alcohol for a duration of 10 days (refer to Figs. 1a-b for leaves and stems, respectively). Subsequently, the alcohol was removed using a rotary evaporator operating at 30 revolutions per minute and a temperature of 65°C (BUCHI R215, USA), resulting in an extraction efficiency of 75%. The obtained extracts were stored at 4°C until further use (see Fig. 1c).
In this study, tomato seeds of the Río Grande® variety, known for their susceptibility to fusarium wilt (Arellano-Aburto et al., 2021), were utilized as the experimental model. These seeds were planted in 200-well polyfoam trays within a growth chamber that provided semi-controlled conditions. The chamber was set to maintain 10 hours of light, a temperature of 25°C, and a relative humidity of 75%. Germination of the seeds was facilitated using a peat moss type substrate (PROMIX®). After 15 days of emergence (DAE), the seedlings were carefully selected and exposed to the predetermined treatments.
The experimental treatments involved a combination of two sources of variation: A) plant organs, specifically stems and leaves; and B) volumes of extracts applied, ranging across four levels (0, 1, 3, and 5 mL plant-1). The control treatment was represented by zero applications of the extract. Each of the eight treatments consisted of a sample size of 30 plants. The extracts were applied to both roots and leaves simultaneously, three times post-emergence at 15, 25, and 35 DAE. The timing of application was not considered a source of variation, and the results were analyzed separately. The treatments were conducted under semi-controlled conditions, utilizing a completely randomized experimental design with a bifactorial arrangement. To account for potential edge effects and neighboring influences on phytotoxicity, all treatments were carefully monitored. Any plants showing signs of phytotoxicity were removed to minimize experimental error.
Polyphenol content was quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteu method as outlined by Anesini et al. (2008). In this procedure, a 125 µL volume of the gallic acid standard solution was prepared, followed by the addition of 0.5 mL of distilled H2O and 125 µL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. These reagents were allowed to react for 6 minutes before introducing 1.25 mL of a 7% Na2CO3 solution. Subsequently, 1 mL of distilled H2O was incorporated, and the mixture was left to incubate for 90 minutes at a temperature of 17°C and 65% relative humidity.
An absorbance reading was conducted on the solution using a UV Vis Genesys 10S spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) at a wavelength (λ) of 760 nm. Subsequently, both stem and leaf extracts were diluted at a 1:5 ratio with a 50% methanolic solution, and the total polyphenol content was determined following the same procedure as for gallic acid standards. By interpolating the absorbance of the extracts on the gallic acid curve, the total polyphenol content was determined in triplicate samples and expressed in mg L-1 of extract. The flavonoid content was determined according to the method outlined by Muñoz et al. (2007). Specifically, 250 μL of P. aculeata extracts were dissolved in 1000 μL of deionized water, followed by the addition of 75 μL of NaNO2 and a 5-minute reaction period. Subsequently, 75 μL of 10% AlCl3 and 500 μL of 1 M NaOH were added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 3500 r.p.m. for 5 minutes. The absorbance was then measured at a wavelength of 510 nm, and the final concentrations of total flavonoids were expressed in mg L-1 of stem and leaf extracts (Herrera et al., 2017).
The phytotoxicity assessment of hydroalcoholic extracts derived from the leaves and stems of P. aculeata was conducted during the early growth phases of the Rio Grande tomato variety. This evaluation was performed using the scale outlined in Table 1, with reference to the scale introduced by Esparza-Díaz et al. (2010).
To compare the concentrations of polyphenols and flavonoids, we utilized the theoretical distribution of student probabilities as proposed by Gosset (1917), which allowed us to discern differences across various organs where these compounds were measured. In assessing phytotoxicity, a double classification analysis of variance was conducted, following a linear model of fixed effects as outlined by Fisher (1937). The variable response considered for this analysis was the number of damaged or deceased plants observed during each treatment, treated as a discrete quantitative variable.
When differences in means among treatments were observed, Tukey's multiple comparison test was employed at a significance level of 5% (Tukey, 1960). Statistical parameters such as the coefficient of variation (CV), standard error of the mean of treatments (ESx), and coefficients of determination (R2) were calculated without adjusting for isolated factors (organs and volume) or their interaction. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATISTICA professional software, version 14.1 for Windows (Stasoft, 2014).
The hydroalcoholic extract of stems and leaves exhibited varying concentrations of polyphenols and total flavonoids, with significant differences observed between the two organs. The concentration of these compounds was notably higher in the leaves compared to the stems, as indicated in Table 2. This disparity suggests the plant's capacity to store these compounds as a defense mechanism against pests and diseases, with a greater accumulation observed in the leaves. In a study by Silva et al. (2012) focusing on rot control in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), it was found that hydroalcoholic extracts derived from both leaves and stems of palo verde at a concentration of 10% effectively reduced disease severity to 3.7 and 3.3, respectively. These findings potentially elucidate the limited reports of pests and diseases affecting this species, attributing this phenomenon to the synthesis and accumulation of polyphenols and flavonoids as primary biocontrol agents.
Numerous studies have demonstrated the inhibitory effects of crude plant extracts on microorganisms. For instance, the antimicrobial properties of Pinus wallichiana A.B.Jacks. leaf extracts against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) have been attributed to the high levels of flavonoids and polyphenols present (Ain et al., 2022). These findings underscore the potential of palo verde extract as a biocontrol agent due to its botanical origin. Moreover, its easy assimilation into plants (Stefanovic and Comic, 2012) suggests minimal to no phytotoxicity, further emphasizing the significance of this research.
Numerous extracts in question harbor terpenoids, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids, all of which are harnessed for the production of fungicides and pesticides in significant quantities (Nxumalo et al., 2021).
In Mexico, extracts from various plant species have been obtained, known for their significant concentration of flavonoids and polyphenols which are utilized as biocontrol agents against insects. Hernandez et al. (2018) demonstrated a substantial control of 48-hour-old larvae of Spodoptera frugiperda with seven concentrations of mistletoe dust (Phoradendron densum Torr. ex Trel.), showcasing its insecticidal activity.
Flavonoids are known to play a crucial role in protecting against biological oxidations triggered by both biotic and abiotic stresses (Sun et al., 2022). The levels of polyphenols present in plants and fruits can vary significantly based on factors like genotype, species, environmental conditions, maturity stage, soil composition, geographic location, and storage conditions (Shen et al., 2022). Due to their diverse functions including nutrient assimilation, protein synthesis, enzymatic activity, photosynthesis, structural component formation, and defense against environmental stressors like pathogens and insects, flavonoids are a subject of frequent research interest (Figueirinha et al., 2008; Vélez-Terranova et al., 2014).
The application of treatments T2 to T8 at 15 days after emergence (DAE) exhibited highly significant phytotoxicity (p=0.0017) in the Rio Grande tomato variety, resulting in damage to 77% of the plants in each treatment (value of 5). Consequently, the application of hydroalcoholic extract of P. aculeata at 15 DAE is not recommended (Table 3). In the statistical analysis, at this specific time of application (15 DAE), despite a significant interaction between the organ*volume factors (p=0.01796), it was evident that the effect of the applied volume accounted for 98% of the total variability observed (R2(volumes)=0.98). These results indicate that using any volume close to emergence can lead to phytotoxicity, with a notable increase in toxicity as the applied extract volume rises (Table 3).
At 25 days after emergence (DAE), significant differences were observed between the organs utilized for extract extraction (p=0.00274) and the volumes used (p=0.0003), with a notable interaction effect (p=0.0179). The application of extracts at this stage explained 64% of the total variability in phytotoxicity, with an average phytotoxicity value of 2 across treatments. Similarly, at 35 DAE, the variation in volume accounted for 79% of the total phytotoxicity variability, despite an average phytotoxicity value of 1 (refer to Table 3). These findings suggest that elevated extract volumes can induce phytotoxicity in plants, underscoring the necessity for further investigations to support recommendations for its safe application. Such insights could prove invaluable for producers seeking to manage diseases in seedlings while safeguarding the plants' initial morphological and physiological traits.
Various extracts derived from semi-desert plants have been harnessed for agronomic purposes, employing an organic and integrated management strategy for pest and disease control as outlined by Heikal et al. (2021). Notably, the governor species Larrea tridentata (DC.) Coville has been utilized for biocontrol of fusarium, resulting in a significant 10% reduction in radial growth, as reported by Martínez-Olivo et al. (2020). Additionally, Neem extract from Azadirachta indica A.Juss. has been investigated for its antifungal properties against tomato vascular wilt, demonstrating high control efficiency and minimal phytotoxicity in seedlings, as highlighted by Ayvar-Serna et al. (2021).
For the past decade, researchers have been investigating the efficacy of the hydroalcoholic extract of Acacia farnesiana in combating fungal diseases like fusariosis, as highlighted by Rodríguez et al. (2012) in their in vitro culture experiments. Their findings revealed a notable reduction in the mycelial growth of the fungus, coupled with minimal phytotoxic effects on plants. Similarly, Rivera-Solis et al. (2021) explored the potential of extracts from Sargassum spp. in inducing tolerance to Fusarium oxysporum in tomato seedlings, noting a lack of significant phytotoxicity. These studies underscore the practical utility of plant extracts in disease management within agricultural settings, while also emphasizing their role in environmental stewardship through the reduction of chemical inputs.
Plant extracts are increasingly acknowledged as environmentally safe, less hazardous, and cost-effective in pest and disease management. Many plant species possess inherent insecticidal properties in their natural state (Tavares et al., 2021), offering a viable alternative to reduce contaminant levels caused by concentrated chemical agents that can lead to resistance in organisms.
The production of plant extracts remains crucial in the quest for novel and environmentally friendly antimicrobials to combat the challenges posed by resistance to various pesticides. Leveraging extracts to mitigate or eradicate the harm inflicted by pests and diseases can serve as a valuable contribution to the global scientific arena, with potential far-reaching economic and ecological implications.
The hydroalcoholic extracts of Parkinsonia aculeata L. exhibit a greater concentration of flavonoids and polyphenols in the leaves compared to the stems. The Río Grande tomato variety demonstrates significant phytotoxicity (f=5) at 15 DAE, indicating that the use of hydroalcoholic extracts of P. aculeata during this period is not advisable. To ensure the safe application of the hydroalcoholic extract without triggering phytotoxic symptoms, it is recommended to administer it between 25 to 35 DAE of the seedlings.
