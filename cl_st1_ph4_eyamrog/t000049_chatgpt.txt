Some documents, such as the Proposal for Key Principles of a Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care (2014) and the National Guidelines for the Curriculum (2012), underscore the significance of formative evaluation as a research and innovation process within the realm of education. Educational evaluation, facilitated through the observation and analysis of educational documentation, enables teachers to assess their educational proposals and enhance them to foster learning effectively. In delving into this subject, I will draw upon research pertaining to scientific education in nursery schools. This research delves into the theoretical contributions of Dewey (1933; 1938), Vygotsky (1930; 1934), Wood, Bruner, Ross (1976), psychoanalysis concerning psychic processes as the foundation for curiosity, and the experiences of Susan Isaacs (1930; 1933) at the Malting House. The primary aim of this research is to underscore the conditions (such as space, materials, and adult approach) that facilitate optimal scientific exploration by children. The 'promoting from within' approach (Bondioli, 2008; Bondioli, Savio, 2009; Bondioli, 2015) serves as a valuable reference for crafting and implementing adult interventions geared towards nurturing a scientific mindset. Data was gathered through videotapes and observation protocols, with the subsequent development of two analysis grids: one focusing on the epistemic conduct of children and the other on the strategies and roles of adults. The initial analysis revealed intriguing insights into the educational context's conditions (such as adult intervention strategies, materials, and space) that are most conducive to fostering a scientific attitude and cultivating critical thinking skills.
In this study, the concepts of scientific education and evaluation are imbued with a distinct significance, intricately linked to the unique setting of a nursery school where the research was conducted.
Scientific education is characterized by the cultivation of critical and reflective thinking, emphasizing the acquisition of knowledge pertaining to living entities rather than the natural world. These skills are fostered within the discipline through an investigative approach, as advocated by Dewey, involving the identification and elucidation of pertinent issues. Central to this methodology is the formulation and testing of hypotheses, proposed solutions, and their subsequent validation.
Evaluation is a contentious and extensively discussed subject within the realm of education. While there seems to be a prevailing consensus that evaluation is a multifaceted process necessitating observation, documentation, and thoughtful analysis to enhance educational methodologies, there exist contrasting viewpoints rooted in a more traditionalist stance. This perspective perceives evaluation solely as a means of assessing performance, as opposed to a tool for holistic improvement (Vertecchi, 2016).
Several European documents, including the Indicazioni Nazionali per il Curricolo della Scuola dellâ€™Infanzia e del Primo Ciclo di Istruzione (2012), Quality Toolbox: Executive Summary (2012), and Proposal for Key Principles of a Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care (2014), unequivocally reject the notion of evaluation as a mere act of classification and judgment. Instead, they emphasize that the teacher's evaluative role is geared towards identifying, describing, and fostering growth and development. These documents underscore the significance of professional strategies like observation and documentation, as well as the importance of self-assessment for both the child and the teacher. Collaborative analysis of these documents by teams is beneficial as it helps in recognizing the alignment between pedagogical concepts, cultural decisions, and their implementation (Raso, Lampugnani, Marone, Lichene, 2020). In this context, evaluation emerges as a crucial instrument for enhancing the educational offerings of schools, with a focus on nurturing children's development through the educational process. The Proposal for Key Principles of a Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care (2012) further emphasizes that evaluation should aim at recognizing, supporting, describing, and documenting developmental processes, rather than simply judging or categorizing performances.
This form of assessment necessitates a meticulous and systematic observation to differentiate between the child's existing abilities and the ones they are currently acquiring. It is imperative to recognize and strengthen these potentials to guide the choices and educational interventions required to foster their ongoing development in children. The teacher is entrusted with the task of providing support (scaffolding), motivation, and facilitation for their holistic growth. These assessment protocols should take into account the children's everyday experiences and urge the teacher to concentrate on the process while assuming accountability for their chosen educational approach, acknowledging both successes and setbacks. The significance of educational evaluation in relation to the developmental processes and advancements achieved by children is elucidated from this standpoint.
In this study, which centers on the concept of scientific education as delineated earlier, evaluation is viewed as a process that oversees, directs, and steers the educational endeavor, the researcher's methodology, and the actions of teachers.
The research was conducted on an exploratory basis with the aim of identifying and analyzing the optimal contexts - including space, time, and educational approaches - to foster and enhance the development of scientific thinking in kindergarten. The initial project, overseen by a team of researchers and supervisors, underwent minor adjustments as a result of observations made during interactions with the children and the review of collected documents. The final reflections on the study highlight the advancements made by the children in the realm of scientific inquiry. These advancements are intricately linked to the carefully selected contexts - encompassing tools, time, and educational strategies - deliberately chosen by adults, meticulously documented, monitored, and assessed from various perspectives to provide an enriching experience not only for the children but also for the educators and families involved.
The scientific literature, as referenced by Giordano (2010), Andersson and Gullberg (2014), and Bertolino, Guerra, Schenetti, and Antonietti (2017), emphasizes that scientific education should not merely involve the transmission of content. It is crucial for adults to acknowledge and nurture the innate curiosities, questions, and interests that every child possesses, even at the onset of their educational journey. This specific approach should be dedicated to fostering and bolstering their interests and discoveries, thereby stimulating further exploration and learning processes (Bondioli and Savio, 2014). In alignment with this perspective, the Indicazioni Nazionali per il curricolo of 2012 (updated in "Nuovi scenari," 2018) address scientific education within "La conoscenza del mondo," placing a significant emphasis on a child's curiosity, interest in observed phenomena, ability to pose questions and delve deeper into investigations, and enthusiasm for sharing discoveries with peers and educators.
 a deeper understanding of the subject matter. By focusing on the practical application of theoretical knowledge, this study aims to bridge the gap between academia and real-world problem-solving. The integration of hands-on experiences and critical thinking skills is crucial in fostering a holistic approach to learning. Through this research, it is evident that a multidimensional approach to education is essential in preparing individuals for the complexities of the modern world. The findings of this study underscore the importance of incorporating practical elements into academic curricula to enhance the overall learning experience and promote a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
The capacity and readiness to utilize the existing body of knowledge and methodologies to elucidate the natural world, enabling the identification of inquiries and the formulation of evidence-based conclusions are essential. Proficiency in technology is perceived as the utilization of this knowledge and methodology to address perceived human desires or requirements. Proficiency in science and technology encompasses an awareness of the impacts of human actions and the accountability of the individual as a citizen. (Recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning, 2006, p. 15).
The research planning outlined here, along with the educational strategies implemented by the adult, are intricately linked to John Dewey's (1933; 1938) theoretical insights on the inquiry process, Vygotsky's (1930; 1934) concept of the "zone of proximal development," and Bruner's scaffolding. Additionally, Susan Isaacs' (1930, 1933) contributions proved invaluable as her experiences at Malting House enabled her to adeptly interpret Dewey's theory and psychoanalytic principles in a distinctly pedagogical manner.
The 'promotion from within' approach, as advocated by Bondioli (2008; 2009; 2015a, b) and Savio (2003; 2012; 2013), was implemented to uphold a strong link between the aforementioned theories and sources. This method is integrated into the conceptual framework discussed earlier and is distinguished by its participatory nature. Educational activities are planned based on the child's curiosity, with a willingness to embrace their input and suggestions.
Building upon previous studies, the primary objective of this research was to pinpoint the optimal environment for fostering a scientific understanding of natural behaviors in preschool-aged children, specifically focusing on those in kindergarten. The educational approaches implemented by teachers play a pivotal role in shaping this environment, thus warranting thorough examination within the study. Additionally, a secondary goal was to investigate whether children within the same educational setting, age bracket (4- and 5-year-olds), and exposed to identical opportunities for hands-on exploration with 'stimulating tools,' exhibited similar skill sets and scientific attitudes following exposure to varying teaching methodologies.
The educational styles advocated by the teachers in the three distinct groups of children are categorized as follows:
In the laissez-faire approach, the adult assumes an observer role and refrains from intervening unless specific practical issues arise. The primary goal is to promote exploration activity without adult interference. By implementing this method, we aim to investigate how complete freedom and autonomy, devoid of adult intervention, influence children's engagement in scientific exploration.
Promotion from within has been extensively discussed in the literature (Bondioli, 2008; Bondioli & Savio, 2009; Bondioli, 2015a & Savio, 2003; Bondioli & Savio, 2012; Savio, 2013). The adult's role in this model involves promoting and facilitating explorative actions. Here, the teacher patiently awaits and encourages the child's initiatives, fosters questioning, and mirrors the scientific curiosity displayed by the children, either verbally or non-verbally. Additionally, the teacher demonstrates and expands upon the children's endeavors, enhancing their exploratory and inventive pursuits. These elements collectively characterize the participatory nature of this approach, which prioritizes the child's interests and active involvement in the learning process. The primary objective of this approach is to explore how an adult's intervention, aimed at stimulating a child's curiosity and interests without imposing control over their ideas, can impact the development of scientific attitudes.
This educational approach, akin to the previously mentioned method, involves encouraging children to revisit and reflect on their experiences through discussions at the conclusion of activities. The adult facilitator plays a crucial role in promoting dialogue, encouraging confrontation, and fostering reflection by posing specific questions such as: What did we accomplish today? What did we notice? How can we build upon this experience? The objective here is to assess the potential influence of this adult-led approach, which not only promotes learning from within but also emphasizes participative reflection, on the development of scientific attitudes among children. Additionally, this method delves into exploring the impact of the metacognitive dimension on the overall learning process.
In this research, children aged 4 to 5 were selected as participants and subsequently divided into three groups, ensuring a balance in terms of age and gender distribution. Each group underwent an equal number of sessions held in identical settings, utilizing the same materials, but with distinct approaches that were randomly assigned to each group. The scenario presented to the children was:
Group A would evaluate the effectiveness of the 'promotion from within' strategy.
Group B will undergo a process that involves a combination of 'promotion from within' and guided discussions on the activities.
In Group C, an adult serves as an observer, refraining from intervening to actively promote the participants' cognitive processes.
The research was conducted over a three-month period, with meetings held in a classroom that was set up as a laboratory. The table presented below outlines the various types of interactions in which the groups engaged. All interactions with the children were meticulously recorded and transcribed for the purpose of monitoring and subsequent analysis.
The utilization of audio-visual materials proved to be essential as they allowed the researchers to repeatedly review the meetings, enabling them to identify increasingly nuanced details with each viewing. Furthermore, these materials facilitated the involvement of additional observers during the analysis phase, particularly the process supervisors. The supervisors' participation served the dual purpose of mitigating potential subjectivity biases and incorporating diverse perspectives that enhanced the examination of the gathered materials. By documenting the process and engaging in ongoing re-evaluation, the researchers were able to pinpoint critical junctures and recognize the occasional need to pause and contemplate the intervention strategies. Through a meticulous study of the materials, the researchers were able to construct analysis tables delineating the scientific behaviors exhibited by the children, as well as the methods and interventions employed by the adult to foster cognitive development, aligning with the 'promotion from within' approach. These actions align with the evaluation concept elucidated in the premise, representing a form of evaluation that "proceeds, accompanies, and follows" (Indicazioni Nazionali, 2012, p.19) the learning process. Adhering to this framework, the researchers and supervisors scrutinized the recordings, successfully delineating scientific behaviors displayed by the children and strategies implemented by the adult.
The arrangement of categories in the subsequent list is not determined by a linear progression of occurrence; rather, it serves to underscore the intricate and nuanced nature of the various methodologies employed.
Detection of the phenomenon refers to instances where children engage with materials by perceiving certain characteristics without delving deeper into investigation. For instance, consider Leonardo observing plastic bottles, then laying down, taking aim, and blowing on one of the bottles until it falls. This process is repeated a few times, with increasing intensity in blowing until the desired outcome is achieved.
Assembly and construction behaviors examined in this study involve instances where children, either individually or in groups, actively seek out objects with the purpose of constructing something based on a specific project or goal. These endeavors are typically accomplished without encountering significant obstacles. Examples of such activities include constructing a marble track or assembling various materials to create a wigwam.
Exploration encompasses behaviors in which a child not only detects and briefly observes a phenomenon but actively engages with it to deepen their understanding, aiming to comprehend "how it works" with an objective beyond cognitive development in mind. For instance, when Alice attempts to retrieve a piece of cellotape but struggles to tear it, she intensifies her efforts by pulling harder, noticing the tape's elasticity without tearing. She then tries to use her teeth to rip it off, assuming it will tear if she exerts more force, only to realize this approach fails. Subsequently, she returns the tape to its container while holding the cardboard roll, demonstrating her exploration of the tape's properties and her problem-solving process.
Experimentation encompasses the various channels through which a child engages and interacts with available materials based on a hypothesis awaiting validation. The pivotal element within this category involves articulating the hypothesis verbally and executing actions necessary to test it, while observing ensuing effects. This conduct type evolves in alignment with Dewey's investigation process theory. For instance, consider Leonardo immersed in a pool of water who exclaims, "See! This floats (pointing to a piece of wood), but if I place this (a water-filled plastic bottle) on it, it will sink."
Identification of the problem is a crucial aspect closely aligned with Dewey's investigative process. Behaviors falling under this category are characterized by children encountering a dilemma or obstacle during their explorations with the available materials. This situation leads to a sense of frustration as their research becomes impeded by an external problem. The child is faced with a challenging scenario where they explicitly recognize the obstacle hindering their progress and make attempts to resolve it. An illustrative example is provided below.
In the observation, Leonardo identified a piece of cardboard from a damaged kitchen paper roll and remarked, "Here it is broken." Subsequently, he scanned the surroundings, located a box, and retrieved a roll of blue tape. Demonstrating the issue, he pointed out the raised corner on the cardboard roll, stating, "I have to fix it!" While examining the tape, he attempted to locate the starting point for peeling off a piece. Peter and Alice joined him, prompting Leonardo to start pulling the tape forcefully. As he struggled with the task, he scrutinized both the cardboard roll and the tape, questioning, "How do you do it... how do you do it?" Alice then suggested a solution, proposing, "If we use scissors, we can cut it."
In examining the adult's intervention, I will illustrate with an example from the table below to show how the researcher executed supportive actions and strategies to foster and enhance scientific attitudes in children following their requests. Even in this instance, the selection of strategies and functions carried out by the adult was shaped by the concept of evaluation, viewed as a tool to ensure alignment between pedagogical principles, goals, and educational decisions.
In this research article, the identification of educational strategies and functions aligned with the 'promotion from within' approach involved the consideration of Bondioli's and Savio's (1996, 2001) categories. These categories emphasized the significance of an intervention style that does not dominate but rather amplifies the child's interests and perspectives. Specifically, the adult engages in 'reflecting' on the child's verbal and non-verbal behaviors without passing judgment. Additionally, they pose open-ended questions that encourage a wide array of responses and introduce new elements, such as materials or activities, that are in harmony with the child's or group's ongoing activities.
The strategies mentioned above serve specific functions within the framework of tutoring theory, particularly in relation to cognitive, emotional, and social aspects.
The data processed in the aforementioned schemes were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative analysis provided specific insights into the manifestation and evolution of scientific categories, communication methods, and socialization associated with these attitudes. Additionally, the examination of the schemes concerning the role of adults facilitated an exploration of the strategies and functions that can effectively enhance and encourage learning processes in children.
The analysis of Tables 3, 4, and 5, which detail the display of scientific behaviors in children during encounters, indicates notable distinctions between groups A (promotion from within), B (promotion from within with subsequent discussion), and C (no intervention to foster scientific attitudes), particularly in the realms of experimentation (A=6, B=10, C=1) and problem detection (A=10, B=5, C=0). Conversely, minimal variations are observed in the detection of phenomena and exploration categories. This implies that while providing children with engaging materials and allowing them to freely explore is crucial, it alone does not suffice to trigger more sophisticated scientific attitudes. The attitudes aligned with Dewey's inquiry process were predominantly evident in groups where materials were freely explored but also supplemented by adult guidance, incorporating interventions rooted in Bruner's tutoring (1967) and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development (1934; 1938). These interventions were designed not only to enhance the display of scientific attitudes but also to cultivate and enhance them through the facilitation of learning processes.
In examining the children's experiences, the researcher and supervisors pinpointed elements deemed worthy of investigation, such as the duration for which children across the three groups exhibited scientific attitudes and how they utilized these attitudes to explore specific themes or observed phenomena. Notably, groups A and B, under the guidance of an adult who encouraged internal growth, sustained their focus on scientific attitudes for an extended period (increasing from 37% in the initial encounter to 42% in the final one) in contrast to group C (decreasing from 24% in the first meeting to 12% in the last). In group C, where the adult did not prioritize or support the children's interests and refrained from actively intervening to foster the learning process, the manifestation of scientific attitudes dwindled over time.
Considerations can be extended to the identification of articulated epistemic behavior, which refers to the complex attitudes exhibited by children when investigating observed phenomena. The analysis of collected data revealed distinct epistemic behaviors among children in groups A and B, following the 'promotion from within' approach, with A and B exhibiting 11 behaviors each. These behaviors, linked to scientific investigation, encompassed exploration, experimentation, and issue identification to enhance their understanding of the same phenomenon. Conversely, group C demonstrated fewer (4 behaviors) and less complexity in behaviors related to learning through a scientific investigative approach, such as constructing and exploring. The tables presented below illustrate the quantity and quality of articulated epistemic behaviors employed by children in investigating various observed phenomena.
In summary, based on the considerations discussed thus far, notable distinctions have surfaced among the groups with regards to:
The epistemic behavior of Groups A and B contrasts with that of Group C, particularly in their heightened engagement with activities falling within the scientific realms of experimentation and problem identification.
Groups A and B dedicate a higher percentage of time to epistemic activities compared to Group C. This difference highlights the extent to which children in Groups A and B engage in activities that necessitate the activation of epistemic behavior. By delving deeper into this aspect and analyzing the 'non-scientific' activities undertaken by the groups during their remaining time, additional insights can be gleaned.
In certain instances and gatherings, distinct scenarios and interactions arise due to the presence of data that diverge from the typical pattern of a specific group. Within groups A and B, unique situations unfold based on certain data points. For instance, in group B, a significant decline was noted in the second meeting concerning verbal communication methods, social interactions, and the time allocated to scientific pursuits. Additionally, a noteworthy observation is the exceptionally high percentage of time dedicated to scientific activities during the fourth meeting (B = 87%), which will be further scrutinized in relation to the adult's role. Conversely, in group A, more intricate scientific behaviors start to emerge from the second meeting onwards (refer to section 4.2). This contrast is not evident in group C, as the children appear to maintain a status quo where they do not engage in more sophisticated epistemic behaviors, verbal communication modes, or collaborative social exchanges.
The initial observations suggest a potential influence of the intervention approach in groups A and B on the development of cognitive attitudes towards the observed phenomena. This hypothesis requires further exploration to gather additional evidence, considering alternative research perspectives.
The examination of the strategies employed by the adult demonstrates how numerous interventions align with the 'promotion from within' approach embraced by groups A and B, particularly through mirroring. Within these two groups, the adult's aim was to elicit further insights, extend the experience, or prompt reflection (A=35 and B=36). In contrast, group C stands out for its focus on interventions aimed at ensuring the functionality of social factors (C=13). This functionality was facilitated through accommodating strategies, such as the adult engaging in play with the children to establish rules, or through more specific directives like, "Let's explore your kit and examine its contents. Are there any intriguing items? Let's differentiate between objects that float and those that sink."
The data on instances where adults 'unintentionally' engaged in more direct interventions, demonstrating tasks to children instead of considering their input, and providing straightforward answers to their queries, resulted in a reduction in time spent on scientific activities, communication of attitudes, and group interaction. This aligns with previous assertions on the impacts of internal promotion. Such actions imply that by offering activities that do not align with children's interests, adults inadvertently replace them, hindering their ability to engage, develop theories, test them, and share with peers. Children in environments where adults disregarded their inquiries struggled with scientific attitudes and group dynamics, necessitating multiple interventions by the researcher to maintain a conducive setting for activities. These challenges were absent in the other two groups that adhered to the internal promotion approach.
The research yielded a wealth of data that was meticulously analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, offering crucial insights into the parameters necessary for an educational approach that fosters the cultivation of scientific attitudes. These attitudes encompass an active engagement in investigation, leading to the autonomous and participative construction of knowledge and a deep scientific comprehension (Andersson & Gullberg, 2014; Onida & Salvadori, 2020). Furthermore, the analysis of the collected materials provided valuable guidance on how to nurture a science-oriented mindset, encouraging critical reflection on complex issues and enhancing understanding of the intricate workings of the world and its various entanglements and relationships (ArcÃ  & Mazzoli, 1995; Bertolino, Guerra, Schenetti, & Antonacci, 2017).
The exploratory nature of this research has facilitated the identification of key considerations for designing educational interventions focused on enhancing critical thinking processes. This opportunity has shed light on crucial questions that necessitate answers and can guide educational and instructional decisions. Specifically, it prompts inquiries into the most effective strategies for fostering more sophisticated scientific attitudes, the optimal approaches to promote children's verbal expression and collaboration in investigating phenomena, and the methods to recognize and prevent the development of automatic responses stemming from daily routines that may hinder authentic engagement and reflection, where adults may inadvertently overshadow or dismiss children's contributions.
What strategies should be considered for organizing and managing a similar experience to the one outlined in the preceding paragraph, adapting it to daily school work? Specifically, how can small groups of children be formed at a designated time during the day, and how can the appropriate documentation be gathered through video recordings or traditional observation methods using pen and paper for subsequent analysis with colleagues? The reflection on necessary actions should not solely rely on the data collected from the experience or the initial planning. This process of reflective action (SchÃ¶n, 1993) that intertwines planning, execution, and documentation, with the aim of assessing progress and making necessary adjustments, involves deliberate choices on the part of the teacher. These decisions pertain to both activity organization and the utilization of evaluation tools. Consequently, the evaluation process is intended to "guide" the learning process and acquire insights to enhance it by refining the environment, rather than merely assessing the children's performances.
The concepts mentioned above frame evaluation as a research process in which teachers, guided by shared values and pedagogical principles, conceptualize developmental pathways that involve observation, documentation, and assessment. These processes are designed to facilitate a re-examination of experiences and the identification of enhancements in both methodologies (such as observation and documentation) and diverse perspectives. Evaluation, viewed through this lens, is not a one-way street where teachers pass judgment on students or researchers assess the outcomes of their investigations; rather, it is characterized by a complex interplay of interconnected layers. This perspective underscores the need for teachers to embrace adaptable and inclusive intervention strategies that eschew preconceived notions in favor of a willingness to scrutinize their educational and instructional approaches, thereby enriching children's daily experiences, nurturing their curiosity, acknowledging their differences, and appreciating the array of individual responses. Engaging in discussions about the decisions made by adults to cultivate an educational setting that fosters critical thinking necessitates a readiness to relinquish certainties and confront the emotionally taxing realm of uncertainty (Bion, 1973). This process entails managing a certain level of anxiety to resist the allure of seeking 'off-the-shelf' solutions.
In this context, researchers and supervisors should be open to embracing hypotheses that arise from the analysis of collected data while maintaining the scientific integrity of the project. This notion underscores the importance of cultivating the workgroup as an entity capable of accommodating new hypotheses through constructive engagement. It is essential for each workgroup to undergo appropriate professional development that fosters dialogue, constructive debate, self-assessment as a pivotal tool to govern and steer the educational process. Consequently, the training should equip educators to engage in research with students, confront the emotional and uncertain aspects of this process, and address doubts and uncertainties without succumbing to the temptation of simply explaining, transmitting concepts, or suggesting activities that do not align with the children's interests.
