This review seeks to examine the primary epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic facets of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in critically ill pediatric patients.
An exhaustive examination of the medical literature concerning COVID-19 was conducted, with a primary emphasis on the critical care of pediatric patients. This review incorporated expert opinions and recent reports pertaining to this emerging disease. Scholars from a prominent Brazilian public university meticulously analyzed all recently published materials to compile a comprehensive report with the objective of establishing standardized protocols for the treatment of critically ill children and adolescents.
The report focuses on the clinical manifestations of the disease and the provision of ventilatory support in pediatric patients with COVID-19. It introduces a flowchart designed to assist healthcare professionals in effectively triaging critical cases.
COVID-19 presents a clinical challenge that is largely unfamiliar to pediatric intensive care professionals. The development of guidelines by experts can assist in establishing a standardized approach among practitioners, ultimately enhancing the care and treatment of patients with COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a single-stranded RNA virus believed to have originated in bats. The primary mode of transmission is through person-to-person contact, where the virus can be transferred from hands to the eyes, nose, or mouth, as well as through respiratory droplets produced when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. There is no evidence supporting vertical transmission or transmission via breastfeeding. It is possible for transmission to occur from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers, as well as during the estimated 1 to 14-day incubation period (with a mean of 5 days). Symptoms typically manifest within 12.5 days after exposure, leading to the established quarantine period of 14 days post-exposure.
The clinical presentation of COVID-19 varies widely, encompassing individuals who are asymptomatic to those experiencing severe acute respiratory distress, as illustrated in Figure 1 (3).
Based on a case series involving 2143 pediatric patients documented in the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database, it was found that 731 cases were confirmed through laboratory testing. Among these cases, 94 (4.4%) patients were asymptomatic, 1091 (50.9%) presented with mild symptoms, and 831 (38.8%) exhibited moderate symptoms. A mere 125 (5.8%) patients progressed to severe or critical illness. Notably, younger children showed a higher vulnerability to severe or critical symptoms, with 10.6% of those under 1 year old affected compared to 3% of those over 16 years old. Thirteen critical cases were identified, with 53.8% of them occurring in patients under 1 year old. Tragically, only one death was recorded, that of a 14-year-old boy.
In a separate study involving 171 pediatric cases (aged 1 day to 15 years; median age, 6.7 years) admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China, it was found that all patients tested positive for COVID-19. Among them, 27 (15.8%) were asymptomatic, 33 (19.3%) exhibited upper airway symptoms, and 111 (64.9%) had pneumonia. Fever was reported in 71 pediatric patients (41.5%), with a duration ranging from 1 to 16 days (median duration, 3 days). Three patients required intensive care unit admission, all of whom had underlying conditions such as hydronephrosis, leukemia (undergoing chemotherapy), and intussusception. The patient with intussusception, a 10-month-old, experienced a deteriorating condition leading to multiple organ dysfunction and eventual death. Notably, recent observations have highlighted the occurrence of various cutaneous rashes in some pediatric cases, each presenting with distinct clinical features.
The white blood cell count may present as normal or reduced, with a study of 171 pediatric COVID-19 cases revealing leukopenia in 26.3% of patients and only 3.5% experiencing lymphocytopenia. C-reactive protein levels can vary between normal and elevated. In severe or critical cases, there may be an increase in hepatic and muscular enzyme levels, as well as elevated D-dimer levels (2,4).
In the initial phase of illness, chest radiography findings may reveal signs of pneumonia, such as small irregular lung opacities and interstitial alterations, typically affecting peripheral areas. Severe cases may exhibit ground glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation, with pleural effusion being rare. Chest computed tomography also shows GGO and segmental consolidation in both lungs, while children with severe infection may display bilateral lobar consolidation. Lung ultrasonography (US) demonstrates single or grouped, usually bilateral, pneumogenic-type vertical artifacts and/or small areas of white lung. Advanced COVID-19 pneumonia is characterized by evident consolidation, particularly in the posterobasal regions, and widespread patched artifactual changes akin to those seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thoracic electrical impedance tomography can be utilized to monitor the regional ventilation distribution in ARDS patients and identify refractory hypoxemia necessitating alveolar recruitment maneuvers.
The identification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid through real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) stands as the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. This virus can be identified in secretions from the upper airway or lower airway, including samples such as nasopharynx swabs or tracheal aspirates (if the patient is intubated), sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in blood, urine, and stool samples.
In a case series involving 10 pediatric patients from Shanghai, viral RNA was consistently detected in the nasopharynx of all patients within 4 to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms, persisting for a duration ranging from 6 to 22 days (with a mean of 12 days) following the initial day of illness. Notably, in five patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still detectable in stool samples up to 18 to 30 days post the onset of symptoms. As per the 22-38 SS Resolution dated March 3, 2020, issued by São Paulo’s State Health Secretary, it is recommended that RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 be reserved for patients in severe or critical conditions, those admitted to sentinel units, and healthcare professionals displaying typical COVID-19 symptoms. Testing is not advised for asymptomatic individuals.
A diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is established by evaluating clinical findings, epidemiological data, and laboratory test results (2). The flowchart depicted in Figure 2 outlines the recommended approach for patients presenting with flu-like symptoms, as suggested by the São Paulo State Health Secretary (10,11).
Other viral respiratory illnesses such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Influenza, Parainfluenza, Adenovirus, and Metapneumovirus are commonly responsible for lower airway infections in children and share clinical presentations similar to COVID-19. The identification of the causative agent in respiratory secretions through polymerase chain reaction is crucial for accurate diagnosis.
Bacterial pneumonia typically presents with prominent clinical features such as elevated fever and a toxemic state.
Leukocytosis often presents alongside neutrophilia and an elevated count of immature cells. Conducting blood and tracheal aspirate cultures is crucial for diagnostic purposes. In intubated patients, performing a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can significantly aid in establishing a definitive diagnosis.
Atypical pneumonia, caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae, is a significant contributor to community-acquired pneumonia in children. Serologic tests play a crucial role in confirming the diagnosis of these pathogens (2).
The four key principles for effective therapeutic management include early identification, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment. In cases of suspected COVID-19, patients should be isolated in a single room with strict infection control measures until laboratory confirmation. Mild cases can be managed with symptomatic relief medications such as paracetamol or dipyrone to address fever. Various antiviral agents like oseltamivir, ribavirin, ganciclovir, remdesivir, lopinavir, and ritonavir have been utilized to reduce viral load and prevent respiratory complications, although their benefits remain inconclusive. A study from China involving over 100 patients suggested that chloroquine effectively treated COVID-19-associated pneumonia by inhibiting exacerbation, reducing radiographic changes, eliminating the virus, and shortening the disease duration. Similarly, a French study with 20 COVID-19 patients indicated that hydroxychloroquine treatment led to viral infection resolution, with added benefits when combined with azithromycin. Ongoing research is exploring the efficacy of these drugs in critically ill patients at higher risk of mortality, with proposed dosages of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (5–10 mg/kg/day for 10 days) and azithromycin (10 mg/kg on day one, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for four days up to a maximum of 30 mg/kg or 1,500 mg).
Severe cases presenting with respiratory distress and/or hypoxia (SaO2 < 94%) should be promptly hospitalized. Criteria for intensive care unit (ICU) admission include respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation, shock, or other organ dysfunction necessitating intervention. Critical cases are typified by the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) characterized by hypoxemic acute respiratory distress and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates not attributable to cardiac dysfunction or fluid overload. The primary treatment principles for ARDS encompass various strategies as outlined in existing literature (17-20).
Early tracheal intubation, specifically rapid sequence intubation, is considered the optimal approach in this scenario. Preoxygenation should be conducted using a flexible nasal cannula with flows of up to 4 L/min or a reservoir mask with a lower flow rate to maintain an SaO2 above 93%. It is recommended to avoid positive pressure ventilation with a bag-valve-mask or similar devices to prevent aerosol generation. Sedation can be achieved using fentanyl (1–2 mg/kg) or ketamine (1–2 mg/kg, if pulmonary hypertension is not a contraindication), along with neuromuscular blocking with rocuronium (0.6–1.2 mg/kg) as the preferred choice. If available, video laryngoscopy should be employed for the intubation process.
Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) should be avoided due to the significant risk it poses for aerosol dispersion and contamination among healthcare providers.
Protective mechanical ventilation involves utilizing either pressure-controlled or volume-cycled ventilation techniques, employing a low tidal volume of approximately 6 mL/kg and maintaining a plateau pressure below 30 cmH2O. The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) should be adjusted to achieve a reduction in FiO2 to below 50%, aiming for a PaO2 of at least 60 mmHg and an SaO2 between 90-93%. Typically, initiating PEEP at 5-6 cmH2O and gradually increasing it to 12-14 cmH2O is recommended. It is crucial to uphold a driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) below 15 cmH2O and accept hypercapnia with a pH above 7.2 (permissive hypercapnia), except in cases of pulmonary hypertension.
Prone positioning is recommended, particularly when the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is less than or equal to 150 mmHg. It is advised to keep the patient in this position for a minimum of 18 hours daily, while continuously monitoring their oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels using oximetry and capnography, respectively.
Closed tracheal aspiration systems are recommended for use in clinical settings.
Treatment with nitric oxide and/or sildenafil at doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg per kilogram per dose every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum of 20 mg per dose every 8 hours, is recommended for patients experiencing persistent hypoxemia. In cases where conventional treatments such as protective mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, and nitric oxide/sildenafil have not yielded successful outcomes for patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 70-80 mmHg, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered, subject to its availability within the hospital setting.
Conservative fluid therapy involves limiting fluid intake in patients who are hemodynamically stable. This approach typically begins with administering 50% of the recommended volume according to the Holliday-Segar rule. Subsequent adjustments are made based on the patient's fluid balance and hemodynamic status.
Patients presenting with wheezing and lower airway obstruction necessitate treatment strategies aimed at minimizing respiratory droplet dispersion within the environment. It is imperative to steer clear of aerosol bronchodilators and instead opt for spray or dosimetric inhalers. In select cases, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may be employed, utilizing a mechanical ventilator equipped with a double circuit featuring filters in both segments - one for warming and humidifying in the inspiratory circuit, and another for high-efficiency particle separation in the expiratory circuit. Notably, NIV support should be administered solely in isolation hospital rooms with negative pressure. If after 1 to 2 hours of non-invasive mechanical ventilation there is no significant improvement, tracheal intubation is advised. Mechanical ventilation assistance should be cautious to prevent pulmonary hyperinflation, auto-PEEP, and barotrauma. Pressure-controlled ventilation is the preferred mode within synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, incorporating support pressure, a low breathing rate, an inspiration/expiration time ratio of 1:3–1:4, and a PEEP level of 5 cmH2O.
Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with secondary bacterial infections based on culture and antibiogram results. Corticosteroids, while effective in suppressing lung inflammation, can also hinder immune responses and pathogen clearance, thus their use should be limited to specific indications such as bronchospasm or certain cases of septic shock. A case study highlighted the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in a critically ill 3-year-old child. Patients experiencing cardiocirculatory dysfunction and shock may benefit from fluid therapy or vasoactive/inotropic drugs. Milrinone (0.1–1.0 mg/kg/min) or dobutamine (5–15 mg/kg/min) can be beneficial for those with a low cardiac index due to pulmonary hypertension and normal arterial pressure, while epinephrine at an inotropic dose (≤0.3 mg/kg/min) may be appropriate for patients with hypotension. In cases of other organic dysfunctions in children and adolescents, continuous renal replacement therapy might be necessary as renal dysfunction is indicative of a poor prognosis. Microthrombosis and associated ischemic events, such as strokes, are prevalent, particularly in adolescents and adults, necessitating frequent monitoring of D-dimer levels.
Medical transport teams should be responsible for providing appropriate transportation for the patient and their parent or caregiver to the hospital. It is recommended that community pediatricians advise parents to wait for this service and refrain from seeking secondary care independently, such as by using their own vehicle or public transportation (22).
