Vriesea reitzii, an endemic bromeliad from the Atlantic Rainforest, was the focus of this study on seed cryopreservation. The research aimed to assess cryopreservation through direct immersion of seeds collected from capsules at 120, 135, and 150 days after anthesis (DAA). Prior to cryopreservation, water content was determined, while post-cryopreservation evaluations included germination percentage, germination speed index (GSI), and total soluble carbohydrates. The seeds collected at 120 DAA exhibited the highest moisture content at 17.6%, whereas those from 150 DAA showed the highest germination percentage (89.6%) and GSI (17.0). Optical and transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed no cell damage or morpho-histological and ultrastructural changes post-cryopreservation. These findings suggest that V. reitzii seeds can be classified as orthodox seeds, and cryopreservation (+LN) emerges as an effective method for ex situ conservation of this species.
The Bromeliaceae Juss. Family encompasses 78 genera and 3,336 known species, making it one of the most diverse families in the Atlantic forest (Gouda et al., 2021). The genus Vriesea Lindl. comprises 231 species, with 219 of them being endemic to Brazil (Costa et al., 2021). Vriesea is the most species-rich genus in the Atlantic Forest biome, with a total of 169 species, out of which 145 are endemic. One such endemic species, Vriesea reitzii Leme & A.F. Costa, is currently endangered, as indicated in the list of the Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil (Martinelli et al., 2008).
Given the ecological significance of bromeliads and their endemism, it is crucial to develop conservation strategies that safeguard genetic diversity (Costa et al., 2014; BFG, 2015). The current knowledge on ex situ conservation methods for bromeliad species in Brazil is limited, underscoring the necessity for the implementation of robust conservation programs for the preservation of indigenous flora (Rodrigues et al., 2014).
Various strategies have been employed in the conservation efforts of Bromeliads to enhance comprehension and support future research. In V. reitzii, biotechnological methods have been utilized as conservation tools, notably through in vitro cultivation involving nodular cultures (NCs) production. These NCs exhibit a morphogenic response pattern with significant regenerative potential, capable of yielding over 5300 micro sprouts g-1 within a 10-week cultivation period, originating either from leaf bases (Dal Vesco & Guerra 2010, Guerra & Dal Vesco 2010, Dal Vesco et al. 2014a) or seeds (Dal Vesco et al. 2014b). Furthermore, studies have delved into morphological and histochemical characterizations concerning the induction and source of nodular cultures (Corredor-Prado et al. 2015), proteomic analyses identifying differentially expressed proteins crucial in the induction and regeneration of NCs (Corredor-Prado et al. 2016, 2019), and the dynamics of protein, carbohydrate, and global DNA methylation level alterations during NC induction (Corredor-Prado et al. 2020).
An effective alternative to traditional preservation methods is the establishment of a cryopreservation protocol, which enables the safe and efficient conservation of materials, making it suitable for long-term storage systems. These protocols encompass a variety of materials suitable for diverse plant species, including seeds, zygotic embryos, apical buds, meristems, and others (Engelmann, 2011). Direct cryopreservation emerges as a straightforward methodology involving the direct immersion of fresh or dehydrated plant material in liquid nitrogen (LN). Subsequently, the material is typically removed and reheated in water at 40°C, leading to the regeneration of the material (Popova et al., 2016).
Seed conservation represents a highly efficient and cost-effective method for preserving germplasm (Kaviani, 2011). This approach has been successfully applied in the study of bromeliads. Research has shown that seeds from six species of the Encholirium genus and two species of Dyckia were cryopreserved without the use of cryoprotectants, maintaining their germination percentage post-cryopreservation (Tarré et al., 2007). Specifically, for Encholirium spectabile Mart. ex Schult. & Schult.f. seeds, it was demonstrated that cryoprotectants are unnecessary for successful cryopreservation (Ferrari et al., 2016). Similarly, seeds of Dyckia brevifolia Baker and Dyckia delicata Larocca & Sobral exhibited germination rates of 92% and 79%, respectively, after cryopreservation without cryoprotectants (de Paula et al., 2020).
In Bromeliaceae, certain species have demonstrated a notable resilience to drying and freezing, particularly within the genera Encholirium Mart. ex Schult. & Schult. f. and Dyckia Schult. & Schult. f. (Tarré et al. 2007), as observed in Pitcairnia albiflos Herbert (Pereira et al. 2010) and in ten endemic and threatened Brazilian species (Rodrigues et al. 2014). This resilience can be attributed to the presence and distribution of reserves, including carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, which serve as essential components of cells and membranes, offering protection throughout the phases of seed maturation and dehydration (Mollo et al. 2011, Carvalho et al. 2019).
Mollo et al. (2011) observed significant alterations in carbohydrate composition in Alcantarea imperialis (Carrière) Harms (Bromeliaceae) as a response to cold adaptation. The researchers noted a shift in sucrose levels, which were replaced by trehalose, raffinose, and stachyose in plants subjected to cold conditions. Additionally, changes in starch concentrations were observed in the presence of cold, potentially indicating a reduction in starch levels and an increase in carbohydrates linked to cold tolerance and protection mechanisms in the plant.
Moreover, intracellular ice crystal formation represents the most detrimental occurrence in the cryopreservation process, with its effects being irreversible. This phenomenon can manifest during both freezing and thawing stages, potentially resulting in cell wall and epidermal ruptures, protoplast leakage, abnormal nuclei in surviving explants, or even explant demise (Kaviani, 2011). Anatomical investigations, exemplified by the work of Wesley-Smith et al. (2014, 2015), underscore the significance of comprehending the interplay between water content and ice structure in studies aimed at optimizing cryogenic procedures and enhancing cell viability. Notably, the size of ice crystals and resultant cell damage can exert delayed impacts on cell survival.
In this context, the seeds of V. reitzii present themselves as a promising candidate for germplasm conservation due to their significant genetic diversity and the existence of established protocols for their mass propagation. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess the viability, cellular integrity, and polysaccharide content in both cryopreserved and non-cryopreserved V. reitzii seeds through anatomical, biochemical, and ultrastructural analyses.
Physiologically mature capsules of V. reitzii were collected from a natural population in the municipality of Curitibanos, Santa Catarina State, Brazil (27º17'02.7"S, 50º32'05.5" W, 900 m altitude). The collection occurred at three distinct times, determined by days after anthesis (DAA), based on the maturation curve between physiological maturation and dispersion: 1) at 120 DAA, marking the point when seeds achieved physiological maturity and the onset of reduced indoor water content; 2) at 135 DAA, representing the intermediate stage of natural dehydration; and 3) at 150 DAA, indicating the initiation of carpel opening for seed release and dispersion. These experiments were conducted at the Laboratory of Developmental Physiology and Plant Genetics (LFDGV) within the Center of Agricultural Sciences at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (CCA/UFSC) in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina State, Brazil.
The moisture content of the seeds was determined by analyzing a sample pool of 1000 seeds collected at various fruit collection times. The oven method, as described by Brazil (2009), involved drying the seeds at 105 ± 3 ºC for 24 ± 1 hours with four replicates of 200 seeds each. Moisture content, reported on a wet basis, was calculated using the formula: <>. Here, Iw represents the initial weight of the sample in grams, Fw is the final sample weight in grams, and X% denotes the water content as a percentage of the wet basis.
The conservation of seeds was conducted using a 2x3 factorial experimental design, incorporating two conservation methods: 1) Cryopreservation (+LN; at -196 °C) and 2) control, non-cryopreserved (-LN) stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C, in conjunction with three collection times (120; 135 and 150 DAA). Each experimental unit comprised a cryotube containing 30 seeds and four replicates organized in random blocks. Following 24 hours of storage (-196 °C and Control), the seeds underwent immersion in a water bath for two minutes at 42 °C. Subsequently, the seeds were disinfected using the method outlined by Guerra & Dal Vesco (2010).
The germination test was conducted in vitro, with seeds placed in Petri dishes (60 x 15 mm) on sterilized filter paper soaked with 2.0 mL of liquid culture medium MS (Murashige & Skoog, 1962), supplemented with Morel vitamins (Morel & Wetmore, 1951) and 30 g L-1 of sucrose. The pH was adjusted to 5.8 before sterilization in an autoclave for 20 minutes at 121 °C and 1.3 atm. Cultivations were maintained in a BOD chamber at 25 ºC ± 2 ºC under a 16-hour photoperiod of light with a luminous intensity of 55 ± μmol m-2 s-1.
Germination percentage data (%) and germination speed index (GSI) were collected daily up to the 15th day of cultivation. Seeds were deemed germinated when they exhibited embryo swelling, seminal envelope rupture, and a light green color indicating active metabolism. The GSI was determined following Maguire's (1962) formula: GSI= ∑ (Gi/ni), where Gi represents the number of germinated seeds and ni denotes the counting day.
The determination of total soluble carbohydrate levels (mg g-1) was conducted on seed samples (200 mg) from each treatment as previously outlined, utilizing the phenol-sulfuric method (Dubois et al., 1956). The samples, in triplicate, were first macerated with liquid nitrogen and then transferred to 15 mL test tubes, with the addition of 0.4 mL of ethanol (80% at -22 °C), followed by incubation in a water bath at 70 °C for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the extracts underwent centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and upon completion, the supernatants were collected. This process was repeated thrice, followed by filtration with glass wool and adjustment of the volume to 2 mL with ethanol (80% at -22 °C). Next, 50 μL of the extract was combined with 450 μL of distilled water, 0.5 mL of phenol (5%), and 2.5 mL of sulfuric acid (96%). The total carbohydrate content was then estimated using a standard curve based on Glucose as the standard carbohydrate, with absorbance readings taken at 490 nm on a spectrophotometer (Pro-Analysis V-1600).
Representative samples of the seeds were fixed in a 2.5% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.2 for 72 hours at 4 °C to prepare them for anatomical analysis. Following fixation, the seeds underwent dehydration in an increasing ethyl series (0-100 °Gl). Subsequently, the samples were pre-infiltrated in a solution of 100% ethanol and historesin glycol methacrylate (GMA) in a 1:1 ratio for 6 hours. They were then infiltrated in Historesin (Leica Historesin, Heidelberg, Germany) and placed in histo-molds, which were then placed in an oven at 35 °C for 24 hours to complete the preparation process.
Sections of 5 μm thickness were acquired using a hand-rotating microtome (Leica RM 2135) equipped with tungsten razors. These sections were subsequently mounted on slides and stained with Toluidine Blue (TBO) to facilitate the identification of acid polysaccharides, while Lugol staining was employed for the detection of starch. The stained sections were then examined using an optical microscope (Olympus BX40) and images were captured using an image capture system (Olympus Q-Color- 3C América Ind.).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was conducted on seeds from each treatment, which were initially fixed in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution in a 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 7.2 and 0.2 M sucrose at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, the seeds were immersed in a solution of 0.3 M sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 7.2, 0.6 M sucrose, and H2O, with five washes that gradually reduced the sucrose concentration by 25% in each step. Following this, the seeds were treated with osmium tetroxide (2%) and 0.2 M sodium cacodylate at pH 7.2 (1:1, v/v) for 4 hours at room temperature. Dehydration was carried out using an increasing series of acetone (30-100 °GL), followed by pre-infiltration in a series of acetone and Spurr resin solutions (3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3), and finally infiltrated in Spurr resin. Sections of 60-90 nm were obtained using a Power Tome XL ultramicrotome with a diamond razor and contrasted with uranyl acetate (1%) and lead citrate (1%). The images were captured using a Jeol JEM1011 Transmission Electron Microscope in Tokyo, Japan, at CEML-UFSC, with relevant events documented in the micrographs.
The germination percentage data (%) and levels of total soluble carbohydrates (mg g-1MF) were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a test for comparison of means (Tukey 5%), utilizing the statistical software R (R Development Core Team, 2010).
The various fruit collection periods, measured in days after floral anthesis (DAA), exhibited statistically significant differences in water levels (see Table 1). The seeds collected at 120 DAA displayed the highest average percentage of water content (17.6%), which was significantly different (p < 0.05) from the other collection periods. In contrast, seeds collected at 135 and 150 DAA did not demonstrate any significant variations in moisture content.
The average percentage of seed germination showed no statistically significant difference between conservation methods, with cryopreserved seeds at 78.9% and non-cryopreserved at 78.3% (Table 1). However, significant variations in germination percentages were noted across different Days After Anthesis (DAA). The highest and most significant (p < 0.01) average germination percentage of 89.6% was observed in seeds collected at 150 DAA (Table 1).
Regarding the germination speed index (GSI), there were no significant differences observed between cryopreserved (+LN) and non-cryopreserved (-LN) seeds. Germination initiation for seeds subjected to the conservation methods commenced on the 7th day of cultivation, with the peak germination rate occurring on the 15th day. Notably, seeds harvested at 150 DAA exhibited an average GSI of 17.0, which was statistically higher and more significant (p<0.05) compared to the GSI values of seeds collected at 120 and 135 DAA (refer to table 2).
The mean content of total soluble carbohydrates in V. reitzii seeds did not exhibit a significant variance across the examined factors, including collection period and conservation methodology (refer to Table 3).
An anatomical analysis using light microscopy of seeds collected on various days (DAA) and subjected to cryopreservation and non-cryopreservation did not show any mechanical damage, such as cell wall rupture or membrane system damage. Nonetheless, variations were noted in the histochemical reactions of chemical compounds within the seed coat, endosperm, aleurone layer, and embryo regions (see figure 1).
In the micrographs of V. reitzii seeds, particular attention is drawn to seeds containing the embryo and plumose appendages during conservation (Figure 1a). Within the embryo region, a notable reaction of acid compounds to TBO was evident, as evidenced by the procambium. This procambium, composed of the nuclei of embryonic cells, exhibited a distinct dark purple hue (Figure 1b, indicated by the arrow).
The study also noted the presence of a double seed coat, which exhibited a positive response to treatment with TBO. The outer seed coat, known as the testa, displayed a dark green hue, suggesting the presence of tannic compounds (see figure 1b). In contrast, the inner seed coat, referred to as the tegmen, exhibited a greenish color indicative of phenolic composition, while the plumose appendages displayed a purple coloration, suggesting a high pectin content (see figure 1b).
The aleurone layer, which envelops both the endosperm and the embryo, consists of a single layer of cells characterized by thick walls containing acid polysaccharides in both the cytoplasm and cell wall (refer to figure 1c, indicated by the arrow). Notably, the cytoplasm of the aleurone layer lacks starch grains.
Neutral polysaccharides were identified in the endosperm region, serving as components of the cell wall and indicating the presence of cellulose. Upon staining with Lugol, neutral polysaccharide grains were visible, highlighting a significant concentration of starch grains dispersed within amyloplasts (refer to figure 1d, indicated by the arrow). Examination of seeds at 120 DAA, both non-cryopreserved (figure 1c) and cryopreserved (figure 1f); at 135 DAA, non-cryopreserved (figure 1d) and cryopreserved (figure 1g); and at 150 DAA, non-cryopreserved (figure 1e) and cryopreserved (figure 1h), revealed that all maintained structural integrity following both preservation methods.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the ultrastructure of the seeds, showing the presence of membranes, organelles, and nucleus in their natural state within the embryo cells of non-cryopreserved seeds (-LN) (Figure 2a). Furthermore, detailed observations highlighted cells containing abundant reserve structures in the form of lipid bodies (Figure 2b) and protein bodies (Figure 2c). Conversely, analysis of embryonic cells from cryopreserved seeds (+LN) demonstrated intact cell integrity, indicating the absence of damage, lysis, or injury to membranes and cell walls (Figure 2d). Detailed examination further revealed the preservation of membrane structures of the nucleus and cell wall (Figure 2e), along with the protein and lipid reserve structures (Figure 2f). These TEM findings, in conjunction with light microscopy results, provide conclusive evidence that the seeds maintained their structural integrity following cryopreservation.
The time intervals established in seed collections (DAA), based on the maturation and viability curve, facilitated the analyses conducted in this study and supported their application in protocols for multiplication and nodular culture generation (Guerra & Dal Vesco 2010, Dal Vesco et al. 2014a). The water content in V. reitzii seeds, evaluated in this study, indicated a natural desiccation process linked to their physiological maturity level. This observation suggests that seeds of this species exhibit orthodox behavior, with moisture decreasing as they mature on the mother plant, leading to natural desiccation and conferring tolerance to artificial desiccation (Dousseau et al. 2011). While water content can vary in classifying orthodox seeds, Engelmann & Dussert (2000) suggest a moisture content range of 10 to 20%. Walters (2015) specifies that water content should be below 0.1 g H2O g-1 for conservation, necessitating artificial desiccation. Therefore, the assertion that V. reitzii seeds fall within the orthodox category concerning moisture percentage, as outlined by these authors, is supported.
In this context, the importance of monitoring the water content present in plant material utilized in cryopreservation protocols is underscored. This factor can play a crucial role in determining strategies to prevent potential damage caused by the crystallization of intracellular water (Vendrame et al., 2014). This aspect, notably absent in the current study, was characterized by ultrastructural analyses showing no lysis or damage to membranes and cell walls. As noted by González-Arnao & Engelmann (2013), a low water content in plant material can lead to a transition of the water phase during immersion in liquid nitrogen, known as the "vitrification" phase. This phase facilitates the removal of ice structures by preventing the bonding of water molecules, thereby preserving the physical properties of an amorphous solid (Kulus & Zalewska, 2014).
The significance of water content has been highlighted in numerous studies involving various plant materials, including the seeds of Punica granatum L. (Punicaceae) (Silva et al., 2015), Encholirium spectabile Martius ex Schultes f. (Bromeliaceae) (Ferrari et al., 2016), Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl.) Miers (Salomão et al., 2020), as well as seeds, pollen, protocorms, structures resembling protocorms, apexes extracted from in vitro plants, and meristematic tissues of orchids (Popova et al., 2016).
Cryopreservation offers several advantages, particularly in terms of potential storage duration and cost-effectiveness. Direct immersion cryopreservation stands out as the most economical option within this category, as it eliminates the need for cryoprotectants or excessive reagents. For long-term storage of plant material, cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen at -196°C remains the sole viable method currently available (Engelmann, 2011). Furthermore, when contrasted with conventional conservation techniques, cryopreservation demonstrates significant benefits, as highlighted in studies by Vendrame et al. (2014).
In the current investigation, it was noted that the expectation of seed collection at 120 DAA led to a diminished average germination percentage of 70%, in contrast to seeds gathered during the desiccation period at 150 DAA, which exhibited a higher germination rate of 89.6% (see table 1). Additionally, it was observed that the cryogenic process did not impact the germination potential of the seeds, with moisture content emerging as a critical factor influencing survival and germination. The cryopreservation of Ipê-Roxo (Tabebuia impetiginosa (Mart. ex DC.) Standl.) seeds with moisture levels of 12.5%, 8.4%, and 4.2% maintained both vigor and germination capacity. However, a decline in germination was noted at a moisture content of 18.3% (Martins et al., 2009).
Moreover, various studies have reported an enhancement in the germination percentage of seeds following cryopreservation, with the cooling process at ultra-low temperatures potentially breaking seed dormancy. For instance, Rocha et al. (2009) observed an increase in both seed germination percentage and seedling vigor in Gossypium hirsutum L. seeds after undergoing cryopreservation. Similarly, Tarré et al. (2007) noted a higher germination percentage in E. subsecundum (Baker) Mez seeds with a moisture content of 12.7% following cryopreservation.
These results suggest that the timing of fruit collection and seed extraction in V. reitzii plays a crucial role. The highest rates of germination and GSI appear to be associated with lower water content, increased reserve accumulation, and embryo maturity. Similar patterns were observed in the germination of Moringa oleifera Lam. seeds (Agustini et al. 2015), aligning with findings by Guimarães & Barbosa (2007) who noted a correlation between GSI increase in Machaerium brasiliensi Vogel seeds and fruit maturation. Consequently, natural desiccation appears to significantly impact seed quality and vigor, a critical consideration for conservation initiatives like cryopreservation.
Carbohydrates play a crucial role in a seed's ability to endure desiccation and storage at low temperatures, alongside other structural and biochemical attributes. In the study by Mollo et al. (2011), they found that the carbohydrates found in Alcantarea imperialis (Carrière) Harms (Bromeliaceae) seeds initiate adaptive responses to cold temperatures when subjected to varying conditions in growth chambers. Specifically, sucrose levels in plants under cold stress were observed to be replaced by trehalose, raffinose, and stachyose. Additionally, starch concentrations were noted to fluctuate in response to cold exposure, potentially indicating a shift towards carbohydrates linked to the plant's cold tolerance and protection mechanisms. Consequently, it can be deduced that an extended period of fruit attachment to the parent plant post-anthesis leads to increased carbohydrate accumulation. This is supported by the study's findings, which suggest that a higher number of days after anthesis for fruit collection correlates with greater seed water loss.
In the current study, it was noted that cryopreserved seeds, in comparison to non-cryopreserved seeds, exhibited no discernible structural or biochemical variances, indicating that cryopreservation did not impact the seeds. This finding aligns with the notion that non-reducing sugars, such as sucrose and certain oligosaccharides, play a crucial role in shielding membranes from crystal formation during freezing, along with the accumulation of lipid bodies and starch grains (Zaritzky, 2015). Additionally, protein bodies were identified in embryonic corn cells (Wen, 2009), whereas in Livistona chinensis (Jacq.) R.Br. ex Mart. embryonic cells, the absence of such accumulations was noted, potentially due to their classification as recalcitrant seeds (Wen, 2010). Consequently, the investigation revealed that V. reitzii seeds possess reserve organelles like lipid bodies, protein bodies, and orthamyloplasts, which may confer resilience to desiccation and cooling, thereby reinforcing the orthodox nature of these seeds.
Cryopreservation stands out as the sole technique ensuring the conservation of genetic material, potentially indefinitely, in a secure and cost-effective manner (Engelmann, 2011). By storing specimens in liquid nitrogen at -196 °C, all metabolic processes and cell divisions are halted, effectively preventing degradation and contamination of the preserved material (Cruz-Cruz et al., 2013). The direct immersion in liquid nitrogen offers the added benefit of obviating the need for cryoprotectants in materials tolerant to cooling and possessing low moisture content, as evidenced in various instances such as Dyckia brevifolia Beker and Dyckia delicata Larocca & Sobral seeds (De Paula et al., 2020), mature seeds of Cattleya guttata Lindl (Vettorazzi et al., 2019), and Passiflora edulis Sims seeds (Generoso et al., 2019). While the current study did not detect any disparity between storage treatments, it is postulated that cryopreservation offers superior long-term benefits compared to refrigeration, where material degradation and contamination may occur in the medium term.
In conclusion, immersing the seeds in liquid nitrogen for 24 hours effectively halts metabolism, indicating potential tolerance and long-term storage viability. Cryopreservation of V. reitzii seeds through direct immersion in liquid nitrogen proves to be an efficient method for ex situ conservation. Emphasizing the significance of seed maturity and water content as crucial factors for successful conservation, it is noted that V. reitzii seeds undergo a natural desiccation process in the mother plant, showcasing their ability to withstand desiccation and storage, essential characteristics for classification as orthodox seeds.
