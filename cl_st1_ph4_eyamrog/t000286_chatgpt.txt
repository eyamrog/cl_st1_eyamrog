This research investigates the impact of specific macroeconomic variables on investment inflows in Turkey. According to macroeconomic theory, foreign direct investment inflows are significantly influenced by changes in the macroeconomic environment. This environment encompasses factors such as government deficit, exchange rates, inflation rates, and interest rates, all of which play a crucial role in determining the level of investment inflows in a country.
This study specifically examines the relationship between Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows and various economic indicators in Turkey, such as the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) and Gross Domestic Product per capita of Purchasing Power Parity (GDP PPP). The inclusion of the GDP PPP variable is crucial as it has been found to have a substantial causal impact on REER. Additionally, the study considers the influence of exchange rate volatility of the U.S. Dollar on the Turkish stock market.
In Turkey, the government has implemented various macroeconomic policies and reforms in an attempt to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the country. However, these efforts have proven to be ineffective, as evidenced by the consistently low and unstable levels of FDI. This concerning trend prompted the current study, which aimed to explore the impact of macroeconomic policy variables on FDI inflow in Turkey. Data for the research were sourced from the Central Bank of Turkey statistical bulletin spanning the years 1994 to 2018. The variables under scrutiny included exchange rates, inflation rates, interest rates, and government deficit. The results indicated that all the explanatory variables collectively influence FDI inflow. Specifically, government deficit and exchange rates were found to have a significant positive impact on FDI in Turkey. Consequently, it is recommended that the government formulate robust policies that prioritize these macroeconomic policy variables to enhance the attractiveness of FDI inflow in Turkey. These variables have been identified as crucial tools for stimulating FDI inflow into the country, underscoring the importance of creating a conducive and supportive environment for FDI to flourish in Turkey.
There is a wealth of literature discussing the effects of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows on the real effective exchange rate in Turkey. To facilitate a comprehensive analysis, these contributions can be categorized into four main groups: the relationship between FDI inflows and exchange rates, the influence of financial stress, various approaches to financial crises (such as macroprudential policy and purchasing power parity), and the effects of tourism on the actual Turkish GDP.
In the literature concerning Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows and exchange rates, Cushman (1985) examined the correlation between FDI inflows, risk rates, and exchange rate regimes. To mitigate the impact of inflationary tendencies in his estimations, Cushman opted for the real exchange rate over the nominal exchange rate. Analysis of U.S. annual data revealed a noteworthy rise in risk levels with a consistent decrease in FDI inflows. This discovery holds true and carries significance in the context of Turkey as well. The substantial drop in FDI inflows during 2009 amplified the risk factor associated with the real exchange rate in Turkey.
This concept entails the advantageous delay of consumption to a later time, leading to an anticipation of increased consumption. This anticipation is achieved when the resources invested generate returns in line with the capital's opportunity cost. Additionally, it may involve the creation of capital goods, which are not immediately consumed but rather utilized for future production purposes.
Investment inflows typically manifest in two primary forms: capital (real) and financial investments. Capital investment inflows revolve around tangible assets that materialize into projects or collections of assets, including single or fixed assets like machinery and buildings. Essentially, this category encompasses total expenditures on new plant and equipment, often undertaken to lower costs and manufacture goods for future gains.
On the other hand, financial investment pertains to investments in securities like shares, bonds, and financial instruments known as "IOUs," which are essentially documents representing claims that economic agents hold on others. Investment inflow plays a crucial role in the operation of an economy, regardless of its development status. The economic growth of the majority of economies is fueled by the influx of investments into the economy.
However, despite this positive trajectory, Turkey has faced a series of regional and international challenges since 2008. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis stands out as a significant event, widely regarded by economists as the most severe financial downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis had a direct impact on global trade and financial movements, affecting countries worldwide. While the crisis did not originate in developing nations, its repercussions were felt more acutely by them, including Turkey, leading to trade and payment balance deficits, currency devaluations, rising inflation rates, and increased public budget deficits. The Turkish economy bore the brunt of the crisis, evident in the sharp decline in exports and a sudden halt in financial inflows, as highlighted by Cömert and Çolak (2014).
Investment inflows across different sectors of the economy play a crucial role in stimulating aggregate employment, output, demand, and income, consequently boosting government revenue for the provision of essential industrial and agricultural inputs essential for the growth and development of any economy. This dynamic process underscores the significance of investment inflows in enhancing the national income multiplier effect, leading to increased savings for investment, consumption, and overall aggregate demand levels. Ultimately, this positive impact translates into an improved standard of living for the population.
Undoubtedly, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) stands out as a crucial tool capable of bolstering economic development initiatives. Consequently, nations strive to cultivate an investment-friendly atmosphere to stimulate inflows. Turkey, classified as a developing nation, has been crafting policies since 2006 to allure high-quality investments, thereby enhancing economic efficiency. Furthermore, it is a well-established fact that developing countries frequently encounter deficits in capital inflows.
Fundraising stands as a crucial element for policymakers aiming to uphold their standing in the global economic arena, with Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) serving as a key avenue to draw financial resources to a specific region. Notwithstanding the obstacles outlined earlier, a 2016 financial stability report from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) highlighted Turkey's substantial macroeconomic adaptation towards consistent economic expansion following the events of July 2016. Building upon this assertion, the present study delves into the repercussions of FDI inflows on Turkey's real effective exchange rate.
Therefore, for a developing country like Turkey to achieve economic growth, it is imperative to enhance the influx of investments. This would not only contribute to economic growth but also address various economic objectives. It is crucial to prioritize factors that influence investment inflows both domestically and internationally in order to stimulate higher economic growth.
Several key factors contribute to a stable economy, including a controlled government deficit, price stability with a controlled inflation rate, stable exchange rates, and interest rates.
Over the past decade, Turkey has faced various macroeconomic shocks that have adversely impacted its currency, the Turkish Lira, leading to inflationary trends. Mitigating these shocks is crucial for Turkey to shield itself from further economic instability. Consequently, the country has struggled to attract the anticipated Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows. Following the failed military coup and terrorist attacks in July 2016, credit rating agencies such as S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch have assigned Turkey a low risk score, further complicating its economic outlook.
The instruments encompass public sources of funds, internal and external borrowing. With these tools in mind, it can be asserted that managing the government deficit will enhance the economy's revenue, particularly by boosting national income and subsequently attracting investment inflows into the country.
Investors strive to enhance their long-term purchasing power, a goal that is jeopardized by inflation as investment returns need to outpace the inflation rate to effectively boost real purchasing power. Furthermore, escalating inflation diminishes the value of the principal invested in fixed income securities.
In this context, Erdem and Yamak (2016) performed an economic analysis to establish an Optimal Uncertainty Index for Turkey on a macroeconomic scale. The research utilized data spanning from 2002 to 2014, focusing on quarterly data. The investigation employed various statistical methods including seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), ordinary least squares (OLS), and the generalized method of moments (GMM) to conduct the analysis.
The findings reveal a negative correlation between the general economic situation index and the optimal macroeconomics uncertainty index. In a related discussion, Kalyoncu (2009) delved into the sensitivity of purchasing power parity, assessing its validity through unit root tests on data from Turkey and its trade partners, including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Kalyoncu's findings highlighted a significant correlation between PPP validity and trade levels across the sample countries. Turning to the literature on the impact of foreign exchange and tourism on Turkey's GDP, Arslantürk and Atan (2012) examined this relationship using data spanning from 1987 to 2009. Employing co-integration and Granger causality models, they explored the link between these variables. Their results demonstrated a positive association between tourism income and GDP growth, indicating that as tourism income increased, so did economic growth.
The Granger causality test results indicated that FDI inflows and GDP impacted the Turkish economy differently, with both variables experiencing a decline during the period under study. However, it was found that tourism income emerged as a significant revenue source for Turkey. In a similar vein, Dinçer (2015) utilized reflections on monetary policies and REER during the 2000s to delve into the macroeconomic dynamics of the Turkish economy. Dinçer's analysis led to the conclusion that the volatility of the Turkish currency had notably decreased following regulatory reforms in the financial sector in recent years. Furthermore, Dinçer highlighted the pivotal role played by the tourism sector in contributing to the national economy, emphasizing its ability to attract foreign currency as one of Turkey's key sectors with exposure to international markets.
The high rates of inflation fluctuations are currently posing a significant challenge to Turkey's economy and impacting investment inflows. This issue arises from the fact that unstable inflation can disrupt the buying and selling dynamics within an economy. Consequently, investors are hesitant to allocate their capital to a country where inflation rates are not carefully monitored and stabilized, as they risk potential financial losses.
Some companies in the country have failed to offer favorable interest rates to international bodies, deterring potential investors from investing in Turkey. This reluctance stems from the understanding that investors seek to maximize profits and avoid losing their cost of capital in an economy. Consequently, the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of specific macroeconomic variables on investment inflows in Turkey.
This study is grounded in macroeconomic variables and economic theory, which establish a connection between investment inflows in Turkey.
In examining the factors influencing investment inflows, Lesotho (2006) utilized the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression method, incorporating variables such as the interest rate.
Findings from the study indicate that interest rates have a positive and significant impact on investment inflows.
The econometric analysis revealed that the growth of real income, as measured by increases in government deficit and exchange rates, has a positive impact on investment inflow. Conversely, escalating inflation and high interest rates act as deterrents to investment inflow in Turkey.
Turkey's remarkable economic growth and the successful implementation of structural reforms in the last decade have captured the attention of numerous international investors. As per the EY Attractiveness Survey Europe, Turkey emerged as the 7th most sought-after Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) destination in Europe in 2018. The nation hosted 261 projects, marking a 14 percent increase from the previous year, and held a 4 percent share in all FDI projects across Europe.
Prior to 2002, Turkey had received a total of USD 15 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI). However, from 2003 to 2018, the country experienced a significant increase in FDI inflows, attracting approximately USD 209 billion.
The negative relationships underscore the primary reasons why investors lack confidence in Turkey's investment climate, leading to their avoidance of investing in the country.
Over the last 16 years, the finance and manufacturing sectors in Turkey have consistently garnered the most Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), reflecting a trend towards increased diversification in sectors of interest. This shift aligns with Turkey's ambitious 2023 vision, aimed at elevating the country's standing within the global value chain.
Recent policies have predominantly focused on enhancing investment inflows, yet the precise determinants of such inflows in an economy remain elusive.
In this research study, the following tests will be carried out:
The unit root test is a statistical method used to determine whether a time series data set is stationary or non-stationary. Stationary data is characterized by a constant mean and variance over time, while non-stationary data exhibits trends or cycles. The presence of a unit root in a time series indicates non-stationarity, suggesting that the data has a stochastic trend. Common unit root tests include the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and the Phillips-Perron (PP) test, which both assess the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in the data. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it implies that the data is stationary. Unit root tests are essential in time series analysis as they help researchers determine the appropriate models and forecasting techniques to use for their data.
The co-integration test is a statistical method used to determine the long-term relationship between two or more time series variables. It is commonly employed in econometrics and financial research to assess whether there exists a stable equilibrium relationship among the variables under consideration. By examining the co-movements of the variables over time, researchers can ascertain whether they tend to move together in the long run, indicating a shared underlying trend or equilibrium. The test involves analyzing the residuals of a regression model to determine if they are stationary, which suggests a co-integrating relationship. If the variables are found to be co-integrated, it implies that they share a common stochastic trend and are not independent of each other in the long term. This information is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the variables and making informed decisions in various fields, such as economics, finance, and social sciences.
The Vector Error Correction Mechanism (VECM) is a widely used econometric model that is particularly suited for analyzing the long-run relationships among multiple time series variables. It is an extension of the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, incorporating both short-term dynamics and long-term equilibrium relationships. VECM is especially useful when dealing with non-stationary time series data, as it allows for the modeling of cointegration among variables. By estimating the cointegrating vectors, VECM enables the examination of how deviations from equilibrium are corrected in the long run. This makes it a valuable tool for studying the dynamics of economic variables and understanding the interdependencies among them. Additionally, VECM can be used for forecasting and policy analysis, making it a versatile and powerful tool in empirical economic research.
The Granger causality test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether one time series can predict another time series. It is based on the idea that if a variable X causes another variable Y, then changes in X should precede changes in Y. The test involves running regressions of Y on its own lagged values as well as on lagged values of X. If the lagged values of X are found to be statistically significant in predicting Y, then it is concluded that X Granger causes Y. This test is commonly used in econometrics and time series analysis to establish causal relationships between variables.
The model aims to examine the influence of specific macroeconomic variables on investment inflows in Turkey.
In accordance with Shields and Patricia (2013), the model utilized in this study is outlined as follows: <>
The data utilized in this study is displayed in the table provided below.
The data presented above underwent analysis through multiple regressions with the assistance of E-View due to the extensive volume of data and the necessity for accurate computation. The investigation into the correlation between poverty and inflation in Turkey prompted the researcher to subject the collected data to various tests including Unit Root test, Johansen Co-integration test, Vector Error Correction Model, and Granger Causality Test. The variables under consideration in this study are the Poverty rate as the dependent variable and Inflation as the independent variable. The empirical results derived from the analysis are presented below.
To ascertain the presence or absence of a unit root in the data utilized for the empirical analysis, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was utilized, with the results detailed in Table 2. The analysis revealed that GD, INF, and INT exhibited stationarity at the level, as indicated by their ADF values (4.180454, 3.173179, and 5.591438) surpassing the critical value of 0.05 (3.02997, 2.991878, and 3.004861). This suggests that these three variables were stationary at the level of order I (0). Conversely, FDI and EXC were stationary at the first level, with their ADF values (10.14302 and 3.996066) exceeding the critical value of 0.05 (2.998064 and 2.998064). Given the integration levels of the variables, both at the level and first level I, the subsequent step involved conducting a co-integration test and examining the short-run speed of adjustment from long-run disequilibrium.
Table 2 presents the empirical findings derived from the Johansen co-integration analysis. Johansen's test is designed to determine the presence of a long-term relationship among the series. It begins by assuming a null hypothesis of no co-integrating relationship and proceeds to test for the existence of at least one co-integrating equation. Given the model's five variables, subsequent tests are conducted to ascertain the number of co-integrating equations, ranging from zero to five.
The results presented in Table 3 demonstrate that the trace statistics exceed the critical value at a 5% significance level in the two equations, indicating a co-integrating relationship among the variables utilized to analyze the impact of selected macroeconomic variables on investment inflow in Turkey during the study period. Specifically, the values are 117.7144>69.81889 and 54.35455>47.85613. Furthermore, the p-values are below 0.05 (0.0000 and 0.0109), leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis of no co-integration among the variables. Consequently, the test results suggest the presence of a long-run relationship in the two co-integrating equations at a 5% significance level.
The normalized co-integrating coefficients for the two co-integrating equations representing the long-run relationship are as follows: FDI, the dependent variable, is influenced by coefficients of -0.001076 for GD, -0.240732 for INF, 0.213348 for INT, and -0.003069 for EXC. The negative signs associated with the adjusted coefficient estimates of GD, INF, and EXC suggest a negative long-run relationship between these variables and FDI. Conversely, the positive sign linked to the adjusted coefficient estimate of INT indicates a positive long-run relationship between INT and FDI.
Given the identification of a co-integrating vector among the variables through co-integration tests, a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is employed to assess the rate of adjustment from short-term dynamics to their long-term equilibrium state.
The VECM analysis revealed a consistent ECM (-1) with a negative value, indicating its ability to correct deviations from the long-run equilibrium relationship between POV and the explanatory variables. The coefficient of 1.99% suggests a rapid adjustment annually, implying that approximately 1.99% of the transition towards long-run equilibrium occurs within a year following short-run disequilibrium. Additionally, the R2 value of 0.35 indicates that the model explains around 35% of the total variations in FDI, as influenced by the independent variables (GD, INF, INT, and EXC) during the study period, leaving the remaining 65% of variations to be accounted for by variables not included in the model.
The decision rule is a critical component in statistical hypothesis testing, guiding researchers on whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on the calculated test statistic and predetermined significance level. It serves as a criterion for making decisions about the population parameter based on sample data, helping researchers draw conclusions about the research question at hand. The decision rule typically involves comparing the test statistic to a critical value or determining the p-value associated with the test statistic. If the test statistic falls within the critical region or the p-value is less than the significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Conversely, if the test statistic falls outside the critical region or the p-value is greater than the significance level, the null hypothesis is not rejected. The decision rule plays a crucial role in hypothesis testing, providing a systematic approach to interpreting the results of statistical analyses and drawing valid conclusions from research studies.
If the probability associated with the t-statistic is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis should be rejected.
If the probability associated with the t-statistic is greater than 0.05, the null hypothesis is accepted.
In this instance, the probability associated with the t-statistic is calculated to be 0.1646, a value exceeding the conventional significance level of 0.05. This suggests that the interest rate does not exert a significant impact on the inflow of investments in Turkey. Consequently, the research embraces the null hypothesis, dismissing the alternative hypothesis, and ultimately determines that the interest rate does not have a significant effect on the level of investment inflow in Turkey.
The findings indicate that GD does not Granger cause FDI, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as evidenced by the high probability value of 0.0934. Similarly, the results show that FDI does not Granger cause GD, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as indicated by the probability value of 0.3396 and further supported by the F-statistics value of 1.1474. Consequently, these results suggest a lack of causation from GD to FDI.
The findings indicate that INF does not Granger cause FDI, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as evidenced by the high probability value of 0.8324. Similarly, the results demonstrate that FDI does not Granger cause INF, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as indicated by the probability value of 0.7724 and further supported by the F-statistics value of 0.26197. Consequently, these results suggest a lack of causation from INF to FDI.
The findings indicate that INT does not Granger cause FDI, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as evidenced by the high probability value of 0.1538. Similarly, the results demonstrate that FDI does not Granger cause INT, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as indicated by the probability value of 0.8541, further supported by the F-statistics value of 0.15915. Consequently, these results suggest a lack of causation from INT to FDI.
The findings indicate that EXC does not Granger cause FDI, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as evidenced by the high probability value of 0.6838. Conversely, the results demonstrate that FDI Granger causes EXC, with the alternate hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, supported by a probability value of 0.0233 and further confirmed by an F-statistics value of 4.66525. This suggests a unidirectional causation from FDI to EXC.
The findings indicate that INF does not Granger cause GD, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as evidenced by the high probability value of 0.7060. Similarly, the results show that GD does not Granger cause INF, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, supported by the probability value of 0.7405 and further confirmed by the F-statistics value of 0.3051. This suggests a lack of causation from INF to GD. Additionally, the results demonstrate that INT does not Granger cause GD, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as indicated by the probability value of 0.5712.
The findings indicate that GD does not Granger-cause INT, as the null hypothesis is accepted at a 5% significance level, as evidenced by the probability value of 0.2098 and further supported by the F-statistics value of 1.70505. Consequently, there is no evidence of causation from INT to GD.
The findings indicate that EXC does not Granger cause GD, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as evidenced by the high probability value of 0.0124. Similarly, the results show that GD does not Granger cause EXC, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as indicated by the probability value of 0.0709, further supported by the F-statistics value of 5.66235. Consequently, these results suggest a unidirectional causation from EXC to GD.
The findings indicate that INT does not Granger-cause INF, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as evidenced by the high probability value of 0.8942. Similarly, the results show that INF does not Granger-cause INT, with the null hypothesis accepted at a 5% significance level, supported by a probability value of 0.1264 and further confirmed by an F-statistics value of 2.32514. Consequently, these results suggest a lack of causation from INT to INF.
The findings indicate that EXC does not Granger-cause INF, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as evidenced by the high probability value of 0.0635. Similarly, the results demonstrate that INF does not Granger-cause EXC, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as indicated by the probability value of 0.4724 and further supported by the F-statistics value of 0.781. Consequently, these results suggest a lack of causation from EXC to INF.
The results indicate that EXC does not Granger cause INT, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as evidenced by the high probability value of 0.9582. Additionally, the findings show that EXC does not Granger cause INT, with the null hypothesis being accepted at a 5% significance level, as indicated by the probability value of 0.2365, further supported by the F-statistics value of 1.5637. Consequently, these results suggest that there is no evidence of causation from EXC to INT.
The equation presented above represents the estimated regression equation utilized to examine the influence of specific macroeconomic variables (Gross Domestic Product, Inflation Rate, Interest Rate, and Exchange Rate) on Foreign Direct Investment inflows in Nigeria, as previously mentioned.
The equation indicates that the government deficit and exchange rate have a positive influence on foreign direct investment in Turkey, with coefficients of 0.000197 and 0.001518, respectively. This suggests that a one-unit change in government deficit and exchange rate will result in an increase of 0.000197 and 0.001518 in FDI in Turkey. Conversely, inflation and interest rates exhibit a negative impact on FDI. Specifically, a decrease in interest rates or inflation rates by 0.007553 or 0.022135 will lead to a corresponding decrease in FDI.
The findings suggest that the coefficients of government deficit, inflation, interest rate, and exchange rate are deemed insignificant. Specifically, their coefficients are statistically insignificant at levels of 58%, 91%, 16%, and 75%, respectively, as evidenced by their corresponding probability values of 0.5767, 0.9094, 0.1646, and 0.7513.
The F-statistic of 1.43, representing the collective significance of the explanatory variables, is deemed statistically insignificant at the 26 percent level, given the associated probability value of 0.262258. Additionally, the analysis reveals an R2 value of 0.349699, indicating the model's explanatory capability.
Approximately 34.97% of the systematic variation in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can be accounted for by the explanatory variables, with the remaining 65.03% being attributed to other variables not incorporated into the model. Consequently, the overall model exhibits a weak statistical significance when assessing the influence of selected macroeconomic variables on investment inflows in Turkey.
The implication of this finding suggests that a rise in the government deficit and exchange rate could result in increased foreign direct investment in Turkey.
The Durbin-Watson statistic of 2.578326 indicates the presence of negative serial autocorrelation in the data. The unit root test conducted on the three variables (GD, INF, and INT) in the model suggests that these variables were stationary at level I (0), as evidenced by the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) results (4.180454, 3.173179, and 5.591438) which exceeded the critical value of 0.05 (3.02997, 2.991878, and 3.004861). On the other hand, FDI and EXC were stationary at the first level, with their ADF values (10.14302 and 3.996066) surpassing the critical value of 0.05 (2.998064 and 2.998064).
The findings on causality indicate a lack of causation between the variables under consideration. However, a unidirectional causation is observed from Foreign Direct Investment to Exchange Rate, mirroring a similar one-way causation from Exchange Rate to Government Deficit.
This study demonstrates that the rising government deficit and exchange rate have had a positive impact on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) within the country. Additionally, the research indicates that government deficit and exchange rates play a significant role in influencing the inflow of foreign investments. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully manage government deficit and exchange rates. By doing so, a stable and conducive environment can be maintained, fostering economic growth and attracting foreign capital inflows to the country.
This study examines the relationship between Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and the economic conditions in Turkey from January 2010 to July 2016. This period holds significant importance in the country's history as Turkey faced substantial global, regional, and domestic challenges. The 2008 global financial crisis had a profound impact on economies worldwide, including that of Turkey, particularly affecting developing nations.
In conclusion, it is imperative to prioritize factors such as the ease and cost of doing business, the availability of infrastructural facilities, and other incentives that contribute to attracting investment flows in Turkey. This research suggests that the government should focus on reducing the level of budget deficit resulting from improper management and enhance financial discipline by promoting accountability and transparency in resource allocation. It is essential to establish a friendly and conducive environment for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to flourish in Turkey. This can be achieved by creating a stable environment that allows for consistent interest and inflation rates, ultimately attracting foreign investment inflows.
