Taxonomy, a cornerstone of the biological sciences, is crucial in the face of the current biodiversity crisis. However, the scientific publishing industry's heavy reliance on bibliometric indexes has led to distortions affecting institutions, organizations, and researchers, notably through the phenomenon known as Journal Impact Factor (JIF) mania. The inadequacies of widely used bibliometric indexes from major companies like Clarivate™ (InCites™) and RELX™ Elsevier B.V. (Scopus®) in assessing the relevance of taxonomic publications have hindered progress in this field. Recently, Clarivate removed the mega-journal Zootaxa, dedicated to taxonomy, from the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) due to an unusually high proportion of self-citations, along with 32 other journals, resulting in their exclusion from the JIF calculation for 2020. The scientific community swiftly reacted against this move, leading to Clarivate's decision to reinstate Zootaxa. This incident highlighted the misconceptions and misuses of bibliometric indexes. This study aims to examine the impact of bibliometric indexes on the field of taxonomy and the underlying reasons for Zootaxa's suppression. Specifically, we question whether the exclusion of a journal from the JIF truly affects taxonomic research output. Analyzing data from the JCR (Web of Science Core Collection™) for 2010–2018, focusing on the top ten zoological journals and 123 journals publishing taxonomic studies, we found that Zootaxa had higher levels of self-citations compared to similar journals. The commonly cited reasons for this, such as Zootaxa's focus on taxonomy and its mega-journal status, were deemed inadequate. Instead, we propose that the "Zootaxa phenomenon" is influenced by sociological biases, visibility, and harmful myths that falsely elevate Zootaxa as the sole journal for taxonomic studies with a desirable JIF. Threats to taxonomy as a discipline stem from various sources, with low bibliometric values being just one factor contributing to the so-called taxonomic impediment. We advocate for the rejection of bibliometric indexes, including the JIF, rather than selective use. The taxonomic community should prioritize actions that directly support and advance the field, rather than being overly fixated on journal metrics dictated by dominant publishing companies.
Every year, prominent companies in scientific data analytics such as the American-British Clarivate™ (InCites™) and the Dutch RELX™ Elsevier B.V. (Scopus®) release their metrics for scientific journals indexed in their extensive databases, including the Journal Impact Factor™ (JIF) and the CiteScore™. These metrics have become significant benchmarks adopted by numerous countries to gauge the quality of research produced in their academic institutions. Typically, research funding in these establishments is sourced from the taxes paid by the country's citizens, leading to a fervent pursuit of publishing in journals with higher rankings, a phenomenon often referred to as "JIF mania" (Ioannidis & Thombs, 2019). Consequently, a researcher's career progression, reputation, and ability to secure grants are heavily influenced by the impact factor of the journals they publish in. As a result, these metrics play a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of current scientific inquiry and determining the scope of research that can be pursued.
On the final day of June this year, a significant development amidst the ongoing concerns surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic captured the attention of taxonomists globally. The issue that garnered widespread media coverage pertained to the exclusion of the prominent mega-journal Zootaxa, which specializes in zoological taxonomy, from the Journal Citation Reports™ (JCR) Science Edition metrics by Clarivate. This exclusion was attributed to a notable prevalence of self-citations, a pattern shared with 32 other journals out of the 12,000 listed in the JCR database. Consequently, Zootaxa would not be assigned a Journal Impact Factor (JIF) for the year 2019. Despite this setback, the journal would retain its previous JIF values and continue to be indexed on the Clarivate Analytics platform, maintaining its presence within the scientific community.
With the release of JIF 2019 by JCR, which drew the attention of editors and authors eager to understand journal rankings, fervent discussions emerged following Zootaxa's suppression. This unprecedented reaction, marked by numerous letters of support and petitions from various societies and researchers, compelled Clarivate to reassess its decision. The suppression of Zootaxa presents a complex array of factors warranting closer scrutiny. Some of the supportive letters bordered on political manifestos, while others displayed naivety, alarmism, or inaccuracies in portraying the event as a new assault on taxonomy as a scientific discipline. One fervent argument claimed Zootaxa as the sole platform for taxonomic publications today, a statement clearly diverging from reality. In late July, Clarivate briefly announced on Twitter that Zootaxa and the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology would be reconsidered in the upcoming JCR update in September. Instances of suppression, not exclusive to Clarivate, often stem from allegations of artificially inflating impact factors, as evidenced in prior cases (e.g., Cortegiani et al., 2020). A notable incident nearly a decade ago involved the suppression of four Brazilian journals over accusations of a citation-stacking scheme, resembling a self-citation cartel among a cluster of journals (Van Norden, 2013). Historically, instances of suppression rarely garnered sympathy from the scientific community, except from those directly involved, suggesting tacit approval of the action as a form of "punishment" for the affected journals. Once excluded from the JIF, a journal loses access to the academic prestige associated with high-impact publications.
In a system rife with anachronisms, where traditional journals backed by museums or scientific societies are grappling to survive and the scientific publishing realm is dominated by major publishers like John Wiley & Sons, Elsevier, and Springer Nature, boasting profit margins akin to those of leading entities in pharmaceuticals, banking, and automotive sectors (Larivière et al. 2015), the uproar surrounding the discontinuation of Zootaxa appears intriguing. Intrigued by this scenario, we embarked on a quest to offer insights that illuminate the underlying facets of this matter. We posit that many arguments presented in the supportive correspondence stem from misconceptions about metrics or are influenced by personal agendas driven by the imperative to publish in high-impact journals. Furthermore, certain points may be misdirected. The realm of bibliometric data is fraught with myths and misconceptions (Glänzel 2008).
Our aim is to address several key questions in this study. Firstly, we aim to investigate whether the exclusion of a journal from the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) can have a significant impact on productivity within the taxonomic field. Secondly, we seek to explore the implications of Zootaxa's exclusion on the field of taxonomy as a whole. Additionally, we aim to define the concept of self-citation and determine the average JIF for taxonomic journals. Furthermore, we aim to analyze whether Zootaxa's success has inadvertently led to its current predicament. To comprehensively address these inquiries, it is imperative to elucidate fundamental concepts, delve deeper into the present state of taxonomic journals, scrutinize the metrics used to gauge the impact of scientific publications, and evaluate the influence of both individuals and large corporations in this domain.
We examined citation data, including Journal Impact Factor (JIF), most-cited journals, and self-citation metrics from the Journal Citation Reports (Web of Science Core Collection™) spanning the years 2010 to 2018 for the top ten zoological journals (TTJ, eight of which are included in JCR). This analysis also took into account the number of new available names based on the last five years of Index of Organism Names/Zoological RecordsTM – ZR. Additionally, we identified journals focused on or regularly publishing taxonomic papers within the Zoology and Entomology categories. Data from Zootaxa were obtained from JCR 2018 as the journal was temporarily removed from the current edition and is set to reappear in September. Journals falling under both Zoology and Entomology categories were categorized simply as Zoology. Out of 168 journals in Zoology and 101 in Entomology, 73 and 48 (including Zootaxa) were selected, totaling 123 journals for analysis. Descriptive statistics, including the arithmetic mean of bibliometric variables, their standard deviations, and the ratio between JIF excluding self-citations and JIF, were employed to investigate the impact of self-citations on JIF. This analysis was conducted on the top ten journals (TTJ) in ZR and those in the Zoology and Entomology categories. The percentage of self-citations and the ratio between JIF excluding self-citations and JIF per year for journals falling within quartiles 2 and 3 (Q2 and Q3) in their respective categories, along with TTJ, were examined using the non-parametric one-way analysis of variance Kruskal–Wallis H test (Dalgaard 2008) in R software (R Core Team 2018). Journals with similar scope and JIF to Zootaxa were considered, encompassing all journals publishing taxonomic papers with a JIF 2019 ranging from 0.25 to 2.315 in the Zoology and Entomology categories. While the inclusion criterion may seem arbitrary due to varying proportions of taxonomic papers among journals, for the purposes of this study, journals like Zootaxa and ZooKeys, known for their substantial amount of taxonomic papers, were considered similar in scope. Despite Zootaxa's unique focus on rapid publication of high-quality papers in systematic zoology, it now covers a wide range of zoological taxonomy/systematics topics, including biographies and theoretical perspectives, excluding ecological or experimental issues. The list of journals and selected metrics can be found in Table 1 and Supplementary File 1, following Web of Science's categorization rules, which may have excluded some taxonomic journals listed in other categories within the Science Edition database.
A mere 18.7% of the 123 taxonomic journals under scrutiny enforce mandatory APC-GOA models. DOA models are represented by 22.0% of the journals, while the majority (59.3%) operate on hybrid models that necessitate a paywall for content access, typically through reader payments or subscriptions (refer to Table 1). Some journals, hosted on distinct platforms managed by societies, impose page charges on authors, regardless of their affiliation with the society. These journals also employ a paywall to safeguard their content, resulting in charges for both authors and readers. Examples of such journals include the Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society and Malacologia.
The average levels of self-citations between 2010 and 2018 vary from 0.0% to 24.2% in Zoology, 0.0% to 34.9% in Entomology, and 4.6% to 34.9% in TTJ. Over the last five years (2014–2018), these rates stand at 0.0% to 27.3% in Zoology, 0.0% to 36.4% in Entomology, and 4.5% to 36.4% in TTJ. The higher self-citation limits in Entomology and TTJ are influenced by Systematic and Applied Acarology; excluding this journal, the maximum self-citation levels for Entomology are 21.4% (Coleopterists Bulletin) from 2010 to 2018 and 27.3% (Odonatologica) from 2014 to 2018, while for TTJ, they are 26.3% and 27.5% (both corresponding to Cretaceous Research). Compared to all other journals, except Systematic and Applied Acarology, Zootaxa exhibits higher mean self-citation levels in Zoology (Figure 1), Entomology (Figure 2), and TTJ categories (Figure 3), reaching 34.9% from 2010 to 2018 and 37.6% from 2014 to 2018 in Zootaxa. Self-citation rates in Zootaxa have shown a gradual increase from 27.99% in 2010 to 52.7% in 2018 (Figure 4), with percentages comparable only to Systematic and Applied Acarology for 2010–2018 (Figure 4). The non-parametric one-way analysis of variance Kruskal-Wallis for Q2 and Q3 journals, along with TTJ, is notably significant for both the JIF ratio without self-citation and JIF (JIF ratio: H = 326.8, d.f. = 67, P < 0.001), as well as for the level of self-citation (level of self-citation: H = 311.4, d.f. = 67, P < 0.001).
The impact of self-citations on the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) is largely negligible in enhancing this metric, as most journals within the Entomology, Zoology, and TTJ categories exhibit similar ratios between JIF values with and without self-citations for the period of 2010-2018 (see Figure 5). However, exceptions to this trend are observed in journals like Shilap-Revista de Lepidopterologia, a publication focused on butterflies and moths, Insects by the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) - a company with a controversial reputation (Retraction Watch, 2018) and deemed predatory (Brezgov, 2014) - and Zootaxa. While some journals display wide intervals in the impact of self-citation on JIF due to standard deviations, Zootaxa consistently maintains a more stable influence from self-citations. For example, in Zootaxa, the ratio ranges from 0.55 to 0.60, leading to a reduction of 39.6% to 45.6% in JIF when self-citations are excluded (refer to Figure 6 and Supplementary File 1).
Zootaxa, with approximately 15,000 citations, garnered 311% more citations than the second most cited journal, ZooKeys, between 2010 and 2018 (see Figure 7 in Supplementary File 1). The levels of self-citation do not appear to be correlated with the total number of citations. Figure 7 illustrates the distribution of citations among journals and highlights similar patterns in the evaluated metrics.
As researchers not primarily focused on bibliometrics, we acknowledge that bibliometric measures were initially designed with specific purposes beyond simply evaluating research or researchers. These measures were originally intended to serve as objective tools to aid librarians in journal collection development (Haustein & Larivière, 2015). Keith Collier, the Senior Vice President of Product at Science Group Clarivate, stated that the mission of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) is to offer a comprehensive, publisher-neutral, and multifaceted assessment of journal performance, reflecting the highest-quality scientific and scholarly literature worldwide (https://bit.ly/31gOMg3). The JIF relies on citation frequency to gauge a journal's value and the extent of its utilization, representing the average citations per published paper within a specific journal (Garfield, 1972).
The Journal Impact Factor (JIF) has long been a subject of debate regarding its ability to truly gauge journal quality, yet it, along with other bibliometric indexes, serves the purpose of identifying publication patterns and trends. Originating in the early 1970s (although Garfield claimed its design in 1955), the metric quickly gained popularity and became a key parameter for research quality assessment, a contentious topic indeed. Calculated simply as the ratio of citations in a year to papers published in the previous two years, the JIF essentially reflects the popularity and reach of a journal's content. However, the problematic shift occurred when entities, including governmental funding bodies, began equating journal impact with the evaluation of scientific output, leading to the flawed practice of assessing researchers and institutions based on these metrics. Consequently, the JIF has been widely criticized for its misuse and abuse in academic circles, with scholars pointing out the inherent flaws in applying such indexes to evaluate individual work and careers. This misuse has led to a situation where the JIF is acknowledged as one of the most misused bibliometric indexes in academic science, as highlighted by various researchers (Hecht et al. 1998, Haustein & Larivière 2015, Ioannidis & Thombs 2019).
The utilization of scientific bibliometric indexes like the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) has significantly increased over the past two decades, serving as a means to impartially assess the fiercely competitive landscape of academic professions. Nonetheless, numerous studies have highlighted detrimental drawbacks associated with the reliance on and interpretation of the JIF, impacting both individual researchers and institutions (Hecht et al., 1998; Alberts, 2013; Chapman et al., 2019). The relentless pursuit and pressure to publish in high-impact journals have led to what is termed as "JIF mania" (Ioannidis & Thombs, 2019).
While the use of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) for ranking individuals is discouraged (Alberts, 2013), its undeniable influence on academic careers is evident. The prevailing belief is that academic researchers can advance only by publishing in journals with high JIF values. However, the metric is fraught with well-documented limitations when assessing journals or individual papers, primarily due to its sensitivity to what constitutes a citable item (The PLoS Medicine Editors, 2006). Moreover, the JIF is criticized for its statistical misuse, including the reliance on mean and median calculations (Vanclay, 2012), and its susceptibility to significant influence from a single or a few highly cited papers (e.g., Dimitrov, 2010). The widespread adoption of JIF has led to distortions such as the proliferation of unjustified multi-authored papers and journal strategies aimed at artificially inflating JIF scores, resulting in what can be termed as "JIF mania." Bibliometric platforms, acting as arbiters, attempt to curb these distortions by excluding or penalizing journals engaging in such practices. Platforms like Clarivate/JCR, for instance, employ a complex set of 24 criteria in their evaluation process, which can lead to the suppression of journals that fail to meet these standards (Clarivate, 2020a). The lack of transparency in these processes raises concerns about the fairness and accuracy of journal suppressions, echoing the age-old question, "Who watches the watchmen?" as famously depicted in Alan Moore's graphic novel, Watchmen.
Undoubtedly, the exploration of biodiversity stands as a fundamental concern within the biological sciences and for humanity at large. In light of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, taxonomic research emerges as a critical priority (Wheeler et al., 2012). The concept of taxonomy in the biological sciences encompasses a spectrum of interpretations, ranging from the reductionist and purely descriptive perspective of alpha taxonomy (Mayr, 1969) - often dismissed as a minor, outdated, and intellectually lacking field - to a broader understanding of taxonomy as the largest domain within biological sciences (Wheeler, 2008), akin to the entirety of comparative biology. Embracing this expansive viewpoint, taxonomy extends from primary data collection during field expeditions to morphological, genomic, and ecosystem analyses, positioning it as a hypothesis-driven science of significance. However, routine taxonomic research typically involves minimal technological resources, focusing on the examination of natural history collections to document and provide fundamental data on biological entities. This work frequently entails the study of poorly understood taxa, unidentified sexes within species, developmental stages, and undescribed entities. Taxonomists often grapple with obscure subjects, seeking novelty and uniqueness, engaging with unpopular or overlooked themes. Consequently, there exist numerous meticulously crafted and visually captivating taxonomic monographs on animal groups that may receive limited citations, potentially due to their successful resolution of fundamental taxonomic queries within a specific taxon. A vivid illustration of this challenge was shared at the Brazilian Congress of Zoology in 2014, where an entomologist pondered the citation prospects for a paper offering significant contributions to the small order of insects, Zoraptera, comprising a mere few dozen extant species. The issue of low citation rates in taxonomy is a widely debated topic, often highlighting the inadequacy of Journal Impact Factors (JIF) for basic sciences (Krell, 2000; Rafael et al., 2009). This paradox arises from the inherent nature of taxonomy, which necessitates engagement with basic descriptive elements, the novel and unexpected, focusing on minute segments of the tree of life.
Taxonomy faces a crisis marked by dwindling positions in institutions and reduced funding resources, exacerbating the loss of workforce. Compounding these challenges are the biases and deficiencies in the quality assessment metrics, as highlighted by Ebach et al. (2011). To address low citation rates, suggestions have been made, such as the compulsory citation of original descriptions when referencing taxa, a practice loosely enforced by Zootaxa. However, this approach is flawed as original descriptions, particularly older ones, may not adequately characterize or identify species. A more effective strategy would involve clearly stating the adopted species concept and providing the relevant bibliographic sources, as proposed by Meier (2017). The interdisciplinary nature of biological sciences has further blurred the boundaries between traditional disciplines, including descriptive ones. While some argue that these factors contribute to Zootaxa's high self-citation rates, it is important to note that numerous journals now accept taxonomic studies, whether purely descriptive or incorporating broader analytical approaches. These alternative journals are increasingly appealing in the context of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) obsession.
As authors of papers focusing on various zoological taxa, editors of special issues, and reviewers of manuscripts submitted to Zootaxa over the past decade, we are well-positioned to provide an informed perspective on the journal and its significant impact within the taxonomic community. Zootaxa has emerged as a pivotal platform for the dissemination of new zoological nomenclature, solidifying its reputation as a primary vehicle for the introduction of novel taxonomic classifications.
Since its inception, Zootaxa has emerged as a prestigious platform for the promotion and discourse of various taxonomic science topics, solidifying its distinguished position among similar journals. Undoubtedly, the journal's establishment marked a significant milestone in the realm of zoological taxonomy. Commencing in 2001 with a hybrid publication model, where authors had the option to pay Article Processing Charges (APC) for Open Access (OA) publication, Zootaxa saw a substantial growth from 300 pages in its inaugural year to 32,330 pages in 2010 (Zhang 2011), culminating in an impressive 47,528 pages by the end of 2019, encompassing 2,400 papers across 176 volumes (data sourced from Zootaxa's website). During its initial decade, Zootaxa introduced approximately 20–25% of new nomina annually (Zhang 2014). Over the past five years, it has solidified its position as the primary journal and a leader in descriptive taxonomy, presenting 24,722 (26.57% of the total) newly established taxa (ION/Zoological RecordsTM 2020). Despite its relatively short existence, the journal has garnered significant recognition and visibility, with papers published within it having a higher likelihood of citation among taxonomists compared to many other journals in the field with lower visibility. Zootaxa has become the preferred choice for numerous young taxonomists for their initial publications, likely due to its relatively high Journal Impact Factor (JIF). Additionally, for zoologists not primarily focused on taxonomy but eventually venturing into taxonomic publications, Zootaxa often emerges as the primary or sole choice. The journal's influence has grown to the extent that a somewhat derogatory term, "Zootaxa author," has been coined to describe researchers who predominantly publish in or have a significant portion of their work featured in the journal, sometimes exceeding 80%. This raises questions about the reasons behind this phenomenon, its implications for taxonomy, and whether such a concentration of publications in one journal is beneficial for the field.
For nearly a decade, Zootaxa stood as the prominent journal in the field, focusing on taxonomic science, despite the presence of smaller journals that also featured a substantial number of taxonomic papers. Presently, Zootaxa faces competition from journals like the European Journal of Taxonomy (established in 2011) and ZooKeys (founded in 2008), which offer Gold Open Access (GOA) or Diamond Open Access (DOA) policies. However, ZooKeys mandates a minimum Article Processing Charge (APC) of €700 for open access, posing a significant barrier, particularly for researchers from developing countries not falling within the lowest income bracket and thus ineligible for fee waivers. The success of Zootaxa, an initiative by Magnolia Press Ltd., has spurred the creation of new journals like Phytotaxa, a plant sciences-focused counterpart. Information on Magnolia Press, headquartered in New Zealand, is not readily available, with limited details provided on their website (magnoliapress.com), including their registered business model (for-profit or not-for-profit).
The significance of Zootaxa cannot be understated, as it stands as a crucial platform for the dissemination of taxonomic studies. Despite its importance, it is essential to acknowledge that Zootaxa is not the sole journal dedicated to taxonomic science, as some supporting letters have suggested. The uproar caused by its suppression begs the question: why such a significant reaction? The answer lies in the fact that in countries with vast biodiversity like Brazil, where a substantial portion of fauna remains undocumented, academic and scientific evaluation systems heavily rely on bibliometric indexes (Curry 2018, Krüger 2020, Reategui et al. 2020). Consequently, these metrics hold considerable sway in decision-making processes, with Brazilian authors often selecting journals based on metrics like the Journal Impact Factor (JIF). Therefore, the discontinuation of Zootaxa was perceived as a major setback for taxonomists in such regions, particularly for those who predominantly publish in the journal. This reliance on Zootaxa is evident in the high rate of self-citations and its impact on the journal's JIF, despite Clarivate acknowledging that a significant portion of zoological papers are published by the journal (Figures 1–3, 5).
An important distinction should be made between two categories of self-citation: individual (author) and collective (journal) self-citation, both of which can potentially boost bibliometric indexes. There are numerous legitimate reasons for a researcher to cite their earlier works; in many cases, self-citations are unavoidable, depending on the circumstances or subject (Glänzel 2008). For instance, an author may have been the sole authority on a taxon for the past thirty years or may have a high production in a specialized field. In such cases, self-citation alone is not necessarily deceptive. Concerns arise when similar citations are absent in the works of other researchers in the field (Haustein & Larivière 2015) or, more commonly, based on the misconception that self-citations aid in artificially boosting one's standing in the community (Glänzel 2008). Conversely, collective (journal) self-citation poses more significant issues and is likely a byproduct of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) frenzy, driven by the competition among journals for higher rankings, prestige, and increased financial gains through elevated subscription fees, often tied to journal-level bibliometrics. Readers should not be misled: academic publications are lucrative businesses with substantial profit margins (Monbiot 2011, Larivière et al. 2015). It is therefore unsurprising that journals partake in "impact factor wars" to manipulate their metrics through tactics like citation stacking, expanding cited references during reviews to include papers from their own journal (sometimes through coercive self-citation), and rejecting studies with low citation potential (Haustein & Larivière 2015). Consequently, a high level of self-citations in a journal warrants careful scrutiny and should not be taken at face value.
The phenomenon of self-citation, whether by authors or journals, has been extensively explored from diverse perspectives, encompassing sociological and bibliometric dimensions. Szomszor et al. (2020) provided a comprehensive review specifically delving into author self-citation and its intricate technicalities. Generally, excessive self-citation is frowned upon, especially when journal self-citation is perceived as a means of artificially inflating metrics; in such cases, it is unequivocally established that biased metrics should not be utilized in evaluations of influence or impact (Ioannidis & Thombs, 2019). Nonetheless, self-citation can be deemed acceptable under certain conditions (Chorus & Waltman, 2016). Consequently, assessing levels of self-citation proves to be a complex task. Ioannidis & Thombs (2019) contended that these levels naturally fluctuate, with high levels potentially justified in highly specialized journals or disciplines with limited publication outlets.
Zootaxa falls short of meeting the established criteria for justifying high self-citations, a trend that has notably increased over time within the journal as indicated in Figure 4. Despite this, Zootaxa does not exhibit a high level of specialization, evident upon a cursory review of its publications, and the field of taxonomy itself boasts a multitude of alternative journal options, as evidenced by our compilation of 123 taxonomic paper-publishing journals exclusively from the JCR database (refer to Table 1). This abundance of alternatives suggests that the descriptive taxonomy content published by these journals is extensive, as illustrated in Figures 1-2. Contrary to expectations, specialized journals focusing on smaller taxonomic groups like Odonatologica and Acarologia, which represent a fraction of overall diversity, do not demonstrate comparable or elevated levels of self-citation, as shown in Figures 1-2 and 5. Similarly, journals dedicated to megadiverse groups such as beetles, bees, moths, and butterflies do not exhibit high self-citation rates, as depicted in Figures 2 and 5. Even journals concentrating on specific regional taxa, like Neotropical Ichthyology and South American Journal of Herpetology, display notably lower self-citation levels. Therefore, the emphasis on taxonomy within Zootaxa does not account for its elevated self-citation rates, necessitating a deeper exploration of the unique factors contributing to this phenomenon. Notably, a significant proportion of citations to the journals under analysis originate from Zootaxa, as highlighted in Figures 1-3.
Chorus and Waltman (2016) conducted a meticulous examination of journal self-citation, proposing a metric to assess enhancements in the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) while identifying instances of disproportionate and potentially unethical practices ("Impact Factor Biased Self-Citation Practices"). They acknowledged the limitations of their metric and deliberated on scenarios where self-citation could be justified, such as when a researcher draws inspiration from recent publications in a specific journal, prompting them to pursue similar research and naturally favor that journal for publication. Additionally, authors may find that a significant portion of their references come from a particular journal only after completing their manuscript, making it a logical choice for submission. These instances are notably linked to the Zootaxa mega-journal phenomenon, shedding light on the elevated levels of self-citation observed within this context.
It is our firm belief that a journal's capacity to disseminate high-quality, rigorous scientific work remains unaffected by its degree of self-citation. The correlation between a journal's self-citation rate and the caliber of research it publishes is not inherently linked, especially in the context of prolific journals like Zootaxa. It seems evident that Clarivate aims to instigate a competitive atmosphere among journals to market its journal ranking data and analytics. However, this approach does not align with the practices of zoological taxonomists and their publishing and citation habits. The question arises: who is at fault in this scenario? Is it the community of taxonomic scientists who diligently produce research within their specialized field, or the profit-oriented analytics company that lacks expertise in taxonomy yet seeks to evaluate and rank taxonomic journals? Our stance unequivocally supports the scientific community's authority in this matter, as opposed to Clarivate's apparent disregard for the principles of robust scientific inquiry.
Following the Zootaxa suppression and the surge of academic support for the journal through social media, letters from societies, and researchers (e.g., SBH 2020, SOL 2020, Van Damme 2020), predominantly from megadiverse countries, advocating for a review of Clarivate's decision, two primary conclusions emerge: (1) the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) holds significant importance in taxonomy, and (2) taxonomy is facing a threat. However, we cast doubt on both assertions and urge readers to critically evaluate these claims.
Researchers often opt to publish in Zootaxa for a variety of reasons. Factors such as scope, visibility, prestige within the field, and Journal Impact Factor (JIF) play a significant role in their decision-making process. It is common for authors choosing Zootaxa to prioritize journals with efficient reviewing and production timelines, no author publication charges (APC), a relatively high JIF, and no restrictions on manuscript length. Despite the journal's hybrid paywall policy, where most content requires payment for access but some articles are available through author-paid APC for open access (APC-OA), authors and readers appear largely unconcerned. This indifference may stem from the prohibitively high APCs of many open access journals, which can be financially burdensome for researchers from developing countries or those with limited budgets. The prevalence of Brazilian researchers as primary authors in Zootaxa further underscores this point. While platforms like ResearchGate and Sci-Hub offer alternative avenues for accessing paywalled content, the latter is considered piracy and raises ethical concerns regarding intellectual property rights. The steep costs associated with APCs pose a significant barrier for researchers worldwide, particularly those from less affluent regions or small research groups. Despite the allure of breaking paywalls through hybrid platforms, the ethical implications of circumventing copyright laws remain a contentious issue among authors and publishers alike.
The pursuit of Diamond open access (no APC for authors, DOA) in contrast to paywall policies presents a conundrum: how can journals manage the expenses associated with publishing, copyediting, DOI generation, data integration into biodiversity databases, file archiving, and more? These debates surrounding OA were vividly illustrated during the gradual shift of major publishers' journals, like Diversity and Distributions, from reader payments to author payments in an APC-OA framework (Peterson et al., 2019). The landscape of scholarly publications is progressively transitioning from paywalls to GOA, with authors bearing the costs (APC-GOA) for publication in biodiversity journals. Undoubtedly, this represents the optimal business model for major publishers as it mitigates losses stemming from white (sometimes referred to as black OA) or green platforms like Sci-Hub, ResearchGate, or Academia Inc. (site: academia.edu). It is worth noting that authors have not received any notices from Zootaxa requesting the removal of files from such platforms, in stark contrast to the aggressive stance taken by major publishers against these forms of storage and access provision.
Bibliometric indexes are recognized for their significant role in the science publishing industry and their impact on the current landscape of scientific research. Despite the widespread adoption of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) as a measure of quality by supporting agencies, it is important to note that a high JIF does not necessarily reflect the overall development of a scientific field. Rather, it is often more closely linked to the breadth of methods and data sources aligned with high JIF ranked journals. In the case of Zootaxa, originally focused on detailed taxonomic studies, the journal has evolved to include shorter notes and studies on various topics within zoological taxonomy and systematics. Notably, following Clarivate's announcement of the reinstatement of Zootaxa's JIF for the upcoming September, the journal's website promptly updated its JIF, suggesting a willingness to engage in the dynamics of JIF rankings.
Various threats to the field of taxonomy exist, with the low bibliometric values of its journals being just one contributing factor to what is known as the taxonomic impediment. While Clarivate is a for-profit entity, it is important to note that Magnolia Press Ltd. and similar publishers are not nonprofit NGOs either. The recent reinstatement of Zootaxa by Clarivate holds little significance for biological sciences and taxonomy, as Journal Impact Factors have been criticized for their statistical shortcomings and detrimental impact on scientific progress. Taxonomists should not view this reinstatement as a triumph for the field, but rather as a reminder of the negative consequences of bibliometric policies that often do more harm than good. It is crucial for the community to resist and denounce such practices that undermine the integrity and progress of taxonomy.
The taxonomic community is encouraged to reinvigorate their involvement in activities that directly contribute to the advancement and advocacy of our field. Rather than fixating on exclusive gaming practices, unreliable journal metrics marketed to our academic institutions and funding bodies, overseen by a US/UK-based entity, which was itself acquired in 2016 by two private equity firms (Onex Corporation and Baring Private Equity Asia – ONEX/BPEA; refer to Cision Ltd./PR Newswire 2016, https://prn.to/31nGDYC, BPEA 2019, https://bit.ly/3hm9yC4), it may be more beneficial to focus on securing professional opportunities for promising young taxonomists, essential for the proper upkeep and advancement of museums, scientific collections, and digital databases accessible to the public. The invaluable contributions of Zootaxa to the field of taxonomy remain unaffected by exclusion from Journal Impact Factor assessments.
The threat to taxonomy does not primarily stem from the exclusion of specific journals from major bibliometric platforms owned by large corporations. Rather, the more significant harm arises from the limited turnover of professional positions and the loss of invaluable collections, such as those previously housed at the Museu Nacional of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. These are the critical issues that should galvanize taxonomists worldwide into action. In essence, taxonomy is a product of taxonomists themselves, not the journals they publish in. We acknowledge the detrimental effects of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) obsession on the careers of taxonomists, driven by governmental policies that prioritize bibliometric evaluations in a fiercely competitive landscape where researchers vie for scarce funding. However, addressing our current challenges necessitates a shift in focus away from maintaining the status quo. It is inconsistent to advocate for the inclusion of Zootaxa in the JIF without acknowledging the journal's reliance on self-citation to boost its impact factor. While the JIF may hold allure, it is crucial to recognize that the game of bibliometrics in science operates by its own set of rules. A principled stance would involve rejecting all bibliometric indexes, including the JIF, rather than selectively embracing them. The current scientific publishing system dedicated to biodiversity knowledge is showing signs of failure, particularly for researchers. A more promising approach would involve a reinvention of the system with a primary emphasis on supporting diamond open access (DOA).
Taxonomic groups such as Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Arachnida still require extensive descriptive studies, with numerous undiscovered species awaiting identification. Journals dedicated to these groups have Journal Impact Factors (JIF) comparable to Zootaxa, and research on these taxa can also find publication in broader outlets within Entomology or Zoology categories. Consequently, the substantial self-citation rates in Zootaxa lack justification, seemingly stemming from a sociological bias linked to the Zootaxa phenomenon. Dispelling the myths surrounding Zootaxa as the sole journal for taxonomic studies is crucial for the field's advancement. Moreover, a pressing question arises: if Zootaxa were to disregard JIF entirely, would it still serve as an effective platform for taxonomic paper dissemination? A negative response to this query would signal a significant issue within the taxonomic community, necessitating prompt attention.
