ABSTRACT – (Water immersion and one-year storage influence germination of the pyrenes of 
Copernicia alba Morong, a palm tree from a neotropical wetland). Palm seeds are known for displaying 
dormancy and a thick endocarp that delays germination and embryo growth; but water treatments may 
accelerate their germination process. Additionally, ex-situ conservation can cause seed viability loss over 
time. Data on seed dormancy and storage have been neglected for many native palm species in Brazil. 
We investigated the effect of water treatments and one-year storage on the germination of Copernicia 
alba Morong, a palm tree from the Brazilian Pantanal wetland. To address our aim, fresh and stored 
pyrenes were immersed in water (at room temperature for 24, 48, and 72h) and in hot water (~75°C for 
5- and 10-min). Fresh pyrenes germinated up to 84% in control, reaching 100% after water immersion for 
48 and 72h. In contrast, one-year storage reduced germination by almost 50%, but water immersion 
slightly increased the germination of stored pyrenes. On the contrary, hot water decreased germination 
for both fresh and stored pyrenes. Seeds of C. alba may be classified as orthodox seed storage behavior. 
Taken all together, water treatments at room temperature improved the germination of the pyrenes. In 
contrast, long-term seed storage and hot-water treatments may jeopardize germination.

RESUMO – (A imersão em água e o armazenamento de um ano influenciam a germinação dos 
pirênios de Copernicia alba Morong, uma palmeira de um bioma alagado neotropical). As sementes 
de palmeiras geralmente apresentam dormência e um endocarpo espesso que retarda a germinação e 
o crescimento do embrião, contudo, tratamentos com água podem acelerar o processo de germinação 
das suas sementes. Além disso, a conservação de sementes ex-situ pode causar perda de viabilidade 
das sementes ao longo do tempo. Dados sobre dormência e armazenamento de sementes têm sido 
negligenciados para muitas espécies de palmeiras nativas no Brasil. Nós investigamos o efeito da 
imersão em água e armazenamento de um ano sobre a germinação de sementes de Copernicia alba 
Morong, uma palmeira do Pantanal brasileiro. Para testar nosso objetivo, pirênios recém-colhidos e 
armazenados foram imersos em água a temperatura ambiente por 24, 48 e 72h e água quente (~75°C 
por 5 e 10 min). Pirênios recém coletados germinaram 84% no controle, atingindo 100% após imersão 
em água por 48 e 72h. Em contraste, o armazenamento de um ano reduziu germinação em ~50%; 
contudo, a imersão em água promoveu a germinação dos pirênios armazenadas. Por outro lado, a 
água quente diminuiu a germinação dos pirênios frescos e os armazenados. Sementes de C. alba 
podem ser classificados em ortodoxas. Em geral,  a imersão em água à temperatura ambiente 
aumentou a germinação dos pirênios. Entretanto, armazenamento for longa duração e tratamentos 
com água quente podem prejudicar a germinação.

Introduction 
 
Palm seeds often display morphophysiological dormancy due to underdeveloped embryos 
(Baskin & Baskin 2014) and a thick endocarp that delays germination and embryo growth (Pérez 
2009, Ribeiro et al. 2011, Oliveira et al. 2013, Carvalho et al. 2015, Oliveira et al. 2015, Soares et 
al. 2021). Water treatments may accelerate the germination process of palm seeds by facilitating 
oxygen absorption and loosening mechanical restrictions of the surrounding tissues (e.g., Bovi 1990, 
Martin et al. 1996, Ferreira & Gentil 2006, Fava & Albuquerque 2011, Rubio Neto et al. 2012, Pinto 
et al. 2012, Goudel et al. 2013, Ferreira et al. 2021). On the other hand, hot-water treatments (~75°C) 
have been tested on the germination of tropical palm seeds but may not promote a dormancy break 
(Martin et al. 1996, Rodrigues-Junior et al. 2016). 
Studies have shown that ex-situ conservation of palm seeds has been associated with seed 
viability loss over time (Broschat 1994, Orozco-Segovia et al. 2003, Nascimento et al. 2010, Jacob 
& Decruse 2015, Oliveira et al. 2015, Felix et al. 2017, Beltrame et al. 2018, Bastos et al. 2021). 
Several external factors influence the viability of tropical palm seeds during storage, such as 
temperature and time, and intrinsic factors like seed moisture content, seed maturation, and 
desiccation sensitivity (recalcitrance) (Roberts 1973, Orozco-Segovia et al. 2003, Baskin & Baskin, 
2014, Sano et al. 2015). Recalcitrant seeds do not tolerate water loss - typically below a threshold 
<12% - thus rapidly fading in laboratory storage (Hong & Ellis 1996) and showing a low potential 
for forming soil seed banks (Oliveira et al. 2015). On the other hand, orthodox seed storage behavior 
can be maintained ex situ over a long-term in suitable environments (Hong & Ellis 1996). The 
longevity of stored palm seeds varies among species, and the optimal conditions for ex-situ 
conservation may reduce metabolic activity under relatively low values of environmental humidity 
and temperatures (Pivetta et al. 2011). In laboratory conditions, temperatures ranging from 18 to 23°C 
have been recommended for most palm seeds (Broschat 1994) and tested for a few tropical species, 
such as the macaw palm (Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. Mart.) from the Cerrado savannas 
(Ribeiro et al. 2012) and Copernicia alba Morong from Brazilian wetlands (Masetto et al. 2012). 
Knowledge of seed biology, such as dormancy, germination, and storage, is crucial to aid 
efforts to improve seed conservation techniques (Ellis et al. 2007, Hay & Probert 2013, Costa et al. 
2017) and to use for restoration programs (Merritt & Dixon 2011, León-Lobos et al. 2012, Kildisheva 
et al. 2016, Vittis et al. 2020). Therefore, to conserve seeds of a species safely is necessary to assess 
germination requirements and the category of seed storage behavior to find out the most satisfactory 
storage environment and the duration of successful storage (Hong & Ellis 1996, Teixido et al. 2017). 
Unfortunately, data on seed dormancy and longevity and storage behavior have been neglected for

several wild native species in Brazil (Ribeiro et al. 2016). Such studies have also been limited to a 
relatively small number of palm species (Jagannathan 2021). 
Copernicia alba Morong is a palm tree (Arecaceae family) native to tropical and subtropical 
ecosystems in South America, occurring in the Chacos of Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and the 
Pantanal in Brazil (Lorenzi et al. 2004). This species is commonly named “carandá” or caranday 
palm, often forming monodominant populations in the Pantanal wetland, which is periodically 
subjected to flooding followed by dry periods (Pott & Pott 1994). These areas can remain flooded for 
up to eight months per year (Pott & Pott 1994, Nunes-da-Cunha & Junk 2011, Figure 1 a). In the 
natural areas, C. alba exhibits early successional characteristics, can tolerate fires, and its fruit provide 
food for wildlife such as macaws, parrots, and fishes (Pott & Pott 1994). The economic relevance of 
C. alba regards its wood durability and its uses in rural constructions such as corrals and fences 
(Lorenzi et al. 2004, Pivetta et al. 2011). 
Previous studies pointed out that this palm species may display dormancy, and water 
immersion treatments can enhance germination (Fava & Alburqueque 2011, Masetto et al. 2012). 
Besides, seed storage behavior knowledge is still insufficient (but see Masetto et al. 2012). Several 
species, including palms species that dominate wetlands ecosystems may show fruit/seed dispersal 
and germination strategies related to the water pulse (Orozco-Segovia et al. 2003, Fabri 2018, Pires 
et al. 2018, Bao et al. 2018, Oliveira et al. 2019, Elias & Viera 2020). Therefore, this study aimed to 
evaluate the pretreatment in water immersion (~ 25 and 75°C) and the one year of storage on seed 
germination of C. alba, and addressed the following questions: i) do these seeds show dormancy?; ii) 
what is the effect of water pretreatments on germination of the caranday pyrenes?; iii) what is the 
classification of germination behavior after one year of storage?; and iv) do the pretreatments in water 
immersion enhance or reduce the germination of stored seeds? The thick endocarp can hinder 
germination; thus, water immersion treatments are expected to improve germination. However, we 
anticipated that seed viability might decrease after the relatively prolonged storage period. 
 
Material and Methods 
 
Seed collection and benefiting - We harvested fresh, mature, black fruits directly from 15 matrices of 
Copernicia alba Morong from a natural population at the Carandazal trail (Fig 1a), located in a natural 
area of the Miranda subregion of the Pantanal wetland, in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil (GPS 
coordinates 19º48’30.1’’S and 57º10’13.5’’W) in July 2011. The black exocarp was considered the 
criterion of maturation for fruit harvesting. Harvesting involved cutting the outer branches and 
dislodging the fresh fruit bunches with a tree pruner, and then fruits fell freely on the plastic wrap

placed on the ground. We took the fruits to the Seed Laboratory at Universidade Federal do Mato 
Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, where the experiments were carried out. The exocarp and 
mesocarp of the fruits were removed by manual friction; then, the pyrenes were inspected for fungal 
infection and insect attack. All seeds were mixed in a lot. Mature fruit is a dry, fibrous drupe with an 
ovoid shape and black color, which consists of an exocarp, a fibrous mesocarp, and a stony endocarp 
that encloses the seeds, called pyrenes with 1-2 cm in length (Figure 1 b-d). Since a thick (rigid) 
endocarp surrounded the seeds, we used the whole pyrenes as germination units in our study. The 
initial moisture content of the pyrenes was determined by fresh-weighing two samples of 15 pyrenes 
and then re-weighing the samples after oven-drying at 105 ± 3°C for 24h, according to the Brazilian 
rules for seed testing (Brasil 2009). After benefiting and initial assessment of moisture content,  a 
sublot of cleaned pyrenes were placed in a paper bag and stored in a dry cold room at 19°C (45 ± 5% 
relative humidity) for one year to evaluate viability through  germination test after the storage period. 
 
Experimental factors and germination trials 
 
Germination of pretreated pyrenes - Freshly harvested pyrenes were used to determine the effect of 
soaking pyrenes in water compared to the control (untreated/non-soaked pyrenes) under laboratory 
conditions. For the pretreatments, pyrenes were immersed in water at room temperature (~25°C) for 
24h; 48h; and 72h; and in hot water at 75°C for 5 min and 10 min. Plastic trays (20 x 30 x 9 cm) were 
used to maintain the seeds immersed in water under constant fluorescent light for the desired times, 
with daily water replacement. 
After water immersion treatments (at room temperature and hot water), germination trials were 
carried out. Seeds were placed in rolls of germitest® paper pre-moistened with distilled water at 2.5 
times dry the paper weight (Brasil 2009). All rolls of pretreated and untreated pyrenes were kept inside 
plastic bags to prevent water loss and placed in incubator set to 12 h photoperiod of fluorescent light (4 
x 20 W) and alternating temperatures of 20-30°C, based on optimal germination condition for C. alba 
(Fava & Albuquerque 2011). Rolls were rotated within the incubators four times each week. We daily 
performed germination checks for up to 45 days with protrusion of the cotyledonary petiole ≥2 mm as 
the criterion for germination (Janick & Paull 2008, Baskin & Baskin 2014). 
Effect of storage and pretreatments on germination of the stored pyrenes - After one year of storage, 
stored pyrenes were used to assess the viability through a germination test and categorized the seed 
storage behavior. Seed-bearing species are, in most cases, recognized in three categories based on 
Roberts (1973) and Ellis et al. (1990): orthodox or desiccation-tolerant (seed can be maintained ex-
situ over the long-term using conventional genebank protocols); recalcitrant or desiccation intolerant

(seeds tolerate short-term storage under well-defined and well-controlled environments); and 
intermediate or partly desiccation-tolerant (seed can be maintained in medium-term storage). 
Prior the experiments were set, two replicates of 15 stored pyrenes were used to estimate the 
water content (Brasil 2009) (see seed collection and benefiting subsection). Pretreatments by soaking 
the pyrenes in water (see Germination of pretreated pyrenes) were also applied to the stored pyrenes, 
before the germination tests, compared to a control (untreated/non-soaked stored pyrenes) under 
laboratory conditions. Then, stored pyrenes (pretreated and untreated) were set to germinate in rolls 
of germitest® paper as described above. 
At the end of all germination trials, we assessed the germination percentage (G%) and mean 
germination time (MGT) based on the number of daily germinated pyrenes (Labouriau 1983, Ranal & 
Santana 2006). Additionally, we calculate the germination speed index according to Maguire (1962). Non-
germinated pyrenes were classified as dormant or dead, although a tetrazolium test was not performed to 
evaluate if the seeds were or were not viable; neither dormant nor dead seeds were included in the data. 
A completely randomized factorial experimental design was used with 2 storage conditions 
(non-stored and stored pyrenes) x 6 pretreatments (control; ~25°C - 24h, 48h, and 72h; and in hot 
water at 75°C for 5 and 10 min) with four replicates of 25 pyrenes (=100 individual pyrenes) were 
used for each treatment and control. 
Data analysis - Germination variables (G%, MGT, and speed index) were evaluated using analysis of 
variance with permutations (10,000 iterations) with the lmPerm package (Wheeler & Torchiano 2016) 
in R statistical software (R Core Team 2020). Models compared variable values as a function of water 
immersion treatments (control, soaking in water for 24, 48, and 72h, hot water for 5 and 10 min), 
storage period (freshly harvested and stored pyrenes), and the interaction between them (see 
Supplementary material table S1). The analyses were followed by Tukey HSD tests to address 
multiple comparisons among all treatment combinations. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Copernicia alba Morong seeds displayed no evidence of dormancy in the tested treatments. 
Freshly harvested pyrenes germinated 84% (Figure 2 a), indicating a high germination percentage. 
Masetto et al. (2012) also found similar findings for the same species collected in a natural area in 
the Pantanal. Contrasting with our study, Masetto et al. (2012) and Fava & Albuquerque (2011) 
affirmed that the study species exhibits seed dormancy. Genetic factors may affect seed germination 
by influencing seed viability and quality in the same species from different areas (Soler-Guilhen et 
al. 2020). Initial moisture content of the pyrenes was ~10%, with corresponding results of 10% (Fabri

2018) and 16.6% (Masetto et al. 2012) for the same species. In both studies fruits were collected from 
natural populations of Pantanal wetland in the Mato Grosso do Sul State.  The thick endocarp of C. 
alba was permeable to water, not impeding the seeds from germinating. Seeds surrounded by a stony 
endocarp may block the germination causing its delay for months or years, such as reported to Butia 
capitata Mart.Becc. (Soares et al. 2021) and Syagrus romanzoffiana (Cham.) Glassman. (Oliveira et 
al. 2015), both species from the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado), and Bactris maraja Mart from the 
Amazon Forest (Rodrigues et at. 2014). Fortunately, the lack of seed dormancy of C. alba can warrant 
recruitment in the Pantanal wetlands where seeds/pyrenes are subjected to flooding conditions 
demonstrated by a rapid flush of seedling emergence in the post-flood environment (Bao et al. 2018). 
Even though many palm seeds may display morphophysiological dormancy related to the 
undeveloped embryo and/or mechanical restrictions imposed by a thick endocarp (Pérez 2009, Baskin 
& Baskin 2014), pyrenes of our study species can be easily germinated under laboratory conditions. 
The storage period reduced the germination performance of the study species. The germination 
percentage of stored pyrenes decreased to ≤50% (Figure 2 b). Germination times varied from 18 to 33 
days in freshly harvested, and around 18 days in the stored pyrenes (Figure 2 c, d). Speed index followed 
the same patterns of G% (Figure 2 e, f). This germination parameter can be used as a tool to evaluate 
the rate of germinated seeds/pyrenes (or emerged seedlings) per day, also applied as a metric for 
seedling vigor (Maguire 1962, Ranal & Santana 2006). The initial water content of the stored pyrenes 
decreased to 7% after the one-year period of storage. This study demonstrated that stored seeds of 
Copernicia alba Morong species from the Pantanal wetland, even though the germination capacity was 
reduced over time, can remain relatively viable and germinable at least over the time frame of this study 
for one year. However, these results showed a limitation of using only germination studies to assess 
viability. Viability tests such as tetrazolium and X-ray tests are widely used in conservation programs 
(Terry et al. 2003, Gosling 2004, Riebkes et al. 2015) and could have been applied to evaluate whether 
the non-germinated stored seeds remained viable or undergone some kind of secondary dormancy state 
(Schlindwein et al. 2019).  Future studies should assess viability through these methods and test 
different storage conditions to maintain higher germinability of the seeds of the study species. 
Regarding seed behavior storage, we suggest that C. alba Morong seeds may be classified as 
desiccation-tolerant (orthodox) given their low water content ranging from 10 to 7% and the moderate 
germination percentages maintained after the storage period. Hong & Ellis (1996) define as orthodox 
those seeds that tolerate desiccation ≤12% moisture content and remain viable during 12 months of 
subsequent storage. Nevertheless, the authors also pointed out that investigations of seed survival in 
different storage environments, such as at lower temperatures (-20°C), should be tested to confirm if 
the seeds show intermediate rather than orthodox seed storage behavior. Recent research has shown

that some tropical species of the Arecaceae family produce seeds that exhibits desiccation tolerance 
after storage (Orozco-Segovia et al. 2003, Souza et al. 2016). In Cerrado ecosystems, the seed of 
Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart. has been identified as desiccation-tolerant and can be 
stored over one year under low temperatures (10°C, see Ribeiro et al. 2012). Ex-situ seed conservation 
is a worldwide concern (CBD 2010, Walters et al. 2013); however, longevity patterns remain a matter 
of inquiry for most tropical palm trees (Broschat 1994, Pivetta et al. 2011). The natural habitats where 
the study species occurs can experience prolonged events of drought in pluriannual dry spells of the 
Pantanal (Thielen et al. 2020), such as those that occurred in 2020; therefore, the desiccation tolerance 
may play a critical role in maintaining this species in the ecosystem under a set of dry years. 
Nevertheless, low-temperature conservation and in vitro culture propagation methods remain 
unstudied for seeds of C. alba. 
Overall, water treatments positively influenced germination. The freshly harvested pyrenes 
reached 100% of germination after immersion in water for 48 and 72h (Figure 2 a). Stored pyrenes 
germinated 32% after soaking in water for 24h but reached ~50% after 48 and 72h (Figure 2 b). The 
water treatments for 48 and 72h also improved MGT of freshly harvested pyrenes (to around 20 days) 
compared to the control (25 days, Figure 2 c), thus providing faster germination. In contrast, there 
was no change in the mean germination time of stored pyrenes among treatments (Figure 2 d). Hence, 
water immersion for two-to-three days improves the germination of freshly harvested pyrenes of C. 
alba, which may accelerate germination and seedling growth for nursery production. The number of 
germinated seeds per day was improved by water immersion, as indicated by the speed index after 48 
and 72h, mostly for the freshly harvested pyrenes (Figure 2 e). Water immersion pretreatments also 
promoted germination of Butia capitata (Mart.) Becc. pyrenes (Arecaceae) from the Cerrado (Soares 
et al.2021); and seed of Copernicia prunifera (Mill.) H.E. Moore (carnauba) from the Brazilian 
Northeast region (Reis et al. 2011) that seems to display flood-tolerant seedlings (Arruda & Calbo 
2004). Both species occur in flooded environments, suggesting that the enhancement of germination 
ability after immersion in water can improve the competitive performance following flooding events 
in their natural habitats.  
On the contrary, hot water treatments negatively affected the germination process. The 
germination percentage (G%) of freshly harvested pyrenes of C. alba decreased  to 62 and 50% for 5 
and 10 minutes of exposure, respectively (Figure 2 a, b). Such treatments also reduced the germination 
percentage of stored pyrenes to 21% for 5-min and 16% for 10-min of exposure (Figure 2 b). 
Additionally, the 5-min hot water treatment delayed the mean germination time of freshly harvested 
pyrenes to 30 days (Figure 2 c), with no effect on MGT after storage (Figure 2 d). Likewise, hot water 
treatments jeopardized the germination of Euterpe oleracea Mart. (Arecaceae) seeds from the Amazon

rainforest (Bovi & Cardoso 1976). Heat shock also did not break the seed dormancy of A. aculeata 
(Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart. (macaw palm) but caused high seed deterioration rates (Rodrigues-Junior et al. 
2016). 
The tolerance of C. alba seeds/pyrenes to prolonged water immersion should be further 
investigated to understand if the heightened germination is sustained. High and fast germination after 
flooding can be a vital trait for maintaining monodominance since most buried propagules are 
recruited at the end of the seasonal flooding period in the Pantanal wetlands (Bao et al. 2018). 
 
Conclusions 
 
Our study highlights some important considerations for studies involving water immersion to 
accelerate seed/pyrene germination and the ex-situ conservation of a tropical palm species. The results 
reveal that water imbibition of seeds enclosed by a thick endocarp was not blocked, promoting the 
seeds germination. Copernicia alba Morong seed did not display dormancy, exhibiting a high 
germination capacity in the control. The pyrenes stored for one year at 19°C under a relative humidity 
of 45% decreased the water content from 10 (initial) to 7% and germination rates by almost 50%. 
Therefore, we suggested that our study species should be classified as orthodox. Soaking in water for 
48 and 72h improved the germination rate and time of freshly harvested and stored seeds; however, 
hot treatments reduced the germination capacity delaying the germination time.
