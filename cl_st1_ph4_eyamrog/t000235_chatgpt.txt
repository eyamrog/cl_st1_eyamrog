The full spectrum of COVID-19 is still emerging, with various studies indicating that patients infected with the novel coronavirus may develop a hypercoagulable state. However, many aspects concerning the incidence and pathophysiology of the link between COVID-19 and pulmonary embolism remain unclear. In this case study, we present a patient with COVID-19 who experienced acute pulmonary embolism. Clinical and laboratory data, along with non-enhanced CT findings, suggest the presence of acute pulmonary embolism, prompting the decision to conduct computed tomography pulmonary angiography for the objective identification of filling defects in pulmonary arterial branches.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is attributed to a betacoronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Originating in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, this novel coronavirus swiftly disseminated globally. The World Health Organization officially classified COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
Most patients with COVID-19 typically exhibit mild disease symptoms, although a small subset may progress to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other complications, such as thrombotic events in both macro- and micro-circulation. Coagulopathy is a common occurrence in ARDS/sepsis and has been identified as a prognostic indicator in severe or critical cases of COVID-19. Aberrant coagulation parameters, including elevated levels of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products, have shown a significant association with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been implicated in triggering a cytokine storm and activating the coagulation cascade, ultimately leading to the observed thrombotic events.
Moreover, the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) among individuals with COVID-19 has garnered significant interest within the medical field. It has been observed that these patients are particularly susceptible to a heightened likelihood of developing venous thromboembolism.
In this study, we present the case of a 52-year-old male patient who presented to our emergency department with a 5-day history of fever, myalgia, abdominal pain, headache, cough, and dyspnea. The patient disclosed a history of asthma but denied recent attacks, along with any other comorbidities, smoking habits, or ongoing medication use. Upon admission, the patient exhibited normal vital signs, with peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) exceeding 95%. Laboratory tests indicated no significant abnormalities in the white blood cell (WBC) count or C-reactive protein levels. A rapid influenza diagnostic test yielded negative results. Subsequent non-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed scattered ground-glass opacities in both lungs, primarily distributed peripherally (Figure 1A). Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis of the nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient was hospitalized for a duration of 3 days and received antibiotic therapy in the form of azithromycin.
Eleven days post-hospital discharge (afebrile for over a week), the patient was readmitted due to a 2-day fever, sudden right-sided back pain, and respiratory distress. His SpO2 was 93% on room air, improving to >95% with 1L/min oxygen via nasal catheter. On examination, he was afebrile, with a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 136/85 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min. Thoracic auscultation revealed reduced vesicular murmur bilaterally with bibasilar crackles. A repeat non-enhanced chest CT showed increased bilateral and multilobar lung involvement with peripheral multifocal opacities, consolidation, sub-pleural lines, and new ground-glass opacities. A new right-sided laminar pleural effusion was noted, along with an increase in heart volume and pulmonary trunk diameter. The Wells score for PE was <2. Laboratory findings included a WBC count of 11090/mm3, hemoglobin level of 13.9 g/dL, platelet count of 296000/mm3, elevated D-dimer level, normal troponin I, elevated CRP, increased LDH, prolonged PT, and slightly elevated APTT. A repeat rRT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal results. Due to persistent back pain, CT pulmonary angiography revealed sub-segmental arterial filling defects in the right lower lobe, indicative of acute PE. Additionally, findings consistent with pulmonary infarction were observed. Treatment included full-dose anticoagulation and antibiotics, leading to clinical improvement and discharge after 4 days with rivaroxaban prescribed for home use.
This case report details a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 who developed acute PE several days after the onset of viral pneumonia. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, case reports had already documented concurrent PE and viral lung infections. Visseren et al. concluded in their 2000 study that respiratory viruses induce procoagulant activity in cultured human endothelial cells, although coronaviruses were not specifically included. A proinflammatory, hypercoagulable state may manifest in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 symptoms, potentially playing a significant role in PE development. Reduced physical activity due to quarantine measures or hospitalization may also contribute to an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and subsequent PE formation. Pathological reports and verbal accounts have noted microvascular thrombosis and PE in autopsied COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless, further research is imperative to fully understand the incidence of PE in COVID-19 patients and elucidate the precise pathophysiological mechanisms at play.
Furthermore, our case was found to be positive for lupus anticoagulant. In a recent study by Zhang et al. (11), three cases of COVID-19 were reported to exhibit thrombotic events, specifically multiple cerebral infarctions, along with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. It is worth noting that in those cases, while they tested negative for lupus anticoagulant, they did show positivity for anti-cardiolipin IgA, anti–β 2-glycoprotein-I IgA, and IgG antibodies.
Non-enhanced chest CT is widely recognized as the primary imaging modality for assessing COVID-19 pneumonia. Certain incidental findings on non-enhanced CT scans, such as peripheral lung opacities displaying characteristics indicative of pulmonary infarction (such as the reversed halo sign or central lucencies), pulmonary trunk dilatation, and an increase in cardiac volume (specifically, right cardiac chamber enlargement), can signal a potential risk of pulmonary embolism. These observed features, as evidenced in our patient, may prompt the consideration of performing CT pulmonary angiography to either confirm or rule out PE. Furthermore, clinical indicators like elevated D-dimer levels, hemoptysis, sudden deterioration in respiratory function, or chest pain should also be taken into account. Additionally, the presence of signs indicating right heart strain on an electrocardiogram or echocardiogram can assist in identifying COVID-19 patients who may be at risk of concurrent PE. It is crucial to carefully evaluate contraindications related to the administration of intravenous iodinated contrast media, such as allergies (previous reactions to iodinated contrast medium) and renal impairment, when deciding on the necessity of conducting CTPA.
In conclusion, it is imperative to acknowledge the correlation between COVID-19 and acute pulmonary embolism (PE), emphasizing the significance of evaluating clinical and laboratory findings alongside non-enhanced chest CT features, if available, when determining the necessity of conducting a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scan for individuals afflicted with the novel coronavirus.
