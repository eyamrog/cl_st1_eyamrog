COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by the enveloped, single-stranded RNA coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, has led to a rising number of fatalities worldwide. The initial alerts regarding COVID-19, or SARS-CoV-2, were raised by Dr. Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist in Wuhan province, China, in December 2019. Tragically, he succumbed to the disease shortly after, at the age of 34. Recent findings indicate that Dr. Li may have contracted the virus following contact with an asymptomatic patient during a consultation, who later developed symptoms.
In a recent study by Wu et al. (2), an examination of 38 hospitalized patients revealed signs of conjunctivitis in almost 32% of cases, particularly pronounced in the sickest individuals. These patients were admitted due to the severity of their signs and symptoms, with a likely diagnosis of COVID-19 (28 of whom tested positive for viral RNA in oropharynx secretions using RT-PCR). Histological evidence of viral infection was identified in two out of the 11 conjunctival samples tested (18%). These findings mark the first confirmation of viral invasion in the conjunctiva, underscoring the importance of safeguarding healthcare professionals handling tears and ocular secretions of patients with suspected COVID-19 and red eyes. Furthermore, the authors highlighted that conjunctivitis may be a relatively common occurrence in patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia. The predominant clinical features of conjunctivitis in this case series included hyperemia, tearing, chemosis, and mucous discharge.
Subsequent reports have indicated the presence of typical follicular conjunctivitis in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In a study by Chen et al. (3), it was found that out of 534 patients with COVID-19, 25 individuals (4.7%) exhibited conjunctival congestion, with three of them presenting this as the initial clinical symptom. The conjunctival congestion persisted for an average of 5 days, ranging from 2 to 10 days, and was often accompanied by dry eye symptoms (21%), blurred vision (13%), and a sensation of a foreign body in the eye (12%). The majority of patients reported eye complaints alongside fever and respiratory symptoms, such as dry cough and shortness of breath.
This situation raises a crucial question: can tears from patients with confirmed COVID-19, even in the absence of conjunctivitis symptoms, potentially infect healthcare professionals?
Despite the stringent care protocols advised for handling secretions from COVID-19 patients and the potential presence of viral RNA in the conjunctiva, several studies have indicated a low likelihood of detecting the virus in the tears of COVID-19 patients who do not exhibit symptoms of conjunctivitis.
In a limited study involving 30 patients with SARS-CoV-2 exhibiting moderate to severe respiratory symptoms and lacking signs of conjunctivitis, viral RNA was not found in either tears or conjunctival secretions. Notably, these patients did show detectable levels of RNA in oropharynx samples. It is worth mentioning that only one patient, who had both conjunctivitis and severe COVID-19 symptoms, exhibited viral RNA in their tears.
In a subsequent study involving 72 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR at the Tongji School of Medicine, only two individuals exhibited symptoms of conjunctivitis, representing a prevalence of 2.8% (5).
Only one patient exhibited signs of conjunctivitis and tested positive for viral RNA in tears, while none of the remaining 70 patients, who did not display signs of conjunctivitis, tested positive for COVID-19 in their tear samples.
Given the frequent occurrence of conjunctival congestion and the confirmed presence of COVID-19 in the eyes, it is imperative to consider the safety implications of using contact lenses. In hospital settings, health professionals are required to wear eye protection such as goggles or face shields, along with other necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), regardless of whether they wear contact lenses or corrective glasses. As a precaution, the general public has been advised to opt for glasses over contact lenses, as glasses can serve as an extra physical barrier against aerosol particles that may pose a risk of reaching the eyes.
It is crucial to consider the potential risk of contamination associated with handling contact lenses, particularly noting that individuals who wear glasses typically engage in less eye manipulation and scratching compared to contact lens wearers. While speculative, it is worth noting that contact lens surfaces, often composed of polymethyl acrylate and/or silicone and their derivatives, along with the lens storage containers, could potentially harbor the virus for extended periods, ranging from hours to days. Our stance is that wearing glasses represents the safest overall choice during the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, for those who opt to continue using contact lenses, it is imperative to exercise extreme caution by ensuring thorough hand washing before handling the lenses, refraining from eye or face scratching, and utilizing personal protective equipment (PPE) when in a hospital environment.
In the current scenario, what recommendations can be made for healthcare professionals tending to patients with conjunctivitis and suspected COVID-19? The suggested protocols for caring for individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 involve safeguarding the mouth, nose, and eyes with surgical masks (or N-95 masks in high-risk areas) along with either goggles or face shields. Additionally, the use of breath shields on slit-lamps is beneficial in safeguarding ophthalmologists.
To mitigate the transmission of COVID-19, it is imperative to bolster existing disinfection protocols that are typically employed to curb the dissemination of other viral pathogens prevalent in clinical settings. Alongside the recommendation to reschedule non-urgent visits and surgeries, meticulous cleaning and disinfection procedures should be rigorously adhered to both prior to and following patient examinations, as studies have indicated the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on certain surfaces for several days.
