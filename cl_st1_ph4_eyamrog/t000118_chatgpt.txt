A new species of Vriesea Lindl. (Bromeliaceae) from the Atlantic Rainforest of São Paulo State, Brazil, is presented in this study. Vriesea altobocainensis, exclusively found in the Atlantic Forest of Serra da Bocaina, is identified as a robust epiphyte distinguished by its reddish inflorescence and the orbicular and broadly ovate shape of its floral and primary bracts. Morphologically, this species bears resemblance to Vriesea altodaserrae L.B.Sm. and Vriesea sceptrum Mez. Nevertheless, Vriesea altobocainensis can be differentiated primarily by the color, dimensions, and shape of its floral and primary bracts, as well as the number of inflorescence branches and flowers per branch.
Vriesea Lindl. belongs to the subfamily Tillandsioideae, which, as indicated by phylogenetic and morphological studies, has undergone segregation resulting in the establishment of new genera (Barfuss et al. 2016). In this revised classification, Vriesea is primarily distinguished by the presence of a stigma of the convolute blade II type, characterized by lobes that are often fused, spreading, significantly broadened, and shaped like an infundibulum or umbrella (Barfuss et al. 2016). These plants are typically epiphytic, terrestrial, or rupicolous, and are predominantly found in South America, with a notable concentration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Costa et al. 2007). According to Forzza et al. (2015), Vriesea stands out as the most diverse genus of Bromeliaceae in Brazil, boasting nearly 230 species (Gouda et al. cont. updated). It also ranks among the most species-rich genera, with approximately 170 species, within the Atlantic Rainforest domain (BFG 2018, Flora do Brasil 2020 under construction).
Serra da Bocaina, situated within the Serra do Mar mountain range at the juncture of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in Southeastern Brazil, encompasses vast expanses of pristine Atlantic Rainforest. This region boasts a variety of distinct physiognomic formations, including lowland forests, nebular forests, and altitude fields. The area's physical characteristics, characterized by significant topographical diversity ranging from sea level to 2,088 meters, steep slopes, mountainous highlands, and substantial annual precipitation averaging around 1,700 mm, have likely created unique niches and refuges. Consequently, Serra da Bocaina exhibits high levels of biological diversity and endemism, as noted by IBAMA in 2002 and Freitas in 2010.
During our fieldwork in Serra da Bocaina, we discovered a previously unknown species of Vriesea. In this study, we provide a detailed description and visual representation of this newly identified species.
The species description was established using both herbarium specimens and fresh material gathered during field expeditions to Serra da Bocaina, in the vicinity of the Parque Nacional da Serra da Bocaina (Serra da Bocaina National Park), and subsequently stored at the SP Herbarium.
To enhance the data and assess the morphological traits, thorough analysis was conducted on samples of the newly discovered species along with the two species that bear the closest morphological resemblance to it.
The floral bracts were measured within the central structures of the inflorescence, with supplementary data gathered from various authoritative sources including specialized literature (Smith & Downs, 1977; Reitz, 1983; Costa et al., 2007; Rosa, 2011; Flora do Brasil, 2020 - currently under construction), the Brazilian virtual herbarium Herbário Virtual REFLORA (Reflora cont. updated), and the speciesLink network.
Epiphytic plants exhibit leaf rosettes that are infundibuliform in shape. The leaf-sheaths are broadly elliptic and dark-brown, while the leaf-blades are linear-lanceolate with an acute-attenuate apex, ending in a mucronate tip. The peduncle bracts are imbricate, with the lower ones being green, foliaceous, and suberect, while the upper ones have dilated sheaths that are orbicular and reddish, with blades that are suberect to patent, lanceolate, and green. The inflorescence is compound, displaying a heterothetic double raceme structure with 10-21 branches that are patent with an ascending to slightly sigmoid apical portion, each bearing (8-)10-20 flowers. The primary bracts are longer than the peduncles of the branches but shorter than the branches themselves, appearing red in color. The peduncle of branches typically has 1-2 sterile bracts, with the rachilla being red, slightly geniculate, and featuring short internodes approximately 1 cm long. Floral bracts are red or red with a yellow apex, orbicular to broadly-ovate in shape, with an obtuse, apiculate, carinate apex. The flowers are distichous and suberect in anthesis, with yellow sepals and petals that are slightly orangish at the apex, rounded in shape, and with petal appendages that are longitudinally adnate to the petal, featuring a superior free portion that is ovate or rhombic-ovate, with a rounded or obtuse apex and entire margins. The anthers are included to slightly exserted, while the ovary is cylindrical, and the seeds have long funicles.
Epiphytic plants typically reach heights of 0.8-1.7 meters when in bloom, characterized by infundibuliform leaf rosettes. The leaf-sheaths measure 23 × 9-14 cm, displaying a broad elliptic shape in a dark-brown hue, while the linear-lanceolate leaf-blades span 36-72 × 5.5-7.5 cm, featuring a green coloration with faint transversal stripes, and terminating in an acute-attenuate, mucronate apex. The peduncle, standing 50-63 cm tall, presents an erect posture, transitioning from green to reddish tones towards the apex. Peduncle bracts, arranged in an imbricate manner, exhibit a variety of characteristics: the lower ones are green, foliaceous, and suberect, with broadly-ovate sheaths measuring approximately 5 × 6.5 cm and blades around 40 × 5.5 cm, which taper towards the apex. In contrast, the upper bracts feature dilated sheaths, measuring about 6 × 7 cm, with orbicular reddish blades around 10 × 3 cm, lanceolate in shape, and green in color, ending in an attenuate, mucronate apex. The inflorescence is compound, displaying a heterothetic double raceme structure that stands erect at 35-100 cm in length, with 10-21 branches. The primary bracts, generally longer than the peduncles but shorter than the branches, range from 4.5-12 × 6-8 cm, with the lower ones resembling the peduncle bracts in size and coloration. The floral bracts, measuring 2.1-3.5 × 2-3 cm, are orbicular to broadly-ovate, enveloping the rachilla base, and exhibit a red hue with an obtuse, apiculate apex. The flowers, arranged distichously, are suberect during anthesis, with narrowly ovate yellow sepals and ligulate yellow petals, slightly orange at the apex. The stamens, approximately 2.8 cm long, are arranged in two verticils, with three free in the outer verticil and three epipetalous in the inner verticil. The gynoecium, measuring 3-3.4 cm, features a cylindrical ovary with axile placentation. The fruit, a capsule measuring 3.5-4.5 × 1.4 cm, contains seeds around 1.7 cm long, with a long funicle of approximately 1 cm.
Vriesea altobocainensis, a notable species native to the Atlantic Forest of Serra da Bocaina, stands out for its robust habit, infundibuliform rosettes, inflorescence branches that are patent, with the apical portion of the branches ascending to slightly sigmoid (as observed in certain species of Alcantarea (E. Morren ex Mez) Harms), red primary and floral bracts, and distichous flowers. While typically an epiphyte, this species can also be found growing on the forest floor after falling from the canopy.
Costa et al. (2015) identified that Vriesea sceptrum Mez and Vriesea altodaserrae L.B. Sm. are part of the same clade, alongside the basal lineages of Vriesea species, based on morphological character analysis. These species are distinguished by their compound inflorescences, featuring bracts longer than the peduncle of the branches, erect and linear to narrowly-oblong petals with apressed apices, and stamens that are included, as outlined in the study.
Vriesea altobocainensis bears a striking resemblance to V. sceptrum, a species native to the highlands of Serra da Mantiqueira in the States of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. Both species exhibit a robust growth habit, inflorescences characterized by patent branches, densely packed and distichous flowers, short internodes measuring between 0.7 to 1.5 cm in length, and primary bracts that are red in color. However, Vriesea altobocainensis can be differentiated by its higher count of inflorescence branches ranging from 10 to 21, with a corresponding number of flowers in the branches varying from 8 to 20. Additionally, it features orbicular to broadly-ovate upper primary bracts measuring 6 to 8 cm wide, red rachillas, orbicular to broadly-ovate floral bracts that are 2 to 3 cm wide and have obtuse apices, as well as yellow sepals. In contrast, Vriesea sceptrum displays a lower number of inflorescence branches, typically between 13 to 15, with a corresponding range of 5 to 12 flowers in the branches. Its distinguishing features include triangular to ovate upper primary bracts measuring 2 to 5 cm wide, rachillas that are greenish-orange to orange in color, ovate floral bracts ranging from 1.5 to 2.2 cm wide and having apices that are acute to obtuse, along with orange sepals as depicted in figure 3.
Vriesea altobocainensis is closely related to Vriesea altodaserrae, a species found in the Serra do Mar mountain range spanning Paraná, Santa Catarina, and São Paulo, including Serra da Bocaina. These two species coexist in the region, with Vriesea altodaserrae being more prevalent. In contrast, Vriesea altobocainensis is less common, typically residing in the forest canopy, making it challenging to observe and estimate population sizes. Despite their similarities in general morphology, such as rosette shape, red primary bracts, and distichous flowers with yellow sepals and petals, there are distinct differences between the two species. Vriesea altobocainensis features sturdier inflorescence branches with fewer (10-21) densely packed flowers, thicker red rachillas, and shorter internodes (0.8-1.1 cm). Its primary bracts are orbicular to broadly-ovate, 6-8 cm wide, while floral bracts are red or red and yellow at the apex, orbicular to broadly-ovate, 2-2.8 cm wide. On the other hand, Vriesea altodaserrae displays more delicate inflorescence branches with more numerous (20-30) green to greenish-yellow rachillas and longer internodes (1.5-2 cm). Its primary bracts are broadly-ovate, 3-6 cm long, and floral bracts are yellow, ovate, 1.4-2 cm wide (see figure 3).
Vriesea altobocainensis is confined to the mountains of Serra da Bocaina within the Atlantic Rainforest, typically thriving as an epiphyte. The proposed specific epithet is derived from the species' habitat, specifically the elevated regions of Serra da Bocaina.
