It is widely acknowledged that proficient readers possess well-developed reading skills. Without these skills, individuals may struggle to attain the necessary levels of comprehension essential for problem-solving or academic success, whether in their native language or a foreign one. Therefore, it is crucial to identify effective strategies for enhancing reading comprehension among English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. One such strategy involves the utilization of graphic organizers. This particular study sought to evaluate the impact of graphic organizers on the reading comprehension development of students at Unidad Educativa Joaquin Lalama in Ambato, Ecuador. The sample comprised 40 students in the control group and 35 students in the experimental group. Data collection involved the observation technique and a comparison of results obtained from pre-test and post-test assessments of reading comprehension. Ultimately, the study concluded that the use of graphic organizers proved to be effective in enhancing reading comprehension among the observed subjects.
English has undeniably emerged as a crucial language for communication across various domains such as science, technology, politics, and economics. Its global significance is further underscored by its widespread use in the realm of entertainment. Projections made by Graddol in 2006 suggested a continuous increase in the number of individuals learning English as a foreign language, particularly in countries like China and India.
In Ecuador, English is widely regarded as the primary foreign language and a lingua franca, particularly among indigenous communities like Yungantza. Members of these communities have demonstrated a keen interest in acquiring proficiency in English, driven by the perceived advantages it offers in terms of enhanced academic prospects and improved employment opportunities (Sánchez & Zajkowski, 2016:2).
As evidenced by this example, proficiency in English is closely linked to enhanced job prospects and a broader knowledge base, largely due to the prevalence of the latest scientific and academic resources in the English language. Consequently, the Ecuadorian Education System has prioritized the teaching of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) for an extended period, integrating the English subject as a substantial component of the primary and secondary school curriculum.
Learning a new language entails the development of various skills essential for effective comprehension and expression. The four primary language skills encompass Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. In contexts where English is considered a foreign language rather than a second language, such as in our country, educators must exhibit creativity and incorporate authentic materials into their teaching practices. This is crucial as the input provided by teachers may serve as the sole source of exposure for students during their learning journey (Bekes, 2016).
Spratt, Pulverness, and Williams have underscored reading as a receptive skill, indicating that it involves responding to a text rather than creating one (Spratt, Pulverness & Williams, 2005:21-26). Reading comprehension is a multifaceted cognitive process of deciphering symbols to derive meaning, encompassing understanding at the word, sentence, and paragraph levels. To aid learners, educators must possess a comprehensive grasp of the intricacies of reading and strive to facilitate this intricate process. UNESCO previously highlighted that third-grade students in certain Latin American countries, such as Ecuador, struggled to identify crucial information in basic Spanish texts (López, 2009:1-3). This concern persisted in 2016, with third graders in Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and other nations displaying subpar reading performance, unable to discern essential details unless explicitly presented and emphasized in the text.
Similar findings were observed, particularly in public high schools in Ecuador, when assessing the standard of English language proficiency. Challenges such as large class sizes, insufficient teacher training, and a shortage of educators emerged as factors that could potentially impede the teaching and learning process. Despite the dedicated efforts within the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom, student performance appears to be subpar.
For example, students at Unidad Educativa Joaquin Lalama have demonstrated feelings of demotivation when reading in Spanish or English, attributed to a lack of effective text comprehension strategies. This raises the question of how we can support students in becoming more proficient readers. Are the strategies we currently employ in teaching reading adequate? Educators globally are likely pondering similar concerns and investigating various approaches. For instance, Wong (2019) introduced a 14-week curriculum in an EFL class that focused on developing skills in identifying discourse structures and utilizing graphic organizers.
While this researcher suggests the necessity for additional investigation into the advantages of graphic organizers within the foreign language teaching domain, it is asserted by others that the utilization of such tools can enhance students' reading proficiency. This enhancement is attributed to the development of essential cognitive skills required for comprehending educational materials that incorporate engaging visual elements, as highlighted in the study by Kurniaman, Oktari, and Pahrurazi (2019).
Drawing from theoretical frameworks, this study suggests the utilization of graphic organizers as effective tools for improving reading comprehension among junior year students at Unidad Educativa Joaquin Lalama during the Academic Year 2018-2019.
One of the investigators involved in this study is currently affiliated with Unidad Educativa Joaquin Lalama and has obtained permission from the institution's authorities to conduct research aimed at enhancing students' English reading comprehension. Consequently, the researcher observed the groups assigned to them during the academic period of 2018-2019, both before and after the intervention. According to Barreiro and Albandoz (2001), the population is defined as the total number of individuals under study in a given problem. Given that the total student population in this research was fewer than 100, the population and sample are considered as one, comprising a control group of 40 students and an experimental group of 35.
This research study utilized a quasi-experimental design, specifically a nonequivalent group design, necessitating both pretest and post-test assessments to compare two distinct groups: the treated group and the comparison group. In this research framework, the independent variable is deliberately manipulated, and participants are not randomly allocated to different conditions.
This practice is typically observed in naturalistic settings and in the assessment of social work practices (Thyer, 2012:77-106). The characteristics of such work stem from the integration of qualitative and quantitative methodologies that examine the nature of potential educational realities (Marzano, Vegliate & De Angelis, 2015:406).
Graphic organizers have been utilized for over three decades to aid readers in comprehending the content of a text. Defined as a "visual representation of information in a text," these tools have been studied scientifically (Wills & Ellis, 2008:1) and are commonly employed with learners to enhance reading comprehension (Jiang & Grabe, 2007:34).
A pre- and post-reading comprehension test was developed to assess the impact of a 6-week intervention on participants' reading abilities. Various components were carefully considered in the design of these assessment tools, as detailed in Table 1.
Throughout the intervention period, teachers facilitated students' understanding and utilization of various graphic organizers tailored to each reading text. The selection of reading materials was based on the age and interests of the students to ensure engagement. In the experimental group, teachers introduced new graphic organizers, emphasizing their intended purpose and providing guidance on their application. Meanwhile, the control group maintained their usual reading activities without the incorporation of graphic organizers.
Graphic organizers for reading are categorized under Graphic Strategies, with concept maps, mind maps, webs, and Venn diagrams being the most commonly used ones. For this study, specific graphic organizers were selected based on previous research and their practicality. These include the K-W-L chart (know, want to know, learned), K-W-L-S chart (know, want, learned, still), BRS chart (building and revising know schema chart), Sixty-second Skim and Scan, Cluster web, Concept web, Alphabet brainstorming, Questioning cluster, and B-D-A connection chart (before, during, and after reading). Figure 1 displays some of these graphic organizers.
In this research study, a mixed-method approach was employed, utilizing an assessment questionnaire and short interviews as instruments to gauge students' comprehension of the texts. These tools, in conjunction with rubrics, were utilized to measure the participants' knowledge. Subsequently, the collected data was subjected to statistical analysis, focusing on the independent variable of Graphic Organizers. The study aimed to test specific hypotheses related to the impact of Graphic Organizers on students' understanding of the texts.
Dependent variable: Reading comprehension.
Null Hypothesis (H0): The utilization of graphic organizers does not have a significant impact on the development of students' reading comprehension skills.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The utilization of graphic organizers has a significant impact on the development of students' reading comprehension skills.
After identifying the weaknesses students encounter when reading texts in English and reviewing information on various strategies and their effectiveness, this research sought to assess the advantages of employing graphic organizers to enhance EFL reading comprehension. To achieve this goal, graphic organizers were implemented across three distinct stages: pre-reading, during reading, and post-reading.
According to the British Council (2015: 8), both English learners and non-learners perceive English as a valuable asset for enhancing employability. A significant 59 per cent of non-learners express a willingness to study the language to enhance their career opportunities. Additionally, English learners underscore the significance of English proficiency for effective communication with others.
Recognizing the significance of acquiring English language proficiency, there has been a heightened focus on this foreign language within the educational sector since 2012. Consequently, English educators nationwide are urged to adopt innovative and suitable methodologies to impart this language effectively, aiming to yield favorable outcomes that would elevate the country and its populace onto a more global platform.
It is essential to consider that Ecuadorian teachers encounter diverse classrooms comprising students with varying cultural backgrounds and learning styles, presenting a significant challenge in designing lessons that cater to all. To effectively engage students and foster the development of higher-order thinking skills and problem-solving abilities in authentic settings, educators must provide a range of opportunities for meaningful tasks. Therefore, implementing innovative approaches to teaching reading has demonstrated a substantial impact, potentially yielding the desired outcomes in the realm of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instruction.
Latin American countries typically exhibit low levels of literacy, a concern that has prompted the Ecuadorian government to devise strategies aimed at enhancing reading proficiency and comprehension within the nation. Among these initiatives is the Fiesta de la Lectura, a national program advocating for a dedicated 30-minute reading period during select school days. This program seeks to integrate reading into the curriculum by combining it with recreational activities, thereby fostering a culture of reading in educational institutions (Ministerio de Educación, 2018).
Similarly, other Latin American countries have implemented similar strategies to encourage reading, including initiatives like Playing with Magic Words in Bolivia, Read Together - Learn Together in Peru, Extracurricular Clubs in Mexico, and The Magic of Reading in Guatemala, all of which have demonstrated positive outcomes (Save the Children, 2015).
Low reading comprehension appears to be associated with a deficiency in reading strategies, leading to a limited acquisition of vocabulary. If students encounter this challenge in their first language (L1), it stands to reason that the reading process becomes even more intricate for them in English. As anticipated, the pre-test results revealed low percentages, as illustrated in Table N.2.
Table N.2 illustrates that both groups exhibit deficiencies in essential reading skills, such as paraphrasing content, generating novel ideas, making predictions, offering opinions, and establishing connections within the presented information. This deficiency was discerned through the examination of results from select questions designed to assess these abilities, with the control group scoring 3.92 points and the experimental group scoring 4.22 points. Furthermore, a marked improvement is evident in the experimental group, which achieved a score of 7.02 out of 10 in the post-test. This outcome underscores the effectiveness of employing graphic organizers to bolster reading comprehension, aligning with the notion that graphic organizers serve as valuable tools for information processing (Graves & Graves, 2003).
In a local context, Tirado (2013) conducted a study focusing on the implementation of active techniques to enhance reading comprehension among fifth-year English learners in a primary school. The research revealed that the utilization of traditional methods tended to discourage students during reading activities; however, it also highlighted the students' interest in improving their reading skills. This study, along with others, has motivated educators to explore effective strategies for enhancing reading proficiency among EFL learners. Graphic organizers, recognized as tools that aid in organizing information and establishing connections within a text, such as facts, examples, definitions, and sequences, have been instrumental in assisting readers in breaking down the content of a text while processing the information presented. The incorporation of graphic organizers notably contributed to the improvement of reading comprehension levels within the experimental group, as evidenced in Table N. 3.
Upon observing and comparing the low pre-test results, which were 4.05 for the control group and 4.14 out of 10 points for the experimental group, it becomes evident that students exhibit demotivation in reading due to a deficiency in tools necessary for text comprehension. This insight led to the proposition of utilizing graphic organizers as a means to improve their reading comprehension skills.
Following the intervention, the experimental group exhibited a notable enhancement in their scores (7.06), underscoring the efficacy of employing graphic organizers to bolster students' reading comprehension abilities, thereby transforming them into more proficient readers. The cultivation of reading comprehension necessitates the adept analysis and synthesis of information, with visual aids such as graphic organizers playing a pivotal role in facilitating this cognitive process (Pearson & Fielding, 1991). From an educational perspective, various approaches and cognitive mechanisms advocate for the utilization of graphic organizers, particularly those aligned with Bloom's taxonomy. It is imperative to bear in mind how these tools correspond to the diverse stages or tiers of cognitive thinking when integrating them into instructional practices.
Utilizing a basic flow chart can aid in the retention and comprehension of information. However, when it comes to applying and analyzing data, students ought to employ various graphic organizers. These tools can assist in comparing and contrasting information, evaluating cause and effect relationships, as well as weighing the positive and negative aspects of a subject. This approach becomes particularly crucial when aiming for higher levels of cognitive engagement.
Graphic organizers serve as valuable tools in catering to diverse learning styles among students. Particularly beneficial for visual learners, these tools aid in familiarizing readers with symbols and key terms, offering a dynamic and engaging approach to learning. Studies have indicated that graphic organizers are not only effective as preparatory exercises but also serve as valuable follow-up learning activities (Dishner, Bean, & Readence, 1981).
Through the utilization of graphic organizers, individuals are able to effectively isolate crucial information from the surrounding content, thereby enhancing their strategic learning abilities and honing various skills associated with writing, reading, communication, analysis, and creativity. This, in turn, contributes to an overall improvement in performance, as evidenced by the outcomes derived from the evaluation of learning skills outlined in Table N. 4.
In the assessment of learning skills, the control group students scored 4.05 while the experimental group scored 4.17 in the pre-test, indicating a deficiency in skills like decoding and grasping new vocabulary. Following the introduction of graphic organizers to improve reading comprehension, there was no notable improvement in the control group's scores; in fact, there was a slight decrease. Table 4 further illustrates that the experimental group outperformed the control group in the post-test, scoring 6.57 out of 10, highlighting the positive impact of graphic organizers on the enhancement of learning skills.
Graphic organizers play a crucial role in aiding readers. These tools, categorized under Graphic Strategies for reading, have been highlighted for their effectiveness. Shabiralyani, Hasan, Hamad, and Iqbal (2015) emphasize the significance of visual aids in education, noting their ability to enhance knowledge dissemination and improve teaching efficacy.
According to Pearson and Fielding (1991), the brain processes 75 percent of information from visual formats such as images, diagrams, flowcharts, videos, graphs, cartoons, coloring books, movies, posters, games, and flashcards. These various graphic strategies undoubtedly enhance interaction between teachers and students.
The current study involved the collection and analysis of data from two distinct groups: the experimental group and the control group. The research employed graphic organizers as a strategic tool to aid students in improving their reading comprehension. The formulated hypothesis was based on the assumption that the use of graphic organizers would positively impact the participants' ability to comprehend written material.
According to Ho (year), the utilization of graphic organizers does not have a significant impact on the development of students' reading comprehension skills.
The utilization of graphic organizers has a significant impact on students' reading comprehension development (H1).
Given the adoption of a quasi-experimental approach, the study incorporated two distinct measurements: a pre-test conducted prior to the intervention and a post-test administered after the intervention. The chosen significance level for this research in the realm of social sciences was set at α = 0.05, indicating a 5% risk level and thereby establishing a confidence level of 95%.
The sample for this study comprised more than 30 subjects, thus making it suitable for the application of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
The calculation of the P-value was also conducted and is presented in Table 5.
The results from the Wilcoxon test for pretest and posttest on each criterion, as shown in the table above, reveal significant findings. Starting with the experimental group, the Reading Comprehension score yielded a Z-value of -5.131 (a) with a p-value of 0.000, indicating a substantial difference between the pretest and posttest scores.
The control group's results are as follows: Reading Comprehension Z= -4.292 (a) with a p=0.000. Considering that Z values are negative and p values are less than 0.05, it can be inferred that significant differences exist between the results obtained in the pre-test and post-test in the experimental and control groups. Thus, it can be concluded that the utilization of graphic organizers to improve students' reading comprehension is effective. Despite the noticeable variances in both groups, it cannot definitively be stated that the enhancement in reading comprehension is solely attributed to the implementation of this strategy.
This study aimed to assess the impact of graphic organizers on the enhancement of reading comprehension among junior year students at Unidad Educativa Joaquin Lalama in Ambato, Ecuador.
Upon examining the initial low reading proficiency levels among students at the outset of this study and contrasting it with the notable enhancement in reading comprehension observed in the experimental group during the post-intervention assessment, it is evident that the utilization of graphic organizers significantly bolstered the reading comprehension abilities of the students involved in this research endeavor.
After six weeks of incorporating reading activities with graphic organizers, the majority of students in the experimental group exhibited a clear understanding and acceptance of the utility of these tools. Additionally, they displayed notable enhancements in their receptive skills, including listening and concentration, as well as improvements in reading comprehension and learning abilities. Specifically, progress was observed in decoding skills, vocabulary understanding, and the ability to connect new content with existing knowledge.
While both groups exhibited significant differences in their post-intervention results, it cannot be definitively concluded that the improvement observed in the experimental group is solely attributed to the implemented strategy. Therefore, it is advisable to conduct additional research on the topic, preferably over an extended period, to validate the efficacy of the proposed intervention.
In fact, various factors must be considered, including the choice of texts. It is crucial to bear in mind that readers who encounter difficulties in understanding a text are likely to lose interest and motivation (Hansen, 2016). Therefore, it is essential to identify students' interests and preferences when instructing reading.
It is advisable, despite time constraints, to evaluate students' reading comprehension levels in their native language to enable teachers to offer transferable strategies for foreign language learning. Cheryl (1994) supported this notion by highlighting evidence of reading skills transferring between languages. The current study's findings indicate a lack of utilization of graphic organizers in EFL classrooms for enhancing reading skills and comprehension. Therefore, it is recommended to educate teachers about the potential benefits that could be derived from incorporating this approach.
The efficacy of graphic organizers in enhancing reading comprehension within EFL classrooms has been substantiated. These tools furnish students with visual aids, like images, that facilitate the amplification of linguistic data or logogens in a manner that enables dual coding of information: visually and linguistically. Consequently, this dual coding aids students in the processing and retention of content.
Utilizing graphic organizers to enhance reading comprehension presents a viable alternative to conventional methods typically outlined in textbooks. Consequently, following their study, the researchers put forth a recommendation: a compilation of graphic organizers and corresponding activities designed to assist EFL teachers and their students in structuring information extracted from texts during reading sessions.
Encouraging reading through innovative teaching methods, such as utilizing graphic organizers, is highly recommended. Effective reading skills are not only beneficial for daily tasks but also aid in comprehending texts in one's native language and in English. Additionally, it fosters the development of crucial cognitive abilities and enhances students' motivation through improved vocabulary acquisition and better comprehension of texts.
