Respiratory symptoms, particularly the onset of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, are the focal point of discussion and initial apprehensions among both the general populace and healthcare professionals. Nonetheless, it is crucial to recognize that the cardiovascular system is significantly impacted by these conditions, often leading to complications and mortality in affected patients. To elucidate the cardiovascular implications in individuals infected with COVID-19 and underscore the significance of social isolation as a preventive measure to mitigate disease transmission, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, drawing upon 37 articles in English, Portuguese, and Spanish sourced from Scielo and PubMed. The review revealed that cardiac complications linked to COVID-19 infection mirror those seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza. Notably, COVID-19 exhibits a higher and more rapid transmission rate, with the absence of a vaccine or definitive treatment unlike influenza. Consequently, social isolation emerges as a critical strategy to potentially reduce the number of cases, safeguard vulnerable populations, diminish the likelihood of severe disease outcomes, prevent fatalities, and avert overwhelming strain on the healthcare system.
Coronavirus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, ranges from causing mild flu-like symptoms to more severe diseases with significant public health implications. The novel coronavirus responsible for the 2020 pandemic was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO), with the resulting illness termed COVID-19. Initially identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, its rapid spread led to confirmed cases in various countries by mid-January 2020, including Brazil where the first case was reported on February 26, 2020. Prior to SARS-CoV-2, two other coronavirus epidemics had been documented: SARS-CoV-1, causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, and MERS-CoV, responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. The pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 mirrors that of SARS-CoV-1, both inducing acute lung injuries through aggressive inflammation triggered by viral replication. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to heightened secretion of pro-inflammatory interleukins and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), contributing to lung damage.
Brazil, akin to other nations, is currently experiencing a demographic transition characterized by the aging of its population. Consequently, diseases of the circulatory system have emerged as the primary cause of mortality among its inhabitants. When juxtaposed with contemporary research on cardiovascular implications exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2, it becomes apparent that preventive and control measures aimed at mitigating the risks of contamination and infection play a crucial role in curbing severe cases of the disease and potential fatalities.
This article explores the connection between the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its cardiovascular implications, underscoring the critical role of social isolation in mitigating the spread of the disease and safeguarding the nation's healthcare infrastructure.
The literature review, drawing from 37 articles in English, Portuguese, and Spanish sourced from Scielo and PubMed, delves into the cardiovascular implications observed in patients infected with Covid-19. It underscores the significance of social isolation as a pivotal measure for preventing and controlling the spread of the disease, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the nation's healthcare system.
The COVID-19 pandemic, along with previous epidemics of other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, as well as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, have had profound implications for global health, economies, and social structures. These events have significantly impacted the well-being and functioning of populations worldwide.
The demographic transition varies across countries but typically involves a rise in the elderly population compared to other age groups, increasing by approximately 4% annually. This shift is influenced by factors like declining fertility rates, lower infant and overall mortality rates, advancements in healthcare accessibility, and technological progress in disease diagnosis and treatment. These elements collectively contribute to the evolving demographic landscape.
With the rise in the elderly population, an epidemiological transition is observed, marked by a higher prevalence of circulatory diseases, diabetes mellitus, neoplasms, conditions resulting from external causes, and respiratory system ailments. Research indicates that a greater occurrence of comorbidities is often associated with advanced age.
The mortality rate of COVID-19 can be significantly higher, up to nine times, among individuals with underlying chronic conditions compared to those without any pre-existing health issues. Data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February revealed that among infected individuals without comorbidities, the mortality rate was only 1.4%. In contrast, for patients with conditions such as cardiovascular disease, the mortality rate surged to 13.2%. Overall, the lethality rate among all infected patients stood at 3.8%. It is important to note that as the pandemic progresses, new statistical data continues to be incorporated into ongoing studies.
The severe form of the disease was noted in older patients who had a higher number of comorbid conditions compared to non-severe patients, indicating that age and associated comorbidities could be risk factors for critically ill patients. Additionally, elderly and immunosuppressed patients might exhibit atypical symptoms and various presentations, ranging from mild to severe pneumonia, and in more severe instances, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and mortality.
In a case report involving 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, it was observed that 16.7% of the patients developed arrhythmia, while 7.2% experienced acute cardiac injury, alongside other complications associated with the disease. Published reports have highlighted instances of acute onset heart failure, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, and cardiac arrest. Furthermore, cases of myocardial damage characterized by elevated troponin I levels, acute cardiac damage, shock, and arrhythmia were also documented.
During the acute phase of severe viral conditions, such as COVID-19 and other Coronavirus illnesses, patients may exhibit symptoms including tachycardia, hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and even sudden death. Abnormal results on electrocardiograms and elevated troponin levels indicate myocardial involvement, often in the form of myocarditis.
Cohort studies published thus far have reported rates of acute heart failure, shock, and arrhythmia at 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7%, respectively. The cardiovascular implications stem from a discrepancy between the heightened metabolic and inflammatory demands induced by the virus and the diminished cardiac reserve. The inflammatory milieu increases susceptibility to thrombotic events. Consequently, the current suggestion is to uphold patients' chronic medications, with any alterations or substitutions being evaluated on an individual basis and in alignment with existing guidelines. It is important to acknowledge that as ongoing studies unfold, new recommendations may surface.
Chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular conditions, exhibit commonalities with infectious diseases in terms of standardized states such as a pro-inflammatory environment and compromised innate immune responses. For instance, diabetes is linked to the activation of innate immune cells in metabolic tissues, resulting in the secretion of inflammatory mediators like IL-1β and TNFα, which contribute to insulin resistance and harm to β cells. Additionally, metabolic imbalances can suppress immune function, impacting the roles of macrophages and lymphocytes, potentially heightening individuals' vulnerability to COVID-19 complications and exacerbations.
A significant proportion of elderly patients who develop severe illness often present with pre-existing conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases, kidney diseases, or malignant tumors. These individuals typically succumb to their pre-existing comorbidities rather than the immediate effects of COVID-19. Hence, it is imperative to meticulously evaluate and take into account all pre-existing comorbidities when devising individualized treatment strategies for patients with COVID-19.
Additional research indicates that respiratory failure exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2 is attributed to extensive alveolar injury. The virus demonstrates the ability to invade human respiratory epithelial cells by engaging the viral S protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in human cells. While existing literature suggests that severe lung infections may impact the extended prognosis of individuals with heart conditions, there remains a lack of data confirming whether patients who have recuperated from COVID-19 will endure lasting consequences.
COVID-19, beyond its known association with pneumonia, has been identified as a potential instigator of damage to various organs, ultimately leading to fatalities resulting from multiple organ failure, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, arrhythmias, and kidney failure. It is imperative to closely monitor the potential harm to multiple organs and prioritize protective and preventive measures in the management of COVID-19. For critically ill patients, essential protective interventions encompass mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoids, antivirals, symptomatic treatments, and shock therapy.
Another crucial consideration involves the methodology used to gauge a virus's transmissibility, often done through the calculation of its reproductive number (R0). This metric serves as an indicator of the virus's attack rate, quantifying the number of secondary infections stemming from a single infected individual within a susceptible population. Initial investigations indicated that the novel coronavirus linked to COVID-19 could be linked to R0 values ranging from 1.5 to 3.5, with the latest findings proposing an R0 of 4.08, meaning that, on average, each case would lead to the infection of four new individuals.
Given its high potential for dissemination and the fact that it is an RNA virus transmitted through respiratory droplets or contact, it is imperative to enhance and implement hygiene measures. These include washing hands with soap and water to disrupt the virus's morphological structure, utilizing 70% alcohol-based hand sanitizers, practicing proper cough and sneeze etiquette to contain viral particles, steering clear of crowded spaces, and opting for well-ventilated environments.
Based on existing literature, the average incubation period for the coronavirus is typically around 5 days, although there have been instances where this period can extend up to 12 days. Initial findings regarding SARS-CoV-2 indicate that transmission could potentially take place even in the absence of noticeable signs and symptoms.
In cases without complications, symptoms typically include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, with additional possibilities of a runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, and diarrhea. It is noteworthy that a significant proportion of those infected, approximately 80%, remain asymptomatic and naturally recover without the need for specific medical interventions. However, about one-sixth of patients may experience severe progression of the illness, characterized by respiratory difficulties.
Given the present circumstances, it is imperative for individuals to act responsibly by remaining at home, regardless of whether they exhibit symptoms, in order to mitigate the spread of infection and slow down community transmission. This collective effort is crucial to ensure that the healthcare system can effectively cater to all those in need. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in overwhelming the healthcare infrastructure, potentially resulting in fatalities among the most vulnerable. Individuals who are required to venture out for essential reasons, such as work or unavoidable circumstances, must rigorously adhere to preventive measures to minimize the risk of transmission.
Slowing the spread of the virus to ensure a gradual increase in cases, rather than sudden peaks, is a key strategy in flattening the epidemic curve and preventing the collapse of the public health system, ultimately reducing mortality rates (see Figure 1). Controlled transmission of the disease alleviates strain on healthcare facilities, enhancing their ability to cater to not only COVID-19 patients but also individuals in need of medical attention for other conditions.
Staying at home is a crucial measure aimed at reducing the transmission of respiratory infections, including those caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19). By adhering to these preventive measures, individuals can effectively prevent the spread of respiratory secretions from an infected person to others. It is imperative that individuals who have tested positive for the virus or are suspected of being infected strictly adhere to the directive to stay at home.
Ideally, the individual should be situated in a private bedroom or a room temporarily designated as a sleeping area, preferably with an attached private bathroom. The bedroom doors should remain closed at all times, while ensuring that windows are open to facilitate adequate ventilation. The patient should limit their exit from this isolated space to essential circumstances.
Hence, social isolation and preventive measures are crucial in averting the infection of the elderly and exacerbation of preexisting conditions, thereby preventing complications in their health status that could potentially result in fatal outcomes. In situations where diseases spread rapidly, healthcare services become overwhelmed, leading to shortages in essential resources such as beds, masks, medical personnel, ventilators, and other necessary equipment for patient care. This strain on the healthcare system is not exclusive to COVID-19 but extends to any other illness that necessitates medical attention, emphasizing the importance of preventing system collapse.
The authors concur that individuals at a heightened risk of developing the most severe form of the condition, potentially resulting in fatality, primarily consist of the elderly and those with prevalent comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases.
The critical factor lies not in the severity of the disease per se, but in the capacity to provide adequate care for all those afflicted when the need arises. By flattening the transmission curve gradually, the strain on the healthcare system diminishes, increasing the chances of meeting the demands of the epidemic. This underscores the significance of social isolation as a preventive measure in curbing the spread of the disease and safeguarding the integrity of the nation's healthcare infrastructure.
