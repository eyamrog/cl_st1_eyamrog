Microorganisms are increasingly developing resistance to conventional chemical disinfectants, necessitating a shift towards natural alternatives. This study sought to assess the disinfectant efficacy of Libidibia ferrea leaf extracts and decoctions on various surfaces. Two extraction methods, decoction and hydroalcoholic extraction, were evaluated using the Kirby and Bauer diffusion disk technique, growth curve analysis, acceptability tests with the population, and surface testing. Results indicated sensitivity to the decoction among S. aureus and E. faecalis strains, while the extract showed sensitivity in S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Micrococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., and S. Typhimurium in the diffusion disk test. A decrease in bacterial load was observed in the growth curve analysis, with reduced absorbance values after 24 hours for E. coli, E. faecalis, Micrococcus spp., and K. pneumoniae at a concentration of 100 mg/mL for both the decoction and extract. Surface testing also demonstrated a reduction in bacterial load across all tested strains, suggesting that L. ferrea could serve as an effective alternative disinfectant.
Microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibit adaptability to diverse environments and can be readily disseminated by humans through food consumption. Furthermore, these microorganisms have the potential to be dispersed in various settings including the environment, air, dust, and sewage water. It is widely acknowledged that microorganisms are increasingly developing resistance to commonly employed chemical disinfectants, either due to their improper application or disposal, or through mechanisms such as biofilm formation or resistance transfer (DOLAN; COSTERTON, 2002).
Therefore, it is imperative to replace these products with natural alternatives that exhibit lower toxicity levels, are more economically feasible, and are readily accessible to the general population (Volkart, Spagiari, & Bizzani, 2017; Nóbrega, Dantas, & Silva, 2010). One such plant species commonly utilized is Libidibia ferrea (Fabaceae), native to the Caatinga biome and found from the Northeast to the South of Brazil, known colloquially as Pau-ferro, Pau-caí, or Jucá (Mota, Ferreira, & Imaña, 2012). Libidibia ferrea boasts a wide array of medicinal properties, including antifungal, antibacterial, antiulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-flu, antitussive, anti-asthmatic, antianemia, antidiarrheal, anticoagulant, analgesic, and wound-healing effects. Additionally, it serves as a larvicide against Aedes aegypti and is recommended for animal feed in sheep and goat farming, particularly prevalent in rural regions due to food scarcity (Gomes et al., 2017; Moreira & Oliveira, 2017; Reis et al., 2017; Pereira et al., 2016; Hassan et al., 2015; Freitas et al., 2015; Magalhães et al., 2014; Vásquez, Mendonça, & Noda, 2014; Lima et al., 2012; Vasconcelos et al., 2011).
Further investigation is warranted to fully understand the disinfectant properties of Libidibia ferrea. Therefore, this study seeks to assess the efficacy of both the extract and decoction of Libidibia ferrea leaves as disinfectants on various surfaces.
Microbiological analyses and decoction production of Libidibia ferrea leaves were conducted at the Veterinary Microbiology Laboratory (LAMIV) of Universidade Federal do Semi-Árido (UFERSA). The examination of phytochemical compounds and the extraction of hydroalcoholic extracts from Libidibia ferrea leaves were carried out at the Chromatography Laboratory of Universidade Estadual do Rio Grande do Norte (UERN).
Microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus spp., and Corynebacterium spp. (LAMIV) isolated from the environment, along with standard strains such as Staphylococcus aureus (American Type Culture Collection - ATCC 25923), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 13813), Salmonella Typhimurium (ATCC 14028), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 700603) were utilized in this study.
100 grams of leaves from L. ferrea were utilized for decoction by depositing them in a container with 200 mL of distilled water. Subsequently, they were boiled in a water bath for 15 minutes to yield 200 mL of decoction, resulting in a concentration of 1:2 (LEONEZ et al., 2018). For the hydroalcoholic extract production, the leaves were shredded, weighed, and placed in an amber glass container identified appropriately. This container was then immersed in a hydroalcoholic solvent solution (70% ethanol) for seven days, with agitation every 24 hours. Following the immersion period, the mixture underwent vacuum filtration and was subsequently evaporated in a water bath at a temperature of 50 ± ºC.
Microorganisms with a concentration of 1.5 × 108 UFC/mL were found to be equivalent to pattern 5 on McFarland’s scale and were subsequently cultured in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth at 37ºC. Utilizing five microdilution plates, each containing 96 wells (ALAMAR®, Diadema, São Paulo, Brazil), the growth of each microorganism was assessed in triplicate at concentrations of 100 mg/mL from both the extract and decoction. Additionally, positive control was established using an alcoholic solution of chlorhexidine (CP) at 0.5%, while a negative control was maintained with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
The methodology proposed by Engel et al. (2017 was modified to assess the surface disinfectant effects on plastic, steel, and ceramic surfaces. These surfaces were first washed and sterilized before being exposed to an inoculum at a concentration of approximately 108 UFC/mL for 30 minutes to facilitate biofilm formation. Subsequently, disinfectant solutions were sprayed at a concentration of 100 mg/mL, along with a control product, for a duration of 15 minutes within a 1 cm3 area. Following this, samples were collected using a sterilized swab, and the quantification of microorganisms was carried out using the plate count technique (TORTORA; FUNKE; CASE, 2012).
Fifty judges from the traditional rural communities of Mossoró/RN were randomly selected to conduct an acceptability test on the efficacy of a L. ferrea-based disinfectant at a concentration of 100 mg/mL, as observed in the in vitro test (PAGANI et al., 2015). Utilizing a hedonic scale adapted from Pagani et al. (2015) and Beserra et al. (2003), the judges evaluated two surfaces: one treated with the conventional disinfectant and the other with the disinfectant derived from jucá leaves. Each judge received a form containing a sensory evaluation, utilizing a nine-point scale ranging from "extremely liked" to "extremely disliked" for each assessed attribute (aroma, color, texture, and surface aspect).
Data were presented as mean values ± standard deviation and frequency (%) using the SigmaPlot program (Systat Software, Inc.), version 12.0. Following an assessment of parametric assumptions and statistical variances among the experimental groups across different variables, a comparative analysis was conducted between the microorganisms and the decoction and extract, as well as among the various concentrations applied to both the decoction and extract, utilizing one-way ANOVA and one-way ANOVA repeated measures (RM) followed by Turkey’s test, respectively. Nonparametric data underwent testing through Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests. The statistical differences in sensorial analysis scores between groups were determined using Wilcoxon’s test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
The results of the diffusion tests in wells using the decoction and hydroalcoholic extract from C. ferrea leaves against the bacteria are presented in Tables 1 and 2. It was observed that the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis exhibited sensitivity at a concentration of 100 mg/mL to the decoction of C. ferrea, showing halos of 10 mm and 10.67 mm, respectively. As noted by Thomazi, Bertolin, and Pinto (2010), these values were deemed satisfactory, as they were considered sensitive for halos equal to or greater than 10 mm.
The results from the L. ferrea extract (Table 2) indicate that the strains of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae did not exhibit satisfactory inhibition halos. However, the decoction, when used at concentrations of 100, 50, 25, and 12.5 mg/mL, effectively inhibited the growth of E. faecalis strains, with the highest concentration showing statistical similarity to the positive control. These findings can be attributed to the simpler cell wall composition of Gram-positive microbial agents compared to Gram-negative bacteria. It is important to note the promise of these results, as the decoction method of L. ferrea is straightforward and has the potential to reduce the presence of these microorganisms on tool surfaces.
The decoction was found to be ineffective in inhibiting the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosas, and Salmonella Typhimurium. These bacterial strains, all Gram-negative, possess cell wall structures such as the outer membrane, which is comprised of lipids and lipopolysaccharides (Tortora, Funke, & Case, 2012). It is plausible that the presence of these components in the outer membrane could impede the penetration of hydrophilic molecules found in the decoction, thus rendering it ineffective against these particular pathogens.
Table 3 presents the growth curve results using the hydroalcoholic extract and decoction of L. ferrea against strains exhibiting sensitivity at the optimal concentration of 100 mg/mL, as determined by the well diffusion technique. In the decoction, a reduction in absorbance value of 0.24 was observed for the E. feacalis strain, while S. aureus showed a decrease of 0.07, although not statistically significant. The extract demonstrated a decrease in bacterial numbers based on absorbance after 24 hours, with a notable difference in the absorbance value of 0.36 for P. aeruginosa strains. Despite an increase in absorbance values for Corynebacterium spp., E. feacalis, and Salmonella Typhimurium by 0.06, 0.03, and 0.14, respectively, these differences were not statistically significant compared to the positive control.
The findings suggest that the hydroalcoholic extract exhibited a more potent effect compared to the decoction, as evidenced by lower absorbance values after 24 hours and its ability to inhibit the growth and development of microorganisms such as P. aeruginosas and Salmonella Typhimurium. A comparison of results across the different microorganisms revealed a significantly lower bacterial load, indicating a statistical distinction between them.
Variations in antimicrobial activity may arise from differences in extraction methods, with certain extracts containing molecules capable of penetrating the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria but not Gram-positive bacteria (Duffy & Power, 2001). Alternatively, these variations could be attributed to phytochemical compounds in the extract exhibiting higher bioactivity against Gram-negative bacteria due to their greater affinity for the lipid structure of their membranes. This phenomenon was observed by Engel et al. (2017), who found that strains of Salmonella were more susceptible to disinfectants containing carvacrol and thymol compared to strains of S. aureus.
A reduction in UFC/mL/cm2 was observed across all tested microorganisms (Table 4). Bacterial reduction of the extract and decoction showed statistical significance in all tested strains compared to the negative control on all surfaces, except for Salmonella Typhimurium in relation to steel. These findings align with those reported by Oliveira et al. (2017). Effective disinfectants must possess the ability to destroy or inactivate pathogenic organisms efficiently, within a reasonable timeframe, while maintaining a favorable cost-benefit ratio. Additionally, they should offer ease and safety in transport, storage, handling, and application.
The results detailing the assessment of the disinfectant's acceptability based on variables such as smell, color, texture, and surface aspect (cleanliness and brightness) are presented in Table 5. Across all criteria, the disinfectant derived from L. ferrea leaves exhibited higher acceptability, particularly in terms of aroma, with a frequency of acceptance reaching 83.6%. Notably, there is a lack of documented natural products used as disinfectants in terms of acceptability. Nevertheless, Teixeira and Becker (2017) argue that the most effective product for surface disinfection and sanitation is 70% alcohol, which is as potent as sodium hypochlorite when in contact for a minimum of 10 minutes.
The decoction and extract of L. ferrea present themselves as promising alternatives for disinfection purposes, given their demonstrated antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Furthermore, these substances exhibit efficacy in reducing bacterial loads on tested surfaces, making them a viable option for disinfection protocols. Additionally, their high level of acceptance among users further supports their potential as efficient disinfectants.
