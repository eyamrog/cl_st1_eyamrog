The induction of autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been a subject of research, with a focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms. Studies have proposed that the presence of inflammatory cytokines during HCV infection could potentially alter the signaling cascade of thyroperoxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg), thereby contributing to the development of autoimmune thyroid disease.

Objective: This study aims to elucidate the signaling pathway involving thrombopoietin (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg), as well as their potential targets, in mediating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in individuals with hepatitis C.
Methods: The signaling pathway was elucidated through a comprehensive review study approach and was meticulously mapped using the automatic annotation server provided by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). PathVisio, a freely available software tool tailored for the analysis and visualization of open-source pathways, was employed for the graphical representation of the intricate signaling cascade.
Results: The contigs were retrieved from the KEGG database, and their transcription mapping illustrates the signaling pathway of key biomolecules that initiate AIT. The presence of autoantibodies against TPO and Tg characterizes AIT, which can be triggered by the action of HCV or its treatment. Within AIT, autoreactive CD4+ T lymphocytes play a role in recruiting B cells and CD8+ T cells to the thyroid. As the disease progresses, it culminates in the death of thyroid cells and the development of hypothyroidism.
In conclusion, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) or its treatment triggers various signaling pathways that lead to damage in thyroid cells, ultimately causing Autoimmune Thyroiditis (AIT) and secondary hypothyroidism through cellular apoptosis.
A signaling pathway, also known as a signal transduction cascade, refers to the aggregation of molecules within a cell that regulates one or multiple functions aimed at protecting the cell from damage.
The thyroid hormone operates within a complex signaling pathway that is tightly regulated, primarily through tissue-specific expression in thyroid cells, and involves intricate interactions with other signaling pathways. One key enzyme in this process is thyroid peroxidase (TPO), which, along with thyroglobulin (Tg), plays a crucial role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones.
Autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) is distinguished by lymphocytic infiltrates leading to the gradual destruction of thyroid follicles and the production of antithyroglobulin and antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab).
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is linked to endocrine-metabolic disorders, including autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). Research indicates that HCV therapy can trigger thyroid diseases, with female gender, positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab), and high levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) being significant risk factors for AIT development. It is proposed that the increased interleukin levels resulting from HCV-induced inflammation may disrupt the signaling pathways of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg), ultimately leading to autoimmune thyroid disease.
In this study, we elucidate the signaling pathway of Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) and Thyroglobulin (Tg), along with their potential targets for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-mediated Autoimmune Thyroiditis (AIT), through a comprehensive review of existing literature.
In our search for signaling pathways, we rely on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway as a primary reference. KEGG serves as a comprehensive database containing maps of biological interactions, cellular processes, and pathways associated with signal transduction. It aids in the comprehension of cellular functions based on molecular-level information.
PathVisio (version 3.2.4) is a freely available software designed for the visualization of biological pathways and the creation of open-source routes. It was utilized in this study for the graphical depiction of the signaling pathway due to its capability to display and edit biological signaling pathways effectively.
A succinct depiction of the signaling pathway involving TPO and Tg, along with their potential targets in hepatitis C virus-induced autoimmune thyroiditis, has been constructed according to a defined set of confidence criteria. This map can be accessed at www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05320.
The relationships between all molecules discussed in the reviewed literature were elucidated. In cases where the interactions of certain molecules were not specified in the literature, the KEGG database was consulted to identify these unknown connections.
To initiate the design of the signaling pathway, a schematic overview encompassing all pathway maps for both HCV and AIT was first created. This initial overview served as the foundation for delving into specific pathways, allowing for a systematic extension of the drawing by incorporating additional linked pathways in a step-by-step manner.
The Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) serves as an etiological factor in autoimmune thyroiditis due to its potential to infect thyroid follicular cells. This infection triggers CD8+ T-cell responses to HCV antigens displayed on the cell membrane, a process induced by the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens DR or through the non-specific secretion of interleukin production. It is hypothesized that the HCV could disrupt immune regulatory signaling pathways, thereby facilitating the onset of autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), as illustrated in Figure 1.
It has been postulated that individuals with a genetic predisposition to autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) who are exposed to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection may be at risk of developing thyroiditis. HCV is known to be a virus that affects both the liver and lymphatic system, leading to various hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations, including a range of autoimmune, lymphoproliferative, and neoplastic disorders. In this study, we elucidate the signaling pathway involving Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) and Thyroglobulin (Tg), highlighting their potential as targets in the context of HCV-mediated AIT.
The breakdown of immune tolerance in chronic HCV infection is attributed to a deficiency in regulatory T-cells with suppressive function. The cytotoxic T-cells antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is essential for maintaining self-tolerance, ultimately leading to the initiation of a primary autoimmune response.
The HCV infection has the potential to induce thyroid cell damage in genetically predisposed individuals through an immune response, characterized by a non-specific release of TNF-a. This leads to an upregulation of MHC class expression on the cell membrane, causing these cells to mimic antigen-presenting cells (APC) and consequently triggering an increased production of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg). Consequently, in the initial phase, there is an aggregation of MHC class II positive APCs in the thyroid, presenting thyroid-specific autoantigens to T-cells, resulting in clonal expansion and the full maturation of autoreactive T and B lymphocytes.
The antigens produced by HCV interact with membrane T-cell receptors (TCR), leading to T-cell activation and increased expression of the CTLA-4 molecule, which shares homology with CD28. CTLA-4 acts as a competitive inhibitor to CD28 and serves as a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Furthermore, an elevated level of CTLA-4 can impede early T-cell activation by obstructing the interaction between CD80/CD86 and the co-stimulatory receptor CD28. The heightened expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80/86, resulting from the transportation of MHC molecules to the cell surface, is a well-established phenomenon during an immune response.
The CD4+ T-cells play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of AIT. Following the recognition of autoantigens by lymphocytes, there is a marked escalation in the generation of autoreactive CD4+ T-cells due to excessive stimulation, alongside the production of immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells.
A recent study demonstrated that the HCV envelope protein E2 elicits robust inflammatory reactions in thyroid cells, leading to the secretion of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Additionally, the E2 protein triggers the synthesis of other proteins such as HSP60, HSP70p12A, and HSP10 in primary thyrocytes.
Th1 cells play a crucial role in autoimmune inflammatory reactions by stimulating antigen-presenting cells and releasing cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. On the other hand, Th2 cells contribute to the production of autoantibodies and secrete cytokines like IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10. The direction of the immune response towards Th1 or Th2 cells is determined by the TCR affinity. Consequently, the fate of thyroid cells, whether they are preserved or undergo apoptosis, is influenced by the actions of Th1 or Th2 cells. In autoimmune thyroiditis, the initial apoptosis of thyroid cells is mediated by Th1 cells through cytokine-regulated apoptotic pathways and the activation of death receptors on the cell surface.
B-cells have the ability to internalize antigens by binding them to their B-cell receptors (BCR) and incorporating them into the MHC II molecule. When antigen concentrations are low, B cells act as efficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs), capturing antigens with antigen-specific BCRs and focusing the immune response on a particular antigen. In contrast, macrophages and dendritic cells primarily use pinocytosis to capture antigens.
The autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) is characterized by the accumulation of immune cells in the thyroid gland, which contributes to disease progression. This accumulation occurs due to central tolerance mechanisms that lead to the accumulation of self-reactive T cells in the thyroid. These cells alter the site of immunoregulation through the secretion of lymphokines or cytolysis. Additionally, thyroid disorders caused by HCV infection result in increased CXCL10 expression in thyroid cells. This leads to the grouping of Th1 lymphocytes within the gland, triggering the onset of AIT in individuals with risk factors or predispositions.
The Fas (CD95, TNF receptor superfamily member 6) is a membrane receptor that belongs to the TNF-α family of death receptors, playing a crucial role in mediating T-cell responses and T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity through mechanisms involving Fas-dependent cytotoxicity and perforin/GZMB. The interaction between Fas and its ligand among thyrocytes is implicated in promoting the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroiditis by inducing apoptotic cell death.
The activation of complement in antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity involves the transportation of antibodies to target cells, including those targeting thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) through IgG mediation. However, it is important to note that there may be additional, unidentified antibody-antigen complexes that play a role in the destruction of thyroid cells.
The data suggest that HCV infection contributes to the breakdown of immune tolerance, leading to thyroid cell damage caused by auto-antigens released against TPO and Tg. This process involves the activation of multiple signaling pathways, ultimately resulting in autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) and secondary hypothyroidism through cellular apoptosis.
