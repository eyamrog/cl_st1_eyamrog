We aimed to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 in Colombia and Peru. A secondary analysis was conducted using a database generated by the University of Maryland and Facebook, Inc. The study included adult Facebook users aged 18 and over residing in Latin America and the Caribbean who responded to the survey between May 20 and November 5, 2021. Various factors such as sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, mental health, economic and food insecurity, compliance with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, and vaccination practices were considered. Crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios with their respective 95% confidence intervals were estimated. The sample consisted of 44,678 adults from Colombia and 24,302 from Peru. The prevalence of parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 was 7.41% (n=3,274) for Colombia and 6.64% (n=1,464) for Peru. In Colombia, factors such as age above 35, compliance with physical distancing and mask usage, economic insecurity, anxiety symptoms, chronic conditions, and vaccination status were associated with a lower prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate. In Peru, factors such as gender, compliance with physical distancing and mask usage, economic insecurity, anxiety symptoms, chronic conditions, history of COVID-19, and vaccination status were associated with a higher probability of vaccinating children. Additionally, living in a town, village, or rural area was linked to a higher prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate. Overall, the vast majority of parents in Colombia and Peru intend to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, with similar and varying factors influencing this intention across regions within each country.
Approximately 90% of parents in Colombia and Peru express their intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19.
In Colombia, individuals aged between 35 and 54 who adhere to physical distancing measures, consistently wear masks, experience economic insecurity, exhibit symptoms of anxiety and comorbidities, and have received the COVID-19 vaccine were found to have a higher likelihood of vaccinating their children against the virus.
In Peru, factors such as being female, adhering to social distancing measures, wearing a mask, experiencing economic and food insecurity, having comorbidities, being vaccinated, and having previously contracted COVID-19 were linked to a reduced likelihood of lacking the intention to vaccinate children. Conversely, residing in a town or rural setting was associated with a higher inclination towards not vaccinating.
While there is widespread support for COVID-19 vaccination, it is imperative for health authorities in each country to tailor their strategies to the specific context in order to effectively meet the objectives of vaccination campaigns within different population groups.
The most cost-effective approach to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic involves achieving global vaccination coverage of at least 70 to 90% (1). COVID-19 vaccines are not only safe but have also demonstrated efficacy in reducing hospitalizations, the need for ventilation, healthcare costs, mortality rates, and viral transmission (2â€“5). Initially, there was controversy surrounding vaccinating children due to the lower incidence, severity, and limited spread of the disease in this age group; however, it is now deemed crucial for attaining herd immunity (6). Ensuring a safe return to in-person schooling, preventing severe cases in children, and mitigating long-term effects like post-COVID-19 syndrome are also imperative (7).
In October 2021, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for the BioNTech vaccine in children aged 5 to 11 (8). While ongoing surveillance and monitoring persist, the vaccine has shown to be both safe and effective within this age group (9). However, global investigations have indicated that misinformation propagated by the media has resulted in vaccine hesitancy among some parents (10,11), casting doubt on the safety and efficacy of these vaccines (12).
While 9 out of 10 parents in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) express an intention to vaccinate their children, there exist factors linked to the reluctance to vaccinate. This positive inclination towards vaccination is noteworthy, especially in a region characterized by high levels of misinformation and poor adherence to pandemic control measures. Nonetheless, the intention to vaccinate varies across different regions within each country, with unique factors tied to social determinants and healthcare systems influencing this decision-making process.
Variations exist among the regions of Peru regarding the willingness of the adult population to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, particularly lower rates observed among older adults. A study conducted in Colombia revealed a lower acceptance of vaccination among adults compared to the Peruvian population, with significant regional disparities akin to those in Peru. These findings indicate that vaccination intentions differ across countries based on sociodemographic factors and age. Additionally, factors such as fear, socioeconomic status, and institutional circumstances may also play a role in influencing vaccination compliance.
Some studies have assessed vaccination intentions in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries, yet variations within these nations necessitate tailored strategies for achieving sufficient coverage among children and adolescents. Consequently, this study aims to examine the factors influencing vaccination intentions for children and adolescents in Peru and Colombia, as well as the disparities in these intentions across various regions within these two countries.
A secondary analysis was conducted utilizing a database jointly created by the University of Maryland and Facebook, Inc. The survey, designed by both institutions, aimed to evaluate various aspects including sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, mental health, economic and food insecurity, adherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies, and attitudes towards vaccination against the disease. Commencing on April 23, 2020, the survey has been administered daily across more than 200 countries, with questions presented in the primary language of the respective region. The sampling process involved the random selection of participants from daily Facebook users aged 18 and above in specific regions and countries. Participants were randomly chosen based on a recalculated sampling frame, with replacements sought if a user declined participation. Each participant was allowed to respond to the survey only once within an eight-week period. This survey has been utilized in prior research endeavors and a detailed description of the survey methodology can be found elsewhere.

In this study, we focused on adult Facebook users aged 18 and above residing in the Latin America and Caribbean region who participated in the survey from May 20 to November 5, 2021. Participants who lacked the variables of interest, did not have children, identified as non-binary, or were over 54 years old were excluded from the analysis. The exclusion of participants over 54 years old was aimed at minimizing the likelihood of including individuals who were not solely parents of children under 18, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Outcome Variable: The outcome variable examined in this study pertained to parents' lack of intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19.
In our study, we assessed parental attitudes towards vaccinating their children and adolescents against COVID-19 through a survey question that inquired: "Will you opt to have your child or children receive a COVID-19 vaccine once they are eligible?" This question presented respondents with four response options: "yes, definitely," "yes, probably," "no, probably not," and "no, definitely not." Following this, we categorized the variable into two groups, with the first two responses indicating a positive intention from parents to vaccinate their children and adolescents, while the latter two responses were classified as non-intention.
The study incorporated various sociodemographic variables, each with specific survey questions and corresponding categories: gender (question: What is your gender?; categories: male, female), age (question: What is your age?; categories: 18 to 24 years, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 to 54), educational level (question: What is the highest level of education that you have completed?; categories: university post-graduate degree completed/university completed/college/pre-university, secondary school completed/high school (or equivalent) completed, primary school completed/less than primary school/no formal schooling), and area of residence (question: Which of the following best describes the area where you currently live?; categories: city, town, village or rural area). For the purpose of this study, a town was defined as a populated area with fixed boundaries and local self-government; a city was described as an important or large town; and a village was characterized as a cluster of houses and other structures, typically in rural settings and smaller than a town.
Participants were asked to self-report various comorbidities based on whether they had been diagnosed by a healthcare professional. These included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, emphysema, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, compromised immune system, heart attack, other heart diseases, and obesity. A binary variable was then created to categorize participants based on the presence or absence of comorbidities.
In our study, we incorporated self-reported data on smoking status (yes or no), history of COVID-19 infection (yes or no), and COVID-19 vaccination status (yes or no).
The community mitigation strategies examined in this study encompassed physical distancing and mask usage within the preceding seven days. Physical distancing was operationalized as a participant's deliberate effort to minimize contact with others at some point during the specified period (as assessed by the survey question: "In the past 7 days, how often did you intentionally avoid contact with other people?"). Furthermore, mask use was characterized by a participant's reported habit of wearing a mask in public at least once during the same seven-day timeframe (as indicated by the survey question: "In the past 7 days, how often did you wear a mask when in public?").
Food insecurity was evaluated using a survey question that inquired about concerns regarding having enough food in the upcoming week. Respondents could choose from four options: very worried, somewhat worried, not too worried, and not worried at all. For the purpose of this study, the first three responses were categorized as indicative of food insecurity.
In this research, economic insecurity was operationalized through a survey question that inquired about participants' concerns regarding their household finances in the upcoming month. Respondents were presented with four response options: "very worried," "somewhat worried," "not too worried," and "not worried at all." For the purpose of this study, economic insecurity was characterized by the first three responses, indicating varying degrees of apprehension regarding financial stability in the near future.
In our study, anxiety symptoms were assessed through a survey question that inquired: "During the last seven days, how often did you feel so nervous that nothing could calm you down?" This question is a component of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), which offers respondents five response options: all the time, most of the time, some of the time, a little of the time, and none of the time. To simplify our analysis, we categorized the variable by grouping the first four response options together to indicate the presence of anxiety symptoms.
In our study, we assessed depressive symptoms by utilizing a survey question that inquired about the frequency of feeling so depressed that nothing could provide solace within the preceding seven days. This particular question is a component of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and offers respondents five response options: all the time, most of the time, some of the time, a little of the time, and none of the time. To simplify our analysis, we categorized the variable by grouping the first four response options together to indicate the presence of depressive symptoms.
The databases were downloaded in Microsoft Excel 2016Â® format and subsequently imported into the statistical software Stata/SEÂ® version 17.0 (StataCorp, TX, USA). Following this, a statistical analysis was conducted, taking into account the complex sampling design of the survey and utilizing the svy command for appropriate analysis.
A descriptive analysis was conducted using absolute frequencies and weighted proportions along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The Chi-square test with Rao-Scott correction was employed for the bivariate analysis between independent variables and parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19. Two generalized linear models, both crude and adjusted, of the Poisson family with a logarithmic link function were utilized to determine the factors associated with parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19. Prevalence ratios, both crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR), were estimated alongside their respective 95% confidence intervals. Adjustment for confounders was conducted following an epidemiological approach based on previous studies, after assessing collinearity among associated factors in the final adjusted model. The potential collinearity of factors in the final adjusted model was evaluated. A significance level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant across all analyses.
All participants provided informed consent prior to participating in the survey. This study conducted an analysis on a secondary database that gathered data without any identifying information, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the participants. Access to this database was not publicly available; the authors of this study gained entry through a formal agreement signed with the University of Maryland.
We conducted an analysis on a sample comprising 44,678 adults from Colombia and 24,302 adults from Peru, as illustrated in Figure 1.
In the Columbia study sample, 55.44% were female, 33.19% were between 35 to 44 years old, 53% had completed secondary education or less, 60.88% lived in a city, and 10.78% reported smoking. In terms of prevention measures, 89.45% and 92.27% had adhered to physical distancing and the use of masks, respectively. Food insecurity was reported by 72.49%, while 86.61% reported experiencing economic insecurity. Furthermore, 35.82% and 42.51% reported experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Among the participants, 65.27% did not report comorbidities, 47.53% had not yet been vaccinated against COVID-19, and 35.79% had previously contracted the virus. In Colombia, the prevalence of parents expressing a lack of intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 was 7.41% (Table 1).
In Colombia, the areas exhibiting the highest prevalence of parental non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 were Amazonas (14.95%), Putumayo (13.72%), and Vichada (12.96%). Conversely, regions with the lowest prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 included VaupÃ©s (0%), San AndrÃ©s and Providencia (0.27%), and Bolivar (5.33%) as illustrated in Figure 2a.
Statistically significant differences were observed across various factors including age, level of education, compliance with physical distancing and mask usage, economic insecurity, anxiety symptoms, presence of comorbidities, and vaccination status as outlined in Table 2.
In the adjusted regression model, it was observed that age groups ranging from 35 to 44 years old (aPR=0.77; 95%CI: 0.66-0.90; p=0.001) and 45 to 54 years old (aPR=0.78; 95%CI: 0.65-0.95; p=0.012) exhibited a reduced prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 in comparison to the age group of 18 to 24 years. Similarly, adherence to physical distancing (aPR=0.55; 95%CI: 0.49-0.61; p<0.001), mask usage (aPR=0.71; 95%CI: 0.65-0.78; p<0.001), economic instability (aPR=0.72; 95%CI: 0.65-0.89; p<0.001), and anxiety symptoms (aPR=0.87; 95%CI: 0.79-0.95; p=0.003) were linked to a decreased prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19. Furthermore, the presence of one or more comorbidities (aPR=0.83; 95%CI: 0.75-0.91; p<0.001) and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (aPR=0.17; 95%CI: 0.15-0.20; p<0.001) were also associated with a lower prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19, as outlined in Table 3.
In the Peruvian sample, 52.81% were female, 33.01% were between 35 to 44 years old, 51.48% had completed at least a full university post-graduate degree, 75.98% resided in urban areas, and 11.39% reported a history of smoking. Moreover, 90.39% and 93.94% adhered to physical distancing and mask-wearing guidelines, respectively. The study revealed that 76.26% experienced food insecurity, while 89.95% faced economic insecurity. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were prevalent in 42.31% and 50.01% of participants, respectively, with 62.81% reporting no comorbidities. Additionally, 53.71% had not received the COVID-19 vaccine, and 45.91% had previously contracted the virus. The data indicated that 6.64% of parents expressed reluctance to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 (see Table 1).
In Peru, the regions exhibiting the highest rates of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 were Moquegua (13.73%), Madre de Dios (13.65%), and Puno (11.83%). Conversely, regions with lower rates of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 included Pasco (4.10%), Lima (4.82%), and Piura (5.03%) as illustrated in Figure 2b.
Statistically significant differences were observed between the independent variables and parental intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19, with the exception of smoking (p=0.797) as shown in Table 2.
In the adjusted regression model, it was observed that female gender (aPR=0.81; 95% CI: 0.71-0.93; p=0.002) exhibited a lower prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 compared to male gender. Similarly, factors such as compliance with physical distancing (aPR=0.45; 95% CI: 0.39-0.52; p<0.001), use of masks (aPR=0.71; 95% CI: 0.65-0.90; p=0.005), economic insecurity (aPR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.59-0.75; p<0.001), and anxiety symptoms (aPR=0.82; 95% CI: 0.70-0.97; p=0.020) were associated with a decreased prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19. Furthermore, having one or more comorbidities (aRP=0.74; 95% CI: 0.63-0.86; p<0.001), being vaccinated against COVID-19 (aPR=0.24; 95% CI: 0.20-0.28; p<0.001), and having previously had COVID-19 (aPR=0.83; 95% CI: 0.73-0.94; p=0.006) were also linked to a reduced prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19. Conversely, residing in a town (aPR=1.16; 95% CI: 1.00-1.35; p=0.048) or in a village/rural area (aPR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.26-1.80; p<0.001) as opposed to living in a city was associated with a higher prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 (Table 3).
Our primary findings indicate that approximately 90% of parents in Colombia and Peru express an intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19. In Colombia, factors such as being aged between 35 and 54, adhering to physical distancing measures, consistently using masks, experiencing economic insecurity, displaying symptoms of anxiety, having comorbidities, and being vaccinated were correlated with a higher likelihood of vaccinating children against COVID-19. Conversely, in Peru, being female, adhering to social distancing guidelines, consistently using masks, facing economic and food insecurity, having comorbidities, being vaccinated, and having previously contracted COVID-19 were associated with a reduced likelihood of not intending to vaccinate children. Conversely, residing in a town or rural area was linked to a higher inclination towards not vaccinating.
Our findings regarding the intention to vaccinate children and adolescents align closely with those reported in a study conducted in LAC between May and June 2021 (13). This is promising news for public health, as the Ministries of Health in Peru and Colombia have either initiated or planned vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 using various vaccines for this age group (28,29). The anticipated acceptance of vaccination among children and adolescents is crucial for achieving the necessary population coverage to attain herd immunity. Nevertheless, disparities across regions within these countries, particularly in Peru where differences based on residential location exist, underscore the need for tailored vaccination strategies that consider regional nuances.
In line with other Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries, various factors linked to the socioeconomic and psychological impacts of the pandemic contribute to a decreased reluctance towards vaccination. Stress, economic instability, and food insecurity stemming from the economic downturn, particularly evident during the initial wave of the pandemic, likely instilled a sense of vigilance and a desire to prevent a recurrence, with vaccination being perceived as a means to achieve this goal. Concurrently, adherence to communal preventive measures like mask-wearing and social distancing could indicate a higher propensity to accept vaccination. Furthermore, feelings of vulnerability and a parental instinct to shield their children from harm may cultivate a favorable attitude towards vaccination, thereby diminishing the likelihood of vaccine hesitancy among parents.
While some factors align across different countries, studies have indicated that certain factors can be elucidated by social determinants and socioeconomic variances between nations. Despite the absence of comparative studies on these distinctions, there exist plausible explanations. A prior investigation conducted by our team examining food insecurity in Latin America and the Caribbean during the initial phase of the pandemic revealed a higher prevalence of food insecurity in Peru compared to Colombia (83.9% versus 76.8%, respectively), potentially shedding light on the outcomes of the current study. Moreover, the pandemic's impact differed significantly between the two countries, with Peru reporting over 200 thousand deaths by November 17, 2021, in contrast to approximately 128 thousand deaths in Colombia. These disparities may indicate that the apprehension surrounding infection and its repercussions has spurred a heightened desire among individuals to protect their children from similar experiences, thereby increasing the inclination towards vaccinating them. Conversely, as outlined in the document "Distinctive features of health systems in the world, 2017," the Colombian healthcare system exhibits a more advanced state compared to its Peruvian counterpart. Notably, in Peru, despite some advancements, structural deficiencies and limited healthcare access in rural regions significantly impacted healthcare provision during the pandemic, potentially elucidating our current findings.
There were significant disparities in the intention to vaccinate across various regions of Peru. Madre de Dios, Puno, and Moquegua exhibited the lowest inclination to vaccinate, while Lima and Lambayeque showed the highest willingness to vaccinate children and adolescents against COVID-19. Interestingly, Madre de Dios and Moquegua, regions with lower fatality rates during the pandemic, potentially experienced reduced fear levels compared to regions like Lambayeque, which had higher fatality rates. Nevertheless, the intricate impact of the pandemic in each region remains incompletely understood, possibly elucidating why Puno, a region with low mortality, displayed low vaccination intent. Factors such as self-medication, disease knowledge, information sources reliability, and variations in prevention practices among Peruvians could account for the differing vaccination intentions observed across Peru's regions.
In Colombia, the departments exhibiting the highest vaccination intention were VaupÃ©s, San AndrÃ©s, BolÃ­var, GuainÃ­a, and Cundinamarca, all surpassing 94%. These regions experienced significant impacts from COVID-19, particularly in terms of case concentration per inhabitant. In areas like San AndrÃ©s, extensive state intervention occurred across various domains due to the initial COVID involvement, potentially shaping subsequent vaccination intentions. Similarly, in BolÃ­var, home to the capital Cartagena, a notable number of cases and fatalities were recorded, potentially influencing vaccination intentions. The vaccination initiative in Colombia is spearheaded by a mass media campaign and is supported by scientific societies like the Colombian Association of Infectious Diseases. This association disseminates evidence-based information to both healthcare professionals and the general public, potentially bolstering vaccination intentions.
Our study is subject to certain limitations. Given that our respondents were users of a social network, our data was restricted to individuals with internet and social network access, potentially leading to regional and rural population biases. We lack information on non-response rates, a crucial aspect in online surveys. The variables considered in our analysis were predetermined in the survey, potentially overlooking other pertinent factors. The data relied on self-reporting, introducing the possibility of underreporting. Furthermore, the study's design precludes establishing causality among the variables, necessitating a cautious interpretation of our results as indicative of associations rather than causation. Nonetheless, the study's strength lies in its analysis of a substantial database comprising a representative sample of social network users prevalent in Colombia and Peru.
In conclusion, approximately 90% of parents in Colombia and Peru express their intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19. This intention is influenced by various factors that exhibit similarities across the two countries, as well as distinct variations within different regions of each nation. Despite the overall positive reception towards COVID-19 vaccination, it is imperative for the respective health authorities to devise tailored strategies based on the specific contexts in order to effectively meet the vaccination objectives within this demographic. This entails not only expanding the target groups to encompass both the unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals but also ensuring extensive coverage through the administration of booster or supplementary doses. Furthermore, it is crucial to effectively communicate scientific evidence to the public, addressing pertinent aspects that could impact vaccine confidence, such as the emergence of new variants of concern like the Omicron variant, among other relevant considerations.
