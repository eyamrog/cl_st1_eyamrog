Patients and the general public face significant psychological stressors that can result in a range of mental health issues, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia, ultimately impacting their quality of life. Psychological crisis intervention is crucial in promoting overall health-related quality of life and disease management. The emergence of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has disrupted various sectors, including public health. In order to improve infection control measures, implement effective interventions, and develop sound public health policies, this study seeks to evaluate levels of fear and peri-traumatic stress experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted from April 12th to 18th utilizing the Peri-Traumatic Distress Scale (CPDI) and the Fear Scale (FCV-19S) to assess peri-traumatic stress and fear as psychological responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online spreadsheet was employed to distribute the questionnaire and scales to a sample of 1844 participants for data collection. Following data analysis, the individuals were categorized into four groups: Group 1 (1232) comprising individuals without chronic health conditions; Group 2 (298) consisting of patients with prior psychological distress; Group 3 (229) including patients with cardiovascular diseases; and Group 4 (71) comprising patients with diabetes. Groups 1 and 2 were considered as controls for comparison with Groups 2, 3, and 4.
Results: All groups exhibited higher scores on the CPDI and FCV-19S measures compared to the G1 group. Specifically, G3 demonstrated significantly higher CPDI scores when compared to G1, G2, and G4, while also displaying elevated FCV-19S scores in comparison to G1, G2, and G4. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test revealed a statistically significant difference between the control group and groups 2 and 3 (Mann-Whitney p < 0.05).
In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Brazilian population, particularly affecting individuals with heart disease and hypertension who exhibited elevated levels of stress and fear. These numbers were found to be comparable to, and in some cases even higher than, those individuals who had reported experiencing psychological distress prior to the pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a significant global health crisis in the 21st century. By mid-April, just a few months following the initial outbreak in China towards the end of 2019, the number of confirmed cases had surpassed 2 million, with the death toll reaching 120,000 worldwide.
The future trajectory of events remains uncertain, with the timing of a potential return to pre-pandemic levels of activity remaining unclear (Danese et al., 2020). This ongoing uncertainty can contribute to heightened levels of stress, fear, and anguish among the general population. Extensive research has highlighted the diverse and profound psychosocial consequences experienced by individuals, communities, and nations during infectious disease outbreaks. At an individual level, individuals may grapple with fears of personal illness or mortality, feelings of powerlessness, and the burden of social stigma (Wang et al., 2020).
Pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have been linked to increased severity and higher fatality rates in COVID-19 cases. Additionally, COVID-19 has been found to exacerbate cardiovascular complications, leading to issues such as acute myocardial injury due to acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, stress-cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest (Kang et al., 2020).
In a systematic review encompassing six studies involving a total of 1527 patients, Li et al. (2020) examined the prevalence of hypertension, cardio-cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes among individuals with COVID-19. The study revealed that the rates of hypertension, cardio-cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes were notably elevated, being two to three times and twice as high, respectively, in ICU/severe cases compared to non-ICU/severe patients. Notably, at least 8.0% of COVID-19 patients experienced acute cardiac injury, with the incidence of this injury being approximately 13 times greater in ICU/severe cases than in non-ICU/severe cases (Yang et al., 2020).
Research indicates that individuals grappling with severe illness or multiple comorbidities exhibit elevated psychological symptoms amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A study conducted by Santamaria et al. (2020) in Spain delved into the repercussions of the pandemic, revealing that individuals with chronic diseases reported heightened levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in contrast to their healthier counterparts.
Given the heightened vulnerability of hypertensive and diabetic individuals to severe coronavirus infections, coupled with research indicating elevated levels of psychological distress among those with chronic conditions due to COVID-19, it becomes imperative to assess the pandemic's impact on patients with enduring illnesses, particularly those with cardiovascular issues and diabetes.
In a pandemic of unprecedented scale in Brazil, it is crucial to examine the psychological repercussions on the population to enable health authorities to devise targeted strategies for alleviating psychological distress among the most vulnerable groups. This study aimed to assess stress levels and fear among a diverse sample of Brazilian adults across all regions during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the collected data, the study sought to identify the psychological requirements of individuals grappling with the pandemic and potential predictive factors influencing their mental well-being.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted from April 12th to 18th utilizing the Peri-Traumatic Distress Scale (CPDI) and the Fear Scale (FCV-19S) to assess peri-traumatic stress and fear as psychological responses during the Covid-19 pandemic. An online spreadsheet was employed to distribute the questionnaire and scales to a sample of 1844 participants for data collection. Following data analysis, the individuals were categorized into four groups: Group 1 (1232) comprised individuals without chronic health conditions, Group 2 (298) consisted of patients with prior psychological distress, Group 3 (229) included patients with cardiovascular diseases, and Group 4 (71) involved patients with diabetes. Group 1 served as the control for comparison with Groups 2, 3, and 4 in the analysis.
Participants initially completed a socio-demographic survey, which inquired about chronic disease prevalence and levels of social isolation experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, distress levels were evaluated using the Peri-Traumatic Distress Index (CPDI), a self-report questionnaire designed to gauge depression, anxiety, avoidance, compulsive behavior, specific phobias, cognitive alterations, physical symptoms, and impairment in social functioning. The CPDI comprised twenty-four questions presented in a Likert scale format with five response categories ranging from "never" to "most of the time." The content validity of the CPDI was confirmed by Qiu et al. in 2020.
Fear was assessed using the COVID-19 Fear scale (FCV-19S) in a Likert format comprising five response categories (strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree). This scale, consisting of seven items, is unidimensional with strong psychometric properties, proven to be reliable and valid in evaluating and alleviating fears related to COVID-19 among individuals (Ahorsu et al., 2020). Both the FCV-19S and CPDI scales were authorized by their respective authors for use in the study and were translated and adapted to Brazilian Portuguese.
In terms of statistical analyses, the data are presented as median with 25th to 75th percentiles. Initially, the reliability of the two scales was assessed through Cronbach's Alpha calculation, Bartlett's sphericity test, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin adequacy factor (KMO). Subsequently, the Shapiro-Wilk normality test was conducted to verify the normal distribution of all data. The Fear scale and Peri-traumatic distress data underwent a one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (split-plot ANOVA), supplemented by Tukey’s post hoc test where applicable.
First, the study presented data on the prevalence of health issues, social isolation, and physical disabilities among the interviewees, along with the percentage engaged in sports activities and segmented by age group, as illustrated in Table 1.
Table 2 displays the means, confidence intervals, weighted means, and Cronbach Alpha estimates for each factor of the CPDI scales and the Fear scale. The CPDI scale, consisting of four factors, is depicted alongside the unidimensional Fear scale, where the mean Fear Score is utilized for the calculations. Notably, the total factors of the CPDI scale and the Fear scale exhibited high internal consistencies, with Cronbach Alpha values of 0.90 and 0.88, respectively.
Bartlett's sphericity test indicates that the variables assessed through the questionnaire exhibit correlation within the population, as illustrated in Table 3.
The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) sample size suitability factor indicates that the sample size is adequate for testing the variables intended for Factor Analysis, with all CPDI values ≥ 0.82 except for question 21 (0.57) and all FEAR Scale values ≥ 0.84.
In the comparison of CPDI scores among the study groups, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test revealed that individuals with psychological issues or those reporting psychological distress alongside heart disease and/or hypertension exhibited the highest scores compared to those without reported health issues (Mann-Whitney U = 6399.5; p < 0.05). Notably, hypertensive individuals displayed the highest scores among all groups, surpassing even those with psychological problems or reported psychological distress. Conversely, diabetic patients demonstrated values similar to those without reported health problems (Mann-Whitney U = 42672; p < 0.05). These findings are detailed in Table 4.
Table 5 presents the FEAR scale scores, with Group 3 (G3) exhibiting higher FCV-19S scores compared to Groups 1, 2, and 4. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test indicated that the comparison among the study groups mirrors the trends observed in Table 2, which pertains to the CPDI scale (Mann-Whitney p < 0.05). Notably, the comparison between diabetic individuals and those without health issues suggests a potentially greater impact on diabetic patients (Mann-Whitney U = 47572; p < 0.05).
Psychiatric disorders and psychological impairments have been linked to cardiovascular diseases, particularly hypertension, which is also prevalent among diabetic patients. Amid a pandemic, the effects of an event as significant as the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being of individuals with hypertension and diabetes remain largely unexplored. Existing studies, including systematic reviews, have indicated that individuals with chronic conditions are more vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19 compared to healthy individuals, increasing their risk of severe Sars-CoV-2 infection (Wang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). While research has delved into the psychological repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic (Santamaria et al., 2020), specific data on the mental health of patients with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are scarce.
Exposure of the population to trauma, including experiences like witnessing and caring for severely ill individuals, perceiving life-threatening situations, mortality, bereavement, and the deaths of healthcare professionals, can significantly impact mental health, heightening the likelihood of developing psychological distress and progressing towards psychopathology, including conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Neria et al., 2011; Shultz et al., 2015).
Individuals exhibit varied responses to psychological stressors like fear, indifference, fatalism, anxiety, and depression (Taylor, 2019). Moreover, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases have been recognized as potential risk factors for severe outcomes in Sars-CoV-2 patients (Martinez-Ferran et al., 2020). Consequently, this subset of the population may experience heightened psychological symptoms due to the increased severity of COVID-19 in individuals with multiple comorbidities.
In their study, Wang et al. (2020) assessed 1210 volunteers using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results indicated that 53.8% of participants perceived the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe, with 16.5% reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 28.8% reporting moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 8.1% reporting moderate to severe stress levels.
Moreover, in order to address and mitigate the stigma linked to the epidemic, it is imperative to develop strategies that can effectively manage the psychological distress experienced during the post-pandemic phase (Wang et al., 2020), particularly among individuals with chronic illnesses.
In our study, we observed a significant prevalence of psychological distress among patients with cardiovascular and diabetic conditions. This finding can be partially attributed to the already elevated levels of psychological distress seen in individuals with hypertension and diabetes even outside of pandemic circumstances. Nevertheless, our research also indicates a heightened impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being of this particular demographic.
In their study involving 52,095 hypertensive patients from 19 countries, Stein et al. (2014) found significant associations between depression, anxiety, and eating disorders and the subsequent diagnosis of hypertension.
In a meta-analysis conducted by Li et al. (2015, 27 studies involving 10,194 hypertensive patients), the use of self-evaluation scales revealed a notable prevalence of depression at 29.8%. These findings align closely with the results reported by Gebre et al. (2020) in their study of 310 hypertensive patients, where a comparable prevalence of depression was observed at 24.7%.
In various studies and across different countries, diabetic patients have been found to exhibit comparable levels of psychological distress, with rates ranging from 17% to 28.8% (Alajmani et al., 2019; Park et al., 2015). Our research revealed that individuals with diabetes experienced elevated levels of stress and fear, although this did not show a statistically significant difference compared to non-diabetic volunteers. Notably, both groups demonstrated heightened levels of stress and fear in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research indicates that individuals grappling with severe illness or multiple comorbidities tend to exhibit elevated psychological symptoms during times of crisis. A study conducted by Santamaria et al. (2020) in Spain, examining the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealed that individuals reporting chronic diseases displayed heightened levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in comparison to their counterparts without such health conditions.
In a study conducted by Yang et al. (2020), 1099 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated, with 173 of them presenting the severe form of the disease. The identified risk factors for severe COVID-19 included comorbidities such as arterial hypertension (23.7%), diabetes mellitus (16.2%), coronary diseases (5.8%), and cerebrovascular disease (2.3%).
In our study, individuals with cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, exhibited significantly higher levels of peri-traumatic fear and stress compared to those without chronic conditions. The Fear scale (FCV-19S) scores were 23.78, indicating a moderate level of fear, while the Peri-Traumatic Distress Index (CPDI) scores were 58.89, suggesting severe distress. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions by public health agencies to monitor mental health in this population during and after the pandemic.
In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that two primary factors contribute to the heightened levels of psychological distress experienced by hypertensive and diabetic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Firstly, this population already contends with elevated levels of depression and other psychological issues, exacerbated by the awareness and frequent reminders that they belong to a high-risk group susceptible to severe illness and potential fatality from COVID-19.
