Abstract 
Introduction: Analysis of the outcome of 268 ICU patients in a single-center, as well the 
impact of viral infection on patients with preexisting medical conditions and how these 
factors affected survival and hospital stay. 
Methodology: Patients admitted to the ICU from March-August, 2020 were 
retrospectively analyzed under the same protocol at Hospital Alemão Oswaldo Cruz, 
São Paulo, Brazil. Several factors were considered and the results were presented using 
95% confidence intervals. For statistical significance, p <0.05 was adopted. 
Results: Patient median age was 72 years, 64,2 years for discharged patients and 79.9 
years for those deceased (p<0.001). The most common comorbidities were: systemic 
arterial hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, cardiovascular and kidney disease. 
Predictors of survival through univariate analysis: myalgia (p=0.001), cerebrovascular 
disease (p=0.002), COPD (p=0.003), dementia (p=0.000), mechanical ventilation 
(p=0.000), dialysis (0.000), vasopressor use (0.000), SAPS3 (0.000), lymphopenia 
(p=0.004), elevated D-dimer (P=0.011), time in ICU before tracheostomy (p=0.002), 
and performing a tracheostomy (p=0.000). The independent predictors of mortality 
were: advanced age (p=0.003) and tracheostomy performed in ICU (p=0.002). 
Discussion: COVID-19 affects usually older adults, where there already is a higher 
fatality rate. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the primary cause of death and <5% 
of patients were reported as experiencing co-infection at admission.

Conclusion: age, vasopressor use in patients with tracheostomy, and systemic coronary 
disease, heart failure, neoplasia, and COPD, were found to be significantly associated 
with COVID-19 severity. 
Keywords: COVID-19; coronavirus; ICU; comorbidities; pandemic. 
Introduction 
In late December 2019, a few cases of a serious illness causing pneumonia and death 
were first reported in Wuhan, China. Soon after, the number of cases increased 
dramatically, spreading across China and then worldwide.  
The primary cluster of patients was found to be connected with the Huanan South China 
Seafood Market in Wuhan. Coronavirus belongs to the family Coronaviridae (subfamily 
Coronavirinae), species capable of infecting a broad range of hosts, causing symptoms 
and diseases ranging from the common cold to severe and ultimately fatal illnesses, 
such as SARS and MERS1,5. Analysis of the viral genome has revealed that the new 
coronavirus is phylogenetically close to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
(SARS-CoV), the causative agent of a viral outbreak in 20025. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the official name of the disease as 
"coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)" and now publicly refers to the virus as "the 
COVID-19 virus" (formerly known as "2019-nCoV")1. The consequences for human 
health, the global economy, and the normal functioning of society have been 
unprecedented2. 
The virus infects humans of all age groups, although the severe form of the disease is 
more common in older adults2. Patients with COVID-19 can be symptomatic or

asymptomatic. According to most reports, mild symptoms occurred in about 81% of 
patients, including cough, sore throat, fever, myalgia, and moderate pneumonia2,4. 
As of 8 August 2021, there was a total of 201.941.078 confirmed cases globally. Of 192 
countries registered cases that reached an outcome, 4.282.732 resulted in mortality3. In 
Brazil, there were 31.895.385 COVID-19 cases and 561.762 deaths, with a 2.8% 
lethality rate. In São Paulo — the epicenter of the disease in Brazil — there are 
4.113.741 confirmed cases and 140.677 deaths, with a 3.9% lethality rate4. 
The disease can lead to organ dysfunction—shock, severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS), acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury (AKI)—and death2. While most 
COVID-19 patients will not require supportive care, 10-15% of patients develop acute 
respiratory distress that requires invasive ventilatory support1. Patients with the severe 
form of the disease had symptoms of severe pneumonia, dyspnea, and very low blood 
oxygen saturation (≤ 93%), which was observed in about 14% of cases7,8.  
Critical symptoms occurred in about 5% of cases and included respiratory failure, multi-
organ failure, and septic shock. Mild infections were observed to improve in a week, 
whereas severe cases experienced acute respiratory failure, even leading to sepsis and 
death. Most fatalities were reported in middle-aged/elderly populations with preexisting 
conditions, including diabetes, heart and kidney diseases, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, cancer, and immune diseases7. 
The mortality rates are approximately 2%-3%. Older age, presence of comorbidities 
such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, 
higher d-dimer and C-reactive protein, and lower lymphocyte levels are associated with 
higher mortality7,8. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective and specific antiviral

treatment. Currently, supportive care measures such as ventilation oxygenation and fluid 
management remain the standard of care. Several clinical trials are currently trying to 
identify the most potent drug or combination against the disease and it is strongly 
recommended to enroll patients in ongoing trials3,6.  
Mechanical ventilation (MV) for patients infected with the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with prolonged airway intubation 
and high worldwide mortality of at least 50-67%3. 
The development cycle of a vaccine production against SARS-CoV-2 moved 
remarkably fast given the major pandemic issue that has emerged and major 
international vaccine funding agencies are supporting the multitude of innovative 
ongoing efforts. Nowadays, vaccination is being applied around the world with 
optimistic results, reducing the number of infected people, hospitalizations, and deaths6.   
In this light, the present original research describes the outcome in 268 ICU patients in a 
single-center, as well analyzing the effects of viral infection on preexisting medical 
conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease, cancer, and how these factors affected 
survival and hospital stay. 
Methodology 
We retrospectively analyzed patients included in this study (n=268), who were admitted 
to ICU between March 18th, 2020 to August 30th, 2020. All patients were analyzed 
under the same protocol at Hospital Alemão Oswaldo Cruz, São Paulo, Brazil. 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4453
The patients had COVID-19 infection documented by nasal pharyngeal swab for reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) assay and developed severe 
respiratory failure requiring admission to ICU. Data were collected following a medical 
record review of each patient chart. The institutional review board approved this study 
(#4.849.542). 
Patients with the following characteristics were considered eligible for analysis: 1) 
Covid-19 confirmed by test, 2) admission to ICU. 
Several COVID-19 related factors were considered, including age, gender, symptoms 
before hospitalization, comorbidities, vasopressors use, radiological findings, use of 
high flow nasal catheter, prone position, ECMO, tracheostomy, and blood tests. 
In addition, we collected variables such as type and duration of symptoms when 
entering ICU, FIO2 and PaO2/ FiO2 relation, and the total time of hospitalization. 
The majority of the patients underwent chest CT scans before ICU care, to evaluate the 
extent of lung lesions by SARS-CoV-2, which was divided into four degrees: < 25%, 
25-50%, 50-75%, and >75%. 
Statistical Analyses 
For database preparation and descriptive analysis, the Statistical Package for the Social 
Sciences software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), version 17.0 for Windows, was used. 
The results were generated through tables and graphs. Categorical variables are 
expressed in frequencies and percentages - n (%). Continuous variables with normal 
distribution were expressed as means and standard deviations; and those with non-
normal distribution, in median and interquartile ranges. The normality of the numerical 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4453
variables was verified through descriptive statistics, graphical analysis, and the 
Kolmogoronov-Sminov test.  
In the comparison between groups (hospital discharge vs. death) for the numerical 
variables, the independent t-test was used, when the variables had a normal distribution 
and the Mann-Whitney test for those with  asymmetric distribution. In the comparison 
between groups and categorical variables, the chi-square (X2) test was used, when the 
distribution had an N in each category with less than five individuals, Fischer's exact 
test was used. 
The COX regression model was used to evaluate the predictive variables for mortality 
in patients with COVID-19. After univariate analysis, independent variables were 
inserted into the COX model, remaining in the model if they remained significant (p 
<0.05). The manual procedure for inserting and removing variables was adopted. The 
results were presented using the hazard ratio and its respective 95% confidence 
intervals. The Kaplan- Mayer was used for patients' survival curves. For statistical 
inferences, p <0.05 was adopted for all analyses. 
Results 
Two hundred patients (74.6%) were discharged from the hospital (139 male and 34 
female), and 68 patients (44 male and 24 female) were not discharged or died (25.4%). 
There is a higher incidence of males in both groups. The longer the hospital stay, the 
greater the chance of death (figure 1). 
The mean time duration of symptoms before hospital admission was 5.5 days, seven 
days (4-9) for discharged patients, and four days (2-6.75) for the patients not discharged

from the hospital (p<0,001). The last group mentioned had a longer hospital stay, 
showing a faster unfavorable outcome for these patients. We noticed that shorter 
symptom duration usually progresses fastest to severe disease presentation. 
The most common comorbidities associated were: systemic arterial hypertension- SAH 
(n=144), diabetes (n=80), thyroid disease (n=53), cardiovascular disease (n=52), kidney 
disease (n=33), cerebrovascular disease or previous stroke (n=12), obesity (n=60), 
neoplasia (n=35), COPD (n=15) and dementia (n=22), as shown on (table 1). 
One hundred and two patients used any kind of drug before being admitted to ICU 
(Table 1), as follows: ACE inhibitors (n=87), systemic corticosteroids (n=54), 
chemotherapy (n=14), and immunosuppressive drugs (n=9). 
The median age was 72 years, 64,2 years (53-74) for patients who were discharged, and 
79.9 years (71.4-88.4) for those not discharged (p<0.001). The group of patients who 
was not discharged from the hospital was composed of the oldest ones (table 1). 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4453
The most common symptoms before hospital admission were dyspnea (n=206/78%), 
fever (n=179/ 65%), cough (n=166/ 60%), diarrhea (n=51/ 18.5%) and myalgia (n=83/ 
25.6%). Dyspnea was the most prevalent symptom, especially for those who were not 
discharged (n=55/80.9%). 
Regarding lung affection before ICU admission, 21 patients had no specific CT 
findings, 52 patients had less than 25-% (20.7%), 107 had 25-50% (38.4%), 58 had 
50-75% (20.3%) and nine (3.2%) patients >75% of lobes involved by SARS-CoV-2. 
During ICU admission, the median SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) 3 was 
45 (41-51.7) for the discharged patients and 51 (44.3-57) for the non- discharged ones; 
174 patients (60.9%) had oxygen additional through a nasal catheter, 14 patients (5,4%) 
needed high flow nasal catheter, 28 (12.3%) patients required mechanical ventilation 
and 23 (8.6%) needed vasopressors. The median PaO2/FiO2 relation was 236 (135-328) 
for the group discharged from hospital and 192 (125-275) for the non-discharged 
patients. 
During hospital stay, 32 patients (12.9%) underwent prone position, 33 patients (20.9%) 
underwent tracheostomy and seven (2.2%) patients needed ECMO support. 
The laboratory tests showed the following findings (median) during hospital admission: 
leukocytes 7.410 and 8.015, lymphocytes 910 and 700, C-reactive protein 11 and 11.38, 
D-dimer 850 and 1.193, LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase) 615 and 657, creatinine 0.94 and 
1.09, in the discharged and not discharged patients respectively.  
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4453
The median days on mechanical ventilation was 12 (7.5-16), hospitalization total time 
of 17 (10-31) and 18.5 (10-37), and ICU time before tracheostomy 11.5 (7-18) and 19 
(14.5-25.5), for those discharged and not discharged groups.

From Table 1, collected data points towards: 
- Older age in the group that was not discharged from the hospital had worst prognosis; 
-A shorter duration of symptoms pre-hospitalization in the deceased group;  
- A greater incidence of myalgia in the group that was discharged from the hospital; 
- Concerning comorbidities, as comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, neoplasia, 
COPD, and dementia, were highly prevalent among the group with more deceased 
patients; 
- During ICU stay, a higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, 
dialysis, and tracheostomy in the group that presented more deaths;  
- The SAPS3 was higher in patients who died at ICU admission; 
- Lymphopenia, elevated D-dimer, and the duration in the ICU pre-TQT were higher in 
the group with more deaths.  
The univariate analysis (table 2) shows the following factors as predictors of survival:

Discussion 
The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed health care systems globally to the limit with the 
unprecedented task of managing large volumes of critically ill patients. This pandemic 
has affected numerous communities, and reports of overburdened hospitals, specifically 
critical care units, have become commonplace4,7,8. High-quality supportive care remains

the foundation for ensuring that critically ill patients with COVID-19 have the best 
chance of surviving. Such care in pre-pandemic times relied on sufficient expert 
staffing, specialized equipment, and appropriate environments of care to reliably 
implement a myriad of processes that are associated with better outcomes15,17. Patients 
with COVID-19 treated in the ICU during periods of high ICU load or demand fared 
worse than those treated during times of low COVID-19 ICU load or demand. Being 
elderly and requiring mechanical ventilation had a stronger association with the chance 
of death, but ICU capacity had a clear association with mortality25.  
The spectrum of described diseases in our study is similar to those from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance 
Network, the New York City area, and China21,24.   
Analyzed data reveals that the shorter duration of symptoms during pre-hospitalization 
was related to worst survival (p<0.001), as shown by univariate analysis. The shorter 
the symptoms, the worse the prognosis and faster the progression to severe presentation.  
COVID-19 infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global pandemic. The 
clinical and pathological features of acute infection have been extensively published, 
with a wide spectrum of diseases seen, from asymptomatic infection to mild self-
limiting symptoms to acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation 
(MV)26. The most common clinical findings are fever, cough, and fatigue with some 
laboratory findings such as increased serum ferritin, D-dimers, and C reactive protein 
(CRP)27.  Some studies reported that risk factors associated with the development of 
acute respiratory distress syndrome and death included older age, neutrophilia, organ 
dysfunction, coagulopathy, and elevated D-dimer levels45. 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4453
Previous ICU studies found mortality rates of 62% (China) and 67% (USA), but these 
figures had not accounted for many who were still in the ICU41,42.. However, these 
numbers may reflect the pandemics beginning, a time when there was not much 
knowledge about the virus and disease outcome. Analyzed data found a lower mortality 
rate (25.4%), likely associated with improved healthcare due to literature on disease 
management and treatment. 
Older adults are more affected and there is also a higher fatality rate in this subset of 
patients. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the primary cause of death in 
COVID-1928 and a recent scope review found that for COVID-19, < 5% of patients 
were reported as experiencing bacterial/fungal co-infection at admission, but the 
development of secondary infections during ICU admission is common29,30. 
Age was correlated with increased mortality on univariate (p<0.001) and multivariate 
(p=0.003) analysis as well. Mortality rate was of 34% (n=68), although some authors 
reported mortality as high as 49% in patients with critical illness35. In this sample, more 
males were admitted to the ICU than females, 66.3% and 33.7%, respectively. A 
systematic review including 18.246 patients concluded there was no significant 
difference between the number of males (50.5%) and female (49.5%) patients. 
Individuals of all age groups were included. On the other hand, in another study with 
4.203 patients, 2.797 were male (66.5%) and 1.406 were female (33.5%). 
Early reports have suggested an incubation period of two to 14 days, with clinical 
presentations ranging from mild infection to severe disease to fatal illness9-11. The most 
commonly reported symptoms are cough, fever, and dyspnea12-15. Myalgia and 
gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and nausea or vomiting, are also 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4453
common8. Myalgia was found in 25% of patients and was a survival predictor on 
univariate analysis  (p<0.001). 
The need for mechanical ventilation (p=0.000) and longer ICU stay (p=0.002), were 
also correlated to a worse prognosis on univariate analysis.  According to other authors, 
97% of patients on invasive mechanical ventilation died in a multi-center study 
conducted early in the Wuhan outbreak, mortality is affected by local practices, and 
larger studies are awaited43. The same study reported that 53% of deaths were related to 
respiratory failure43.   
Recent reports12,15,16,17 suggest that approximately 14% to 29% of hospitalized patients 
with COVID-19 pneumonia require intensive care, primarily for respiratory support in 
the setting of hypoxic respiratory failure, with acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) developing in 33% of hospitalized patients at a median time from symptom 
onset of eight days9. In these reports12,13, critically ill patients were older, more likely to 
be male and to have underlying comorbidities. The mortality rate ranged from 8.7% to 
21% among those patients admitted with pneumonia12,14-16. These findings support the 
observations of earlier studies, which found a high percentage of hospitalized patients of 
advanced age with preexisting conditions, hypertension being the most common18-20.  
COVID-19 rapidly spread throughout the state of São Paulo and has disproportionately 
affected the population, who have high rates of co-morbid conditions and a mean BMI 
of 30. The obese patients had a high incidence of unfavorable outcomes, as reported 
previously by other authors. In the present study, obesity was present in 27.9% of the 
deceased group. Although it is a considerable number of patients, it was not important 
in univariate analysis (p=0.748).

In the initial reports from Wuhan, China, during the early stages of the pandemic, 
shortness of breath was reported in 54% of patients and was associated with a 
composite endpoint of admission to an ICU, use of mechanical ventilation, and death19. 
A similar prevalence of dyspnea was reported in 21 critically ill patients in Washington 
State and the COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network database21. 
In our series, dyspnea at presentation was associated with hospitalization and the need 
for ICU management — it was the most prevalent symptom, especially for those who 
were not discharged (n=55/80.9%).   
Some authors found that the prevalence of dyspnea in the ICU group was 67.2%, 
compared with 10.2% in the non-ICU group31. Although dyspnea by definition may be 
indicative of lung involvement and therefore more severe disease, there have been 
reports of 'silent hypoxia', where oxygen saturations can fall and precipitate acute 
respiratory failure in the absence of dyspnea and other symptoms of respiratory 
distress31,32. 
However, symptoms of fever (65%), cough (60%), and myalgia (25.6%) at presentation 
were more common among patients in the ICU on uni-variable analysis, especially 
myalgia as a predictor of survival (p=0.001). According to Jail et col, dyspnea was the 
only symptom significantly associated with both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 
1.83–7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28–10.0), being more strongly 
associated with the latter31. 
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that COPD, CVD, and 
hypertension were the comorbidities significantly predictive for both severe disease and 
ICU admission. The pORs for the severe disease were as follows: COPD (6.42, 95% CI 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4453
2.44–16.9), CVD (2.70, 95% CI 1.52–4.80), and hypertension (1.97, 95% CI 1.40–
2.77). COPD, CVD, and hypertension were more strongly associated with ICU 
admission, compared with severe disease, with pORs of 17.8 (95% CI 6.56–48.2), 4.44 
(95% CI 2.64–7.47), and 3.65 (95% CI 2.22–5.99), respectively31. Those findings 
corroborate with the found data, in which COPD (p=0.003) and cardiovascular disease 
(p=0.002) patients, had higher admission to ICU, and worse prognosis as well. 
According to Yan et al., COPD was an extremely strong predictor for both severe 
disease and ICU admission32.  COPD has been identified as an independent risk factor 
associated with COVID-19 patients with an OR of 5.97 (P<0.001)36. Patients with CVD 
and hypertension were 4.4 and 3.7 times more likely to have ICU admission, 
respectively, compared to patients without these comorbidities31,32. 
The cardiovascular complications induced by SARS-CoV-2 include acute myocardial 
damage, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, rhythm disorders, and 
thromboembolism. Also, in the treatment of COVID-19, interaction with cardiovascular 
drugs must be considered34. A study, which included more than 44,000 COVID-19 
patients with diseases of the cardiovascular system, showed a five-fold increase in 
mortality compared to initially healthy patients (10.5% and 2.3%, respectively)35. 
A substantial proportion of studied patients presenting with gastrointestinal (GI) 
symptoms - such as diarrhea (18.5%) - required hospitalization, similar to the data 
reported in the COVID-19 Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network22. A 
systematic review of GI symptoms in COVID-19 showed an overall prevalence of 
diarrhea between 5 – 10%, although rates varied extensively between studies. Larger 
cohort studies report prevalence rates between 20-30%37. 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4453
Another systematic review including 18.246 patients concluded there was no significant 
difference between the number of males (50.5%) and female (49.5%) patients. 
Individuals of all age groups were included37. The prevalence of GI symptoms was 
similar among men and women (52.1% and 49.5%, respectively). Diarrhea was the 
most common GI symptom, affecting 11.5% of the patients, followed by nausea and 
vomiting (6.3%) and abdominal pain (2.3%). Concerning clinical severity, 17.5% of the 
patients were classified as severely ill, whereas 9.8% of them were considered to have a 
non-severe disease37.  
Reports suggest that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and high-flow nasal cannula 
(HFNC) were used in between one-third and two-thirds of critically ill patients with 
COVID-19 in China. Scarce data exists to confirm or refute safety concerns regarding 
the risk of aerosol generation by these devices38. Epidemiological data suggest that NIV 
was associated with nosocomial transmission of SARS; however, human laboratory data 
suggest that NIV does not generate aerosols. Suggestions that HFNC might be safe are 
questionable: studies that might be taken to support the safety of HFNC were not 
designed to show whether or not HFNC is aerosol-generating and did not examine the 
spread of viruses39. Those data were worrying at the beginning of the pandemics. 
Collected data shows that 174 patients used nasal catheters (NC), 14 HFNC, and 71 
non-rebreathing masks (NRM) when entering ICU. Analyzed data did not identify any 
relation to survival according to these factors. 
Liang et al. developed and validated a clinical risk score and a web-based risk calculator 
to predict the development of critical illness among hospitalized COVID-19 infected 
patients38. The ten variables required for calculating the risk of developing a critical 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4453
illness are generally readily available at hospital admission. Chest radiography 
abnormality, age, hemoptysis, dyspnea, unconsciousness, number of comorbidities, 
cancer history, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct 
bilirubin were included in the COVID risk score. Previous studies have found several of 
these variables to be risk factors for severe illness related to COVID-19. Although, 
potential limitations of this study include a modest sample size for constructing the risk 
score and a relatively small sample for validation. Besides, the data for score 
development and validation are entirely from China. According to laboratory findings, 
lymphopenia (p=0.004), elevated D-dimer (p=0.011), and SAPS3 level, were relevant 
variables in univariate analysis. The study in 710 patients by Liang et al, showed that 
radiological abnormalities, number of comorbidities, and DHL level, were related to 
survival multivariate analysis45. 
The need for vasopressors drugs might be due to one or the combination of such factors: 
muscle blockers, septic shock, myocarditis, or other myocardial dysfunctions. The 
scenario with such findings denotes severely ill patients. The need for vasopressors had 
an impact on survival on multivariate analysis (p=0.000). 
Tracheostomy is a common procedure in critically ill patients who require an extended 
period of MV. The use of tracheostomy can facilitate weaning from MV and potentially 
increase the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Analysis shows that 11% of 
the patients who were discharged from the hospital had tracheostomy performed in the 
ICU. On the other hand, 30.9% (21/68) of the deceased group underwent tracheostomy, 
showing a higher incidence of such procedure in the worse patients group. According to 
collected data and previous publications, performing tracheostomy did not impact the 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.4453
natural history of these patients, although those who underwent the procedure had a 
worse prognosis (p=0.000). On the multivariate analysis, the patients who had 
tracheostomy had an impact on survival as well (p=0.002). This could be explained by 
tracheostomy performed in patients in sub-optimal conditions for the procedure, 
advanced age, those who had fewer conditions for MV weaning, or with more 
comorbidities. There are no guidelines for COVID-19 patients in MV who should 
undergo or not to tracheostomy in current literature.  
Conclusions 
In conclusion, age, the need for vasopressor medications in patients who underwent 
tracheostomy, and underlying comorbidities, such as systemic coronary disease, heart 
failure, neoplasia, and COPD, were found to be significantly associated with COVID-19 
severity. These pre-existing conditions could increase the susceptibility of such 
individuals to COVID-19. Recognizing these risk factors could help clinicians reduce 
mortality by identifying patients with poor prognoses at an early stage. Lymphopenia 
and elevated D-dimer were also related to bad prognosis and worse disease course. A 
long time in ICU in this cohort was a bad prognosis marker as well. 
The spectrum of described diseases in this study are similar to those from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization 
Surveillance Network, the New York City area, and China. Moreover, data analysis 
confirmed that shorter symptom duration is associated to worst disease prognosis.
