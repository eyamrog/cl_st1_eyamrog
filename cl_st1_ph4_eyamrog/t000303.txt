Abstract:  
Background: Until March 22, 2020, 22 cases are registered in Paraguay, of which there 
are two cases with epidemiological links to be determined. The country's authorities have 
applied necessary sanitary measures to prevent massive spread. It is imperative to know 
the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the population about COVID-19, for decision 
making. 
Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out from March 20, 2020, the week 
immediately after the closure of Paraguay. The survey was online using a Google Forms 
(c) form distributed through "WhatsApp" groups. Paraguayan nationals, over 18 years of 
age, who were explained the objectives and purpose of the study, who agreed to 
participate in the study, were asked to complete the questionnaire by clicking on the link. 
Results: A total of 3141 participants completed the survey questionnaire. The mean age 
was 29.55 years (SD: 10.7), 2139 (68.10%) were women, and 2073 (66) were Interior. 
The mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 7.45 (SD: 1.51), suggesting an overall 62% 
(7.45/12*100) correct rate on this knowledge test. The majority of the respondents agreed 
that COVID-19 will finally be successfully controlled (66.28%), the vast majority of the 
participants had not visited any crowded place (88.35%) and wore masks when going out 
(74.31%) in recent days 
Conclusion: The knowledge about COVID-19 in the Paraguayan population during the 
outbreak was acceptable, attitudes have been mostly favorable and the practices are 
mostly adequate, however, it is necessary to implement massive education campaigns, to 
increase the proportion of knowledge about COVID-19, to stop its spread. 
Keywords: Coronavirus Infections; COVID-19; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;

Introduction 
 
3 
 
Since December 2019, a number of unexplained cases of pneumonia have been reported 
in Wuhan, China, prompting the Chinese government and researchers to take swift steps 
to control the epidemic and carry out etiological investigations(1). On January 12, 2020, 
the World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively named this new virus as the new 
coronavirus 2019 (2019 - nCoV)(2). On January 30, 2020, the WHO announced the 2019-
nCoV epidemic, a public health emergency of international concern. On February 11, 
2020, the WHO formally named the disease triggered by 2019 - nCoV as coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19). On the same day, the coronavirus study group of the 
International Committee on Virus Taxonomy named 2019 - nCoV as coronavirus 2 of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). On February 23, 2020, there were 
77,041 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in China(3). 
In the Region of the Americas, a total of 663 cases of COVID-19 have been reported from 
12 countries and four (4) French overseas territories/regions. In addition, the United 
States reported that 49 individuals tested positive for COVID-19 among returnees from 
Wuhan, China (1) and the Diamond Princess cruise ship (4)(5). 
To date, 23 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the United States of America(6) 
and Argentina (1). Death in Argentina was reported as an imported case: a 64-year-old 
Buenos Aires city resident with multiple underlying conditions and a recent trip to 
Europe. The 22 deaths in the United States come from the states of California, Florida 
and Washington; the majority of deaths in Washington State were associated with a long-
term care facility(7). 
Until March 22, 2020, 22 cases are registered in Paraguay, of which there are two cases 
with epidemiological links to be determined. The country's authorities have applied 
necessary sanitary measures to prevent massive spread(8).

To guarantee the final success, people’s adherence to these control measures are essential, 
which is largely affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards 
COVID-19 in accordance with KAP theory(9–11). Based on all the above, it was 
proposed to carry out this study to know the knowledge, attitudes and practices of 
Paraguayans in the period of the COVID-19 outbreak. 
Methods 
A cross-sectional study was carried out from March 20, 2020, the week immediately after 
the closure of Paraguay. The survey was online using a Google Forms (c) form distributed 
through "WhatsApp" groups. 
Paraguayan nationals, over 18 years of age, who were explained the objectives and 
purpose of the study, who agreed to participate in the study, were asked to complete the 
questionnaire by clicking on the link. 
Participants had to answer a yes or no question to confirm their willingness to participate 
voluntarily. After confirmation of the question, the participant was instructed to complete 
the self-completed questionnaire. 
The Bao-Liang et al(12). Instrument was used as a model (Translated into Spanish). This 
questionnaire consisted of two parts: demography and KAP. Demographic variables 
included age, sex, marital status, education, occupation, and current place of residence. 
The questionnaire had 12 questions: 4 regarding clinical presentations, 3 regarding 
transmission routes, and 5 regarding prevention and control of COVID-19. These 
questions were answered true / false with an additional "I don't know" option. A correct 
answer was assigned 1 point and an incorrect / unknown answer was assigned 0 points. 
The total knowledge score ranged from 0 to 12, with a higher score denoting better 
knowledge of COVID-19. 
 
5 
 
Attitudes toward COVID-19 were measured by 2 questions about COVID-19's final 
control agreement and confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19. The 
evaluation of the respondents' practices consisted of 2 behaviors: going to a crowded 
place and wearing a mask when going out in the last days. 
A pilot study was carried out with 10 subjects, with which a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.8 was 
obtained(13). 
The frequencies of correct knowledge responses and various attitudes and practices were 
described. Knowledge scores and attitudes and practices of different people according to 
demographic characteristics were compared with independent samples t test, one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA), or Chi-square test as appropriate. Multivariate linear 
regression analysis using all demographic variables as independent variables and the 
knowledge score as the outcome variable was performed to identify factors associated 
with knowledge. Similarly, binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors 
associated with attitudes and practices. 
Data analyzes were performed with STATA version 15.0. The level of statistical 
significance was established at p <0.05. 
Results 
A total of 3141 participants completed the survey questionnaire. The mean age was 
29.55 years (SD: 10.7), 2139 (68.10%) were women, and 2073 (66) were Interior. Other 
demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1. 
The mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 7.45 (SD: 1.51), suggesting an overall 62% 
(7.45/12*100) correct rate on this knowledge test. Knowledge scores significantly 
differed across genders, age-groups, categories of marital status, education levels, and 
residence places (P<0.001) (Table 1).

The majority of the respondents agreed that COVID-19 will finally be successfully 
controlled (66.28%). Rates of reporting “disagree” and “I don't know” were 6.78% and 
26.93%, respectively. Statistically significant differences were found between attitudes 
and gender, age-group, marital status, education, occupation, place of current residence 
and COVID-19 knowledge score (Table 3).

(OR:0.81, P:0.000) were significantly associated with going to any crowded place. Male 
gender (vs. female, OR: 1.01, P: 0.000), and COVID-19 knowledge (OR: 1.13, P:0.000), 
were significantly associated with not wearing a mask outside (Table 6).

Discussion. 
An investigation of Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices can use qualitative as well as 
quantitative techniques. The idea is to achieve a thorough knowledge of the target 
audience, so the best thing would be to start with a focus group, to explore the topic and 
then based on that information put together a survey, select a sample and conduct 
research(14), due to the current circumstances of the this is difficult in the country and 
due to the urgency of the case, this first quick survey was carried out through an online 
survey, constituting the first survey on KAP in COVID-19 in Paraguay. 
This study was based on the study by Bao-Liang Zhong et al(12), where they have studied 
the Knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents 
during the period of rapidly increasing outbreak of COVID-19, the Spanish translation of 
the instrument, validated through a pilot study of 10 subjects, after which the mass 
dissemination to the WhatsApp groups was carried out. No other study similar to this one 
was found. 
The study participants were mostly young adults, university students and residents of the 
interior of the country (Concepción, San Pedro, Cordillera, Guaira, Caaguazú, Itapúa, 
 
16 
 
Alto Paraná, Presidente Hayes, and Boquerón), only a small proportion of Asunción and 
Metropolitan Area, where the first cases of COVID-19 in the country have been reported. 
The global knowledge was 62%, although it is acceptable, it is still considered low, since 
basic aspects regarding the COVID-19 and protection measures were explored, this is 
striking since most of them are university students, in which expect knowledge to be 
greater. The mean knowledge score on COVID-19 in all groups was similar, however, it 
was observed that in all cases there was a statistically significant difference between the 
knowledge score on COVID-19 and gender, the age group, the marital status, education, 
occupation and place of residence. The results found in this study are lower than those 
found by Bao-Liang Zhong et al(12), being a higher average than what was found in this 
study, however, the statistical associations are similar. 
The vast majority of attitudes were favorable when it came to successfully controlling 
COVID-19 and winning the battle, however, it is striking that a proportion of subjects do 
not know if the virus was successfully controlled, and Another interesting proportion that 
considers that Paraguay did not win the battle to COVID-19, which can be attributed to 
false information distributed by social networks, due to the fear and anxiety that exists in 
these cases, which can be mitigated by a culture of proper use of information. Males have 
a greater chance of having a good attitude, and those with higher scores on knowledge 
about COVID-19. 
Regarding the practices, most of the practices are adequate. Most of them reported not 
having gone to places of mass attendance. The risk found between “going to a crowded 
place” and demographic variables was low, while the risk found between going “without 
wearing a mask” was 1.01 times more in men than in women, the results are similar to 
that found by Bao-Liang Zhong et al(12).

The strength of this study lies in its large sample recruited during a critical period, the 
initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, although this sample was composed mainly of 
people with good academic training who the ones who most easily used social networks 
were. for completing online surveys, in turn women, who generally have a better 
predisposition to participate in studies and people from the interior of the country, so, 
with this study, it is possible to give an approximation of the state of knowledge in this 
country population; In order to have better approximations, it is necessary to conduct 
another study adjusting the methodology, trying to obtain results from a population with 
a lower level of academic training and older age, who are the ones at greatest risk(15,16). 
The limitations of the study focus mainly on the sample, which was not selected through 
sampling, in turn the collection method, where the respondents had to have access to the 
Internet and Smartphone or computers to complete the survey. 
As a conclusion, it is possible to indicate that the knowledge about COVID-19 in the 
Paraguayan population during the outbreak was acceptable, attitudes have been mostly 
favorable and the practices are mostly adequate, however, it is necessary to implement 
massive education campaigns, to increase the proportion of knowledge about COVID-19, 
to stop its spread. With the help of the population and the health authorities, it is possible 
to stop and decrease COVID-19 cases throughout the Paraguayan territory.
