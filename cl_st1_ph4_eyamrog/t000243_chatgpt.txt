During the challenging times brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, urologic research has persisted. The July-August edition of Int Braz J Urol, the fourth under my supervision, showcases original contributions encompassing a diverse range of topics including Prostate Cancer, Urethral Stricture, Sexual Function, Male Incontinence, Buried Penis, Vesicoureteral Reflux, Prostate Biopsy, Kidney Transplant, Renal Cell Carcinoma, Bladder Cancer, BPH, Laparoscopy, and Testicular Cancer. These contributions hail from various countries such as Brazil, the USA, Turkey, China, Korea, Colombia, Poland, Germany, Taiwan, India, and Italy. The editor's commentary, as customary, sheds light on some of the noteworthy papers presented in this issue.
In this issue, three significant reviews are presented. Dr. Barbagli and colleagues from Italy have conducted a comprehensive narrative review on bulbar urethral stricture treatment, featured on page 511. Dr. Barbagli, a renowned urethral surgeon, shares valuable insights and techniques derived from extensive surgical experience in managing bulbar urethral strictures. On page 519, Dr. Burks and colleagues from the USA offer a crucial review on acquired buried penis (AABP), emphasizing the necessity of a specialized approach combining genitourinary reconstructive and plastic surgery techniques unique to this condition. Dr. Netto and colleagues from Brazil contribute a well-crafted paper on evaluating and treating Vesicoureteral reflux in Brazil, providing practical guidance and up-to-date recommendations on diagnostic evaluation and therapies on page 523. The editor-in-chief also wishes to highlight the significance of these works.
Dr. Porcaro and colleagues from the USA (4) evaluated the association between prostate volume index (PVI) and prostatic chronic inflammation (PCI) as predictors of prostate cancer (PCA) on page 545. PVI, defined as the ratio between the central transition zone volume (CTZV) and the peripheral zone volume (PZV), was found to have a significant impact on the mean rate of NPC, with high PVI and the presence of PCI correlating with less aggressive tumor biology characterized by a lower tumor burden. The study suggests that PVI could offer valuable prognostic information prior to planning baseline random biopsies.
Dr. Demirtas and colleagues from Turkey conducted an intriguing study on fusion prostate biopsy (FPB) and compared the pain levels between TRUS-guided standard 12-core prostate biopsy (SPB) and MpMRI-guided FPB. Their findings, published on page 557, indicated that FPB, despite its higher cancer detection rate, resulted in similar pain levels to SPB. This was noteworthy considering FPB involves a more intricate procedure and an increased number of biopsy cores compared to SPB.
Dr. Sefik and colleagues from Turkey conducted a compelling study on the impact of preoperative renal function on survival outcomes in patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) with non-continent urinary diversion (UD). Their research, detailed on page 566, revealed that individuals with preoperative eGFR <60mL/s exhibited higher overall mortality rates and lower overall survival rates. Additionally, a greater number of patients with preoperative hydronephrosis also had eGFR <60mL/s.
Dr. Sipal and colleagues from Turkey conducted a study on page 575 to investigate the reasons behind storage symptoms (SS) following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). They aimed to determine if there was a positive correlation between preoperative and postoperative SS in patients undergoing TURP and whether initiating early solifenacin treatment in patients with high preoperative SS would be justified. The study concluded that TURP led to significant improvement in both storage and voiding symptoms. The predictive value of preoperative S-IPSS on postoperative SS was found to be significant. These findings suggest that administering 5 mg solifenacin succinate in the early postoperative period could be advantageous for patients with high preoperative SS but may not be beneficial for others. Additionally, a small prostatic volume may indicate a higher risk of postoperative SS in patients with de novo SS.
In their study published on page 585, Dr. Liu and colleagues from China investigated the prognostic significance of obesity, as measured by BMI, on Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) within a systemic inflammation context. Their findings indicated that in patients with localized RCC, obesity emerged as an independent protective factor for both cancer-specific survival and recurrence-free survival in the presence of systemic inflammation.
In their study on page 599, Dr. Vidal and colleagues from Colombia examined the impact of baseline clinical variables on overall survival (OS) and toxicity of Radium 223 (223Ra). Their findings indicated that an appropriate selection of patients is crucial for maximizing the clinical benefits of 223Ra therapy. Factors such as low baseline hemoglobin levels, high baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, and bone marrow involvement were identified as key determinants that negatively affected overall survival in the study. The researchers suggest that 223Ra treatment should be considered early in the treatment regimen to optimize outcomes.
Dr. Kretschemer and colleagues (10) from Germany present an interesting study on page 632 regarding the impact of perioperative complications related to artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation on explantation rates, continence, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Their conclusion suggests that postoperative infections have a negative effect on device survival following AUS implantation. Additionally, they found that long-term functional outcomes and HRQOL are comparable between patients with and without perioperative complications.
During these challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, I urge everyone to read the insightful editorial penned by Dr. Francisco Sampaio, our Emeritus Editor. Dr. Sampaio sheds light on crucial aspects of the pandemic, offering valuable insights. This issue features one of the most comprehensive reports on the clinical practice of Urology during the COVID-19 pandemic, authored by Dr. Carneiro and colleagues, which can be found on page 501. We trust that readers will find this edition of the International Brazilian Journal of Urology both informative and engaging.
