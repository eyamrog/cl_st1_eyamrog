The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), initially identified in Wuhan, China in late December 2019, swiftly disseminated to various nations, prompting its classification as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. Prior to the detection of the first COVID-19 instances in Brazil, preemptive measures were enacted, including modifications to the legal framework to facilitate isolation and quarantine procedures. Subsequently, as case numbers surged, additional strategies were introduced, primarily aimed at mitigating mortality rates and severe illness. Brazil has proactively implemented rapid and comprehensive preparedness initiatives, even as Latin America has yet to confirm its initial cases. The efficacy of these early readiness efforts warrants examination in forthcoming investigations.
In the past two decades, significant global transformations have had direct implications on both individual and global health and economic landscapes, thereby directly influencing the public health of populations across numerous countries. The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, originating in Wuhan, China in late December 2019, rapidly disseminated to various nations, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. PHEICs are exceptional occurrences that present substantial public health risks on a global scale, necessitating a coordinated response. In Brazil, national public health emergencies (NPHE) are delineated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) as events that pose threats to public health, arising from outbreaks or epidemics (due to unforeseen agents, reemergence of eradicated diseases, or high severity), natural disasters, or instances of inadequate population assistance, surpassing the state's response capabilities.
In the current pandemic context, which signifies a significant Public Health Emergency (PHE), the imperative for prompt actions and responses is evident, with Emergency Health Operations Centers (EHOCs) assuming a pivotal role. These centers are activated as needed and operate within a structured framework, diligently monitoring and analyzing epidemiological data and field reports from diverse sources. Their primary objective is to provide essential support to decision-makers and technical personnel by facilitating the formulation of appropriate and timely strategies and interventions to address public health crises. In Brazil, the activation of EHOCs falls under the purview of the health surveillance secretariat (HSS), which follows the recommendations of the Event Monitoring Committee (EMC) and determines the emergency level classification (ranging from zero to III).
In the context of COVID-19 in China and the provisions of decree MH No. 2,952 of December 14, 2011, NPHE was declared in Brazil on January 10, 2020. Subsequently, on January 22, Brazil's Ministry of Health, through Decree No.188, activated the EHOC-nCoV operations center at alert level 1, which was coordinated by the Health Surveillance Secretariat. The primary goal of EHOC-nCoV was to address the SARS-CoV-2 emergency at the national level by orchestrating a cohesive response within the framework of the Unified Health System. Furthermore, EHOC-nCoV aimed to provide guidance to state and municipal health secretaries, the federal government, public and private health services, agencies, and companies on contingency plans and response measures that should be commensurate with the current risks. Following the identification of the first suspected coronavirus case in Brazil on January 27, the alert level was escalated to level 2 due to the imminent risk.
On January 28, the first EHOC-nCoV Epidemiologic Bulletin, epidemiological surveillance Guideline, and National Contingency Plan (NCP) for COVID-19 with alert levels were published. The aim of epidemiological surveillance is to provide guidance to the National Health Surveillance System and the UHS service network in identifying COVID-19 cases to mitigate the risks of sustained transmission, severe cases, and subsequent deaths. These surveillance efforts and the NCP draw upon structured documents and evidence from other countries, including China, which have dealt with epidemics like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, experiences previously unseen in Brazil. Despite this, Brazil has faced respiratory virus pandemics before, such as H1N1 in 2009, which resulted in 46,355 cases in the country by March 2010. The NCP actions are grounded in national and state plans for surveillance and clinical management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and flu syndrome (FS).
All states across the country were urged to customize the National Contingency Plan (NCP) according to their infrastructure and regional attributes, while also incorporating strategies to combat the disease within their jurisdictions. It is crucial to emphasize that the NCP is founded on data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), which is a compilation of information gathered from various nations, as well as on scientific evidence, leading to ongoing modifications in NCP protocols. Risk assessments should be conducted and regularly reassessed to enhance scientific understanding and implement measures that are suitable for the local context.
On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). In response, the Brazilian Interministerial Executive Group on Public Health (IEG-PHE) was reactivated through Decree No. 10,211 issued on the same day. The primary responsibilities of this group include proposing, monitoring, and coordinating preparedness and response measures, as well as allocating budgetary resources for their implementation. Additionally, the IEG-PHE is tasked with establishing guidelines for defining local criteria to monitor the effectiveness of emergency measures and preparing reports on the public health emergency situation for dissemination to relevant ministers.
Brazil officially declared COVID-19 a public health emergency (PHE) on February 3, followed by the approval of Law No.13,97916 (Quarantine Law) by the Ministry of Health on February 6. This legislation introduced a range of measures designed to safeguard the community and address the PHE arising from SARS-CoV-2, encompassing actions such as isolation, quarantine, mandatory reporting, epidemiological studies, exhumation, necropsy, cremation, and the management of deceased individuals. Additionally, it included provisions for exceptional and temporary restrictions on international travel, as well as the requisition of goods and services from both individuals and businesses, with a commitment to ensuring subsequent fair compensation. Notably, the implementation of these measures is contingent upon the availability of scientific evidence and the analysis of strategic health information.
The first case of coronavirus in Brazil and South America was recorded on February 26, 2020, in São Paulo, involving a 61-year-old man who had recently traveled to the Lombardy region in Italy, a hotspot for cases and fatalities. Subsequently, the number of cases in the region has steadily risen, prompting the implementation of various measures. On March 13, the Ministry of Health (MoH) and state health professionals issued recommendations to curb the disease's spread, aligning with the directives outlined in Decree No. 356 dated March 11. By March 20, the MoH acknowledged the presence of community transmission nationwide, emphasizing the need for a unified effort to mitigate virus dissemination. The adoption of non-pharmacological interventions such as physical distancing and quarantine hinged on the recognition of community transmission by the MoH. The contentious nature of quarantine necessitates a meticulous evaluation, drawing insights from the COVID-19 outbreak progression in countries like China, Italy, and Spain.
The disease has exhibited a surge in the number of cases, with Brazil reporting 5,933 cases and 206 deaths as of March 31. São Paulo stands as the most impacted state, recording 136 deaths and 2,339 confirmed cases, followed by Rio de Janeiro with 23 deaths and 708 confirmed cases. On March 27, the Ministry of Health (MoH) officially sanctioned the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for patients with severe forms of COVID-19. The prescribed protocol entails a five-day treatment regimen, with these medications serving as a supplementary measure alongside other forms of treatment support like mechanical ventilation, symptomatic medications, and those outlined in the treatment manual. Two national clinical studies aimed at assessing the efficacy of CQ in treating COVID-19 have received approval from the national research ethics committee (CONEP).
The escalation of cases in Brazil is occurring at a rapid pace. The Ministry of Health had implemented various measures even before the country's first case was officially reported, as detailed in Figure 1. Notably, on January 27, the World Health Organization acknowledged a significant error in the global risk assessment of COVID-19. Just three days prior, the disease was classified as having a moderate risk globally, yet it was deemed of very high risk in China and at high levels regionally and globally. This discrepancy may have impeded the timely implementation of specific international interventions, potentially contributing to the surge in cases within China and the subsequent spread of the virus to other nations, including Brazil.
Brazil has been adhering to WHO recommendations and incorporating recent scientific findings from China and Italy. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that Brazil possesses unique characteristics, particularly in terms of its population structure, which predominantly comprises young adults. Moreover, prevalent comorbidities and co-infections such as diabetes, hypertension, HIV, tuberculosis, and obesity underscore the importance of not overlooking the younger population with these health conditions.
It is noteworthy that fall is approaching in the southern half of Brazil, a period associated with an uptick in respiratory illnesses such as colds, flu, asthma exacerbations, sinusitis, pneumonia, and bronchitis. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the list of potential ailments has expanded. The combination of drier air and lower temperatures during fall and winter may heighten the risk of coronavirus transmission and the overall number of COVID-19 cases. Given the similarity in symptoms between influenza and SARS-CoV-2, the Ministry of Health (MoH) has taken proactive measures by offering free influenza vaccinations to high-risk groups. This initiative aims to assist healthcare professionals in differentiating between influenza and COVID-19 during patient screenings, thereby enhancing the accuracy of diagnoses for the novel virus.
Brazil has faced various public health emergencies in the past, including outbreaks of polio, smallpox, cholera, H1N1 (influenza A), avian influenza, yellow fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Zika. These events have significantly influenced Brazilian public health policy, prompting the implementation of control and eradication strategies, such as the successful eradication of smallpox in 1977. Notably, recent outbreaks like the H1N1 epidemic in 2009 and the Zika epidemic in 2015-2016 have left a lasting impact. These outbreaks serve as crucial lessons in epidemic management, with the Zika epidemic showcasing Brazil's scientific leadership through the identification of a link between infection and cases of microcephaly.
The H1N1 pandemic facilitated UHS in enhancing its emergency response capacity towards respiratory syndromes (RS), an ongoing initiative since 2005. Presently, UHS has established plans, protocols, procedures, and guidelines for the identification, monitoring, and management of RS-related emergencies. Numerous recommended procedures, particularly those outlined in the influenza section of the Epidemiological Surveillance Guide, are implemented in scenarios involving suspected cases of Coronavirus. Nevertheless, the primary recommendation emphasizes ruling out common respiratory illnesses and promptly adopting the influenza treatment protocol to prevent severe cases and fatalities from known respiratory diseases, as appropriate. UHS possesses the expertise and capability to address RS-related emergencies, and with the introduction of the new Coronavirus protocol, adjustments have been made to align certain recommendations with the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis. These adaptations are informed by the daily updates provided by the WHO, and each procedure remains subject to necessary modifications, underscoring the importance of its suitability in addressing potential future pandemics.
Furthermore, the country relies on a decentralized network of central laboratories in each state, known as LACENs, which possess the necessary capacity. Additionally, there is a public manufacturing chain for laboratory supplies used in diagnostic RT-PCR, exemplified by institutions like Fiocruz (Biomanguinhos). Should evidence emerge supporting the efficacy of chloroquine (CQ), Farmanguinhos and LQFEx are already established as public producers of CQ diphosphate for the treatment of malaria.
During the Zika epidemic, Brazil played a pivotal role in uncovering and reporting the correlation between the Zika virus and the surge in microcephaly cases. The initial surge in microcephaly cases was documented in Pernambuco in October 2015. Promptly responding to this discovery, the Ministry of Health dispatched technical teams to aid in the investigations and promptly informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of the unfolding situation. Following the confirmation of the Zika-microcephaly link in Brazil, where it was first observed, an initial version of the strategy to combat Aedes spp. and microcephaly was released in December 2015. WHO acknowledged Brazil's significant contribution to this crucial discovery. By May 2017, a risk assessment determined that Brazil no longer met the criteria for an emergency designation based on WHO guidelines.
Brazil is currently implementing measures to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases, primarily focusing on physical distancing. Despite these efforts, an increase in cases is anticipated in the upcoming months. Various mathematical models suggest that the virus will likely continue circulating until mid-September, with a significant peak expected in April and May. Concerns have arisen regarding the availability of intensive care units (ICUs) and mechanical ventilators required for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as well as the accessibility of specific diagnostic tests, particularly real-time RT-PCR, for early detection and transmission prevention. There is optimism that RT-PCR testing capacity will increase, and serologic/RDT tests may soon become more widely available, partly due to collaborative efforts between private and public/academic sectors (e.g., Farmanguinhos, Vale). Sentinel sites have conducted virus sequencing, and molecular biologists are currently engaging in intensive interactions.
In terms of cultural differences, the use of masks is prevalent and widely accepted in Asia, whereas it is virtually non-existent in Latin America. This practice is deeply ingrained in Asian cultures, being both culturally accepted and a part of daily routines. Additionally, masks are easily accessible for purchase in Asian countries, further contributing to their widespread use. In contrast, Latin American cultures do not have a tradition of mask-wearing. Furthermore, cultural norms such as bowing and physical contact differ significantly between these regions. These variations could potentially play a crucial role in the progression of pandemics and should be considered in the development of social science protocols.
Physical distancing is a crucial measure that should be recommended early on to flatten the epidemiological curve with minimal economic repercussions. As of the end of March 2020, Brazilian authorities have continued to advocate for physical distancing without resorting to a lockdown enforced by security forces to restrict mass movements. By effectively restricting public access to essential services only, physical distancing can help mitigate the economic impact while simultaneously controlling the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic.
We express our gratitude to Judith Recht for her invaluable critical review of the manuscript. The study conducted by Croda J et al. on the impact of COVID-19 in Brazil has provided significant insights into the current situation in the country.
