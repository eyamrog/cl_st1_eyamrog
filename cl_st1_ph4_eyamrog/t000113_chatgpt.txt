Affirmative policies are implemented to address the needs of marginalized sectors of society who have been subjected to discrimination, injustice, racism, or exclusion. In the realm of Special Education, students exhibiting gifted characteristics often go unnoticed by educators, caregivers, and society at large. Particularly, the intersectional identity of being gifted, black, and female compounds this invisibility. This research delves into the factors contributing to the obscurity of gifted black women within Brazilian educational institutions. Utilizing descriptive statistics, we scrutinize the microdata sourced from surveys, assessments, and examinations conducted by the National Institute of Educational Studies and Research.
The historical and contemporary processes of discrimination, inequality, stigmatization, injustice, social exclusion, racism, and violence have significantly impacted various sectors of the Brazilian population, including women, blacks, indigenous people, immigrants, the homeless, elderly, and special education students. The colonial history of American countries has left a lasting legacy of oppression that has affected thousands of individuals.
In the context of enhancing the educational experience for special education students in Brazil, the National Policy for Special Education from the Perspective of Inclusive Education (PNEE-EI/08) strives to facilitate their learning and foster their integration into mainstream schools by addressing their diverse educational requirements (Brasil, 2008). To achieve this goal, the policy has led to the establishment of Specialized Educational Service Classrooms (AEE), Special and Inclusive Education Centers (NUEEI), and Giftedness Service Centers (NAAHS).
Nonetheless, there remains a significant amount of work to be undertaken concerning the educational requirements of students classified as Gifted and Talented (D&T). In light of this, the primary objective of this article is to scrutinize the factors that contribute to the concealment of the trinomial black women with giftedness within Brazilian educational institutions, impeding their prompt recognition, identification, and support within the Specialized Educational Assistance (AEE) classrooms aimed at nurturing their capabilities.
The passage commences by discussing the characteristics of students with D&T in Brazilian schools and their inadequate recognition and identification in Brazil, leading to a lack of awareness among managers, peers, parents, caregivers, and educators (first invisibility). Subsequently, it delves into the attributes of female education during the colonial period, highlighting a series of historical and contemporary processes of inequality, stigmatization, injustice, social exclusion, racism, and violence that have impacted this Brazilian demographic (second invisibility). Lastly, drawing from the Social Domain-Theory (TDS), the text will explore the third invisibility factor: the education of black women.
In order to provide a theoretical examination of the triple invisibility experienced by gifted black women, we have adopted a descriptive methodology. This approach involves conducting bibliographical research, encompassing books and journals that delve into contemporary studies on Diversity and Talent Development (D&T) and Triple Disadvantage Syndrome (TDS). Our analysis involved reading and scrutinizing original publications pertaining to these subjects. To access these primary texts, we conducted electronic searches across various databases and information sources within the fields of Education and Psychology. These sources included PsycINFO, Fundación Dialnet, the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) from the Institute of Education Sciences, and Google Scholar.
Descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the microdata obtained through surveys, evaluations, and examinations conducted by the National Institute of Educational Studies and Research Anísio Teixeira (INEP).
This section will be segmented into three parts to examine the factors contributing to the invisibility of Black women: firstly, the overall lack of visibility of Design and Technology (D&T) students; secondly, the marginalization of women exhibiting D&T traits; and thirdly, the underrepresentation of gifted Black women.
In this text, the terms giftedness and talent (D&T) will be considered equivalent to what the National Council of Education of Brazil (Resolução, 2001) refers to as high abilities/giftedness (AH/SD). The decision to depart from the official nomenclature stemmed from both the inaccuracies in translation and the necessity to account for the talent development process. Initially, giftedness is conceptualized as the possession and utilization of exceptional innate abilities rooted in biology and informally nurtured (Gagné, 2018), positioning the individual within the top 10% of their peers. Subsequently, talent is viewed as the refinement of these abilities through systematic development - or competencies - that are evident in at least one domain of human endeavor, distinguishing the individual as among the top 10% most exceptional in their field (Gagné, 2013a).
In addition to the trio of giftedness, talent, and the Development Process, the Differentiating Model of Giftedness and Talent (DMGT) includes two additional elements known as intrapersonal and environmental catalysts, which serve as facilitators in the process (Gagné, 2013a). Despite being theoretically distinct, these elements are interconnected and dependent on each other as they contribute to the progressive development of talents (Gagné, 2013b). Gagné (2013a) notes that there are no clear-cut differentiation measures for these elements as they are part of a continuum within a broader dynamic process. However, giftedness is considered a fundamental prerequisite for talent. Therefore, timely identification, recognition, and support of individuals with giftedness and talent in educational settings are crucial for their talent development.
Many D&T students in Brazil face challenges due to their invisibility within society, particularly within the educational sector where they are often overlooked by teachers, educational technicians, managers, and even their own relatives and guardians. National data further confirm this invisibility across the Brazilian territory. The Brazilian Association for the Gifted of Rio Grande do Sul (ABSD-RS) estimates that 7.78% of students in Brazil fall under the category of D&T (Negrini, 2008). The School Census of Basic Education reveals that out of 47.8 million registered enrollments, there are 48,133 D&T students in regular classes (Figure 1) (INEP, 2019). This suggests that there are potentially over two million D&T students yet to be identified in Brazil, who are currently excluded from receiving the necessary support and accommodations in schools.
Freitas and Perez (2016) refer to camouflaging factors as characteristics that render these students "invisible" or seemingly non-existent, impacting their recognition, identification, and inclusion in AEE classrooms. The authors delineate three key factors: individual (e.g., low self-esteem, depression, perfectionism), familial (e.g., low parental expectations, excessive academic pressure, family conflicts), and environmental (e.g., low teacher expectations, pejorative labels such as "nerd"). These factors contribute to the under-representation and under-performance of D&T students. They impede the outward display of D&T traits, leading to diminished self-assurance, rendering these students unseen and concealing their D&T indicators from educators (Freitas & Perez, 2016). The invisibility of these D&T students is particularly pronounced among women (second invisibility) and black individuals (third invisibility).
In recent years, there has been a notable disparity in the provision of Design and Technology (D&T) education, with white students receiving more opportunities compared to their black counterparts (Acosta, 2019). Similarly, there is a gender imbalance, with men being favored over women in this field. This inequality can be attributed to various factors such as prejudice, discrimination, and institutional focus on shortcomings in special education. The repercussions of this imbalance are far-reaching, impacting the educational experiences of underrepresented talented students (Wright, Ford & Young, 2017) and perpetuating harmful myths within the educational system.
In order to comprehend the legitimizing myths that contribute to the invisibility of women in the field of Design and Technology (D&T), it is imperative to delve into the historical context of female education. This era was marked by male dominance, particularly evident in the patriarchal family structure, especially during the colonial period. Ribeiro (1987) highlights that formal education for women was deemed a social taboo in both Portugal and Brazil during this time. Women were confined to seclusion, viewed as inferior beings whose primary role was to bear children to uphold male supremacy, resulting in a significant population of illiterate women in the colony. Consequently, it is not surprising that in contemporary times, the invisibility of women among students displaying D&T indicators remains pronounced. The repercussions of this inequality and injustice, rooted in these legitimizing myths, impact the perceptions of teachers, students, and guardians regarding the characteristics of these individuals. The historical disparities in education and the absence of prominent female role models have detrimentally affected women's self-esteem, often leading to the manifestation of the "imposter syndrome," where women attribute their accomplishments to external factors rather than acknowledging their own capabilities (Freitas & Perez, 2016).
The authors of this article provided an example of the aforementioned phenomenon during the interviews conducted for the aster's project. The project's objective was to identify Design and Technology (D&T) students in a State School located on the French-Brazilian border. Consequently, interviews were conducted with teachers, parents, and students. In one particular interview with a mother of two students (a girl and a boy), the researchers observed a clear preference for the son. The mother extensively praised her son's abilities, intelligence, and talents, while describing her daughter in a more reserved manner, labeling her as obstinate and lacking intelligence. However, upon analyzing the interviews, it became evident that only the daughter exhibited D&T characteristics. This discrepancy led the researchers to conclude that this finding reinforces a pervasive myth that perpetuates the social construction of gender differences (Abad, 2018; Abad et al., 2020).
Gender, as posited by Abad et al. (2020), is a socially constructed concept that significantly shapes how individuals are perceived within society. The identities of men and women are intricately woven into social practices and relationships, often reflecting power dynamics that portray female identity as fragile, insecure, emotional, and selfless. These gender stereotypes not only create obstacles for the advancement of women in social spheres but also perpetuate legitimizing myths, such as the consistent valorization of male figures at the expense of their female counterparts. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in the cultural contexts of American countries.
Family experiences play a crucial role in reinforcing legitimizing myths during a child's formative years, influencing how individuals interact with others in adulthood. The images and perceptions of people and events that individuals hold are often shaped by objects residing in their unconscious minds. Consequently, these legitimizing myths can erect barriers to the recognition and development of female social figures. This phenomenon is exemplified by the prevalent bias towards acknowledging and celebrating male figures over their female counterparts, as evidenced in the interview excerpt and illustrated in Table 01.
Table 01 illustrates the proportional disparity in the identification of students with giftedness and talent in Brazil, with 73.1% being male and 26.9% female. This translates to a mere 14,545 female students out of a total of 47.8 million registered enrollments in Brazil (INEP, 2019).
Throughout history, stereotypes such as those based on gender, social or financial status, race, religion, and economic situation have played a significant role in shaping societal stratification and the formation and definition of oppressed groups. The Social Dominance Theory (SDT) developed by Sidanius and Pratto (1999), which is utilized in this study, seeks to integrate social psychological theories concerning intergroup relations with the ideologies and mechanisms that serve to legitimize social inequalities (Islam, 2014).
The Theory of System Justification (TDS) elucidates the subconscious inclination to uphold social hierarchies rooted in a set of ideals and belief systems. When a dominant, or oppressor group, possesses an unequal share of advantages such as social status, power, wealth, and esteemed positions, a marginalized - or oppressed group - finds themselves in an imbalanced position (Acosta, 2019). Consequently, the theory delves into the social-psychological mechanisms through which ideological frameworks become ingrained in individual attitudes and convictions (Islam, 2014). In the contemporary landscape, individuals of white descent enjoy privileges like job prospects, better nutrition and healthcare, and longer life expectancies, along with the means to pass on advantages to their offspring such as wealth, education, and social networks. Presently, black individuals and other minorities face a significantly higher risk of succumbing to Covid-19 (Dyer, 2020). Nevertheless, the portrayal of minorities and oppressed communities in society starkly contrasts with the "cultural virtues" and depiction of the dominant group, with the former often depicted as unruly, dangerous, indolent, and deceitful (Pratto et al., 2000).
Legitimating myths, as defined by TDS, encompass prejudice, assumptions of marginalized groups' inferiority, and political conservatism (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). These myths give rise to enduring ideological constructs that are institutionalized to justify existing inequalities as just and desirable (Islam, 2014). TDS elucidates how cultural ideologies, discriminatory behaviors, social roles, and inherent tendencies towards group prejudice converge to uphold social group hierarchies (Pratto et al., 2000). Consequently, it offers insights into the mechanisms that perpetuate oppression and sustain social inequalities, emphasizing that the persistence of this inequity is not merely individual but systemic in nature (Acosta, 2019).
Pratto (1994) delves into the psychological dimension of TDS, proposing the concept of Social Domain Orientation (SDG) as a key individual variable that signifies the desire for one's group to dominate and hold superiority over others. Operating as an attitudinal stance towards intergroup dynamics, ODS embodies a preference for hierarchical structures that align along a superior-inferior axis (Pratto et al., 1994). While such beliefs may offer advantages to certain group members, their adoption by marginalized groups can hinder their ability to challenge societal injustices and biases (Islam, 2014).
Hence, the legitimizing myths and society's latent, subconscious need to uphold stratified social hierarchies can impact the selection and recognition of black Design and Technology (D&T) students in Brazil. Educators must acknowledge the potential subconscious bias towards hierarchical social systems when identifying marginalized students (Acosta, 2019).
From a particular standpoint, the disparities between blacks and whites can be directly attributed to colonial education. Historically, the color white symbolized the ruling class, leading to discriminatory practices against black individuals. This bias extended to the valuation of white women, creating obstacles for black women in society (Ribeiro, 1987). Furthermore, during the colonial and imperial eras, the lack of educational institutions, educators, and overall neglect of black education significantly limited the educational opportunities available to black women (Gonçalves, 2000). Presently, these discriminatory legacies manifest in unequal educational access, below-average wages, and higher rates of unemployment among black women. Consequently, the educational achievements of black women often result in disproportionately lower occupational and income advancements (Hasenbalg, 2005).
The legitimizing myths of racist ideologies, whether explicit or covertly ingrained, permeate individuals and institutions, perpetuating throughout the life cycle and across generations. This results in the systemic confinement of black individuals, especially black women, to the lower echelons of the social hierarchy (Osorio, 2004). Consequently, black Brazilian women find themselves ensnared in a cycle of cumulative disadvantages (Hasenbalg, 2005) that persist across various stages of their lives, impacting their psychosocial development, behaviors, and perceptions. These cumulative disadvantages are evident in Table 02.
In the table, we observe the presence of gifted black female students identified in Brazil according to data from INEP (2019), totaling 377 individuals nationwide. This figure accounts for a mere 2.6% of the overall population of female students in Brazil. When juxtaposed with the extensive enrollment of Design and Technology (D&T) students throughout the country, which stands at 47.8 million, these gifted black female students represent a minute average of 0.00078870292% of the total D&T student population in Brazil.
According to Gagné's Integrative Talent Development Model (2018), it is unsurprising that the invisibility of gifted black women is particularly pronounced in the intellectual, creative, social, and perceptual domains, contrasting with their traditional prominence in the muscular and motor control domains due to their innate abilities.
The legitimizing myths that uphold stratified social hierarchies hold sway in individuals' subconscious minds due to their collective sharing among group members and society at large (Moscovici, 1984). Within the educational setting, the foundation of schooling rests upon a stratified social framework where, despite evident shortcomings, ineffective practices persist in both teacher instruction and student engagement (Acosta, 2019). Consequently, educators within this environment may not fully grasp the influence these myths wield in sustaining the existing social order (Milner & Laughter, 2015).
Considering the exposure of black Brazilian women to a cycle of cumulative disadvantages as highlighted by Hasenbalg (2005) and Erikson's developmental stages, it is evident that these factors significantly influence the trust, autonomy, initiative, constructiveness, identity, intimacy, productivity, and integrity of these women. However, one of the most detrimental outcomes of these circumstances is the profound impact on their self-esteem, encompassing aspects such as self-knowledge, self-concept, self-assessment, and self-acceptance. This impact represents a culmination of previous developmental stages where individuals establish their value systems and hone their skills (Rodríguez Estrada, Pellicer de Flores & Domínguez, 1988).
According to Rodríguez (1988), a woman's greatest shame lies in harboring negative thoughts about herself. This sentiment is particularly poignant in the context of oppressed black women, where a systematic erasure of their culture, history, talents, and virtues has rendered them invisible. This erasure not only strips them of their pride and individuality but also stifles any potential for acceptance of their uniqueness and capabilities.
The situation becomes increasingly complex for these students, particularly as numerous private and public schools have yet to adopt AEE Rooms. This observation was made during field research (Abad, 2018), despite existing public policies mandating support for D&T students. Consequently, these institutions are not in compliance with Resolution CNE/CEB nº 4/2009 from the National Council of Education, which stipulates in Article 5 the necessity of implementing AEE, specifically within resource rooms that are multifunctional and operated during the opposite schooling shift.
Teachers, being professionals with the theoretical knowledge and expertise, are ideally positioned to observe and recommend black D&T students for the school's AEE, a task that their family members and friends may not be equipped to do. This situation raises concerns about the potential hindrance to the development of these students' natural abilities and talents, leaving them entrenched in the invisibility that perpetuates a range of cumulative disadvantages. While the research is ongoing, initial findings suggest a fourth form of invisibility in Brazil, specifically affecting gifted black women from the northern region of the country.
