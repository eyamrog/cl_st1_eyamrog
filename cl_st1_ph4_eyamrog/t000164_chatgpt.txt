As the global COVID-19 pandemic progresses, it increasingly affects vulnerable populations already burdened by neglected tropical diseases. Chagas disease (CD), a neglected parasitic infection, is particularly worrisome due to its potential to cause cardiac, gastrointestinal, and other complications that could heighten susceptibility to COVID-19. The over one million individuals worldwide with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy necessitate special attention given COVID-19's potential impact on the heart, yet the pandemic also disrupts treatment access for those with acute or chronic indeterminate CD. This document, a continuation of the WHF-IASC Roadmap on CD, examines the implications of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of CD. Drawing from the limited available evidence, we offer initial guidance on testing, treatment, and patient management for those affected by both diseases, while underscoring emerging healthcare access obstacles and future research imperatives.
In 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for COVID-19, emerged as a global threat. The full extent of the biological and social ramifications of this pandemic may not be comprehended for years. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that, akin to other illnesses, COVID-19 disproportionately impacts individuals on the fringes of society, while posing a heightened risk to older individuals and those with specific underlying health conditions. These factors are crucial as COVID-19 intersects with neglected diseases worldwide, such as Chagas disease (CD), a multi-systemic disorder caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) affecting the cardiovascular, digestive, and central nervous systems. CD is endemic in much of Latin America, a region now grappling with the pandemic's devastating effects. The first reported case in Latin America was on February 26th, 2020, in Brazil; by June 30th, the region had recorded nearly 2.5 million confirmed infections and over 110,000 deaths, with numbers escalating rapidly. Various aspects of CD raise concerns in light of COVID-19: many affected individuals are socioeconomically disadvantaged with limited healthcare access, the majority remain undiagnosed, and a significant portion has progressed to the cardiac form of the disease. This paper delves into the potential interactions between CD and COVID-19 in coinfected individuals, a critical area of study as the pandemic spreads swiftly through Latin American countries where CD is endemic.
In early 2020, the Inter-American Society of Cardiology and World Heart Federation jointly published a roadmap offering a comprehensive overview of Chagas disease (CD) and outlining steps for enhancing healthcare access. Subsequently, in April, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative's Chagas Research Platform reconvened members of the roadmap writing group along with additional experts to produce a follow-up paper examining the potential impact of COVID-19 on individuals with CD. This initiative aimed to provide preliminary guidance based on the limited evidence available at the time. The group comprised various CD specialists, some of whom have been actively involved in treating COVID-19 patients or conducting research on novel treatments amidst the ongoing crisis. The ensuing document encapsulates the collective expert opinion on the co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and T. cruzi.
Chagas disease (CD) is primarily transmitted through various species of hematophagous insects, although it can also be transmitted transplacentally, through infected blood transfusions or organ donations, laboratory accidents, needle sharing among intravenous drug users (IVDU), and orally through food and drink contaminated with triatomines, their feces, or secretions from some host reservoir species. Following infection and an incubation period ranging from 15 to 40 days, the acute phase of the disease typically lasts for one to two months, succeeded by an indeterminate phase where no clinical manifestations are evident. After years of this asymptomatic period, approximately one-third of patients may progress to a chronic form of the disease characterized by organ damage, primarily affecting the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. The most severe complications of CD include stroke, sudden death from brady- or tachyarrhythmias, and congestive heart failure.
COVID-19 has intricate interactions with the cardiovascular system, operating on various levels. The SARS-CoV-2 virus specifically targets the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, predominantly found in the lungs, heart, and vascular endothelium. While the exact implications are still being investigated, this interaction could potentially incite an inflammatory response, leading to heightened myocardial injury and dysfunction. Furthermore, there remains uncertainty regarding whether COVID-19, due to its impact on the immune system, could serve as a catalyst for the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This progression may be influenced by various factors, including the type and load of parasites present, genetic susceptibility, and the immune state of the host, particularly concerning the IFN-Ɣ axis.
In chronic Chagas disease, parasitemia is typically low-level and transient; however, pharmacological and disease-induced immunosuppression can elevate the risk of parasitemia reactivation. Consequently, there is a potential concern that COVID-19 could potentially trigger a reactivation of Chagas disease. This reactivation could be attributed to various factors, including the development of an acquired hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like disease (cytokine storm) triggered by the virus itself or by treatments used for COVID-19, such as steroids, hydroxychloroquine, and other immune-modulating drugs like tocilizumab or interleukin inhibitors. The progression of Chagas disease is closely linked to interleukins, and this interaction may be influenced by parasitic factors such as parasite load and T. cruzi strain, as well as host factors like genetic susceptibility and immune status, particularly the IFN-Ɣ axis.
The pathogenesis of Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) involves a complex interaction of various processes, including tissue damage caused by parasite persistence, inflammation, autoimmunity, fibrosis, dysautonomia, and microvascular changes. Chronic and persistent infection of the myocardium triggers an inflammatory response that, while essential for controlling parasite proliferation, ultimately leads to tissue damage, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiac remodeling. This pro-inflammatory response involves the secretion of Th1 cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids, and endothelin-1, among other factors.
Similar to T. cruzi infection, direct cytotoxicity of cardiac tissue is also possible with SARS-CoV-2, which binds to the ACE2 receptor to enter type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This process can result in myocardial dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque instability, and myocardial infarction (MI). The initial immune and inflammatory responses trigger a severe cytokine storm, involving cytokines and chemokines commonly associated with the inflammatory response implicated in the pathogenesis of Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), such as interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-alpha, and CXCL10. Cases of COVID-19-related myocarditis have been documented, believed to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage caused by the host's immune response.
Further depression of ventricular function in COVID-19 patients may be attributed to various mechanisms, including myocardial infarction and microvascular dysfunction, which are also observed in T. cruzi infection. Additionally, arrhythmia is acknowledged as a potential clinical manifestation in individuals with COVID-19, potentially exacerbating arrhythmias in patients with an arrhythmogenic substrate like Chagas cardiomyopathy.
Finally, COVID-19 has been observed to potentially increase the risk of thrombotic diseases in patients, affecting both venous and arterial circulations. This heightened risk is attributed to factors such as excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. Studies have indicated an increase in procoagulative activity in the plasma of individuals with chronic cardiovascular diseases, and thromboembolic events appear to be more prevalent in those with COVID-19. However, the clinical significance of this interaction remains uncertain.
Patients with the indeterminate form of Chagas disease, typically managed as outpatients with no overt symptoms, still necessitate continuous monitoring and care, a task exacerbated by the current pandemic. Those with chronic indeterminate CD, for instance, require annual cardiac assessments as a subset progress to symptomatic disease at a rate of 2-5% yearly, with 30-40% eventually developing cardiac or gastrointestinal complications. Additionally, antiparasitic treatment, crucial for interrupting congenital transmission in women of childbearing age, demands a 2-month regimen with regular monitoring and laboratory tests due to potential side effects. The essential care for these patients is likely to face obstacles during the pandemic, given the risks of SARS-CoV-2 exposure during healthcare visits or while using public transportation for appointments, as well as the potential delays in routine care due to the healthcare system's focus on COVID-19 cases.
Moreover, upon more meticulous evaluation utilizing advanced technologies like echocardiography, Holter monitoring, and magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement, a subset of patients initially categorized as indeterminate-phase individuals could potentially be reclassified as having Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) owing to the identification of fibrotic regions accompanied by wall motion irregularities. This suggests that a certain fraction of those currently labeled as indeterminate cases might be at risk of developing arrhythmias or other cardiovascular issues when confronted with a cytokine storm akin to that induced by COVID-19.
Atypical chest pain, abdominal pain, and nausea are nonspecific symptoms associated with upper digestive CD involvement, and have been linked to both the pulmonary and extrapulmonary clinical presentation of COVID-19 (31, 32). Conversely, constipation as the primary symptom of lower digestive tract involvement due to T. cruzi infection contrasts with diarrhea, the predominant gastrointestinal (GI) symptom observed in extrapulmonary forms of COVID-19. The presence of GI symptoms, extensively documented in COVID-19 case series and occurring in 3-11.6% of COVID-19 patients (31), has been correlated with high ACE2 expression in the GI tract, suggesting the potential for virus mutation towards increased transmissibility, decreased virulence, and multiorgan infection (31). In cases where GI symptoms common to both diseases manifest in an individual residing in a high SARS-CoV-2 transmission area, consideration must be given to either CD progression or COVID-19, taking into account the implications for mutation and transmissibility.
There is a growing body of evidence indicating a link between coronaviruses and neurological disorders. Research on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown that coronaviruses have neurotropic properties. A systematic review of literature up to April 2020 has identified various neurological disorders associated with COVID-19, such as encephalitis, demyelination, and neuropathy. There is a possibility that COVID-19 could trigger the development of chagasic neuropathy, a condition occasionally seen in chronic Chagas disease.
Maternal-fetal transmission of T. cruzi typically occurs in approximately 5% of pregnancies involving mothers with chronic Chagas disease (CD) (35). The level of parasite load plays a significant role in determining the likelihood of congenital transmission (36). The extensive immunological response triggered by COVID-19 raises uncertainties regarding its effects on T. cruzi parasitic load. If it is discovered that COVID-19 exacerbates parasitemia in pregnant women with CD, the risk of maternal-fetal transmission could potentially increase. Given the importance of screening infants born to T. cruzi-infected mothers, disruptions in access to care resulting from the negative impact of COVID-19 could pose significant challenges (37, 38).
Immunosuppressed patients face an elevated risk of severe COVID-19, particularly those with aggressive underlying conditions, ongoing immunosuppressive treatments, or lymphopenia. The excessive production of cytokines during COVID-19 infection can result in significant tissue damage, especially in the lungs. This heightened inflammatory response in immunosuppressed individuals with COVID-19 and concurrent CD could impact the progression of CCC and potentially trigger CD reactivation. This reactivation may be due to viral interference, as seen in HIV infection, or the immunosuppressive therapies administered for COVID-19, which are often linked to the severity of underlying conditions. Conversely, enhancing the immune response at this juncture is crucial, whether through antiviral medications or cytokine-blocking agents like IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-a. Additionally, there is a need to consider the potential risk of inducing autoimmune disease activation in individuals with asymptomatic COVID-19, leading to a possible CD reactivation.
The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries affected by Chagas disease raises significant concerns for various reasons. The population afflicted with T. cruzi infection, exceeding six million individuals globally, is aging, susceptible to Chagas cardiomyopathy, burdened with multiple comorbidities, and faces socioeconomic vulnerabilities. These factors collectively heighten the potential impact of COVID-19 within this population, particularly in the context of strained and overwhelmed healthcare systems.
The incidence of new Clostridium difficile (CD) infections, estimated at around 30,000 annually, has shown a decline in recent decades, resulting in a higher proportion of individuals living with CD being older or aging. While more than 80% of COVID-19 cases exhibit mild or asymptomatic symptoms, severe cases are notably more prevalent among older adults. A retrospective study conducted in Wuhan revealed a mortality risk increase ranging from 0.03 to 1.17 with each additional year of age. Furthermore, an analysis utilizing data from multiple countries indicated a case fatality ratio of 4.5% in individuals aged over 60, in contrast to 1.4% in those under 60, with the highest rates observed in patients over 80. Notably, in the United States, a significant 78.6% of deaths have been reported in individuals aged 65 and above.
Over one million individuals in the Americas are afflicted with Chronic Cardiovascular Conditions (CCC), with underlying cardiovascular disease serving as a significant risk factor for hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19. The occurrence of acute cardiac injury resulting from COVID-19 has been documented at 8% among hospitalized patients, with a Chinese study revealing a much higher prevalence in fatalities (59%) compared to those who recovered (1%). In Italy, cardiovascular disease was found in 30% of COVID-19 related deaths, while in a U.S. cohort of 1305 hospitalized patients, individuals aged over 60 and those with a Charlson Comorbidity Index exceeding 3 exhibited a higher likelihood of mortality.
Several studies have highlighted the significant presence of comorbidities in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and those afflicted with severe cases of COVID-19. A study conducted in Brazil revealed an average of 2.7 chronic comorbidities in CD patients, with 51.2% having hypertension and 23.8% diabetes mellitus among 168 patients in São Paulo. Similarly, a study in Switzerland involving 137 patients found 2.9% with diabetes and 17% with hypertension. Notably, hypertension and diabetes have been linked to elevated mortality rates in COVID-19 cases in China, with rates of 7.3% and 6.0% respectively, and were more prevalent in severe hospitalizations compared to non-severe cases. Diabetes was also a prevalent factor in a third of deaths in an analysis of Italian data. These comorbidities are indicative of the older age demographics that are particularly vulnerable to both CD and COVID-19.
As the pandemic spreads from Europe and the United States to the Global South, it is significantly affecting vulnerable populations. In the U.S., COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted Black and Latino communities. The CDC reports that these groups have a higher incidence of infection and a greater proportion of deaths compared to their representation in the overall population. Similarly, Brazil has observed a higher mortality rate among individuals identifying as black. These disparities are intertwined with deep-rooted socioeconomic factors that dictate the ability to self-isolate and minimize exposure to the virus.
Furthermore, social vulnerability has been extensively documented among individuals with CD (59), with certain groups bearing a disproportionate burden of the disease, such as indigenous populations, the rural impoverished, and migrants, encountering specific obstacles in healthcare access. Those residing at or near the poverty line are particularly susceptible to the economic repercussions of the pandemic, with experts cautioning that the progress made in poverty reduction over the years is now at risk. The United Nations forecasts a 3.2% contraction in global GDP for 2020, potentially resulting in an additional 34 million individuals plunging into extreme poverty (60). This deteriorating economic landscape further endangers healthcare accessibility for individuals with CD, who frequently confront the dilemma of allocating resources between medical expenses and other critical needs. Many of these individuals are employed in the informal sector or in roles lacking paid leave or health coverage.
Individuals with Crohn's disease (CD) may exhibit hesitancy in seeking medical care at clinics due to concerns about potential exposure to COVID-19, leading them to delay addressing CD-related complications. Reports indicate a decrease in service utilization and delayed treatment for chronic conditions since the pandemic's onset. The emotional toll of CD, compounded by fears of disease progression, is exacerbated by limited access to mental health services and traditional support systems during the pandemic. Those with CD who contract COVID-19 may experience heightened anxiety. As the pandemic becomes a more entrenched aspect of daily life, innovative approaches from patient advocacy groups, social workers, mental health professionals, and others are essential to ensure continued support for individuals with CD.
While the guidelines for screening and diagnosing Chagas disease (CD) have not changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of testing is contingent upon how the diagnosis will impact the short-term management of the individual being tested. Urgent testing is still recommended for pregnant women, infants born to seropositive mothers, and individuals about to undergo immunosuppression. Screening of blood donations remains crucial. Patients displaying clinical syndromes suggestive of CD should also undergo urgent testing for proper evaluation and therapy. Pregnant women from CD-endemic regions should be screened to assess the risk of maternal-fetal transmission. Currently, widespread screening of asymptomatic individuals from endemic areas may be delayed, depending on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and local guidelines, until it can be safely conducted. It is important to note that while antiparasitic therapy may be necessary, it can generally be postponed until the patient can attend lab testing and follow-up appointments without significant risk of exposure.
The following preliminary recommendations are offered for patients with Crohn's disease who contract COVID-19. These recommendations are categorized based on the specific form of Crohn's disease that the patient presents with.
In cases of acute Chagas disease (CD) resulting from congenital, vector, oral transmission, transfusion, laboratory accidents, or other routes, prompt initiation of antiparasitic treatment is typically recommended, even amidst the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. In instances where a patient is coinfected with both acute CD and COVID-19, it is crucial to administer timely antiparasitic therapy for CD; however, healthcare providers must exercise caution and consider the severity of COVID-19 symptoms during treatment.
Congenital Chagas disease (CD) presents as acute cases with effective treatment and minimal side effects. COVID-19 tends to be mild in infants and children (63). In cases where the child is asymptomatic for COVID-19, prompt administration of antiparasitic treatment is recommended upon confirmation of T. cruzi infection (37).
Reactivation: Patients should be hospitalized for antiparasitic treatment with benznidazole (BZN) for a duration of 60 days. In cases where the full treatment period cannot be completed due to adverse events, efforts should be made to continue treatment for as close to the full 60 days as feasible, potentially utilizing anti-histaminic and/or anti-inflammatory medications. Of specific concern is reactivation involving myocarditis or meningoencephalitis, given the potential for COVID-19 to impact the vascular, nervous, and myocardial systems. Monitoring of such cases should be meticulous, particularly in the intensive care unit.
In cases where immunosuppression is necessary without the risk of reactivation, the initiation of antiparasitic treatment may be postponed until the patient can securely visit the clinic, taking into account self-isolation recommendations and the potential exposure to COVID-19. Nevertheless, it is crucial to closely monitor the reactivation of Chagas disease, particularly if there are indications of organ involvement. This monitoring should involve regular clinical follow-ups, direct microscopy using concentration techniques on peripheral blood and/or secretions, and, if feasible, quantitative PCR testing during a COVID-19 infection in adherence to local guidelines and protocols.
From an individual health management perspective, individuals with asymptomatic infection (presenting as the indeterminate clinical form of Chagas disease) are those who show evidence of T. cruzi infection but lack signs of organ damage, particularly in the cardiovascular or digestive systems. This absence of organ damage is typically determined through the assessment of non-specific symptoms and the utilization of tests with low sensitivity for early organ damage detection, such as electrocardiograms, chest X-rays, and barium swallow and enema procedures. Regardless of whether antiparasitic treatment is administered, it is advisable for these individuals to undergo regular monitoring to assess their clinical status over time and promptly identify any treatment failures or clinical progression.
In light of the current epidemiological circumstances, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the risk-benefit ratio when considering referring a patient to a healthcare facility. Safeguarding patient well-being by minimizing the risk of new COVID-19 infections is paramount. Simultaneously, it is imperative to efficiently allocate healthcare resources from a public health standpoint. Non-urgent outpatient appointments and routine cardiovascular and gastrointestinal screenings for stable CD patients could potentially be postponed. Embracing telehealth platforms for virtual consultations is strongly advised, along with providing guidance to patients on promptly contacting healthcare institutions if they experience symptoms indicative of either CD exacerbation or potential COVID-19 infection.
In patients with Chagas disease (CD) lacking organ involvement, etiological (antiparasitic) treatment is advised for acute cases and the majority of chronic cases in the indeterminate form or with mild cardiomyopathy (5, 65). Amid the ongoing pandemic, two crucial considerations arise: 1) the characteristics of the drugs and their potential interactions with existing COVID-19 treatments, and 2) the urgency of administering anti-T. cruzi medications.
Benznidazole (BZN) and Nifurtimox (NFX) are the two drugs approved by regulatory agencies for the antiparasitic treatment of Chagas disease (CD). Benznidazole, also known as N-benzyl-2-nitro-1-imidazole acetamide (BZN), is a nitroimidazole that hinders the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins in Trypanosoma cruzi. Nifurtimox, identified as 5-nitrofuran 3-methyl-4-(5’- nitrofurfurylideneamine) tetrahydro-4H-1,4-thiazine-1,1-dioxide (NFX), is a nitrofuran derivative with a mechanism of action involving multiple reduction and oxidation reactions of its nitro component. This process results in the generation of various reactive oxygen species by parasite enzymes, which then interact with cellular macromolecules, proving lethal to the parasite. Additionally, NFX causes the deactivation of a crucial trypanosomal enzyme, trypanothione reductase.
In both instances, the mechanism of action remains incompletely elucidated, necessitating a thorough investigation into the potential interactions between Benznidazole (BZN) and Nitazoxanide (NFX) with commonly prescribed medications for COVID-19. Given that BZN undergoes hepatic metabolism to a significant extent (95%) and NFX to an even greater degree (>99%), vigilance for hepatotoxicity when these drugs are co-administered with anti-COVID-19 agents is imperative and warrants close monitoring.
The etiological treatment of T. cruzi infection is typically considered urgent only in specific circumstances (67). Although adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with BZN and NFX are generally non-severe (68), it is advisable to closely monitor patients initiating a BZN or NFX regimen to promptly detect side effects and monitor hepatic and hematologic function (53, 69, 70). To mitigate unnecessary risks, during the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying the initiation of etiological treatment protocols for chronic T. cruzi infection without organ involvement is a reasonable approach to minimize exposure to COVID-19 in healthcare settings and due to limitations in follow-up care resulting from reduced in-person visits. However, individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 may require immunosuppressive therapy, and vigilant monitoring to promptly identify Chagas disease (CD) reactivation is recommended. In instances where there is clinical and/or parasitological evidence of reactivation, immediate initiation of treatment with BZN or NFX is imperative (67).
In cases where a patient is currently undergoing treatment with BZN or NFX, it is advisable to maintain the ongoing treatment regimen while also implementing self-quarantine measures to prevent potential exposure to COVID-19. Utilizing telehealth tools for treatment monitoring is recommended, along with minimizing visits to healthcare facilities unless necessary for essential laboratory tests to monitor hepatotoxicity and hemogram changes associated with BZN or NFX, or in the presence of concerning adverse drug reactions. Should a patient being treated with BZN or NFX contract symptomatic COVID-19, healthcare providers may need to evaluate the situation on an individual basis to determine whether treatment interruption is warranted, based on the severity of symptoms and treatment requirements. Notably, there is no documented evidence of drug interactions between antiparasitic medications for Chagas disease and drugs used to manage COVID-19. Treating Chagas disease in its indeterminate form is considered non-urgent.
Table 1 presents a comprehensive overview of recommendations for administering etiological treatment for CD amidst the ongoing pandemic, considering the specific type of CD the patient has and their current COVID-19 status.
In every instance, the etiological treatment of Chagas disease necessitates diligent monitoring, encompassing regular assessments of liver enzymes and blood count parameters. For further insights, refer to the study conducted by Echeverria et al. in 2020 (67).
COVID-19 has been linked to various cardiac manifestations, such as cardiac arrhythmias, Type 2 and 1 myocardial infarction, heart failure exacerbations, and acute fulminant myocarditis. The potential connection between COVID-19 and CCC is likely due to shared immunological pathways, with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) playing a crucial role in heart function, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus—common risk factors in CCC patients. ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), commonly used in CCC management, can elevate ACE2 levels. Despite concerns about increased susceptibility to COVID-19, there is no current evidence supporting the discontinuation of ACE or ARBs. Major cardiovascular societies like ESC, ACC, AHA, CCS, and the IASC recommend the continuation of these medications even in the presence of COVID-19 manifestations, a stance that should also apply to CCC patients.
In patients with CCC undergoing treatment for cardiac arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation or severe ventricular arrhythmias with amiodarone, there is a possibility of additional interactions. This is particularly concerning due to the potential for prolonged QT intervals associated with medications suggested for COVID-19 treatment, like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which could elevate the risk of torsade de pointes.
Patients diagnosed with Chronic Cardiovascular Conditions (CCC) are advised to maintain their regular treatment regimens even amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To minimize the exposure of these vulnerable individuals to the virus, outpatient facilities are encouraged to utilize telehealth services where feasible. While adhering to stringent hygiene protocols and self-care practices, essential cardiac assessments such as EKG, echocardiograms, stress tests, or Holter monitoring can be conducted or, if necessary, postponed, with a careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio and the prevailing SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates in the respective region. Prompt medical attention is imperative if a CCC patient experiences new-onset arrhythmias, stroke, or exacerbation of chronic heart failure, as any delay in hospitalization could jeopardize their health. Given the strain on healthcare facilities in certain areas due to the pandemic, the management of acute cardiac events may be compromised, underscoring the importance of timely intervention to safeguard the well-being of CCC patients.
Table 2 presents a compilation of potential interactions between cardiovascular medications commonly prescribed for Chagas disease cardiomyopathy (CCC) and certain medications proposed for the treatment of COVID-19.
Our current comprehension of the potential interrelations between CD and COVID-19 remains limited, highlighting the significant need for future research in this area. The recommendations outlined in this document should be viewed as preliminary and subject to refinement and adjustment as our understanding of both diseases progresses. Table 3 delineates some of the key gaps in our current clinical knowledge. It is imperative to draw upon research from other disciplines to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of both diseases, the social and psychological impacts of the pandemic on individuals with CD, emerging access barriers in the pandemic context, the economic repercussions, and the unique circumstances of vulnerable populations such as migrants and indigenous communities.
While COVID-19 presents a global threat affecting individuals indiscriminately, it poses a specific danger to those with cardiac disease (CD). Both conditions are more prevalent among marginalized populations with limited access to adequate healthcare and heightened exposure to risk factors. COVID-19 proves more fatal in individuals with cardiac ailments, diabetes, and obesity - conditions commonly found in those with CD. The precise mechanisms of COVID-19's impact on CD remain unclear, but there is a theoretical risk of exacerbating cardiac dysfunction or triggering acute CD reactivation through disease-induced immunomodulation or therapeutic immunosuppression. The economic repercussions of the pandemic disproportionately affect the most vulnerable socioeconomic groups, further hindering individuals with CD from accessing necessary care for either condition. The pandemic's focus on urgent medical care limits resources for diagnosing, treating, and monitoring CD patients, potentially leading to clinical deterioration, increased maternal-fetal transmission, and underdiagnosis - all significant concerns predating the pandemic.
Barriers to accessing appropriate care for cardiovascular disease (CD) were recently outlined in the WHF-IASC Roadmap on CD (5). Employing a comparable framework, Table 4 evaluates the potential impact of the pandemic on significant obstacles to cardiovascular disease healthcare.
The conclusion of the pandemic in Latin America remains distant, with the full extent of its impact on healthcare and healthcare access yet to be fully understood. Chagas Disease (CD) has historically been a neglected illness, with limited awareness among healthcare professionals and at-risk populations, compounded by insufficient government commitment. Amid the current focus on combating the pandemic, raising awareness about CD may prove even more challenging in the short term. However, this crisis could also present an opportunity to bolster public interest in addressing comorbidities and improving healthcare access for marginalized communities. Adapting to the current circumstances necessitates a reevaluation of conventional approaches to CD and other neglected diseases, ensuring progress towards their elimination amidst emerging public health threats. It is crucial to recognize that both CD and COVID-19 are deeply intertwined with socioeconomic factors, underscoring the importance of implementing comprehensive programs that prioritize the healthcare rights and access of the most vulnerable populations.
