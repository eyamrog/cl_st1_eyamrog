The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to an unparalleled global pandemic with significant socioeconomic implications. Given its relatively recent identification, this virus, originating in Wuhan, China in December 2019, remains largely enigmatic to the scientific community. The primary objective of this research is to elucidate the spatio-temporal correlations between the occurrence, fatality rates, and the frequency of rapid and RT-PCR testing in Minas Gerais.
Methods: This study employs a quantitative analysis of secondary data utilizing a cross-sectional research design. Data on incidence, mortality, date of the initial COVID-19 notification, and the quantity of rapid and RT-PCR tests were sourced from the Laboratory Environment Manager, e-SUS epidemiological surveillance platform, and SES-MG. The Pearson coefficient was computed to determine the degree of correlation among the pertinent variables. Descriptive statistical methods were employed to offer a thorough insight into the distribution of incidence, mortality, and testing rates within the region.
Results: The study identified positive correlations between the rate of rapid tests and incidence, as well as between the rate of RT-PCR tests and incidence/mortality. Furthermore, at the municipal level, there was a negative correlation observed between incidence, mortality, the rate of rapid tests, and RT-PCR tests with the number of days elapsed since the First Notified Case. This trend was also noted at varying intensities within different health macro-regions.
Discussion: The variability in the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 within Minas Gerais, alongside the disparities in testing rates (including rapid and RT-PCR tests), could potentially be attributed, at least partially, to the varying timelines of virus introduction across different municipalities and macro-regions. This speculation suggests that such discrepancies may be influenced by the intricate dynamics of regional and inter-regional population movements.
For the past 50 years, various coronaviruses have been recognized as causative agents of respiratory infections. However, in December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases with an unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, Chinese authorities successfully isolated and identified a new strain of coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, which shares a phylogenetic relationship with other beta-coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (the virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS-CoV (the virus accountable for Middle East respiratory syndrome). Recently, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The virus is primarily transmitted through inhalation of expelled droplets and aerosols, as well as via fomites, which are contaminated objects and surfaces that can facilitate transmission through contact with infected carriers and subsequent contact with the face, eyes, and nose (1, 3). To curb the widespread transmission of the novel coronavirus, nations have implemented social isolation measures, including the closure of international borders, resulting in severe and enduring economic repercussions globally (2, 3).
As of August 3, 2020, a total of 17,918,582 confirmed cases and 686,703 deaths had been reported globally (4). The confirmation of cases in most countries exhibits an exponential increase, particularly during the initial phases of the outbreak (3). Comparing fatality rates among countries is challenging due to varying outbreak stages, likely influenced by factors such as population testing coverage, age demographics, overall health status, and healthcare infrastructure (3). In Brazil, the first confirmed COVID-19 case emerged in São Paulo on February 26, 2020 (2). As of August 4, 2020, the country has recorded 2,753,925 cases and 94,746 deaths attributed to the virus (5).
Minas Gerais (MG) plays a crucial role at the national level due to its status as the second most populous Brazilian state, with an estimated population of 21 million people. Situated in a strategic location near states with high incidence rates, such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, MG is particularly susceptible to the transmission of COVID-19.
In the latest update of the human infection protocol for SARS-CoV-2 by the Government of the State of Minas Gerais on July 20, it was stated that both reverse transcription assays followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunological techniques, such as rapid tests, can serve as diagnostic criteria. It is important to highlight that negative results from rapid tests do not necessarily rule out the possibility of suspicious cases (6).
The significance of prevention, proper care, and treatment of infections, along with the necessity of establishing epidemiological correlations between tests and the temporal and geographical patterns of the disease in Minas Gerais, is underscored by the high rates of viral transmissibility, hospitalization, and mortality. These factors undoubtedly strain the healthcare system and have detrimental effects on the local economy.
The study aimed to conduct a temporal and geographical analysis of data concerning the quantity of rapid and RT-PCR tests conducted, as well as the incidence and mortality rates, to enhance comprehension of COVID-19 epidemiology in Minas Gerais and the patterns of diagnostic test utilization. By examining these epidemiological trends, insights can be gained into the regions most at risk, enabling health institutions to better prepare for test and equipment logistics, ultimately enhancing COVID-19 pandemic management.
Quantitative assessment of secondary data was conducted within a cross-sectional epidemiological research framework, employing both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques for analysis. The outcomes were derived utilizing the Matplotlib (version 3.2.1), Pandas (version 1.0.5), and Statistics libraries within the Python™ programming language (version 3.7.7). The analysis was carried out in the Project Jupyter© programming environment.
The data retrieved from the COVID-19 database on the Minas Gerais State Health Secretariat (SES-MG) website includes the Incidence and Mortality rates for COVID-19 per 1000 inhabitants between March 4, 2020, and June 22, 2020. Additionally, it provides the date of the initial disease notification for municipalities that reported COVID-19 cases up to July 10, 2020.
The number of rapid tests per 1000 inhabitants conducted between March 4 and June 22, 2020 was obtained through the DATASUS system, specifically by accessing the e-SUS Epidemiological Surveillance platform (e-sus VE). Additionally, the number of RT-PCR tests conducted between March 4, 2020, and June 21, 2020, was extracted by accessing the Laboratory Environment Manager platform.
Initially, the data was consolidated based on the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) code for municipalities, and descriptive statistical analyses were conducted. Cities that displayed values exceeding two standard deviations from the mean in the distribution of rapid tests (>12.58) and RT-PCR tests (>4.84) were deemed outliers and subsequently excluded to mitigate their impact on the overall dataset. This led to the exclusion of 23 cities for rapid tests and 28 for molecular tests. Subsequently, mean, median, and quartile values were calculated for the city distributions based on the type of test administered.
The quartiles of the two distributions were evaluated based on the macro-regions they encompassed. Subsequently, the quantity of rapid and molecular tests conducted was determined for each health macro-region.
The inferential analysis involved the computation of Pearson's coefficients (8) to determine the correlation between the data collected from the aforementioned systems. The data utilized for this analysis pertained to the timeframe spanning from March 4 to June 22, 2020. Only cities with at least one reported case of the disease by June 22 were included in the analysis. Consequently, 215 cities without any COVID-19 notifications were excluded from the study. The variables considered for establishing Pearson's coefficients included incidence, mortality, rates of rapid and molecular tests, and the date of the initial disease notification. These coefficients were calculated at both the municipal and health macro-region levels.
As of June 22, 2020, 638 cities had confirmed at least one positive case of COVID-19, with 215 cities remaining unaffected by the disease. Within the group of cities reporting cases, 72 days had elapsed since the initial notification on March 4 in the state, with 319 cities (less than half of Minas Gerais' 853 municipalities) recording at least one instance of the disease by early May.
However, it is noteworthy that the most densely populated municipalities have documented positive cases dating back to mid-March 2020 (refer to Figure 1). Particularly striking is the fact that the two largest cities in the state accounted for a total of 7815 COVID-19 cases, representing 26.12% of the overall reported cases up to the examined date of June 22. These cities also reported the initial instances of the disease as early as March.
Cities that had not reported any cases of COVID-19 up to the point of analysis tended to be smaller in population size and had lower rates of both rapid and molecular testing, as indicated in Table 1, when compared to cities in the contrasting group. Notably, there was a significant concentration of disease notifications in the Central, Northern Triangle, and Southeast health macro-regions. Conversely, the Northeast, Jequitinhonha, and East macro-regions accounted for over 40% of the 215 cities that had not reported any cases of the disease up to the date of analysis.
The cities within the health macro-regions of Central, South Central, South, and Northern Triangle collectively accounted for 59% of the cities positioned above the third quartile of the RT-PCR test rate, falling between 1.1 and 2.8. Conversely, an examination of the same quartile for rapid tests, ranging from 3.4 to 12.58, displayed a more evenly distributed representation across various regions. Nevertheless, cities situated in the Central and Northern Triangle regions continued to dominate this category. Notably, the Central, Central South, and Northern Triangle regions exhibited the highest test rates, encompassing both rapid and molecular tests.
Both rapid and RT-PCR tests conducted for the detection of COVID-19 align with the incidence and mortality rates as depicted in Figure 2. The Pearson correlation coefficients at the municipal level reveal a positive correlation of +0.39 between rapid tests and the incidence rate, and a slightly lower positive correlation of +0.21 between RT-PCR tests and the incidence rate. In terms of the mortality rate, the correlation coefficients were 0 for rapid tests and a positive correlation of +0.12 for RT-PCR tests.
However, the temporal correlation was notably more pronounced, as illustrated in Figure 3. When examining the municipal level, the analysis revealed coefficients of -0.11 for the association between the elapsed time of the First Notified Case in Minas Gerais and rapid tests, -0.22 for RT-PCR tests, -0.25 for the incidence rate, and -0.19 for the mortality rate in relation to the first notified case.
The application of the same analysis to the health macro-regions serves to highlight the association more prominently. By grouping cities into larger regions, the impact of outlier cities, characterized by a test rate per thousand exceeding two standard deviations from the average and being small in size, is mitigated on the overall total. The correlation coefficients, as calculated using Pearson's coefficient, reveal significant relationships: -0.59 between the elapsed time of the first reported case in Minas Gerais and rapid tests, -0.25 between the first reported case and RT-PCR tests, -0.70 between the first reported case and incidence rate, and -0.71 between the first reported case and mortality rate.
The regions with the highest concentrations of COVID-19 cases in the state of Minas Gerais are the health macro-regions Central, Southeast, Northern Triangle, Vale do Aço, and South, collectively accounting for over 73% of all cases in the state. Each of these regions includes at least one city of significant importance, either as a metropolis or a strong regional and sub-regional center, with the exception of Vale do Aço, which borders the Central region and was the site of the first reported case of COVID-19 in the state.
Similarly to the incidence rate, the mortality rate also exhibits a regional distribution pattern, as evidenced in the present study. The Vale do Aço, Northern Triangle, and Southeast regions displayed the highest mortality rates, with the Central region recording the highest absolute number of deaths. Drawing from existing literature, it can be deduced that this territorial distribution pattern is influenced by anthropogenic and environmental factors that facilitate virus transmission. These factors include climatic conditions, transportation networks, economic activities, and air pollution. (References 11-15)
Adda (2016) posits that the spread of influenza viruses in the twentieth century coincided with human movements, as there was a notable correlation between the spread of COVID-19 within a region and various factors, including economic activity and transportation accessibility, particularly over long distances. This assertion finds support in Candido et al.'s (2020) study, which confirmed a heightened disease spread linked to increased air travel distances. Given the similarities in transmission, it is anticipated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus will spread in a similar manner. Indeed, Jia et al. (2020) illustrated, in the context of China, a strong connection between human mobility across regions and disease incidence rates. Additionally, the authors identified a relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) and population size, which diminishes in predictive power over time, hinting at the virus's potential migration towards economically diverse and less affluent areas.
Understanding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within a territory necessitates consideration of factors such as population size, economic activity, and transport flow (12, 17, 18). Additionally, the mortality rate exhibits a comparable territorial distribution pattern in Brazil (19).
The negative correlations observed in the analysis of the time elapsed between the first notified case in the municipality and the first notified case in the state suggest potential heterogeneity in the introduction of the virus into the territory. This is particularly evident when considering the incidence and mortality rates, which appear to be lower when the first case is reported later. Candido et al. (2020) established the spatio-temporal flow of COVID-19 in the Brazilian territory, highlighting that the health macro-regions of the Northern Triangle, Central, Central South, South, and Southeast were the initial points of entry for the virus into Minas Gerais. These findings align with previous studies in Brazil and China, indicating that more affluent regions tend to receive the virus before less affluent areas.
A stronger negative correlation, characterized by varying coefficients and increased intensity, was observed when analyzing the data at the health macro-region level. This heightened effect suggests that SARS-CoV-2 tends to persist for an extended period within the sub-region where it initially emerged, indicating that interregional transmission follows the local spread. In the context of Brazil, the virus appears to disseminate through two primary mechanisms: spatial transmission, where the virus moves from metropolitan regions to other areas, and hierarchical transmission, which occurs within sub-regions where key regional cities facilitate the spread of COVID-19 to lower hierarchical locations.
At the municipal level, there existed a positive correlation between the rate of rapid tests and incidence, as well as the rate of RT-PCR tests and incidence across the state. Furthermore, the rates of RT-PCR tests and mortality displayed a positive correlation, primarily concentrated in three health macro-regions (Central, Central South, and Northern Triangle). Additionally, a significant negative correlation was observed between time and test rates at both the municipal and regional levels.
In the study by Bergman A. et al. (2020), the incidence rate over time is influenced by various biological factors such as the interaction between microorganisms and hosts, the size of the susceptible population, the contagiousness of the infection, and the frequency of testing. Additionally, the incidence rate is indicative of the organizational capacity and infrastructure of the health sector within a specific region. It was observed that wealthier regions tend to have greater access to testing resources, a finding that was supported by the results of this study.
While the present research yields valuable findings, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. The methods employed, particularly the use of the Pearson coefficient for correlation, lack the support of additional studies on the movement of people or the spread of diseases within the state of Minas Gerais, making them less sensitive tools for pinpointing the underlying causes of the phenomena under investigation. Furthermore, the univariate analysis restricts our understanding of the individual contributions of each variable to the overall effect. Despite these constraints, the procedures utilized in conjunction with existing literature offer valuable insights and pave the way for further research to elucidate the nature of the observed associations.
It is important to acknowledge that the rate of testing can significantly impact both the incidence and mortality rates, given that the diagnostic criteria for the disease rely on these tests. Consequently, it is anticipated that regions with higher testing rates will likely exhibit higher reported incidence and mortality figures. Consequently, areas with limited testing capabilities may experience substantial underreporting (21). The current methodological approach would be more suitable in a scenario where testing rates are uniform across all regions, which is often not feasible.
The uneven spread of COVID-19 throughout the region coincides with the areas of highest affluence within the state. This observation suggests that the most interconnected regions experienced a more significant surge in both incidence and mortality during the initial stages of the pandemic. Consequently, there was a corresponding rise in testing rates across all regions, with a preference for rapid tests in general and RT-PCR tests in areas exhibiting higher mortality rates.
Certainly, this study delves into the spatio-temporal dynamics of test rates, incidence, and mortality in Minas Gerais, shedding light on the impact of urban center hierarchy levels and demographic factors within the region. These results enhance our comprehension of the correlation between territorial dynamics and COVID-19 epidemiological parameters, potentially aiding health systems and authorities in crafting effective strategies to combat this deadly disease. By leveraging insights into the demographic and hierarchical characteristics of the territory, proactive measures can be developed to mitigate the spread and impact of COVID-19.
