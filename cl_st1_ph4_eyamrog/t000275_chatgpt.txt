The coronavirus infection, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as a potentially fatal disease, posing a significant global health challenge. Originating in Wuhan, China, its rapid spread has led to a pandemic that has overwhelmed healthcare systems in numerous countries, resulting in substantial social repercussions and a high number of fatalities, notably in Italy and Spain. Stringent measures, both within and outside of hospitals, have been enforced to mitigate the transmission and dissemination of COVID-19. Within the realm of surgical practice, a considerable volume of non-essential or elective procedures have been postponed or canceled until the resolution of the pandemic, while urgent and oncological surgeries have continued. This publication aims to underscore and provide guidance on adaptations utilizing commonly employed laparoscopic materials to minimize the risk of transmission and contamination for healthcare professionals attending to surgical patients.
The novel coronavirus, initially identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has rapidly disseminated globally. By March 2020, the World Health Organization had classified it as a pandemic, prompting heightened healthcare vigilance worldwide. The ensuing health, social, economic, and political ramifications, aimed at curbing the global transmission, have significantly affected all nations. The primary objective now is to concentrate on optimal strategies to address this pressing issue.
The rapid dissemination of COVID-19 has led to a surge in research studies focusing on various aspects such as transmission, clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, and potential treatments. Despite the abundance of recent data, a significant portion lacks robust scientific validation. The current tumultuous environment poses challenges for conducting studies with rigorous scientific methodologies. Hospitals globally are grappling with shortages in essential resources, including beds, healthcare personnel, mechanical ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE) crucial for disease control and safeguarding healthcare workers. The primary mode of disease transmission is through direct contact or respiratory droplets expelled by infected individuals through coughing or sneezing.
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the operations of various healthcare departments, particularly surgical units, necessitating frequent revisions to established protocols.
Guidance and literature regarding the appropriate conduct for healthcare providers in the surgical setting are notably lacking. Recognizing this gap in knowledge, expert organizations such as the Brazilian College of Surgeons (CBC) have taken proactive steps to address the dearth of scientific evidence by issuing broad safety protocols for both patients and healthcare professionals.
There is evidence suggesting that laparoscopic procedures have the potential to disperse aerosols carrying viral particles. However, the comparative safety of conventional open access procedures versus laparoscopic techniques in the context of COVID-19 remains uncertain. Devices like the AirSeal iFS® System or Laparoshield ™ Laparoscopic Smoke Filtration System, designed for filtering laparoscopic smoke to eliminate particles, cells, and viruses, have been developed and approved for use. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies demonstrating their efficacy, particularly against COVID-19. Moreover, the availability of these devices during a pandemic, especially in low-income countries, is limited.
In this article, we introduce a straightforward and replicable technique utilizing readily available materials that can be implemented for surgical patients amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during laparoscopic or robotic procedures. Given the current pandemic situation, there is a notable absence of robust evidence regarding the efficacy of virus transmission and mitigation strategies, along with limited data on the outcomes of different interventions. Nevertheless, a set of recommendations can be proposed to mitigate potential viral spread. The adaptation outlined here is designed to specifically reduce aerosol dispersion during surgical procedures, with the primary goal of safeguarding healthcare professionals.
In the context of operating room setup, the current standard mandates the use of personal protective equipment for all procedures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes hats, goggles, gloves, N95 masks, face shields, and sterile garments for all healthcare professionals participating in the surgical procedure. Ideally, negative pressure rooms should be the norm. The induction and establishment of the airway should be conducted with only an anesthesiologist and assisting nurse present, minimizing the number of professionals in the operating room. Once the airway is secured and ventilation is established, the rest of the surgical team can enter to assist with patient positioning, table preparation, and any necessary surgical procedures.
Materials: Prior to commencing the procedure, ensure the availability of two standard plastic suction or irrigation tubes, a water seal apparatus, and a sterile transparent plastic bag designed for covering the laparoscopic optics. Ensure that the nursing assistant prepares a solution of 2 or 2.5% hypochlorous acid (HClO) by diluting 25 mL of hypochlorous acid in 975 mL of water to yield a total volume of 1000 mL, as recent reports have indicated its efficacy in virus eradication. Alternatively, another viable chemical option is chlorine dioxide stabilized at 7%, achieved by diluting 5 mL of the compound in 1000 mL of water. These solutions are intended for filling the water seal reservoir to immerse the distal end of the plastic cannula (refer to Figure 1). Subsequently, securely seal the reservoir with the appropriate cover and attach the initial suction tube to the water seal at orifice A, as illustrated in Figure 2A.
In the context of trocars placement and pneumoperitoneum, it is advisable to employ the Veress needle puncture technique for initiating the pneumoperitoneum. It is crucial to maintain intraperitoneal pressure at the lowest safe level during the initial puncture, typically aiming for levels between 10-15 mmHg to ensure optimal surgical conditions. Prior to inserting any trocar, it is essential to confirm that the trocar's valves are securely closed to prevent unintended air leakage from the pneumoperitoneum into the operating room.
In terms of incision length, it is preferable to keep it as small as possible in order to prevent air leakage.
Practical measures involve the insertion of trocars, with the cable tip from connection A linked to a trocar other than the one housing the insufflator. Subsequently, the second cable should be utilized, with its tip connected to water seal orifice B and the other tip linked to a slow flow continuous suction device. Once the system setup is confirmed, the trocar valve can be opened for operation.
An alternative method for conducting smoke evacuation suction in the absence of the aforementioned chemical agents involves attaching a ventilation machine filter to the end of the suction cable linked to the surgical trocar. The filter system's remaining section is then connected to a second plastic suction cable, guiding the smoke towards a water seal device containing saline solution.
When utilizing electric scalpels or ultrasonic devices, it is advisable to minimize their usage and opt for the lowest coagulation power to mitigate the dispersion of aerosol particles.
Deflation: Upon completion of the procedure, the infusion of carbon dioxide ceases, and intracavitary air is aspirated to its maximum extent through one of the trocars. Following the completion of aspiration and achieving a flat abdomen in the patient, the surgeon's arm is then positioned beneath the previously mentioned sterile transparent plastic bag. This bag partially covers the surgeon's arm and the entirety of their hand.
One hand, covered, removes the trocars in a "wrapped" manner, while the other hand presses the plastic to fully seal the incision site, safeguarding professionals from potential secretions and aerosol spray, as well as preventing dissemination in the room. Disposable materials are then placed in standard plastic disposal bags, which are closed and the neck twisted to create a knot, ensuring a sealed environment from external factors.
The COVID-19 pandemic holds significant relevance in the current global landscape, garnering extensive attention in scientific journals, popular media, and social platforms. The consensus suggests that fostering global cooperation and facilitating information exchange are crucial for improving patient outcomes and safeguarding healthcare professionals. Consequently, the implementation of safety initiatives is now more imperative than ever before.
The heightened need for medical assistance and the strain on healthcare systems globally have highlighted a critical shortage of essential medical supplies, including personal protective equipment (PPE) and patient care resources. Simultaneously, urgent medical procedures, including emergency, critical, and oncological treatments, must proceed without delay, even in the absence of fully controlled viral conditions.
In a recent study by Shaoqing et al. (12), a cohort of 34 patients necessitating hospitalization for severe COVID-19 symptoms following surgery was examined. The patients, initially asymptomatic and devoid of any indications of prior viral infections, were residents of Wuhan who underwent surgical procedures, subsequently developing post-operative pneumonia. These results indicate a potential correlation between the surgical intervention and the acceleration and exacerbation of COVID-19 disease progression.
Healthcare professionals in direct contact with COVID-19 patients face an elevated risk of contracting the virus. Procedures that generate aerosols, such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal cannula therapy, mask ventilation, and intubation, pose a higher risk of transmission. Lima et al. recently published a technical note aimed at surgeons and emergency physicians, providing guidelines on safely performing cricothyroidostomies and tracheostomies, offering alternative approaches throughout the procedures. Similarly, minimally invasive surgeries utilizing carbon dioxide insufflation to elevate intra-abdominal pressure can also disperse aerosols. Richard et al. demonstrated environmental contamination by blood and bodily fluids during rapid pneumoperitoneum deflation in standard conditions.
Recent cases have demonstrated that not only subclinical patients can effectively transmit the virus, but they can also contaminate others after recovering from the acute disease, contingent upon the viral load. These findings underscore the necessity for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the implementation of aggressive measures to ensure the safe handling of healthcare professionals throughout all stages of patient care. It is imperative that every healthcare professional engaged in treating patients during the COVID-19 pandemic adheres rigorously to the prescribed guidelines for hand hygiene and the proper use of PPE.
The effectiveness and limitations of the reported method for reducing aerosol dispersion should be acknowledged, as studies with stronger evidence are currently lacking. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where uncertainties and a lack of high-quality information prevail, sharing preliminary data or techniques may be beneficial. However, it is crucial to recognize the necessity for future studies to validate these findings and techniques.
Practical measures and their systematization in surgery can effectively mitigate viral transmission to healthcare professionals involved. The dispersion of aerosols in the operating room can be curtailed through straightforward interventions, eliminating the necessity for costly or occasionally inaccessible equipment.
