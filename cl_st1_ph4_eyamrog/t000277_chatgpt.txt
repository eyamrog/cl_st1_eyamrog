Amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the surgical community is confronted with the potential risk of infection among healthcare professionals engaged in surgical procedures, prompting concerns and inquiries regarding the most appropriate surgical approach under these circumstances. In an effort to offer guidance to surgeons, drawing upon numerous protocols that have been published to date, the Brazilian College of Surgeons has issued recommendations on this matter. The primary objective of this technical note is to consolidate information from various publications and recommendations put forth by Surgical Scientific Societies globally, with the specific aim of furnishing guidelines pertaining to laparoscopic access during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates heightened surveillance among surgical healthcare workers who are at risk of infection during surgical procedures. The pressing issue of determining the most appropriate surgical approach is paramount. The Brazilian College of Surgeons has issued recommendations based on various protocols to assist surgeons in navigating this challenging landscape.
It is crucial to emphasize that the current recommendations are derived from a synthesis of guidelines provided by various scientific societies and preliminary publications. Given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, these recommendations may require frequent updates to ensure their relevance and effectiveness.
Non-emergency procedures should be postponed to free up hospital beds, intensive care units, and ventilators, with the aim of enhancing healthcare capacity. Additionally, the risk of infection for a patient undergoing elective surgery could potentially elevate their morbidity and mortality rates.
Educating the surgical team on the proper use of protective equipment is crucial. It is imperative that all team members receive training on the correct protocols for utilizing this equipment. These training sessions play a vital role in reducing the transmission of viruses and preventing the loss of equipment, particularly in the face of current shortages. This underscores the significance of regular training specifically tailored to pandemics.
Establishing a dedicated surgical unit for patients afflicted with COVID-19 is crucial in mitigating the spread of the virus.
The experiences documented in centers across the United States, Canada, and Singapore highlighted several key points:
A dedicated surgical center has been designated for the treatment of all COVID-19 cases, ensuring minimal foot traffic and the removal of non-essential items such as personal belongings like cellphones, pens, and keys.
The operating room should only contain the necessary surgical equipment required for the procedure.
The post-anesthesia recovery process should ideally take place within the surgical center under the supervision of a competent medical team before the patient is transferred to a designated isolated area.
The transportation of the patient to and from the surgical center, ICU, or isolated room must adhere to stringent protocols, ensuring minimal contact with individuals not directly involved in the patient's care.
Surgeries that require reduced operating time and minimize the exposure of the surgical team are recommended for consideration.
All patients should ideally undergo a thorough interview to assess the potential risk of COVID-19 infection or contamination. It is advisable to conduct rapid immunologic testing to promptly gauge the urgency of surgical intervention. Additionally, COVID-19 testing can aid in identifying asymptomatic carriers. Some authors suggest utilizing thoracic CT scans as a screening tool, particularly for patients scheduled for abdominal CT scans.
Common safety measures, akin to those implemented for other viral infections with potential transmission in surgical settings, should be adhered to. Emphasis must be placed on utilizing eye protection or full facial protection devices such as face shields. While the Ministry of Health advocates for the use of N95/PFF2 masks, it is worth noting that a recent study revealed the size of the coronavirus-19 to be between 50-200nm, whereas N95 masks can only filter particles larger than 300nm. Despite this discrepancy, the N95 mask still demonstrates a 95% efficacy rate in this context.
The use of two pairs of gloves is recommended to minimize the risk of contamination during removal. Similarly, the surgical gown should be removed by a different healthcare professional, such as the assistant nurse, to adhere to proper infection control protocols.
The surgical procedure should ideally be conducted by the most proficient surgeon available, ensuring a high level of expertise and skill in the operating room. Furthermore, it is recommended to limit the presence of individuals in the surgical field to only those who are absolutely necessary for the procedure to minimize distractions and maintain a focused environment.
The introduction and removal of surgical instruments through the trocars should be meticulously executed, with attention also given to maintaining cleanliness. It is crucial to rigorously inspect the sealing valves and rubbers to prevent any potential leakage of the pneumoperitoneum. Whenever feasible, it is advisable to minimize the number of puncture sites. Employing effective sealing methods around the incisions, such as balloon trocars or suture cerclage, is highly recommended. Trocars should only be withdrawn once the pneumoperitoneum has been completely emptied.
There is a lack of specific studies assessing the dissemination of the coronavirus through aerosol dispersion produced by pneumoperitoneum. However, previous research on other viral diseases strongly advises caution in managing pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic procedures. It is recommended to employ filtration mechanisms during the inflation and emptying of pneumoperitoneum and maintain the minimum intra-abdominal pressure between 10-12mmHg. Various recommendations advocate for maintaining a closed system pneumoperitoneum. When emptying the pneumoperitoneum, it is crucial to minimize carbonic gas dispersion to the surgical environment. Ideally, a tube should be connected to the trocar less frequently used during the operation, with the other end linked to a filtering device placed at a safe distance of at least 2 meters from the surgical team. Some suggest using water-sealed devices or closed systems like those used for intra-abdominal chemotherapy (PIPAC), although these may not be universally available. If there is no emptying mechanism, it is advised to close the valve in the inflation working trocar before turning off the CO2 flow from the insufflator to prevent contaminated CO2 from being pushed back into the insufflator. Additionally, minimizing time in the Trendelenburg position is crucial to reduce the impact of pneumoperitoneum on lung circulation and function, lower susceptibility to pathogens, and decrease postoperative complications among COVID-19 patients.
Previous studies have illustrated the dispersion of pathogen aerosols generated by electrocautery smoke, a phenomenon that may also be relevant to COVID-19 transmission. Particularly in laparoscopic procedures, the smoke can escape into the surrounding environment at elevated pressures caused by pneumoperitoneum. Research indicates that the use of electric or ultrasonic instruments for a duration of 10 minutes during laparoscopy results in a higher concentration of particles compared to open surgeries. This can be attributed to the limited gas mobility within the abdominal cavity, leading to a higher concentration of particles. Consequently, the risk of exposure is greater in laparoscopic procedures than in open surgeries. It is crucial to avoid excessive cauterization and adjust the electrocautery intensity to the minimum necessary level. Similar precautions should be taken with ultrasonic devices, as they have the potential to generate blood and tissue particles.
Intracorporeal anastomosis is recommended over extracorporeal anastomosis to reduce the risk of fecal aerosol dissemination and sudden depressurization of the pneumoperitoneum. Nevertheless, the decision to opt for this approach should be carefully considered in light of potential drawbacks such as prolonged operative time, increased pneumoperitoneum duration, and the surgeon's level of expertise.
The surgical specimens should be extracted after the pneumoperitoneum has been emptied. Hybrid video-assisted procedures are discouraged because they lack control over the gas. Drains should only be used when absolutely necessary, as placing them through trocar incisions under laparoscopic vision can heighten the risk of uncontrolled gas dispersion to the external environment.
While there are recommendations supporting the laparoscopic approach in specific cases, it is crucial to assess this decision on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the duration of pneumoperitoneum required and the surgical trauma recovery associated with the procedure. The advantages of opting for the laparoscopic approach must be carefully weighed against the potential risk of viral aerosol dissemination. In instances where patients have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, it is essential to explore nonsurgical treatment options or less invasive therapies whenever feasible.
It is crucial to emphasize that these recommendations are founded on the principles of safe video laparoscopy surgery, taking into account other infectious diseases like hepatitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, rather than focusing solely on Covid-19. Consequently, these guidelines are subject to ongoing revisions as new evidence emerges. Additionally, it is essential to assess these recommendations on an individual basis, considering the unique setup of Surgical Services and the personal expertise of the surgeons.
