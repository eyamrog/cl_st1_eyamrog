The emergence of Covid-19 was first documented in Brazil in February 2020, with the initial reported fatality occurring on March 17. Subsequently, the virus spread rapidly across the nation, resulting in over 9,000 reported deaths within a span of less than two months. These reported fatalities pertain to individuals who tested positive for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, a diagnostic tool that identifies the genetic material of SARS‑CoV-2, confirming the presence of the virus. However, this figure likely represents only a fraction of the actual number of deaths, as PCR testing has primarily been conducted on hospitalized patients exhibiting symptoms consistent with Covid-19 and, in certain regions, as part of post-mortem examinations. It is reasonable to infer that numerous deaths have occurred among suspected cases that lack a confirmed diagnosis. Consequently, the key challenges lie in accurately estimating the extent of underreported Covid-19-related deaths and determining the true magnitude of the impact of the pandemic.
Information regarding the cause of death is typically obtained from the death certificate (DC), a standardized international document that is expected to be completed by physicians in Brazil. Within the DC, the cause(s) of death are documented in Part I, which includes the immediate, intervening, and underlying causes. For the purpose of mortality statistics, the underlying cause of death (COD) is specifically identified, typically being the cause listed on the lowest line of the DC if the causal sequence leading to death has been accurately recorded. This underlying COD signifies the disease or circumstances of injuries that set off the chain of events culminating in death. In instances involving SARS-CoV-2-related illnesses, the COD must be specified as Covid-19, with clinical suspicions lacking laboratory confirmation being denoted as suspected Covid-19. It is crucial to note that pre-existing comorbidities that may have exacerbated the disease should not be classified as the underlying COD.
The DC form is issued in three copies: the first (white) copy is for the municipal, state, and federal health services, which are responsible for monitoring causes of death with the Mortality Information System (Sistema de Informações Sobre Mortalidade – SIM). The second copy (yellow) is intended for the Civil Registry (CR) notary offices for the registration of the death and the preparation of a copy of the DC for the family, which is essential for the burial process. The third copy (pink) is to be kept by the issuing institution.
For the inclusion of deaths in the Mortality Information System (SIM), the death surveillance service within the municipal health department actively seeks death certificates in hospitals, other institutions, and notary offices, adhering to international standardized guidelines for determining the underlying cause of death. In instances where deaths are not yet confirmed as Covid-19 related, efforts are made to expedite the investigation of unspecified causes by actively searching through medical records in hospitals and laboratories to verify and confirm the disease. Subsequently, deaths recorded at the municipal level are transmitted to both state and federal authorities to compile the national database. Due to the qualification procedures within the mortality information system, there is a lag in the final registration process, with varying delays observed across different municipalities and causes of death.
Deaths recorded in notary offices nationwide are included in the CR statistics system, which is overseen by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística – IBGE). While this system relies on information from notary registrations and does not serve the primary purpose of monitoring vital events within the territory, it plays a crucial role in facilitating the prompt identification of unusual incidents by municipal, state, and federal health authorities across the country.
Over the past decade, it is estimated that the CR and SIM systems have effectively captured the majority of deaths in densely populated urban areas where epidemics are concentrated. However, a significant portion of these deaths still remain ambiguously defined or imprecise, with approximately 35% of deaths investigated in 60 cities in 2017 falling into this category. In the context of Covid-19, there is a high likelihood of substantial underreporting of deaths due to challenges in case identification, particularly for individuals who were not tested via PCR. Many individuals succumb to the virus before receiving their test results, and issues such as delayed or premature specimen collection, as well as improper handling and shipping, can lead to false negative results. Consequently, the timely inclusion of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the SIM database hinges on physicians having access to accurate PCR test results when completing death certificates.
The primary issue at hand revolves around the criteria for suspected Covid-19 cases. A significant challenge arises from the absence of a national protocol from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, leading to varying guidelines among institutions regarding the proper completion of Death Certificates (DCs) related to the disease. This discrepancy is particularly evident when comparing these guidelines to those recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO suggests categorizing any case with clinically compatible symptoms as a suspected Covid-19 case, even in the absence of confirmatory laboratory results. The completion of DCs during the epidemic is further complicated by the lack of adequate medical care during the terminal phase of the illness and the challenging working conditions faced by physicians in urgent and emergency settings. Consequently, a significant number of Covid-19-related deaths being attributed to other causes could potentially distort the accurate assessment of the true mortality rate associated with this specific disease.
The disease caused by the novel coronavirus was initially identified in China through the examination of seven cases of pneumonia of unknown origin that emerged in late December 2019 among hospitalized patients, eventually progressing to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Consequently, pneumonia and SARS are factors within the causal chain leading to severe cases of Covid-19 that can result in fatality, with sepsis also being a potential complication. Deaths attributed to respiratory failure or categorized as ill-defined/undetermined causes may obscure other contributing factors, with the actual underlying cause of death potentially being any specific ailment. Findings from a 2017 study investigating respiratory failure cases in medical records revealed that this diagnosis stems from various underlying causes, ranging from chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases (accounting for 24% of 518 reclassified cases) to external factors. Previous research has shown a similar trend for ill-defined causes and sepsis, suggesting they too encompass a wide array of underlying causes.
The data on deaths in the recent Covid Registral panel, provided by the National Association of Natural Persons Registers (Associação Nacional dos Registradores de Pessoas Naturais – ARPEN Brasil), are sourced from the country's notary offices. A single cause of death was chosen based on hierarchical criteria for the causes listed in the certificate. To assess mortality from coronavirus, deaths mentioning Covid-19 in the death certificate were identified, followed by those mentioning acute respiratory syndrome, pneumonia without SARS, respiratory failure (with or without sepsis), sepsis, and ill-defined causes when they were the sole stated cause. It is evident that cases of SARS increased in capital cities where confirmed Covid-19 cases rose in 2020. Upon analyzing three capital cities with a significant increase in Covid-19 cases, a notable surge in respiratory failure as a cause of death was observed in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, while there was also an uptick in pneumonia-related deaths in Manaus.
The data from the Civil Registry, while acknowledging its limitations, suggest that deaths attributed to coronavirus may be inaccurately recorded under other causes, exhibiting varying patterns across municipalities. Consequently, there is an immediate and imperative need to confront the task of constructing a more accurate depiction of the epidemic, which significantly affects the lives of the Brazilian populace. Alongside the expansion of laboratory testing for suspected cases and fatalities, with enhanced quality control measures, two further strategies are proposed to facilitate a prompt evaluation and deeper understanding of the Covid-19 mortality landscape within the nation's municipalities:
Consider all deaths registered as SARS from March 2020 onwards as suspected cases of Covid-19-related deaths.
Municipalities exhibiting potential underreporting of Covid-19 related deaths can be identified by observing instances where the number of deaths attributed to pneumonia, respiratory failure, septicemia, or ill-defined causes surpasses the anticipated maximum threshold for weekly occurrences of each cause. This determination is made by referencing a control diagram specifically designed to monitor deaths stemming from these particular causes.
These two approaches will enable health municipal departments to conduct investigations of deaths due to Covid-related causes, thereby obtaining a more accurate estimation of the actual number of deaths from the disease. In a collaborative study with Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais and Vital Strategies, the health departments of three municipalities in the country initiated an investigation process based on these guidelines in March. The outcomes of this study are expected to offer a more precise assessment of the extent of likely underreporting of deaths attributed to Covid-19.
In the context of an epidemic like Covid-19, the availability of accurate and timely cause-of-death data is crucial for devising strategies to contain the disease's spread and enhance healthcare service delivery. Research indicates that for every reported death, there may be numerous undetected cases within the population. Therefore, we recommend integrating the proposed protocols outlined in this article into the existing procedures for investigating causes of death within municipal health departments. It is imperative that federal, state, and local authorities, as well as society at large, develop a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks and implement effective preventive measures accordingly.
