Abstract
Many patients with COVID-19 have thromboembolic complications that worsen their prognosis. Herein, the authors 
propose a modified version of the CHA2DS2-VASc score, including 1 point for COVID-19, so that prophylaxis to 
protect against thromboembolic events would be indicated before the condition becomes severe. The advantages of 
this modification would be prevention of the patient’s condition worsening due to thromboembolic problems and 
reduction of the likelihood of a need for intensive care and mechanical ventilation, reducing mortality. 
Keywords: COVID-19; coronavirus; anticoagulants; thrombosis; prevention; hospital mortality.
Resumo
Muitos pacientes com COVID-19 apresentam complicações tromboembólicas que acabam piorando seu prognóstico. 
Os autores propõem uma modificação no escore CHA2DS2-VASc, incluindo 1 ponto para COVID-19, para, desse modo, 
indicar profilaxia de eventos tromboembólicos antes do agravamento do quadro. As vantagens dessa modificação 
seriam evitar a piora do paciente por problemas tromboembólicos, bem como a necessidade de internação em 
unidade de tratamento intensivo e de ventilação mecânica, e diminuir a mortalidade.

INTRODUCTION
Since infection by COVID-19 was first described, 
the severe respiratory syndrome associated with the 
disease has caused rapid increases in admissions to 
intensive care units (ICUs) and elevated mortality of a 
group of patients.1 During a pandemic, it is necessary 
to avoid saturation of health systems, both public 
and private, and in particular of ICUs. The principal 
relevant finding in the lungs is presence of platelet 
thrombi and fibrin in small arterial vessels, which fits 
perfectly with a clinical scenario of coagulopathy.2
Since there is no consensus-approved treatment 
in this situation and considering the possibility of 
thrombosis associated with infection by coronavirus 
in certain cases, recently-acquired experience and 
findings of still-embryonic scientific studies has 
shown that effective anticoagulation can prevent or 
reverse the prothrombotic state in some patients.2,3
PROPOSAL
We have observed that, coincidentally, the group 
of patients who respond poorly to the COVID-19 
infection (Figure 1)4 and die are the same patients 
whose CHA2DS2-VASc scores indicate risk of stroke, 
transitory ischemic episode, peripheral emboli, and 
pulmonary thromboembolism (Table 1).5,6 According 
to this score, a patient is considered high risk if 
they score 2 points or more, intermediate risk if 
they score 1, and low risk if they do not have risk 
factors.6 Our proposal, therefore, is to add 1 point to 
the CHA2DS2-VASc score (Table 1) for patients who 
have COVID-19 and use the new score to indicate 
prophylactic anticoagulation for patients with a 
high risk of thrombosis according to the score, in 
phase 2 of the disease (Table 2). The objective is 
to prevent the patient’s condition from worsening 
because of thromboembolic problems, avoiding the 
need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation.7
The idea is to proceed in a similar manner as 
with risk of thromboses and emboli according to the 
existing scores and initiate prophylaxis to attempt to 
avert occurrence of events that have contributed to the 
worsening clinical status of these patients.1-3 In this 
communication, the authors propose modifying the 
scoring of the CHA2DS2-VASc score and studying its 
validity, with the objective of reducing the number of 
critically patients who progress to phase 3.
