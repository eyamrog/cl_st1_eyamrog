Objective: This study aimed to translate and validate the Brazilian version of the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP). Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a municipal hospital in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, involving the evaluation of 161 patients within the first 24 hours of their emergency arrival using ESP. Exploratory factor analyses and reliability analyses were performed using Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's Omega. Results: The analyses indicated a suitable structure for the instrument's purpose, with two sections revealing two factors instead of the anticipated one-dimensional structure. Despite this deviation, the sections with two factors exhibited interpretability and theoretical consistency, with the factors demonstrating internal consistency. Conclusion: The Brazilian version of the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP) exhibits satisfactory psychometric properties based on the internal structure of the instrument. Future research should explore the correlation between the instrument's scores, clinical diagnoses, and relevant covariates impacting mental health outcomes.
Emergency services in general hospitals are integral components of the Psychosocial Care Network in Brazil, as outlined by the Psychiatric Reform Law (Brasil, 2001) and Ordinance MS/GM No 2048, November 5, 2002 (Brasil, 2002), which designate psychiatric emergency care to be within the purview of emergency rooms (ER) in general hospitals. Patients may present themselves spontaneously or be referred by other psychosocial care services to address crises, anxiety disorders, mental health issues, and intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances. Notably, individuals with primary complaints related to mental health constitute a significant portion of those seeking emergency services. A study conducted between 2009 and 2014 (Moulin, Evans, Xing, Melnikow, 2018) in California, United States, revealed that 28.2% of emergency department visits were made by frequent users of mental health services, defined as those visiting the ER more than four times within a year. Similarly, a survey conducted in a hospital in Ontario, Canada (Matsumoto, O'Driscoll, Lawrance, Jakubow, Madden, Kelly, 2017) indicated that mental disorders and addictions accounted for 10.3% of ER visits, 8.7% of admissions, and 20% of inter-hospital transfers. The research highlighted respiratory issues, mental disorders, and abdominal/pelvic complaints as the three most prevalent diagnostic groups in the emergency room setting.
Patients with substance use disorders, suicidal ideation, or prior suicide attempts represent the most prevalent users of mental health emergency services, followed closely by individuals experiencing psychosis, altered mental status, and acute anxiety disorders. Suicide attempts necessitate thorough screening, evaluation, and recommendations for subsequent follow-up (Hashmi, Czelusta, Jabbar, Siddiqui, Shah, 2018). National data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (2017) indicate that 32% of emergency department visits are solely for mental health concerns such as anxiety and mood disorders, 18% are attributed to substance use disorders, and 50% seek care for a combination of mental health issues and addictions. Notably, in 2017-2018, 81% of patients admitted to general hospitals with mental health disorders and addictions entered through emergency departments (Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2019). Despite the high prevalence of mental health-related visits, emergency physicians receive limited training during residency in evaluating and managing psychiatric patients, particularly those at risk of suicide. Factors contributing to this gap include prioritization of medically severe cases, discomfort with psychiatric complaints, and biases (Williams, Shepherd, 2000). The literature also highlights the stigma faced by non-specialist professionals in general hospitals, as evidenced by various studies (Noblett, Lawrence, Smith, 2015; Giandinoto, Stephenson, Edward, 2018; Staton et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020).
In emergency patient care, it is crucial to differentiate between functional and organic causes of complaints, assess any associated medical comorbidities, and determine the necessity for psychiatric evaluation or hospitalization (Williams & Shepherd, 2000). Despite this importance, there is a lack of interdisciplinary uniform guidelines or algorithms that clearly distinguish between psychiatry and emergency medicine (Tucci, Siever, Matorin, & Moukaddam, 2015). Previous studies (Shepard et al., 2015; Benziger, Roth, & Moran, 2016; World Health Organization, 2013) have highlighted the link between mental disorders and organic diseases, emphasizing that the coexistence of these conditions may not be readily identified in this patient population.
Research suggests that a comprehensive history and physical examination, encompassing vital signs and mental status assessment, are essential components in the assessment of psychiatric patients during emergency situations (Wilson et al., 2017). Conversely, there is currently no standardized screening tool for discharging patients exhibiting psychiatric symptoms in emergency settings. The efficacy of a screening algorithm has been demonstrated in psychiatric diagnosis, serving as a valuable method for ruling out acute medical conditions. A study implementing the Triage Algorithm for Psychiatric Screening (TAPS) revealed that none of the patients assessed received a diagnosis or treatment for acute medical illnesses (Miller et al., 2012).
In hospitals with organized psychiatric services, the importance of systematic training for supervisors and resident physicians in diagnostic criteria and structured interviews to enhance diagnostic accuracy has been advocated, particularly when conducted under indirect supervision (Del-Ben et al., 2005). Additional strategies involve the utilization of standardized diagnostic tools, judicious use of supplementary tests, and a minimum observation period for diagnosing the initial psychotic episode (Del-Ben, Rufino, Azevedo-Marques, & Menezes, 2010). Psychiatric emergency services within general hospitals extend beyond mere stabilization of acute psychiatric conditions or referrals for full hospitalization; they serve as pivotal components in prevention initiatives, therapeutic enhancements, and psychosocial interventions (Barros, Tung, & Mari, 2010). Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that the majority of general hospitals lack on-call psychiatrists within their emergency service staff. Consequently, the implementation of a standardized instrument could enhance emergency care quality and support clinicians in their clinical decision-making processes.
The interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP) is a tool specifically crafted for health and mental health professionals tasked with addressing urgent mental health scenarios, including physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, and family physicians (Rabinowitz, Hirdes, Curtin-Telegdi, Martin, & Smith, 2013). The fundamental principles underpinning interRAI mental health assessment systems involve assessing individuals to enhance their functional capabilities and quality of life, pinpointing physical and mental health issues, and enhancing their level of independent functioning (Hirdes et al., 2020; Hirdes et al., 2002; Hirdes, et al., 2009). interRAI functions as a collaborative network comprising researchers, clinicians, and policy experts across more than 35 countries, all dedicated to enhancing care for individuals with disabilities or complex medical conditions. The interRAI mental health instruments are the culmination of extensive research and testing aimed at establishing the reliability and validity of items, outcome measures, assessment protocols, and quality indicators.
The Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP) primarily focuses on acute mental health crises but is intended to complement other tools such as the interRAI Community Mental Health, commonly utilized by mental health case managers. To effectively meet these objectives, it is crucial to define the evaluation's purpose, pinpoint psychiatric, functional, medical, and social issues that are either current concerns or have the potential to become significant problems for the individual, identify strengths, and synthesize the evaluator's observations for precise coding of the interRAI ESP Assessment (Rabinowitz, Hirdes, Curtin-Telegdi, Martin, & Smith, 2013). Given the absence of specific instruments tailored for psychiatric assessments in general hospital emergency settings, this study sought to translate and assess the applicability of the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry tool within the Brazilian context.
The adaptation of the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP) (Rabinowitz, Hirdes, Curtin-Telegdi, Martin, & Smith, 2013) followed the steps outlined in the literature (Mocking et al., 2020). Upon obtaining consent from the instrument authors, two independent bilingual translators undertook the translation into Brazilian Portuguese. Subsequently, two authors of this study synthesized the two translations, which were then subjected to back-translation by two experienced bilingual translators in the health field. Following this, a psychologist and a psychiatrist, both experts in the field, reviewed the versions and proposed modifications, which were integrated into the final back-translated instrument. A total of 44 items in the instrument underwent modifications related to semantic aspects and the naming of health services in Brazil. The final back-translated version was assessed and approved by the original instrument authors. This version was tested by four professionals from diverse backgrounds (two nurses, a psychologist, and an occupational therapist), all of whom reported no difficulties in comprehending the instrument.
The sample comprised 161 participants, including 67 (42%) men and 94 (58%) women, with an average age of 39.8 years (SD = 16.1), all recruited from a medium-sized municipal hospital in the metropolitan region of Rio Grande do Sul State. Exclusion criteria for the sample encompassed individuals with moderate to severe impairment during assessment, such as acute consumption of psychoactive substances, consciousness impairment like delirium, psychomotor agitation, difficulty in managing aggressiveness, and those unaccompanied by a family member or guardian.
Data were gathered utilizing a bespoke software application featuring the Portuguese iteration of the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP instrument version 9.1 (Rabinowitz, Hirdes, Curtin-Telegdi, Martin, & Smith, 2013). This tool comprises 13 primary sections with subcategories, assessing various mental health parameters including mood disturbances, anxiety levels, psychosis, negative symptoms, sleep issues linked to hypomania or mania, duration since substance use, injectable drug usage, tobacco consumption, withdrawal symptoms, self-harm triggers, self-harm ideation or attempts, behavioral patterns, cognitive and communication abilities, functional status, medication regimens, interpersonal relationships, support systems, life events, and environmental evaluations. Upon completion, the software generates specific risk algorithm calculations (self-risk, risk to others, and self-care index). The data exportation adheres to the internationally recognized coding standards established by the interRAI research consortium, facilitating the utilization of this data in multicenter studies. While the average time required to administer the ESP is approximately thirty minutes, the acute nature of certain conditions may impede completion in the absence of additional informants (Hirdes et al., 2020).
Descriptive analysis, encompassing central tendency and dispersion, was conducted to assess the distribution, frequency, and summaries of the variables. Subsequently, parallel analysis was performed to determine the number of factors elucidated by comparing empirical eigenvalues with simulated values as suggested by Timmerman and Lorenzo-Seva (2011). Two data simulation techniques, parametric (Monte Carlo) and non-parametric (permutation of sample values) distributions, were employed. Exploratory factor analyses were then carried out to unveil the variance of the items explained by the underlying dimension, utilizing a semiparametric approximation (Shapiro & Berge, 2002) to account for the ordinal level of responses to the instrument. Standardized factor loadings exceeding 0.3 were expected to signify a suitable alignment between the item and factor, with a squared value indicating a correlation close to or exceeding 10%. To assess consistency and reliability, Cronbach's Alpha index and McDonald's omega index (Trizano-Hermosilla & Alvarado, 2016) were utilized, with values above 0.7 denoting reliability. In the section pertaining to Summary Psychiatric Information (Section K), only risk indicators were scrutinized, totaling four items. Finally, by modeling the factorial scores on each factor, the contribution to the overall ESP score was calculated through an analysis of principal components, revealing which subscales (sections) were most influential for the general mental health of the participants.
This project was conducted in compliance with the guidelines and regulatory standards for research involving human subjects and received approval under the reference number CAAE 09164119.2.0000.5349. All participants provided their informed consent by signing the necessary documentation. The ethical considerations pertaining to research involving human subjects were strictly adhered to, as outlined in Resolution no. 466/2012 (Brasil, 2012) and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association, 1997).
Table 1 presents a comprehensive overview of the psychometric parameters pertaining to the ESP sections. The table delineates the number of factors recommended by parallel analysis, the magnitude of factor loadings, intercorrelations among factors, and reliability metrics. For a more detailed examination of parallel analysis outcomes and a thorough breakdown of item factor loadings within each section, readers are encouraged to refer to the supplementary material provided.
Table 2 presents the descriptive data and componential loads of each subscale in relation to the overall score. Utilizing principal component analysis, a singular component was derived, elucidating 32% of the total variance in scores. This primary component serves as a comprehensive indicator of mental health issues evaluated by ESP. The componential loads, as depicted in Table 2, signify the correlation between the scores of individual sections or subscales with this overarching index.
The sections generally exhibited strong psychometric properties, with the exception of sections B and D, which deviated from the expected one-dimensional structure. While most sections aligned with the instrument's theoretical framework, sections B and D revealed distinct patterns warranting a two-factor structure. Section B, focusing on mental state indicators, highlighted a separation between depression and mania, while section D, centered on self-harm and harm to others, differentiated between self-aggression and heteroaggression. Notably, the negligible correlations between the factors in sections B and C suggest that behaviors may occur independently, lacking a predictable sequence. This lack of correlation underscores the potential for various behavior combinations to manifest.
The factor loadings of the items were deemed adequate, all exceeding a value of 0.30, signifying their sensitivity in capturing changes within the latent dimensions outlined by the ESP sections. Even in segments where a two-factor solution emerged, the factor loadings of the items within these factors met anticipated thresholds. The reliability metrics were also deemed satisfactory, barring section H (medicines) where all metrics surpassed the anticipated cut-off point. This suggests that responses exhibit consistency, with the presence or absence of one indicator correlating with responses to other items. In section H, Cronbach's alpha demonstrated an acceptable value, while McDonald's omega slightly fell short of expectations, likely due to the limited number of items in this section. Consequently, the level of trust in the findings can be considered appropriate.
The examination of the primary components within the sections and subsections of ESP indicated varying degrees of importance in contributing to the overall mental health index. The sections that held the most sway in determining mental health status were B (mania), E (Behavior), F (Cognition and Communication), and K (Psychiatric Summary Information). These shifts are typically observed in more severe and incapacitating conditions like bipolar disorders and schizophrenia. A study involving 200,000 individuals revealed a significant association between schizophrenia and various other disorders, including bipolar disorders. Some psychiatrists have proposed a radical theory suggesting that if disorders exhibit shared symptoms or co-occur, and if multiple genes are implicated across disorders, there might be a singular predisposing factor to psychopathology. In 2013, Caspi and Moffitt utilized data from a longitudinal study involving 1,037 participants and identified a predominant factor, termed the 'p factor,' accounting for much of the symptom variation (Marshall, 2020). Others (Lahey, Krueger, Rathouz, Waldman, & Zald, 2017) have suggested that the p factor represents a general inclination towards psychopathology, while additional factors such as stressful experiences or genetic alterations may steer individuals towards distinct symptoms. Consequently, the utilization of ESP in extensive multicenter investigations could potentially unveil common symptoms across various mental disorders and elucidate the interrelations between these conditions.
It is important to highlight that deficiencies in interpersonal connections, as highlighted in sections D (Harm to Self and Others) and I (Unsettled Relations, Supports, and Life Events), play a role in the deterioration of mental health evaluations. These findings potentially endorse more concise and traceable versions of ESP. Notably, the software's finalization offers decision-making assistance to emergency personnel across three crucial dimensions: Severity of Self-harm Scale, Risk of Harm to Others Scale, and Self-Care Index.
The Brazilian adaptation of the interRAI Emergency Screener for Psychiatry (ESP) exhibits satisfactory psychometric properties as evidenced by the internal structure of the tool. Subsequent research endeavors ought to explore the correlation between the scores generated by the instrument and clinical diagnoses, as well as with pertinent covariates associated with mental health outcomes.
