São Paulo city serves as the focal point of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Latin America. As of July 2nd, there were 134,984 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 7,370 deaths, accounting for approximately 10% of the total confirmed cases and fatalities in Brazil. The city is divided into five regions - North, East, South, Midwest, and Southeast - each exhibiting distinct socioeconomic and epidemiological profiles.
The health systems in São Paulo are currently facing challenges in controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 while ensuring adequate care, especially for infected patients with severe disease. In Brazil, it has been noted that 69% of COVID-19-related deaths occurred in individuals aged 60 years or older, with 63% having at least one identified clinical risk factor for severe disease, with cardiovascular disease and diabetes being the most prevalent. In response planning, it is crucial to identify population segments at risk for severe COVID-19, describe their sociodemographic characteristics, and analyze their geographical distribution.
The scientific community has increasingly highlighted the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on population subgroups with lower socioeconomic status. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 among residents of São Paulo city, utilizing sociodemographic characteristics derived from routinely collected public health data.
Data for this study were obtained from the most recent household-based survey conducted in São Paulo, ISA Capital 2015, which gathered information from a representative sample of non-institutionalized residents. The survey encompassed self-reported health conditions, weight and height measurements, smoking habits, and other pertinent data. Utilizing a probabilistic sample, the survey employed a two-stage sampling approach within census tracts (primary sampling unit) and households (secondary stage), resulting in a total of 4,043 respondents being interviewed. Data collection was executed through a structured questionnaire predominantly comprising closed-ended questions. Detailed information regarding the design, characteristics, and questionnaires of ISA-Capital 2015 can be found at: https://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/saude/epidemiologia_e_informacao/isacapitalsp/.
In our analysis, we incorporated risk factors for severe disease as outlined in the literature and other reputable public health sources, which were sourced from the ISA-Capital survey. Among the individuals interviewed, we specifically focused on data from 3,223 adults aged 18 years and above, for whom information regarding chronic diseases and lifestyle risk factors was accessible. The criteria for identifying individuals at risk for severe disease encompassed those aged 65 years and above, or individuals with a medical history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, current cancer, a prior stroke, obesity (defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher), current smoking habits, or moderate to severe asthma (characterized by asthma that significantly limits daily activities according to respondents). We proceeded to calculate the prevalence of one or more risk factors for severe COVID-19 based on sex, age, education, income, race/ethnicity, and the region within São Paulo city. All statistical analyses took into account the complex multistage sampling design of the ISA survey and were conducted using Stata 15.0 software developed by StataCorp in Texas, USA.
In our study, the participants comprised 47% men, 66% of whom had attained at least a secondary level of education, 51% identified as white, and 54% resided in households earning less than a minimal wage per capita.
The prevalence of single risk factors for severe COVID-19 among older adults aged 65 years and above was notably high, with hypertension affecting as many as 58% of this demographic. Conversely, among younger adults below the age of 65, obesity emerged as the most prevalent risk factor, impacting 21% of individuals. It is worth noting that, in general, risk factors were more widespread among older adults, with two exceptions: obesity and smoking were more prevalent in the younger adult population, although specific data on this is not currently available.
The prevalence of one or more risk factors for severe COVID-19 in the city of São Paulo was found to be 56.4% (4.7 million) as indicated in Table 1. This proportion was notably higher in adults under 65 years old at 51% compared to older adults at 80%. Notably, among less educated adults, specifically those with no formal education, a striking 86% were identified as having at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19, in contrast to 49% among those who had initiated university education. Interestingly, the distribution of these risk factors appeared to be similar across different income levels or racial groups, as illustrated in Figure 1.
The Southeast (59.8%), North (58.7%), and South (56%) regions exhibited a higher prevalence of one or more risk factors compared to the Midwest, where the prevalence was relatively lower at 53.8% (Table 1). This trend persisted despite the notable proportion of adults aged 65 years and older in the Midwest, although specific data on this demographic group were not presented.
In the city of São Paulo, it was observed that over half of the population, including a significant number of adults under the age of 65, exhibited at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19. Comparatively, a global estimate suggested that one-fifth of the population is at risk of severe disease, although this figure is likely an underestimate due to the exclusion of obesity, a prevalent risk factor on a global scale.
We also delineated the unequal distribution of risk factors across São Paulo city, with higher prevalence observed in the North and Southeast regions, potentially contributing to the elevated death rates. This disparity may be compounded by inequalities in healthcare resources, particularly in the North. Subpopulations with lower educational attainment, a strong proxy for lower socioeconomic status, exhibited a higher prevalence of risk factors associated with severe disease. Analysis of data from the initial weeks of the pandemic in São Paulo highlighted a clustering of COVID-19 cases in the Midwest and Southeast, while COVID-19 fatalities were concentrated in the North, Southeast, and East regions, likely indicative of disparities in healthcare access.
In order to mount an effective response to COVID-19, it is crucial to delineate the distribution of risk factors associated with severe disease within the population. This process enables the identification of vulnerabilities and facilitates the customization of prevention and care strategies to address specific needs.
The current study is subject to limitations. Risk factors were self-reported, introducing the possibility of misclassification bias. Furthermore, the ISA-Capital data only extends to 2015, failing to capture other risk factors, both known and unknown. Despite these constraints, our results enhance comprehension of the heightened impact of COVID-19 in less affluent environments and specific population subsets. Tailored response strategies will be essential to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
