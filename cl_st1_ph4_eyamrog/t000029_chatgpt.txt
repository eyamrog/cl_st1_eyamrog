Health professionals are advised to undergo a residency period lasting between two to seven years post-graduation. The rigorous demands of this training phase have been linked to compromised sleep quality, diminished exercise routines, and a sense of detachment from personal and social connections, resulting in a higher prevalence of anxiety, depression, and burnout syndrome. Consequently, conducting a scoping review to pinpoint effective strategies geared towards enhancing mental health and overall well-being among residents across various healthcare disciplines is imperative to bolster future preventive interventions.
Health professionals are strongly advised to undergo a residency period lasting between two to seven years post-graduation. These programs provide specialized training that emphasizes practical skills, fostering professional autonomy within services of varying complexity and high patient volumes. Residents are exposed to a range of responsibilities, including regulatory compliance, hospital and service management, conflict resolution, as well as clinical or surgical duties.
During this training period, residents are required to juggle learning, patient care, teaching, and managing overcrowded services within a limited workweek of no more than 60 hours. The demands of this in-service training model have been linked to compromised sleep quality, reduced exercise frequency, and a sense of detachment from family and social connections. Consequently, these challenges have been associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety, depression, and burnout syndrome among residents.
Several factors contribute to stress and diminished well-being among healthcare professionals during residency. These include extended weekly working hours, intricate educational requirements, a high volume of patients, frequent alterations in the work setting, a lack of reciprocity in professional relationships, disrupted circadian rhythms, social isolation, regular exposure to traumatic events, anxiety about errors and underperformance, low incomes, and insufficient time for self-care. These factors collectively impact the mental and emotional health of healthcare professionals undergoing residency training.
Residents experiencing such pressures often deliver suboptimal patient care and exhibit a higher likelihood of committing errors. Additionally, they demonstrate elevated levels of substance abuse, alcohol consumption, and suicidal ideation, with suicide being recognized as the second most common cause of death among medical residents.
Many residents, even upon recognizing the necessity for assistance, refrain from seeking mental health services due to constraints in their schedules, feelings of guilt regarding the need for service coverage, apprehension about the stigma associated with being deemed incapable of fulfilling their responsibilities, and the extended waiting periods for care.
In light of this context, it becomes imperative to discern and assess strategies that enhance the mental health and psychological well-being of healthcare residents to avert the onset of mental disorders that could detrimentally impact both the residents and the healthcare services they provide. These strategies must take into account the unique features of residency programs, how they shape the mental health of residents, and the potential ramifications of mental health status on the caliber and safety of patient care.
Hence, it is imperative to conduct a scoping review to identify strategies that target the promotion of mental health and wellbeing among residents across various health domains. This review is crucial in providing the necessary support for future preventive measures.
