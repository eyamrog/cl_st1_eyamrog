Clinical dental practice poses a risk of exposure to infectious airborne disease agents for both the dental team and patients, primarily due to the close proximity during clinical care and the generation of infectious aerosols during most dental procedures. In response to the specific risk profile of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Dental Association (ADA), and other relevant organizations have collaborated to develop recommendations aimed at enhancing existing standard precautions. These guidelines include the implementation of additional protective measures to mitigate the potential spread of the virus within dental settings.
When considering the reopening of dental services, it is crucial to acknowledge the current lack of reliable data regarding the risk of work-related infections for dental personnel. Given this uncertainty, it is advisable to adhere to four fundamental principles: firstly, all patients should be treated as potentially infectious; secondly, procedures that produce aerosols should be minimized, avoided, or carefully controlled; thirdly, infection control measures should be heightened in accordance with guidelines; and finally, personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols should be optimized to ensure maximum protection.
Dental teams are obligated to adhere to ethical principles in delivering optimal and secure dental care. However, as proprietors of businesses, they are grappling with the existential repercussions of diminished patient visits and financial setbacks due to service constraints. Balancing the dilemma of jeopardizing their health or their means of sustenance during the COVID-19 pandemic presents a challenging and unwelcome decision. Choices must be grounded in the most reliable evidence available and should be reassessed as the pandemic and economic circumstances evolve.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significant challenges related to access and financial coverage for dental care in the United States. To better prepare for future pandemics, it is imperative to implement reforms that aim to create a more equitable system with improved coverage for all individuals.
The field of dentistry presents a unique challenge as it exposes both dental health professionals and patients to infectious disease agents. This risk is notably higher in dental practices compared to other healthcare settings due to the close and prolonged contact between providers and patients. Moreover, most dental procedures result in the generation of aerosols that are contaminated with a patient's saliva, blood, other bodily fluids, or tissue particles. To mitigate this risk, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other relevant organizations have formulated recommendations and protocols based on the principle of standard precautions. Central to these guidelines are the utilization of physical barriers between the patient and provider, the sterilization of instruments, and the reprocessing of the environment.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and aerosols released when an infected individual coughs, sneezes, or speaks. There is also evidence indicating that individuals who are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic can transmit the virus. Given that dental procedures can generate aerosols, COVID-19 poses a significant risk in dental settings. To address this concern, the CDC has developed the "Interim infection prevention and control guidance for dental settings during COVID-19." This document emphasizes the need for special infection control measures in dental settings due to their unique characteristics. Similarly, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued COVID-19 workplace guidance, including a specific update for "Dentistry Workers and Employers" available on their website. OSHA categorizes dental health care providers as being at "very high exposure risk," alongside healthcare professionals like doctors, nurses, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians who perform aerosol-generating procedures on COVID-19 patients. Both the CDC and OSHA stress the importance of implementing enhanced precautions in dental practices to safeguard both the clinical team and patients from aerosol exposure during care. Furthermore, the CDC emphasizes the necessity of providing dental emergency care at all times during a pandemic, while considering the specific risk factors in the local context.
The CDC compiles data from state health departments regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers through a standardized case form. This form, however, does not distinguish between different categories of healthcare workers, leading to a lack of specific data on COVID-19 cases among dental healthcare personnel.
The CDC released a summary report detailing the characteristics of U.S. healthcare personnel diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States up to April 9, 2020. Only 16% of all reported infections included information on whether the individual was a healthcare professional (HCP), with 19% of HCPs testing positive. Within this group, 55% reported contact with a COVID-19 patient solely in a healthcare environment, while the rest had exposure in other settings. Among the infected, 2%-5% required admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 0.3%-0.8% succumbed to the virus.
The CDC report cautions that the figures provided underestimate both the infection and mortality rates, primarily due to missing data and a lack of information regarding the nature of interactions with suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19 patients. These data further reinforce the guidance from both the CDC and OSHA, indicating that healthcare workers are at an increased risk of infection while providing care.
It is crucial to recognize that the absence of documented COVID-19 cases among dental healthcare workers should not be interpreted as indicative of a low or minimal risk for individuals operating within dental facilities. Instead, the CDC report reinforces the recommendations that dental personnel face a heightened risk of infection in environments where droplets or aerosols are generated.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC advised dental care providers to postpone non-urgent ambulatory care visits, in line with recommendations for medical services. The American Dental Association (ADA), along with other professional national and global organizations, created guidance documents that mirrored CDC and OSHA guidelines. Furthermore, the ADA provided precise definitions of dental emergencies to assist dentists in their decision-making processes. A significant portion of dental practices in the United States adhered to the advice from the CDC, OSHA, and ADA by either limiting services to emergencies only or shutting down entirely.
In contrast to the guidelines provided by the CDC, OSHA, and ADA, states are now starting to ease restrictions on small businesses and dental practices, placing the responsibility of reopening on the owners of these establishments. Although dental professional organizations are formulating recommendations for pre-opening procedures, the primary concern for dental professionals revolves around the safety of delivering care within dental practices and the necessary adjustments that must be made to strike a balance between the demand for care and the associated risks.
Central to the ongoing discourse surrounding the resumption of dental services is the critical evaluation of infection risk. Given the limited availability of detailed information, assessments pertaining to the risk of COVID-19 infection are typically conducted through extrapolation. This practice of extrapolation is a prevalent method in both clinical and public health settings, particularly in situations where knowledge and the emergency context are rapidly evolving. These swift recommendations or guidelines are commonly referred to as "interim." Nevertheless, there exist several key facts that can serve as a solid foundation for deriving principles guiding clinical care amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur in pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic patients, where medical history or body temperature do not guarantee the identification of infected individuals. Currently, reliable and valid testing before dental care is not feasible due to the possibility of false-negative results. Additionally, vaccinations are unavailable, and the post-infection immunity status remains uncertain. The most practical and safe strategy is to adhere to the principle of standard precautions. This necessitates treating all patients as potentially infectious for airborne disease transmission, requiring equal and consistent precautionary measures to be implemented uniformly.
COVID-19 is classified as an airborne infection due to the primary sources of infection being droplets and aerosols containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Dental procedures, which involve the production of aerosols and droplets, direct contact with potentially infected mucosa, and activities that may trigger gagging or coughing in patients, are conducted in close proximity to the patient's mouth and nose. This proximity exposes dental health personnel to infectious droplets and aerosols. The most effective protection against transmission involves avoiding aerosol-generating procedures altogether. In situations where such procedures are necessary and droplet exposure is unavoidable, wearing a comprehensive set of personal protective equipment (PPE) can significantly reduce the risk of transmission. Respiratory therapists also utilize similar PPE when intubating COVID-19 patients in healthcare settings. Additional measures specific to dentistry, such as using a rubber dam, employing high-power suction, and implementing physical barriers between patients and providers, may further decrease the risk of transmission, although they do not completely eliminate it.
The 2003 CDC recommendations for infection control initially focused on bloodborne pathogens such as hepatitis and HIV, with subsequent updates addressing the risk reduction of airborne pathogens like tuberculosis. The revised guideline emphasizes the necessity of airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIR) equipped with negative pressure ventilation to mitigate the risk of airborne transmission. However, dental operatories are typically not designed to meet AIIR standards. Current clinical evidence suggests that for aerosol-generating procedures, the use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) alone, including handwashing, gloves, goggles, face shields, N95 face masks, and protective gowns, may reduce the risk of transmission by approximately 90%. Despite this, the absence of AIIR in dental settings leaves a significant risk of transmission, and the possibility of infection with airborne pathogens cannot be entirely discounted.
The interim guidance from the CDC regarding aerosol-generating dental procedures during dental emergencies advises the utilization of the highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) when treating patients with COVID-19 (CDC, 2020). These guidelines are consistent with those provided for healthcare professionals working in intensive care units caring for individuals with the infection.
Given the persisting uncertainties surrounding transmission risks beyond the aforementioned evidence, it is ethically imperative to regard all dental patients as potentially infectious. Adhering to the principle of non-maleficence, it is crucial to implement stringent protective measures. Considering the inherent constraints of dental operatories in effectively managing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, any deliberation regarding the provision of dental care, apart from non-aerosol-generating procedures, must be approached with extreme caution.
Based on existing knowledge, the COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to significantly alter the delivery of dental services. There is a pressing need to effectively control aerosols, bolster personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols, and improve patient triage procedures. Despite the potential introduction of a vaccine in the foreseeable future, its availability offers only restricted reassurance. Achieving widespread vaccination coverage will be a time-consuming process, and the likelihood of COVID-19 resurgences or the emergence of other viral outbreaks remains a distinct possibility.
In the midst of the pandemic, all stakeholders including practicing clinicians, patients, staff, families, communities, and professional dental associations find themselves at a critical juncture. Dental health personnel are tasked with upholding the ethical principle of delivering optimal dental care while also mitigating potential risks and harms. Simultaneously, whether as proprietors of private practices or as entities offering dental services, they are grappling with existential challenges stemming from decreased patient visits and financial losses due to service restrictions or practice shutdowns.
Navigating the dilemma of choosing between risking one's life or livelihood amidst the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic presents a challenging and unwelcome decision. In such circumstances, decisions must be grounded in scientific evidence or reliable guidance, especially as the evidence continues to evolve. Adaptations and compromises must be constantly reassessed as the pandemic landscape and economic conditions shift. The pandemic itself is a fluid and dynamic process, presenting varying scenarios within different regions or states. Measures for containment may necessitate stringent service limitations in one area while not in another, or the criteria for reopening services may fluctuate based on the evolving pandemic situation. In certain contexts, the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) could serve as a significant limiting factor. Regardless of the specific scenario, the repercussions will reverberate across all facets of oral health stakeholders, impacting dental supplies and manufacturers, the insurance sector, dental education, and research endeavors.
There is an urgent and existential demand for the field of dentistry to establish swift response protocols that mitigate the effects of the ongoing pandemic by ensuring the ongoing delivery of secure dental services that reduce risks and steer clear of procedures involving aerosols. The notion of SAFE Dentistry (Safe Aerosol-free Emergent Dentistry) could potentially serve as a progressive initiative in this regard.
The pandemic has unveiled disparities in access to dental care and financial coverage in the U.S., highlighting the need for a more equitable system that prioritizes the health and safety of all individuals. The dental profession must work towards a future of oral health care that caters to the oral health needs of the population, incorporates robust surveillance for risk assessment and outcomes evaluation, enhances preparedness and risk mitigation, and identifies optimal policy strategies for both present and future pandemics.
