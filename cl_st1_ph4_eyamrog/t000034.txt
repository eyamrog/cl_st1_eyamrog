Introduction: Gini coefficient (Gini index or Gini ratio) is a parameter that is normally 
used in economy to measure the income distribution in a country or in the whole wide 
world, but it can be used to measure any kind of distribution.  
In the present study it is exposed an innovative proposal of application of the Gini 
coefficient to Heart Rate Variability (HRV) like a psychophysiological indicator of 
mental stress. 

Purpose: To assess the application of the Gini coefficient as a psychophysiological 
indicator of mental stress. 

Methods:  The involved participants are 13 healthy individuals (age 19 ± 1.5 years). 
Heart rate was continuously recorded at rest (5 minutes) and during a mental stress (5 
minutes). Linear and nonlinear methods of heart rate variability were assessed, and 2 new 
indicators (Sequential and Non-Sequential Gini) were calculated and proposed to measure 
HRV differences between states. 

Results: When comparing rest and mental stress conditions, a sensible decrease of the 
traditional indicators of the HRV was founded (p<0.05), an increase of the heart rate 
(p=0.004) and of the Sequential Gini (p=0.004) and Non-Sequential Gini (p=0.04). 

Conclusions:  The results suggest that temporary inequality of the RR intervals analyzed 
from the Gini coefficient could be an adequate indicator of sympathetic activity present 
during the mental stress, with great potentialities with the objective to assess the 
consequences of psychosomatic affections and anxiety disorders. 

Stress in young individuals has a huge impact on physical and psychological functions, 
because it affects several physiological processes in the human body. The stress of 
psychological origin begins with an emotional reaction whose intensity on the organism 
is linked to various psychosocial factors to which the human being is vulnerable, having 
the ability to elicit a response that has been called «stress response» [1]. 

Acute psychological stress is known to cause neural response with the release of hormonal 
and humoral factors activated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the 
hypothalamus. It is known that it  is associated with developmental and 
psychopathological disorders [2], as well as it constitutes a risk factor to many chronic 
non-communicable diseases [3]. Responses to stressors have adaptive functions 
developed within the evolution, from which both adverse and positive consequences can 
be listed. Therefore, stress interventions are useful to understand how healthy individuals 
respond to stressful stimulus [4, 5]. 

Acute mental stress can be assessed with various methods available in the medical 
literature, such as circadian rhythm dysregulations [6], Stroop test [7] and arithmetic test 
[8, 9, 10]. Results from previous studies have shown a physiological coherence between 
stress and physical and cognitive performance in young individuals [11]. However, acute 
stress and maladaptive responses have been related with physiological changes during 
stress like endocrine, autonomous and neural responses, with cortisol release under an 
induced psychological stressor, brain activity changes and heart rate adaptive 
modifications [12, 13]. 

Heart rate variability (HRV) is defined as the time intervals variation among serial heart 
beats. Other terms have been used in the literature; for instance: cycle longitude 
variability, heart period variability and R-R variability. However, the term of HRV is the 
one that has had greater acceptance [14]. The autonomic regulation of the heart beats have 
been widely used to assess the functioning of the autonomic nervous system; methods 
include time and frequency domain HRV analysis for short and long term recordings [15]. 

The analysis of fluctuations of a signal scale with the number of samples of that signal, is 
applicable to HRV for the RR interval time series analysis, and it found applications in 
many different research fields, like psychophysiological studies of the autonomic 
modulation of heart functioning [16, 17].  

Acute stress models have shown results on HRV analysis, regarding the different 
populations over it has been applied. In young adults findings show that it correlates with 
a diminution of the irregularity of the intervals, as well as entropy and multiscale entropy 
withdrawal [10]. The stress states have been also associated with changes in HRV, like 
increased sympathetic activity and parasympathetic lessening [8]. 

The authors have found in a spectral analysis of HRV, the inequality of the distribution 
of slow fluctuations of heart rate under mental stress, with better sensibility than spectral 
density methods traditionally used in HRV analysis [18]. Gini coefficient is a parameter 
that normally is used in the economy to measure the inequality in the income, in a country, 
but can be used to measure any kind of distribution. The application of the Gini coefficient 
to biological phenomena has recently being explored. The applications of this coefficient 
include the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) traces [19], functional magnetic 
resonance imaging [20], gene expression analysis [21] and the application to measure 
inequality in power spectral density of RR intervals was recently assessed [18]. However, 
the application of the Gini coefficient to the analysis in time domain of the inequality of 
the distribution of RR intervals has not been applied previously. 

In this sense, the hypothesis was that the temporal inequality of RR intervals can be 
associated with autonomic changes in HRV during stress, more effectively than the 
traditional HRV indexes. It could be really valuable in the evaluation of the adaptive and 
maladaptive response of the autonomic cardiac modulation to stressful situations, as an 
adequate indicator of autonomic modifications during mental stress. Therefore, this 
investigation aimed to assess the application of the Gini coefficient as a 
psychophysiological indicator of mental stress. 

A non-observational crossover study was conducted in thirteen healthy individuals, 6 
males and 7 females (age: 19±1.5 years; BMI 22.3 ± 1.3 kg/m2). The participants were 
non-smokers and without history of heart disease, systemic hypertension or other diseases 
which could potentially influence HRV changes. The individuals were not under 
medication and they were required to be satiated and not to have taken any caffeine, drugs 
or alcohol in the 12 hours preceding the experiment. 

This study was approved by the Medical University of Santiago de Cuba Ethics 
Committee under protocol number 22/2017. All procedures involved in this study are in 
accordance with the 1975 Helsinki Declaration, updated in 2013. Informed consent was 
obtained from all participants included in the study. 

After signing informed consent, the participants were cited to the specific day and hour 
when measurements were going to be carried out.  The sessions were conducted between 
9:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. in a dimly lit room with controlled environmental noise and 
humidity, and a temperature range between 24 and 27 degrees Celsius, with no 
interactions or distractions among the volunteers. They were allowed to rest for 15 
minutes to adapt to local conditions. There was not circulation of people inside of that 
environment.  The participants were asked for substance ingestion and physical activities 
before starting the recording sessions; they were also required to be satiated (having had 
breakfast about 1 hour before) and not having taken any product with caffeine. 

The PowerLab Acquisition System 8® (ADInstruments) was used to collect the 
electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings, with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz for data 
collection. A standard Lead II was used for ECG measurement. After the skin was cleaned 
with alcohol wipe, ECG electrodes (Ag/AgCl) were attached to the participant’s right 
midclavicle and the lowest left rib (left wrist as the ground) and subjects were allowed to 
relax for 10 min to adapt to local conditions.  Recordings at rest and during spontaneous 
breathing were performed for 5 minutes in a seated position; immediately after, subjects 
performed the arithmetic calculation test for others 5 minutes. An algorithm [22] was used 
to detect the QRS-complexes in the ECG-signal from which we could determine the RR-
intervals. 
The 
Heart 
rate 
variability 
analysis 
software 
(HRVAS) 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/hrvas  Copyright© 2015 by John T. Ramshur, [23] was 
used for preliminary processing of the RR interval series. The standard deviation (SD) 
filter with SD=3 and percentage filter with value of 20% from the previous interval were 
used to detect ectopic intervals [24]. Cubic Spline Replacement was employed to replace 
ectopic intervals using cubic spline interpolation [23]. Traditional time domain indexes 
of Heart Rate Variability were calculated, keeping of HRV recommendations [14]. 
Finally, in other analysis of ECG signals, an ECG-derived Respiration Rate (EDR) was 
computed from raw-ECG throughout the procedure via a built-in algorithm of Kubios 
HRV Premium® 3.0.2 software: the algorithm examined the alterations of the amplitude 
of the R-peak caused by chest movements during each respiratory cycle. 

Standard procedure of arithmetic calculation test [25, 26, and 27] was performed. It is an 
efficient stimulus to induce cardiovascular reactivity by causing mental stress [9, 10, 28, 
29, and 30]. Subjects subtracted 17 starting from 1000. They were instructed to subtract 
as accurate as possible. For a single subtraction time allowed was 5 second (s) and it was 
signaled by a sound. They told the result and after each answer subjects received verbal 
confirmation (“right” or “wrong”). They continued successive subtracting even when the 
result was wrong. The subjects did not talk during calculation between verbalization of 
answers. 

The Gini coefficient is a measure of how incomes are unequally distributed between 
social groups. A coefficient of zero means that all subgroups have exactly the same 
income per capita, meaning that there is no dispersion of income; a very large coefficient 
would result if all the incomes accumulate only in one subgroup and all the remaining 
groups have zero incomes. When the total population size approaches to infinity but all 
the incomes belong only to one individual, Gini coefficient approaches to 1.                                                 

Absolute delta histogram of pairs of adjacent normal R–R intervals |NN-(NN+1)| were 
employed measuring on discrete scale with bins of 1/128 s. (7.8125).  

Histogram of normal R–R intervals (NN) were employed measuring on discrete scale 
with bins of 1/128 s. (7.8125) 

The sequential and non-sequential histograms can be constructed using bins of 7.8125 
milliseconds length. Let n be the number of classes. Let A be a sequence a1, a2,…,an such 
that ai is the number of elements in the i-th class, and let B be the sequence b1,b2,…,bn 
such that bi is the mean of the limits of the i-th class. Now then, we can say that A is a 
sequence of population sizes of some subgroups, and B represents the income per capita 
in this different subgroups.  

The Brown Formula is used to calculate an approximate value of the Gini coefficient and 
is defined as follows: <>  
Therefore, 𝑝𝑖 is the cumulated proportion of the population variable 
and 𝑞𝑖 is the cumulated proportion of the variable. In Non-Sequential Gini,  𝑝𝑖 is 
cumulated proportion of the NN intervals in the different bins of RR Histogram and 𝑞𝑖 is 
the cumulated proportion of values of the different bins of RR Histogram. In Sequential 
Gini,  𝑝𝑖 is cumulated proportion of the absolute delta NN intervals in the different bins 
of absolute delta RR Histogram and 𝑞𝑖 is the cumulated proportion of values of the 
different bins of absolute delta RR Histogram. 

The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for related samples was employed with p<0.05. All 
values were expressed as Mean, Standard Deviation (SD) and Coefficient of Variation 
(CV %). The p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Effect size with 
Cohen's d was calculated and effect sizes of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.9 should be interpreted as 
small, medium, and large effects [31]. Pearson Correlation was applied to the data with 
normal distribution, or Spearman’s correlation, for the ones that did not accept this 
distribution. The normality of the data was initially determined using the Shapiro-Wilk 
test. The distributions of bins scaling histograms are showed.  All the statistical and 
mathematical calculations as well as the processing of the signals were carried out in 
Matlab 2012b and in SPSS 22 statistic software. 

In Table 1 can be observed that mental stress caused changes in the values of heart rate 
and RR intervals. The traditional indexes of HRV that were statistically affected by the 
cardiovascular hyperactivity are pNN50, RMSSD and SD1. Mental stress also produced 
a significant increment of Sequential Gini and Non-Sequential Gini. Sequential Gini 
reported the lowest values of inter-individual variation both in rest and during mental 
stress. 

Figure 1 shows the Lorenz curves of temporal distribution inequality of both Gini indexes 
during rest and mental stress, in a random subject. The Lorenz coefficient result from the 
space between the colored zone and the diagonal line, which is highest during mental 
stress in both Sequential Gini and Non-Sequential Gini indexes. 

Table 2 shows the Pearson’s correlations between Gini temporal HRV indexes and 
traditional HRV indexes, which illustrates that there was no correlation between Non-
Sequential Gini and the other indexes in any of the status. Nevertheless, Sequential Gini 
at rest showed a significant negative correlation with respiratory rate, which means that 
lowest values of Sequential Gini are related to highest values of respiratory rate; a positive 
correlation was also founded between Sequential Gini and pNN50. Otherwise, Sequential 
Gini during mental stress correlated with TINN, and in the total sample it correlated with 
SDNN, HRVTi, TINN and SD2. 

Table 3 shows the evaluating parameters of the discriminatory capacity of traditional and 
Gini temporal HRV indexes to be related to stress status, provided by the Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Sequential Gini shows a poor discriminatory 
capacity to relate with stress, from which it is inferred that its highest values are associated 
with rest. Non-Sequential Gini by the other hand showed a good discriminatory capacity 
to be related with stress. Its cut point could be proposed to be evaluated as an indicator of 
mental stress. 

In Figure 2 can be observed the class intervals (bins) of Gini temporal HRV indexes in 
both psychophysiological status to evaluate the unequal distribution of elements. It was 
founded that during stress both Gini temporal HRV indexes are more concentrated, while 
during rest they are more dispersed. In the analysis of each index separately, Sequential 
Gini increases when bins sizes increases, while Non- Sequential Gini keeps stable no 
matter the sizes of bins. 

The present study explored the usefulness of a temporal indicator of HRV based on the 
Gini index, not reported so far, and its application as a new psychophysiological indicator 
of mental stress. This method made it possible to measure the temporal inequality 
between pairs of adjacent normal R-R intervals and to determine the differences between 
the basal and mental stress status induced by the arithmetic calculation test. 

The response of the cardiovascular system to acute stress causes activation of the 
autonomic nervous system, matching energy supply to increased metabolic demands 
(increase in blood pressure, heart rate, vascular peripheral resistance, etc.), and it can 
clarified the pathophysiological mechanism in which various cardiovascular conditions 
develop [32]. The effect of stress on HRV has been extensively studied, and the changes 
it produces in traditional parameters have been demonstrated, such as increased heart rate, 
SD2/SD1 ratio, short-term fluctuations α, low frequencies, multiscale entropy and the 
sympathetic index; as well as significant decrease in the RR interval, SDNN, RMSSD, 
pNN50, sample entropy and the parasympathetic index [9, 33]. These variations respond 
to the adjustment of the parasympathetic branch that make these variables look like within 
the allotted time, in the sense that they adapt to the changes and demands of the organism 
to face different life situations and they adjust to signals that travel down the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis causing acute catecholamine release and subsequent 
cortisol release. These explain the increase in other variables such as blood pressure, heart 
rate or peripheral vascular resistance [4, 8].  

An increasing number of indicators have been developed and applied to quantify HRV in 
the time and frequency domain since the beginning of the new century [16]. Sassi et al 
[15] provided a critical review of newer methods highlighting their contribution to the 
technical understanding of HRV and their ability to quantify the complex regulation 
mechanism of the heart rate not covered by traditional methods. But Gini index as a 
statistical measure that has only been investigated in a previous study for its application 
to the study of HRV during an acute stimulus induced by a mental stressor [18].  

In the present study, a significant increase in the inequality of heartbeat variations 
(Sequential Gini) during mental stress was found, which in the bivariate analysis 
exceeded the rest of the traditional HRV indicators in statistical significance. This result 
agrees with the previous obtained by Sánchez-Hechavarría et al. [19], where he 
determined the efficacy of the Spectral Gini coefficient (SpG) of each traditional HRV 
indicator to compare between baseline and mental stress. In that study, a significant 
increase in SpG (LF) (p = 0.009) and SpG (LF2) (p = 0.033) was found that also surpassed 
the traditional indicators. However, the significance value of the Sequential Gini in the 
present study is higher than that of SpG, which means that there were more and better 
differences with the index proposed here. Also, the coefficient of variation of the 
Sequential Gini showed that it appearances to be more homogeneous than the rest of the 
indexes studied, which improves the strength of this result. Regarding the result obtained 
in the Non-Sequential Gini analysis (distribution of beats), it is worth highlighting its 
statistical significance that is higher than most traditional HRV indexes. 

The obtained results show that with the use of the new proposed indicators a greater 
homogeneity of the data is achieved in the study of HRV against various stimuli, taking 
into account the value of its coefficient of variation, which results are higher. This 
increases the validity and feasibility of using this indicator to assess mental stress against 
the other indicators. 

The Lorenz curve is used together with the Gini coefficient as a graphical representation 
to measure the inequality in the distribution of numerical data and to express the relative 
distribution of a variable in a domain; the perfect data distribution would result in a slope 
of one and a Gini coefficient of zero, whereas severe data inequity results in higher Gini 
values closer to one [34]. In this study it was found that there is a more unequal 
distribution in the Sequential Gini than in the Non-Sequential Gini, since the coefficient 
was higher. It was also found that the distribution of the data resulted to be more irregular 
during mental stress than during rest. This result is completely novel, since the application 
of the Lorenz curve to measure the inequality in spectral values of HRV, and its 
comparison with mental stress has been applied in this study for the first time. 

The study of HRV has shown that it is a measurement coupled with the fact it is relatively 
affordable, non-invasive and pain free, which makes it very accessible to many 
researchers [16]. But it is true that most HRV indicators currently studied are highly 
correlated with each other, which constitutes a difficulty in their interpretation and a 
possible bias when correlating them with external stimuli, since the values of some of 
them are toughly influenced by the other values such as heart rate and respiratory rate 
[35]. Another difficulty in the study and application of HRV is the large number of 
indicators and the high correlation between them that in many cases is possible to estimate 
one indicator from another, not providing valuable information, but making its 
interpretation difficult. 

In this study, little correlation was found between the proposed indicators and the 
traditional variables, which provides new information not previously described. The Non-
Sequential Gini did not correlate with any of the traditional indicators; However, 
Sequential Gini did show a correlation with some geometric HRV indicators, which opens 
the possibility of classifying this new indicator as geometric, by its possibility of being 
calculated and geometrically represented, and in the fact of using the concept of Data 
binning, which a characteristic of many geometric indicators of HRV [36]. The benefit of 
having greater homogeneity and the possibility of visualizing the most obvious changes 
produced by mental stress in the heart is reported in this study. 

Regarding results obtained in the analysis of the discriminatory capacity of the traditional 
indexes and the Sequential and Non-Sequential Gini, it was found that the area under the 
Sequential Gini curve resulted as poor discriminatory capacity to discriminate mental 
stress. However, the Non-Sequential Gini did show a good discriminatory capacity to be 
associated with stress, with high sensitivity and specific values. 

The analysis of discriminatory capacity has been used in several previous investigations 
of HRV, and cut-off points have been established for various variables, which aim to 
predict a better or worse cardiovascular function or a better adaptation of them to stressful 
physical or mental stimuli [37; 38]. In this study a cut-off point is proposed to be 
investigated in future investigations. 

It was observed that the new indicators have different characteristics when the sizes of 
the Bins vary. In the Sequential Gini (which indicate the inequality of the clustered 
variations of the heartbeats) it was obtained that as the size of each bin increases, there 
are fewer class intervals, therefore fewer groups within the distribution and it 
consequently increases the possibility that these beat variations are concentrated in these 
class intervals. These differences are principally observed during induced mental stress, 
since it has been shown that slow oscillations tend to concentrate [18]. This result 
demonstrates the need to use a standard Bins size when calculating the Sequential Gini. 
In this study, 8-second Bins were used, which is very similar to the value recommended 
for geometric methods [39]. It was also observed that the Non-Sequential Gini (inequality 
of the distribution of the beats) performs in a constant manner regardless of the size of 
the Bins used, so the limitations that the Sequential Gini presents is not applicable to Non- 
Sequential Gini. These results allow describing the mathematical characteristics of the 
indicators proposed in the studied sample. 

Results of this investigation show that Gini index in its Sequential and Non-Sequential 
categories was found to be associated with mental stress in the individuals studied, more 
effectively than the traditional HRV indexes. Temporal inequality measured by the Gini 
index was bigger during mental stress, and the proposed indexes seems not to be affected 
by other indicators, which they could be very valuable in the study of the cardiovascular 
autonomic response to various stimuli. Temporary inequality of the RR intervals analyzed 
from the Gini coefficient could be an adequate indicator of sympathetic-adrenal activity 
present during mental stress, with great potentialities in the objective to assess the 
consequences of psychosomatic affections and the anxiety disorders. 

Funding source: This research did not receive any speciﬁc grant from funding public 
agencies, commercial, or not-for-proﬁt sectors. 

The study sample size was 13, which could affect the performance of methods for 
qualitative sample comparison and distribution of studied parameters values in the 
population. Although the sample size accomplishes sufficiently the minimal 
recommended sample size for biomedical experiments [40], the effect size was assessed 
in every single analysis, by calculating Cohen's kappa coefficient.
