Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to be associated with a strong thrombotic tendency, due to different mechanisms still unknown1, which may predispose to arterial and venous thrombosis1,2,3. However, risk estimates for these complications are still preliminary1. We report a case of an 89-year-old female patient admitted to the emergency room of a tertiary hospital with right hemiparesis, aphasia, and dysarthria. Cranial computed tomography (CT) (Figs. 1,2) and cranial CT angiography (Fig. 3) showed findings suggestive of acute ischemic stroke in the area of the left middle cerebral artery. The patient declared having flu-like symptoms for about two weeks, and chest CT findings were suggestive of viral infection (Fig. 4). The rapid test was performed, and the result was positive for SARS-CoV-2.
