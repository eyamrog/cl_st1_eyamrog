In response to the outbreak of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen responsible for the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), various sectors and social activities, including education, have been significantly impacted. Initially, it is important to acknowledge that educators and students may experience vulnerability during and after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Subsequently, it is crucial to recognize that the relationship between educators and students needs to be carefully navigated due to the psychological and neuropsychiatric effects triggered by neural coding and plasticity processes, leading to the formation of both positive and negative memories in the short and long term. Furthermore, it is essential to note that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic underscores the necessity for adaptation and adequacy in providing significant attention to students as they resume their studies, considering potential sensory modulation disorders and the involvement of limbic brain areas activated in situations of perceived or actual threat of death. It is posited that amidst the challenges posed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, beyond the preservation of life, there is a need for behavioral reorganization, encompassing educational habits that must be approached from a scientific standpoint, aiming to transform the repercussions of pandemic-induced fear into opportunities for strengthening familial bonds. Within the framework of contemporary rationality, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic serves as a period for contemplating the interplay between scientific knowledge and common sense. Consequently, neurosciences can play a pivotal role in reshaping the teaching-learning process to mitigate psychological distress and its secondary effects among educators and students grappling with the pandemic's threats. Education emerges as a central arena for decision-making in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, underscoring the urgency for the development of multidisciplinary strategies that bridge the gap between neurosciences and education post-COVID-19.
In mid-December 2019, in Wuhan, China, cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause started to emerge. Following evaluations of affected patients, a novel type 2 Coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified. This RNA enveloped virus is responsible for causing a range of symptoms including respiratory, hepatic, enteric, and neurological manifestations, collectively termed as the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (1).
Following its initial contamination in China, the virus swiftly disseminated globally, reaching pandemic status as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a viral evolution characterized by both high pathogenicity and transmissibility. Such outbreaks serve as catalysts for potential transformations across various geographical locations and social spheres.
The unprecedented circumstances brought about by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have significantly impacted educators and learners, revealing both vulnerabilities and opportunities that underscore the necessity for guidelines to navigate these novel challenges. The criterion of cognitive development emerges from a complex interplay of various stimuli and synaptic activations within the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, which are fundamental for the process of teaching and learning. Nevertheless, studies have shown that various strains of coronaviruses have the potential to infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS) (4).
In other words, it is worth considering the potential for viral transmission within the brain following intranasal viral infection, facilitated by synaptic connections in the sensory system and neurotropism. This pathway suggests that the coronavirus could disrupt the teaching and learning process by compromising educators and learners, leading to a variety of negative emotions that impact mood and behavioral skills when processing information related to COVID-19.
The necessity for social isolation prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the global uncertainty surrounding SARS-CoV-2, has led to heightened levels of tension and distress. While the world has encountered comparable events in the past, none have been documented to date with the same magnitude and rapidity of transmission as the ongoing pandemic.
Amidst numerous changes and uncertainties, individuals often experience natural responses like unconditioned and conditioned fear, as well as chronic anxiety, which can offer a degree of protection and prevention but may escalate to unbearable or dysfunctional levels. Within this context, the proactive measure of social isolation poses various mental health risks (7). While isolation serves as a strategy to curb virus transmission and has been implemented during previous critical junctures, prolonged periods of isolation are associated with heightened susceptibility to psychiatric disorders (8).
It is imperative to acknowledge that during pandemics, the primary focus is often directed towards the pathogen itself, its biological risks, preventive measures, containment strategies, and medical treatment protocols. Consequently, the psychological and psychiatric repercussions stemming from the pandemic, both on an individual and collective scale, are frequently overlooked and marginalized in discussions (9, 10).
Reynolds et al. (11) noted that social isolation can lead to a range of psychopathological symptoms, including depressed mood, irritability, anxiety, fear, anger, and insomnia, with potential long-term implications for mental health. Hawryluck et al. (12) further highlighted that even three years following a period of isolation, individuals remained at an increased risk for alcohol abuse, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression.
The key areas of activation in social anxiety disorder include the bilateral amygdaloid complex, the left medial temporal lobe involving the entorhinal cortex, the left medial aspect of the inferior temporal lobe involving the perirhinal cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus, and the right anterior cingulate cortex in humans, as noted by Hattingh et al. (13). These regions, such as the amygdaloid complex, entorhinal cortex, cingulum gyrus, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus, are interconnected within the limbic system, the primary brain system responsible for emotional regulation in humans and other mammals. Furthermore, individuals with social anxiety disorder exhibit specific thinning in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and insular cortices of the right brain hemisphere (14).
Shigemura et al. (15) noted that individuals infected with COVID-19 or suspected of being infected could exhibit heightened emotional and behavioral responses, including fear, boredom, loneliness, anxiety, insomnia, or anger, symptoms previously documented during past epidemic outbreaks (Brooks et al., 2020).
During a pandemic, fear tends to heighten anxiety and stress levels in healthy individuals while exacerbating symptoms in those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders (15). Despite this, there remains a gap in understanding the impact on individuals influenced by their responses to the fear of infectious diseases. In China, the epicenter of the ongoing pandemic, elevated rates of depression, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and insomnia have been observed among healthcare workers (16, 17) and patients infected with COVID-19 (18). However, the specific contribution of coronavirus-related anxiety to these psychological conditions has yet to be conclusively established.
Supporting these concerns, a recent study involving 775 adult citizens residing in the United States revealed that individuals experiencing functional impairment due to fear and anxiety surrounding the coronavirus demonstrated higher levels of hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, spiritual crises, and issues related to alcohol and drug abuse compared to those who were anxious but did not exhibit dysfunctional anxiety attributed to COVID-19.
Previous studies on hurricanes, floods, and infectious disease outbreaks have consistently highlighted the prevalence of adverse psychological reactions such as anxiety, acute stress, addictive behaviors, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, increased suicide rates, and depression among affected populations (20). Given this pattern, it is anticipated that similar psychological challenges will manifest during and after the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Another crucial observation to note is that during pandemics, the toll on mental health often surpasses the direct impact of the infection. Historical events have demonstrated that the repercussions on mental well-being can endure longer and affect a larger population than the epidemic or pandemic itself. Additionally, the psychosocial and economic ramifications tend to have a more lasting and widespread influence (15).
It is widely acknowledged that fear may serve as a central component in various psychological conditions, owing to its status as one of the most fundamental and primal human emotions. Fear, being a primitive emotion, is deemed to be conservative across the animal kingdom. Amid the ongoing pandemic, individuals continue to grapple with feelings of helplessness and a loss of essential security, financial stability, and the capacity to foresee a brighter future. The fear of contracting an infection, of potential contamination in one's surroundings, or through interactions with others, triggers heightened levels of distrust, avoidance, and withdrawal, consequently diminishing social interactions and constraining opportunities for contact and social support, both of which are crucial for adaptive behaviors.
Fear is a complex construct influenced by various variables and determinants, particularly in relation to the neurobiological structures involved in its genesis. Stress, fear, and anxiety exhibit a unique characteristic known as the generalization phenomenon, which can be adaptive. However, maladaptive overgeneralization is a key feature of mental disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder. This maladaptive generalization of fear manifests when an abnormal stimulus-response gradient leads to defensive behaviors in contexts or cues not explicitly linked to threat or danger.
Regarding the potential exposure to triggering stimuli, research suggests that approximately 50 to 60% of the North American population may encounter at least one traumatic event during their lifetime. While many individuals are able to recover from such experiences, around 10 to 30% may develop post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite the effectiveness of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions, a notable 20 to 30% of patients with this disorder do not exhibit positive responses to conventional therapies.
At present, a substantial portion of the population may experience clinically significant fear and anxiety amidst an infectious disease outbreak (Taylor, 2019). With the widespread exposure of society to potentially traumatic events, exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, there exists a heightened risk for individuals to develop anxiety disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder. Consequently, it is imperative for healthcare professionals to comprehend the psychological vulnerabilities of individuals grappling with this particular condition.
As outlined by Dong and Bouey (29), fear and anxiety are prevalent psychological reactions in disasters and similar circumstances, rendering the entire population susceptible to mental health issues, particularly anxiety disorders. These disorders, as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), encompass generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, and selective mutism (30).
Corroborating concerns regarding the onset of mental disorders, Batelaan et al. (31) highlighted that anxiety disorders have been linked to a 52% increase in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, with the severity of anxiety symptoms directly correlating with functional impairment (32). These observations are supported by the understanding that the body responds to stress by triggering adaptive mechanisms, involving neuroendocrine and neuronal defensive activities, which encompass the autonomic nervous system, activation of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis (HPA), and the release of cortisol. Dysfunctions within this axis can disrupt responses to stressors, ultimately contributing to the development of anxiety disorders (33).
In acute anxiety, the activation of the HHA axis is considered adaptive; however, in cases of chronic anxiety, this mechanism tends to fail, resulting in sustained activation of the HHA axis that hinders coping mechanisms and leads to reduced tolerance to chronic stress (34). Chronic stress, conversely, has far-reaching implications on cognitive and emotional processing, impacting brain plasticity, immune system function, and increasing the susceptibility to developmental disorders, while also disrupting negative feedback from the HHA axis and reducing neurotrophic factors, among other effects (34). Extensive literature supports the pivotal role of stress in the onset of psychiatric disorders, as evidenced by studies in both laboratory animals (35) and human experimental models (36), highlighting its contribution to the initiation or exacerbation of clinical conditions.
In severe instances, these mental health issues can escalate to suicidal tendencies. Research indicates that approximately 90% of suicides worldwide stem from mental illnesses like depression. Drawing from past experiences during outbreaks like the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) in 2003, where the suicide rate among the elderly surged in Hong Kong during and post-pandemic, it is evident that the current situation demands significant attention and gravity.
Although systematic studies on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health are lacking, it is anticipated to have significant effects based on observed public reactions. In response to these reactions and drawing from past experiences, the National Health Commission of China has taken proactive measures by issuing guidelines for emergency interventions in psychosocial disaster cases to mitigate the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. These interventions involve teams comprising psychiatrists, mental health professionals, and psychological support hotlines. Addressing these concerns, the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at the World Health Organization has released a document outlining recommendations for promoting mental health and psychosocial well-being. The document emphasizes the role of psychiatrists and psychologists in supporting other healthcare professionals, patients, and the general public in understanding the potential psychological effects of COVID-19 and providing assistance to patients, families, and the community at large.
In alignment with the imperative to address the mental well-being of the populace during the pandemic, Gao et al. (2020) reported findings from a survey in China, revealing a significant prevalence of mental health issues, notably depression and anxiety, linked to extensive social media consumption amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Emphasizing the urgency to counter misinformation dissemination, they underscored the criticality of disseminating accurate information. Furthermore, they advocated for the necessity of deploying diverse channels for mental health services as a crucial intervention strategy.
In conclusion, it is crucial to underscore the landscape of uncertainty, insecurity, and isolation that humanity is currently navigating, serving as a catalyst for a range of emotions and feelings including fear, anxiety, and sadness. This environment is conducive to the onset of mental disorders, particularly those falling within the spectrum of anxiety and mood disorders, and may also exacerbate existing conditions in individuals. Given this context, there is a pressing need for a more thorough evaluation by authorities and healthcare professionals, not only focusing on the physical symptoms associated with COVID-19 but also prioritizing the mental well-being of the population.
In the context of developing autonomy for conducting studies during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to acknowledge the three levels of attention behavior formation within the brain: the alert state, focus, and concentration. The alert state serves as the foundational condition for concentration in the teaching-learning process, emphasizing the importance of educators and learners adapting to the new physical and social environment. Motivation plays a pivotal role in this process, influencing attention and memory. Sustaining the alert state leads to achieving focus and, subsequently, concentration. As we navigate through and beyond the pandemic, it is essential to establish a thoughtful relationship between educators and learners to facilitate neural processes related to encoding and plasticity, ultimately shaping positive and negative memories in the short and long term.
The multidisciplinary exploration of cognitive and socio-affective processes in teaching and learning stands to gain insights from the concept of function modularity. This concept posits that motivation, attention, and memory are distinct skills and abilities governed by separate modules within the nervous system. These modules operate independently yet collaboratively to foster autonomy and facilitate academic pursuits amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, it is crucial to consider somatization, which involves the physical manifestation of psychological distress through symptoms.
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurobiological condition influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, often manifesting early in development, even during the prenatal period. It is characterized by behaviors such as extreme inattention, restlessness, and impulsiveness, which surpass what would typically be expected at a given stage of child development. ADHD can persist into adulthood, affecting approximately 5.3% of children and adolescents globally, as well as 2.5% of adults. The presence of this disorder has been linked to increased mortality rates, academic challenges, substance abuse, and difficulties in securing employment.
During the COVID-19 outbreak, schools in China have been closed, necessitating students to remain at home. To facilitate continued education, primary and secondary schools in China have established official online educational platforms for students (47). Consequently, parents of these children are now tasked with assuming educational responsibilities, alongside managing their children's emotional and behavioral challenges round the clock.
The most effective treatment currently available for individuals, both adults, and children, diagnosed with ADHD involves the use of stimulant medications. While medications have shown significant efficacy in addressing symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, it is important to note that individuals with ADHD often present with a range of associated issues that necessitate additional interventions. These may include psychoeducation and psychotherapy, among others (48).
Zhang and colleagues (49) conducted a study examining the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the mental health of children with ADHD. Their research revealed a significant exacerbation of ADHD symptoms in children during the pandemic, underscoring the critical need to prioritize support for vulnerable populations during such crises. These findings emphasize the necessity of developing tailored disaster risk reduction strategies specifically designed to address the unique needs of children with ADHD.
The resumption of activities should not only be contingent upon meeting the requirements of the school curriculum but also on providing psychological and social support. Untreated psychological issues can have detrimental effects on family dynamics, children's relationships, academic achievements, and social interactions. Additionally, mental health problems in childhood frequently persist into adulthood, resulting in reduced productivity, heightened substance abuse, and significant economic strain on both the individual and society.
Conventional medical treatments typically rely on pharmaceutical drugs and psychological therapy (53). However, the incorporation of alternative and complementary therapies, such as manipulative/body techniques and practices centered around attention or music therapy, can serve as valuable supplementary treatments and potentially mitigate the adverse effects associated with pharmaceutical drugs (54, 55). Research indicates that these therapies have the potential to assist children in alleviating symptoms related to ADHD/ADD, autism, anxiety, depression, and stress (56, 57). Numerous studies have proposed that mindfulness-based practices, including yoga, tai chi, qigong, and meditation, could serve as beneficial complements to the treatment of mental health conditions, particularly mood and anxiety disorders, ultimately enhancing overall quality of life (58). Mindfulness involves the deliberate, accepting, and non-judgmental focus on one's emotions, thoughts, and sensations in the present moment (59).
Practices such as yoga and mindfulness have been shown to have a positive impact on the body, enhancing alertness and fostering positive emotions while reducing feelings of aggression, depression, and anxiety (60, 61). A study examining the effects of mindfulness and yoga interventions on the quality of life of elementary school students and teachers revealed significant benefits. Those students who underwent the intervention exhibited notably greater enhancements in psychosocial and emotional quality of life compared to their counterparts who received standard care (62).
There is evidence suggesting that yoga may enhance mood in individuals with major depressive disorder by boosting the activity of the GABA system (63). Yoga practitioners exhibit heightened functions in the Superior Parietal Lobule and Supramarginal Gyrus of the cerebral cortex (64). Long-term practice of Ashtanga Yoga has been linked to reduced regional glucose metabolism in the medial temporal cortex, striatum, and brainstem (65). The brainstem houses the primary output of the encephalic aversion system, the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG), whose activation can trigger unconditioned fear and panic attack-like behaviors (66). Meditation and Yoga have also been associated with a notably smaller right amygdala volume (67). Neurons in both the PAG and amygdaloid complex are known to be spontaneously activated in threatening situations (68).
Another non-pharmacological intervention that has garnered attention is music therapy, which has consistently demonstrated its ability to play crucial roles in regulating emotions and promoting overall well-being. Studies have shown that music therapy can elevate stress thresholds, boost immunity, enhance quality of life, and reduce anxiety (56, 69, 70). Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that music can induce analgesia and suppress abnormal neural activity in the brain (71).
Considering the tangible advantages of integrative and complementary therapies, including their lack of side effects and potential applicability within educational settings, it is compelling to highlight their potential as an adjunctive approach to enhancing post-pandemic education.
The field of educational neuroscience seeks to establish a connection between affective development and cognitive development, specifically in areas like attention and memory. Over the past few decades, there has been a significant accumulation of evidence highlighting the crucial role of skill and capacity enhancement. This has led to the formulation and execution of scientific interventions within educational practices (72).
This perspective on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath highlights the crucial role of educators and learners in addressing mental health issues. Through logical reasoning, it is evident that the engagement of brain areas associated with emotions, such as the limbic system, potentially facilitates viral transmission between neurons, leading to disruptions in the release of essential neurotransmitters like glutamate, acetylcholine (excitatory), GABA, dopamine (inhibitors), serotonin (both excitatory and inhibitory), and glial cells (responsive to environmental stimuli). Consequently, it is postulated that SARS-CoV-2 could impair brain networks or circuits, diminishing their effectiveness and impacting afferent and efferent projections crucial for the learning process (73).
Pedagogical practices can be enhanced through the application of scientific knowledge, serving as a catalyst for progress. By expanding discussion spaces beyond mere content and disciplinary boundaries, a triad emerges encompassing information support on COVID-19, socio-affective considerations, and cognitive processing. To ensure the holistic development of educators and learners, it is imperative to maintain this triangular approach both during and post the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach aligns with a multidisciplinary perspective, recognizing that stimuli, whether positive or negative, can either weaken or strengthen associative neuroplasticity. This process involves connectivity, regulation, and neural modulation, as highlighted in previous research (74).
The triad encompassing informational, cognitive, and socio-affective support amid the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the significance of scientific education (75). The dissemination of information regarding the outbreak can lead to challenges, obstacles, disorders, and interruptions in the teaching and learning dynamics, potentially resulting in enduring alterations in the conduct of both educators and students. Consequently, for this interaction between educators and learners to be effective, it is imperative that they reciprocally generate suitable reactions tailored to sensory and emotional cues, ensuring the maintenance of an alert state conducive to the absorption of content disseminated throughout the pandemic (76).
In the intricate landscape of the current reality, confinement emerges as the primary prophylactic measure to curb the spread of the virus (2, 77). In this context, educators and learners are compelled to cultivate novel adaptive behaviors and responses, undergoing physiological changes in reaction to the prevailing crisis. This transformative journey involves a spectrum of emotions ranging from fear to courage, with individuals oscillating between these states. The ongoing battle against COVID-19 necessitates a concerted effort of cognitive and emotional engagement to mitigate the escalating levels of anxiety and uncertainty that contribute to psychological distress.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the paramount importance of preserving life, a significant challenge lies in the reorganization of behaviors, particularly in the educational sphere. This reorganization necessitates a scientific perspective that can effectively transform the repercussions of the pandemic into opportunities for growth. Neurosciences highlight neuroplasticity as a fundamental principle, offering educators and students a tool to navigate the challenges and conflicts arising during and post the pandemic (43). The current adverse circumstances underscore the importance of developing and honing skills and abilities, emphasizing the imperative of fostering autonomy in studying. It is crucial to recognize that the teaching-learning process is inherently dialectical, where issues such as memory and attention deficits can often be intertwined and mistaken for one another (78).
Within the realm of contemporary rationality, the COVID-19 pandemic prompts a reevaluation of the interplay between scientific knowledge and common sense. In this light, neurosciences offer a potential avenue for reshaping the teaching-learning dynamic, aiming to mitigate the psychological distress and subsequent ramifications—such as anxiety and depression—experienced by educators and learners amidst the pandemic (79).
A virus such as SARS-CoV-2 does not exploit weaknesses but rather should be viewed in terms of its potential, serving as a gateway to a new world where human evolution surpasses the resilient processes of emotion, memory, and decision-making. In essence, there is a crucial need for an educational approach that empowers both educators and learners to comprehend reality through the lens of science.
Given the incomplete understanding of SARS-CoV-2, emotions like fear and anxiety are commonly experienced. Consequently, in this pivotal societal context, the validation of knowledge becomes crucial for enhancing teaching-learning methodologies, strategies, and tactics. Essentially, educators and learners must foster a relationship grounded in ethical and humanitarian principles that uphold scientific values. Education emerges as a pivotal arena for decision-making amidst the COVID-19 crisis, underscoring the necessity for multidisciplinary growth through the integration of neurosciences and education to foster synergy.
