COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the enve­
loped, single-stranded RNA coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, 
which has resulted in an increasing number of fatalities 
across the world. The first warnings on COVID-19, or 
SARS-CoV-2, were issued by Dr. Li Wenliang, an ophthal-
mologist in Wuhan province, China, in December 2019. 
Unfortunately, he died a little later, as a victim of the 
illness, at age 34 years. Emerging evidence suggests that 
Dr. Li could have been infected after contact with a  
patient who was asymptomatic at the time of consulta-
tion but presented the symptoms afterward(1).
Recently, Wu et al.(2) when examining a group of 38 
hospitalized patients found signs of conjunctivitis in al-
most 32% of cases to be more pronounced in the sickest 
ones. Those patients were admitted due to their more 
severe signs and symptoms, with a probable diagnosis of 
COVID-19 [28 of them with positive viral RNA confirma-
tion in the oropharynx secretion, tested using polyme-
rase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR)]. 
Histological signs of the viral infection were detected 
in two conjunctival samples of the 11 patients tested 
(18%). These results have been considered as the first 
confirmation of the viral invasion to the conjunctiva and 
were sufficient to emphasize the vital advice of protecting 
health professionals who would be dealing with tears and 
ocular secretions of patients with suspected COVID-19 
and red eyes. In addition, these authors emphasized that 
conjunctivitis may be a relatively common finding in 
patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia. The most 
common clinical picture of patients with conjunctivitis 
observed in this case series included hyperemia, tearing, 
chemosis, and mucous discharge.
Subsequent reports suggested a typical follicular 
conjunctivitis in patients with COVID-19. Chen et al.(3) 
reported that 25 of 534 patients with COVID-19 (4.7%) 
showed conjunctival congestion, and in three of them, 
that was the very initial clinical sign described. Con-
junctival congestion had persisted for approximately 5 
days, with a range of 2-10 days, associated with dry eye 
symptoms (21%), blurred vision (13%), and foreign body 
sensation (12%). The majority of patients had eye com-
plaints associated with fever and respiratory symptoms, 
including dry cough and shortness of breath.
Therefore, this situation arises a crucial question, 
i.e., is it possible that tears of patients with confirmed 
COVID-19, without signs of conjunctivitis, can infect 
health professionals?
Notwithstanding all the strongly recommended 
care procedures when dealing with any secretions of 
patients with COVID-19, and the potential presence of 
viral RNA in the conjunctiva, a few studies have sug-
gested a relatively low probability of detection of virus 
in the tears of patients with COVID-19 who do not 
manifest the clinical signs of conjunctivitis.
In a small study, no viral RNA was detected in either 
tears or conjunctival secretions of 30 patients with 
SARS-CoV-2 who presented moderate or severe respi-
ratory symptoms and no signs of conjunctivitis(4). These 
patients had detectable RNA levels in the oropharynx 
samples, and only one patient with conjunctivitis and 
severe symptoms of COVID-19 had viral RNA in tears.
In a later study, consisting of 72 patients with  
SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by RT-PCR at the Tongji School of 
Medicine, only two patients had conjunctivitis (2.8%)(5).

Coronavirus and the eye: what is relevant so far?

Only one of them, with signs of conjunctivitis, had viral 
RNA detected in tears. None of the other 70 patients, 
without signs of conjunctivitis, had their tears tested 
positive for COVID-19.
Considering the unaccountable frequency of con-
junctival congestion and confirmation of the presence of 
COVID-19 in the eyes, we may discuss safety for the use 
of contact lenses. For the health professionals, both eye 
protection (goggles or face shield) and other appropriate 
personal protective equipment (PPE) are mandatory in a 
hospital environment, irrespective of the use of contact 
lenses or corrective glasses. The general public has been 
recommended to wear glasses instead of contact lenses, 
as glasses may be an additional physical barrier to the 
aerosol particles that can potentially reach the eyes.
It is important to consider the potential risk of conta-
mination due to the handling of contact lenses, including 
the well-known fact that patients who wear glasses tend 
to scratch and manipulate the eyes less compared with 
contact lens wearers. Although speculative, the contact 
lens surfaces, mostly manufactured using polymethyl 
acrylate and/or silicone and their derivatives, as well as 
the lens storage boxes, can harbor the virus for several 
hours and even days. We believe that wearing glasses is 
the safest general option during this COVID-19 outbreak. 
However, if one chooses to continue using contact len-
ses, extreme care must be taken regarding hand washing 
when handling the lenses, in addition to not scratching 
the eyes or face, and to the use of PPE when attending a 
hospital setting.
In the actual context, what could be the recom-
mendations for health professionals who are caring for 
patients with conjunctivitis and suspected COVID-19? 
The recommended procedures, when caring for patients 
with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, comprise the 
protection of the mouth, nose, and eyes using surgical 
masks (or N-95 masks in hotspots) and either goggles or 
face shields. Furthermore, breath shields attached to 
slit-lamps are useful to protect ophthalmologists(6).
To prevent the transmission of COVID-19, the same 
disinfection practices that are already used to prevent 
the spread of other viral pathogens commonly found 
in clinical practice should be reinforced. Finally, in 
addition to the guidance of rescheduling elective vi-
sits and surgeries, cleaning and disinfection must be 
performed before and after examining each patient, 
because SARS-CoV-2 has been detected up to few days 
in some surface materials (see https://www.cdc.gov/
coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-di-
sinfection.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.
