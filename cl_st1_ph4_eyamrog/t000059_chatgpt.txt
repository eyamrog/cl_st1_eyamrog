This study utilized bibliographic open data sourced from the Pan American Health Organization's Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME) and open data derived by Scanff and colleagues (2021) from bibliographic data offered by the United States National Library of Medicine. It is important to note that neither BIREME nor the United States National Library of Medicine bear any responsibility for potential errors present in this manuscript.
Objective: The aim of this study is to delineate authorship concentration indexes, specifically the proportion of articles by the most prolific author (PPMP) and the Gini coefficient, within health sciences journals listed in LILACS. Additionally, this research seeks to contrast these findings with those of a prior study conducted on MEDLINE.
Methods: Bibliographic data were retrieved from LILACS, focusing on systematically indexed journals that featured a minimum of 50 signed articles (indicating at least one individual author) spanning the years 2015 to 2019. Authors were identified either by their name or, where feasible, their ORCID id. The PPMP was calculated as the ratio of articles authored by the most prolific writer of a journal to the total number of signed articles. The Gini coefficient was utilized to account for articles with multiple authors. To facilitate comparison, MEDLINE data were adjusted to mirror the distribution of journal size (measured by the number of signed articles) observed in LILACS journals.
Results: The study encompassed 568 journals, each containing a median of 166 signed articles. The median PPMP stood at 4.5% (with a 95th percentile of 12.9%), while the median Gini coefficient was calculated at 0.149 (with a 95th percentile of 0.310). Notably, there was a positive correlation observed between journal size and PPMP, whereas the Gini coefficient exhibited a negative correlation. Interestingly, MEDLINE journals displayed lower PPMP values and higher Gini coefficients initially, yet this distinction vanished upon data reweighting.
Conclusions: The inclusion criteria of LILACS effectively mitigate any potential pro-endogeneity bias that may arise from university ownership of regional journals. When evaluating journals, it is important to consider their size in relation to authorship concentration indexes. A formal derivation of the relationship between these indexes and journal size would enhance the precision of their interpretation.
According to the Council of Science Editors (2018), the World Association of Medical Editors (2009 Jul 25), and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (2021), editorial decisions should be based solely on the work's validity and interest to readers, rather than on any potential competing interests of the editors or the commercial interests of the journal owner. Journals owned by universities and other research institutions present a unique challenge in this regard, as editors may share competing interests with the journal owners. These journals often align closely with the research activities of the parent organization, leading to potential affiliations among editors, reviewers, and authors. This inherent endogeneity, as highlighted by Barradas and Pinheiro (2016), can introduce bias into the peer review process, resulting in a more lenient evaluation and a limited diversity of perspectives, ultimately undermining the journal's impact on the scientific community. This issue is further discussed by Sarigöl and colleagues (2017).
Recently, a high-profile scandal involving editors affiliated with the same institution as the authors prompted Locher and colleagues (2021 Mar 30) to introduce an authorship concentration index, which measures the proportion of articles by the most prolific author, as an indicator of endogeneity. Subsequently, Scanff and colleagues (2021) proposed a second index, the Gini coefficient of inequality, and validated both indexes in a representative sample of journals indexed in MEDLINE. When either index exceeded its 95th percentile, it was found that the journal's most prolific author was more likely to be involved in the editorial board. Additionally, the most prolific authors had a higher likelihood of having their articles accepted in under three weeks, with this publication lag being even shorter in journals with a greater number of articles by their most prolific author. As discussed by Scanff and colleagues (2021), while there are valid reasons for editors to publish in their own journals and for articles from prolific authors to undergo quicker evaluations, both authorship concentration indexes can serve as tools for identifying journals that may be considered potentially endogenous, labeled as "self-promotion journals" (as per Locher and colleagues (2021 Mar 30)) or "nepotistic journals" (as per Scanff and colleagues (2021)).
According to Scanff and colleagues (2021), approximately one third of the journals suspected of endogeneity were found to be published in languages other than English, despite the predominance of English-language journals in MEDLINE. This bias towards English-language publications suggests that the proposed 95th cutoffs may not be applicable to health sciences journals published in other languages, particularly those not included in MEDLINE. Such journals are more likely to be featured in the World Health Organization's Global Index Medicus, which consists of five regional bibliographic indexes focusing on low- and middle-income countries. The primary regional index among these is the Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS), overseen by the Pan American Health Organization's Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (known by its original Portuguese acronym, BIREME) (Clark and Castro, 2002).
Most scientific journals in the region are owned by universities (Fischman et al., 2010; Beigel et al., 2021), potentially indicating that journals in LILACS may exhibit a higher degree of endogeneity compared to those in MEDLINE. However, the region has a longstanding tradition of incorporating endogeneity in journal evaluations (Amorim et al., 2015; Rozemblum et al., 2015; Paz Enrique et al., 2016; Boas et al., 2021), with the absence of significant endogeneity being a key criterion for journal selection in LILACS (Suga, 2019). The overall endogeneity of LILACS-indexed journals is likely influenced by the interplay between these two factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to delineate authorship concentration indexes within health sciences journals listed in LILACS and to juxtapose them with the findings of Scanff and colleagues (2021) in MEDLINE.
This bibliographic study focused on LILACS data from the years 2015 to 2019, specifically targeting journals that contained a minimum of 50 articles authored by identifiable individuals ("signed articles"). In January 2022, the iAH (Interface for Access on Health Information) search interface within BIREME's Virtual Health Library was utilized to identify documents indexed as journal articles during the specified study period. Subsequently, in May 2022, BIREME supplied a database containing journal information, including abbreviated titles, LILACS indexing, and subject classifications (referred to as Health Sciences Descriptors – DeCS). All gathered data were retrieved in the ISO 2709 format, imported into the R statistical environment version 4.2.1 (R Core Team 2022) along with the stringi 1.7.8 package (Gagolewski 2022), and custom code developed for this analysis (Fontenelle 2022) was applied to filter the dataset, focusing solely on signed articles from systematically indexed journals with a minimum of 50 such articles.
The ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) identifier was utilized to disambiguate authors whenever feasible, accounting for 7.2% of the total "authorships" (calculated as the number of authors per article multiplied by the number of articles). Following a basic processing step of author names, which involved removing extraneous elements, the ORCID ID was employed in place of author names in instances where a single ORCID ID was associated with a particular name. This process was reiterated after modifying author names to eliminate diacritics (encoding names in ASCII) and substituting hyphens with white spaces (a practice sometimes adopted by Spanish-language authors to facilitate indexing by their first family name). Ultimately, 148 (0.5%) distinct author names were linked to multiple ORCID IDs, occasionally appearing without any ORCID ID. In cases where the appropriate ORCID ID was ambiguous, these authors (along with those lacking an ORCID ID) were identified solely by their author name, as exemplified by Scanff and colleagues (2021).
Authorship concentration at the journal level, over the five-year period, was assessed through two key metrics: the proportion of articles contributed by the most prolific author and the Gini coefficient. The most prolific author for each journal was identified as the individual with the highest number of published articles within that specific journal. The proportion of articles attributed to this author was determined by dividing the number of their articles by the total number of signed articles in the journal. The Gini coefficient, a measure ranging from zero (indicating perfect equality) to one (indicating complete inequality), was computed as per the methodology outlined by Jasso (1979). For a comprehensive evaluation of the different approaches to calculating the Gini coefficient, readers are referred to Davidson (2009).
Both indexes were characterized by their median, interquartile range, total range, and 95th percentile. The association between the indexes and journal size was elucidated through scatter plots created using ggplot2, version 3.3.5 (Wickham 2016). The correlation of journal subjects and countries with these variables was delineated by superimposing the same scatter plots with a smoothing spline for each subject or country boasting 20 or more journals.
For enhanced comparability, data from Scanff and colleagues (2021) underwent reweighting to align journal sizes with the distribution observed among LILACS journals. Omitting a sensitivity analysis that limited data to research articles, the current study justified this decision based on the previous study's findings of consistent results. Moreover, within the dataset of the present study, only 244 journals featured a minimum of 50 signed articles with an explicit publication type, indicating an even smaller subset with at least 50 research articles.
The search yielded 148,667 articles from a minimum of 933 journals, with some uncommon entries lacking an ISSN. Among these, 130,312 articles were found in 698 journals that were systematically indexed by LILACS during the specified timeframe. Notably, 126,774 of these articles were authored pieces published in 568 journals that had a minimum of 50 signed articles between 2015 and 2019.
The median journal size, as indicated in Table 1, was 166 signed articles. In contrast, Scanff and colleagues (2021) found that MEDLINE journals had a median size of 500 signed articles, with an interquartile range of 262 to 964. Following reweighting, it was observed that MEDLINE journals exhibited a similar size distribution to those found in LILACS (1).
The most prolific author in the journals had a median of 8 articles, representing 4.5% of the signed articles, with a 95th percentile of 12.9% (Table 1). A quarter of the journals featured more than one author sharing the title of the most prolific. Notably, Universitas Scientiarum, with 81 signed articles, stood out with 61.7% of the total, more than double the next highest percentage. This journal, which prominently identifies the editor on the articles' first page, often creates an impression in SciELO and LILACS records that the editor is one of the authors. For clarity, this journal was excluded from panels A and C of Figure 1. Consistent with Scanff and colleagues (2021), the proportion of articles by the most prolific author decreased and showed less variation in journals with a higher number of articles (panel A in Figure 1).
The median Gini coefficient stood at 0.149, with a 95th percentile reaching 0.310 (1). Notably, no journal exhibited an exceptionally high Gini coefficient, as illustrated in panel B of Figure 1. However, Ágora, with 91 signed articles, notably displayed a coefficient of zero. This particular journal maintained an average of two authors per article, with no author contributing more than one article throughout the study period. Consistent with the findings of Scanff and colleagues (2021), the coefficient tended to be higher on average yet less variable for journals with a greater number of articles, as depicted in panel B of Figure 1.
The relationship between the Gini coefficient and the proportion of articles by the most prolific author was contingent on the number of articles, as illustrated in panel C of Figure 1. This observation aligns with the anticipated connection between each index and the volume of articles. Specifically, journals with a higher number of articles exhibited a lower proportion, regardless of the Gini coefficient. Conversely, journals with a lower number of articles displayed larger proportions if they possessed higher Gini coefficients.
In contrast to journals listed in LILACS, those listed in MEDLINE exhibited a reduced proportion of articles authored by the most prolific author (median 2.9%, 95th percentile 10.6%) and a higher Gini coefficient (median 0.183, 95th percentile 0.355), as outlined by Scanff and team (2021). Nevertheless, following the reweighting of MEDLINE journals, the authorship concentration metrics in MEDLINE aligned closely with those observed in LILACS (Table 1).
The significance of journal size resurfaced during the grouping of LILACS journals based on subject or country of publication. In Figure 2, the average concentration index for each journal size is depicted for the six countries with a minimum of 20 journals, out of the total 18 countries in the database. Similarly, Figure 3 illustrates the average concentration index for each journal size across the six subjects with a minimum of 20 journals, out of the 183 subjects in the database. Notably, for each country and subject, larger journals exhibited a lower proportion of articles by the most prolific author and a higher Gini coefficient.
This study delineated the distribution of two newly proposed indicators of endogeny among health science journals indexed in LILACS. The proportion of articles by the most prolific author was found to be higher in LILACS journals compared to MEDLINE journals, while the Gini coefficient was lower in LILACS journals. However, upon adjusting for journal size, both differences between the two sets of journals vanished.
If university ownership does indeed contribute to endogeneity in scientific journals, this potential effect appears to be mitigated by the inclusion criteria of LILACS. Notably, the current study included ORCID IDs for certain authors, a practice that is likely to enhance concentration indexes compared to solely relying on authors' names. Moreover, LILACS offers a more direct measurement of endogeneity by considering the proportion of reviewers and editors from the same institution or geographic region, whereas the present study employed more indirect measures. The efficacy of LILACS criteria is underscored by the fact that their impact is evident even when success is assessed using different metrics than those employed by LILACS itself. Researchers aiming to assess the impact of journal ownership by universities on endogeneity may need to explore this in emerging journals that are not yet indexed in LILACS.
An important consideration for practical application is the need for journal evaluations, whether conducted internally or externally, to take into account the size of the journal when analyzing authorship concentration indexes. For instance, in a journal that publishes a thousand articles, it would not be unusual for the most prolific author to have authored only 1% of them (equivalent to ten articles). In contrast, journals with a smaller output of fifty articles would see even the least prolific authors contributing a minimum of 2%. Furthermore, larger journals have the capacity to cater to more extensive and diverse scientific communities compared to smaller journals. It is worth noting that the Gini coefficient, or any other measure of inequality, for overall populations tends to be higher than the Gini coefficient calculated for their sub-populations, particularly if there exists inequality among these sub-populations (Pyatt, 1976).
It is probable that this phenomenon extends beyond health sciences journals in Latin America and the Caribbean to encompass publications from various other regions. If the authorship concentration indexes in journals listed in MEDLINE mirror those in LILACS when adjusted for journal size, it is reasonable to anticipate a similar pattern in other reputable bibliographic databases, particularly within the realm of health sciences. The disproportionate presence of non-English language journals in the outliers identified by Scanff and colleagues (2021) could potentially be attributed to larger English-language journals dominating the field, although this hypothesis falls outside the current study's scope. The question of whether the distribution of authorship concentration indexes is consistent across disciplines beyond health sciences remains unanswered.
Research is imperative to offer a more stringent elucidation of the correlation between journal size and authorship concentration indexes. Understanding how an ideally non-endogenous journal's fluctuations in the quantity of signed articles impact these indexes is crucial. This comprehension would facilitate a more accurate analysis of the indexes, empowering researchers to confidently juxtapose countries or subjects and explore whether larger journals tend to be less or more endogenous than their smaller counterparts.
