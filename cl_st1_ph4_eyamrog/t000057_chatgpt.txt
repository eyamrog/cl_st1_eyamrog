Plant composition, diversity, and structure of riparian forests in Central Brazil are well-documented, yet there remains a dearth of information regarding the soil physical properties within these ecosystems. Understanding these properties is crucial as a foundational step for biodiversity restoration efforts and the preservation of ecosystem services within riparian zones. To address this gap, our study focused on assessing the infiltration capacity and soil penetration resistance in a plinthic soil beneath a gallery forest in Planaltina, Distrito Federal, Brazil. Utilizing the Mini-Disk infiltrometer and Stof penetrometer along linear transects, we found that the plinthic soil exhibited high infiltration capacity and low penetration resistance. Our infiltration estimate falls within the mid-range when compared to similar permeability studies in tropical forests, suggesting that the high topsoil permeability to water in this ecosystem may be attributed to the elevated biological activity and minimal disturbance typically observed in such environments.
Gallery forests, also referred to as riparian forests, are found along small streams within the Cerrado biome of Brazil (Ribeiro and Walter, 1998). These forests are renowned for their plant species composition, diversity, and structure, as evidenced by various studies (Felfili 1994, Felfili 1995, Nóbrega et al. 2001, Silva Júnior 2004, Silva Júnior 2005, Moretti et al. 2013, Cabacinha & Fontes 2014, Pio 2018). They typically exhibit a high level of biological diversity, a characteristic that may be attributed to the heterogeneous nature of the soil types on which they thrive, encompassing both well-drained and poorly drained soils (Haridasan 1998). For instance, these forests can be found on oxisols (latossolos) and histosols (organossolos) (Resck & Silva 1998). Given the distinct hydric behavior of these soil types, they not only impact the plant community but are also likely to influence the ecosystem service provided by riparian forests as buffer zones. In the case of riparian forests on histosols, they may not effectively mitigate surface runoff from uplands during the wet season due to water saturation, as described in studies by Dunne & Black (1970a,b). Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend the hydrological functions of these forests across different soil types.
Riparian forests, like many others worldwide, are anticipated to play crucial roles in buffering functions by retaining sediment, nutrients, and human-made chemicals such as pesticides. The underlying assumption is that the riparian soil in these forests exhibits high topsoil permeability, which consequently reduces or eliminates surface runoff from uplands (Salemi et al., 2011). However, there is currently a lack of documented information regarding the basic topsoil permeability of these riparian forests. Understanding these specific properties within distinct physical contexts could provide insights into whether they are fulfilling their anticipated functions. Furthermore, this knowledge could establish a foundational understanding that may aid scientists and managers in predicting the consequences of improper riparian land use and restoration efforts (Brito et al., 2019; Pereira et al., 2021).
In this study, the primary aim was to characterize a plinthic soil located beneath a riparian forest by assessing its infiltration capacity and soil penetration resistance. It was hypothesized that, similar to other tropical rainforests, these riparian forests would exhibit a high level of water permeability.
The study area chosen for this research is a riparian forest situated in Planaltina, Distrito Federal, Brazil. This region falls under the Köppen-Geiger climatic classification of Aw, characterized by two distinct seasons - dry and wet (Alvares et al., 2013). The annual rainfall in this area amounts to 1,393 mm, with almost all of it occurring during the wet season from October to April (Malaquias et al., 2010). The average temperature recorded is 20.7°C. The soil in this area is classified as a clay Plintossolo (Plinthosols) according to the Brazilian Soil Classification System (Embrapa, 2018).
Riparian forests in the study area exhibit high plant species diversity, with tree density and basal area typically ranging from 1,300 to 1,900 individuals per hectare and 32 to 38 square meters per hectare, respectively (Nóbrega et al., 2001; Silva Júnior, 2004; Silva Júnior, 2005). Among the common species found in these forests are Protium spruceanum (Benth.) Engl. (Burseraceae), Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. (Fabaceae), Tapirira guianensis Aubl. (Anacardiaceae), Inga alba (Sw.) Willd. (Fabaceae), Cheiloclinium cognatum (Miers) A.C.Sm. (Celastraceae), Pseudolmedia guaranitica Hasler (Moraceae), Euterpe edulis Mart. (Arecaceae), and Talauma ovata A. St.-Hill. (Magnoliaceae) (Nóbrega et al., 2001; Silva Júnior, 2004; Silva Júnior, 2005).
Variables and sampling design - In the dry season of 2018, we assessed infiltration capacity and soil resistance to penetration using the Mini-Disk infiltrometer (Decagon) and the Stof Impact Penetrometer (Kamaq).
The Mini-disk infiltrometer, a two-chamber device utilizing the Mariotte principle to regulate soil suction, employs the analytical solution proposed by Zhang (1997). Following the approach of Ghimire et al. (2013), we implemented two steps to enhance the contact area between the infiltrometer and the soil: firstly, meticulously removing the litter layer, and secondly, applying a thin layer of fine sand (< 1 mm). These procedures were crucial in ensuring optimal contact between the infiltrometer and the soil. To encompass a broad range of pores, a suction pressure of 0 cm, equivalent to Ko or the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Reichardt & Timm 2019), was set. Water discharge rates through the Mini-Disk were monitored by observing changes in water levels in the storage chamber until a steady-state flow was achieved. Infiltration measurements were conducted along three randomly distributed linear transects within the riparian forest (refer to figure 2). The random selection of these transects was facilitated by a randomizer software (randomizer.org), which chose 3 out of 50 grid transects. Ten infiltration samples were collected from each of these transects, established parallel to the stream channel. To mitigate the impact of soil moisture on infiltration measurements, known to vary significantly between months (Pereira et al. 2021), two precautions were taken: measurements were conducted in August (dry season) when regional soil moisture is minimal (Oliveira et al. 2005), and a suction pressure of 0 cm was set in the Mariotte bottle.
To forecast the riparian forest's ability to withstand regional storms, we conducted a comparison between our median infiltration capacity and the 5-minute rainfall intensities associated with various return periods (100, 50, and 25 years) as documented in Souza's (2014) research.
Soil penetration resistance was assessed ten times along the linear transects outlined in Figure 2. Four impacts were chosen arbitrarily to gauge soil penetration resistance. The initial impact was attributed to the equipment's inherent weight, while the subsequent three impacts were a consequence of a standard 2 kg weight being introduced into the soil. To mitigate the influence of soil moisture on our penetration readings, measurements were conducted during the dry season (August), a period characterized by minimal soil moisture levels (Oliveira et al., 2005).
Data analysis - Sample sufficiency was assessed for infiltration capacity by plotting the mean and standard deviation against the number of samples. A sufficient sample size was deemed achieved when central tendency statistics exhibited stability for a minimum of three consecutive instances (Salemi et al., 2020).
The residuals of soil penetration resistance underwent a Shapiro-Wilk test, revealing a departure from a Gaussian distribution. Consequently, we employed the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the post hoc Dunn test, to assess significant differences between impacts. Statistical analyses were conducted using PAST software with a significance level set at α < 0.05.
The number of samples utilized for infiltration was deemed appropriate, considering the relative stabilization of the median statistics (Figure 3). The median infiltration capacity stood at 893 mm hr-1 (Figure 4). The mean (± standard deviation) of soil penetration resistance for all four impacts were as follows: 0.63 ± 0.21 MPa, 0.66 ± 0.32 MPa, 0.74 ± 0.22 MPa, and 0.76 ± 0.22 MPa (Figure 5). A notable increase in soil penetration resistance with depth was observed, a phenomenon previously documented in a forest within the Brazilian savanna (Pereira et al., 2021). Our penetration resistance was lower compared to a nearby savanna (regionally known as “Cerrado típico”) in the same area (Murta et al., 2021). This disparity in soil penetration resistance between the riparian forest and savanna could be attributed to the higher and more consistent litter addition year-round in the forest compared to the savanna (Costa et al., 2020). For instance, Aquino et al. (2016) reported an average of 6 ton ha-1 year-1 in a riparian forest, while Valenti et al. (2008) found 0.6 ton ha-1 year-1 in a savanna.
The infiltration capacity of the plinthic soil under riparian forest was observed to be within the intermediate range when compared to estimates conducted in other tropical forests like the Amazon and Atlantic Forest (see table 1). Typically, elevated soil biological activity, including continuous litter production, root growth and decay, and the presence of soil fauna, combined with minimal disturbance such as human and animal trampling or the use of heavy machinery, contribute to high infiltration rates in forest soils (Bruijnzeel, 1990; Salemi et al., 2011).
Our median infiltration capacity estimate exceeded the rain intensity of various storms in the region (Figure 4), indicating the absence of infiltration excess overland-flow in this forest. However, our penetration resistance suggested a likely decrease in permeability with depth, a phenomenon anticipated due to the presence of the plinthic horizon. Previous research on plinthic soils demonstrated the formation of a perched water table above such layers (Moraes et al., 2006). Additionally, riparian forests, like the one under study, are typically found in areas with shallow water tables (Ribeiro & Walter, 2008). When the water table intersects the soil surface, whether perched or not, both return-flow and overland-flow can be initiated (Dunne & Black, 1970a, b; Elsenbeer & Vertessy, 2000), potentially leading to saturation overland-flow. Contrary to the expected role of surface runoff sinks, these zones may function as surface runoff sources instead. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the percolation capacities of these soils and their implications for runoff processes.
