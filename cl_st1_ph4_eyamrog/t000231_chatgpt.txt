In Egypt, the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was marked by the presence of asymptomatic carriers, also known as covert carriers, who tested positive for the virus but displayed no symptoms while being able to transmit it. Many researchers suggest the existence of an undetected reservoir of such carriers, as some infections could not be linked to contact with infected individuals or travel to high-risk areas. Recent studies indicate that certain populations may harbor up to 50% of covert carriers. The unfolding of events leading to the current epidemic sheds light on this phenomenon. The first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Egypt, a Chinese national, was reported on February 14, 2020, upon his arrival in Cairo. The extended duration spent in close quarters during the flight from China to Cairo, which typically takes around 15 hours, provided ample opportunity for viral shedding. Subsequent testing of all contacts at that time yielded negative results, indicating the potential for silent transmission by asymptomatic carriers.
On February 28, four foreigners who had traveled to Egypt were reported to be infected: two French nationals, one Canadian national, and one Taiwanese national. This occurrence was particularly notable as, up to that point, Egypt had not recorded any cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prompting various questions. The situation became more complex with the emergence of another incident involving the Egyptian Cruise Ship MS Aâ€™ Sara in late February and early March. Following their trip to Luxor, approximately 18 Americans were confirmed to have contracted SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent investigations revealed that 12 crew members had tested positive for the virus, with the initial case traced back to a Taiwanese-American female tourist who had traveled on the ship between late January and early February. It was determined that she had transmitted the virus to the crew members, none of whom displayed any symptoms. Despite these developments, the Egyptian Health Authorities had not officially reported any cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection at that time.
On March 6, three confirmed cases involving Egyptian nationals were documented, and by March 9, a total of 59 COVID-19 cases had been reported. This timeline suggests that from the initial exposure on February 14, it took nearly a month for overt cases to manifest, a notably prolonged period in a country with a population of 100 million. Moreover, all individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 earlier displayed no signs or symptoms. A plausible explanation for this epidemiological conundrum is that the virus caused covert or asymptomatic infections during this interval. As highlighted by researchers from the United States of America, asymptomatic individuals are significant contributors to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Following March 6, there has been a consistent emergence of overt and symptomatic cases. Figure 1 illustrates the postulated sequences implicated in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak among Egyptians. As of May 6, a total of 7201 confirmed cases have been reported. A meticulous data analysis conducted on a scientific basis, informed by recent publications, has yielded crucial preliminary findings. Apart from shedding light on the pivotal role of covert carriers in the pandemic's onset, further investigation is warranted into the nature of patient-virus interactions within the Egyptian population. Theoretically, these interactions may stem from host and/or viral factors. Host factors are intricately linked to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), recognized as the primary human receptor for the viral spike (S) protein attachment, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells and subsequent viral replication. Given the variable expression levels and patterns of ACE2, a spectrum of disease forms and severities can be anticipated.
Viral factors potentially involved in patient-virus interactions encompass changes in viral characteristics attributed to selective pressures, whether biotic or abiotic. A critical element in this dynamic is virus mutation. Recent findings suggest the existence of three distinct mutants of SARS-CoV-2, hinting at the likelihood of additional mutants in diverse geographic regions, potentially leading to variations in clinical manifestations and outcomes. Notably, a study from England unveiled the presence of at least 12 strains of coronavirus in the United Kingdom, including one exclusive to the region, indicating a mutation event within British borders.
The prevalence of asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens poses a significant medical challenge. A recent study revealed a rise in the percentage of asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from 0% to 28.6%.
Contrary to the commonly accepted belief that severe cases are detected early in an outbreak followed by less severe cases such as paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Egypt actually began with asymptomatic carriers. This suggests that other outbreaks globally might have initiated in a similar fashion, where individuals were not symptomatic enough to seek medical attention or testing. With over 3 million infections and the ongoing global spread of COVID-19, there is a pressing need for a new approach that involves expanding testing to include asymptomatic individuals in targeted settings.
Further research is necessary to ascertain the validity of the aforementioned assumptions across diverse geographic regions and ethnic groups. Understanding the natural progression of coronavirus outbreaks in varying locations is essential for policymakers to develop effective prevention strategies, tailor surveillance programs, and forecast outcomes while assessing interventions. Additionally, in-depth molecular research is imperative to identify and characterize the subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 prevalent in Egypt.
