The study focused on identifying and documenting smooth or finely punctate cell-walled Cosmarium Corda species in the low Doce river region of Espírito Santo State, Brazil, following ore tailings flow. Periphytic material was collected monthly from October 2018 to February 2020, excluding October 2019. A total of 22 taxa were identified, and the environmental conditions (including trophic state, pH, and total iron) in which each taxon occurred were analyzed. The research documented 21 new records of smooth cell-walled Cosmarium for Espírito Santo State and one new record (Cosmarium trilobulatum var. tumidum Willi Krieger & Gerloff) for Brazil.
Originally described by Ralfs in 1848, the genus Cosmarium Corda encompasses over 1,500 taxa, making it one of the most numerous and oldest genera within the family Desmidiaceae. Comprising typically free-living single cells with a median constriction, these cells exhibit a range of variations from deep closed depressions to widely open and shallow ones, dividing the cell into two symmetrical semicells. The shape and size of these constrictions vary depending on the species (Bicudo & Menezes, 2017). Taxonomic classification of Cosmarium primarily relies on the cell outline and cell wall ornamentation. For practical categorization, taxonomists often categorize it into two artificial groups: one characterized by ornamented cell walls, which can range from small granules to scrobiculations and tiny spines, and the other group with smooth or finely punctate cell walls.
Genus Cosmarium has been extensively documented worldwide in various taxonomic surveys, spanning from classical 19th-century literature (e.g., Brébisson 1856, Lundell 1871, Nordstedt & Wittrock 1876, Ralfs 1848, West & G.S. West 1895) to more recent publications. The genus has been reported in numerous countries, including Nigeria (Biswas & Nweze 1990), Colombia (Duque & Donato 1996), Canada (Elster et al. 1997), Bangladesh (Islam & Irfanullah 2006), India (Dhande & Jawale 2009, Bansod & Patil 2019), Czech Republic (Šťastný 2009), South Korea (Lee 2015), and others. Brazil alone has documented over 600 Cosmarium taxa (Biolo & Bicudo 2018), with a particular focus on the southern region where extensive taxonomic studies have revealed its presence in both phytoplankton and periphyton of reservoirs and rivers. Recent floristic studies in Brazil have identified Cosmarium in various states such as Paraná, São Paulo, Bahia, Goiás, Distrito Federal, Amazonas, Sergipe, Mato Grosso, and Rio de Janeiro. In the past decade, five new species of Cosmarium have been described based on Brazilian material, along with a few taxonomic varieties. Despite boasting one of Brazil's most significant coastal lake systems (Barroso et al. 2012), Espírito Santo State has been notably overlooked in terms of algal flora studies. Delazari-Barroso et al. (2007) stands as the sole floristic study of the state, documenting the presence of four Cosmarium taxa (Cosmarium asphaerosporum var. strigosum Nordstedt, Cosmarium cf. capitulum J.Roy & Bisset, Cosmarium pseudobroomei Wolle, and Cosmarium pseudoconnatum Nordstedt).
The Low Doce River region is currently experiencing significant anthropogenic interference, both urban and rural, primarily attributed to livestock, agriculture, and the escalating industrialization, as noted by Barroso et al. (2012), predating the Fundão dam failure in 2015. Following the dam breach, approximately 43 million m³ of mining tailings were discharged downstream, leading to various alterations in the fluvial system, including erosion, degradation, and elevated levels of iron (Fe) that could potentially have significant impacts, as highlighted by Hatje et al. (2017). The absence of comprehensive floristic studies in the area, coupled with previous instances where mine tailing inputs have induced taxonomic and functional modifications in various communities like benthic fauna (Burd 2002), marine macroalgal flora (Correa et al. 1999), planktonic algae (Salonen et al. 2006), and benthic algal communities (Lavoie et al. 2012), underscores the critical need for biodiversity assessments of periphyton in this region.
The present study aimed to conduct a taxonomic survey of smooth cell-walled Cosmarium species in the Low Doce River region three years following the introduction of iron ore tailings. The study also focused on species autecology, thereby enhancing our understanding of freshwater algal diversity in Espírito Santo State.
The research was conducted in three cities within Espírito Santo State: Baixo Guandu, Colatina, and Linhares. Detailed information regarding the study area and sampling design can be found in Zorzal-Almeida et al. (2021). For taxonomic and ecological analysis, a minimum of five non-permanent slides were prepared for each sample. The material was observed and photographed using a Motic Panthera L digital binocular upright Olympus microscope and a Moticam 3.0 MP camera. Various taxonomic features were examined for the identification and description of the material under the microscope, including cell shape, number and position of chloroplasts and pyrenoids, cell wall structure, and metric data such as cell length, width, and isthmus width. Measurements of cell length (L), cell width (W), and isthmus width (I) were conducted using Motic Image Plus 3.0 software. Identification was based on a combination of classic literature sources (e.g., Ralfs 1848, West & West 1895, 1902, Croasdale 1956, Scott & Grönblad 1957, Krieger 1932) and recent papers (e.g., Coesel & Meesters 2007, Oliveira et al. 2016, Bicudo et al. 2019, etc.).
Environmental conditions were delineated based on ecosystem type (rivers, lagoons, and lakes), trophic state index (TSI), and pH levels, with the methodology outlined in Zorzal-Almeida et al. (2021). The pH classifications were acid (< 6.5), alkaline (> 7.5), and circumneutral (6.5-7.5) as per Šťastný (2010). The frequency of taxon occurrences was computed following the protocol established by Zorzal-Almeida et al. (2021). Taxa specific to Espírito Santo State were denoted with [*], while those representing the first citations for Brazil were marked with [**]. Specimens analyzed in this inventory have been archived at the Herbarium VIES/UFES.
Twenty-two smooth cell-walled Cosmarium Corda taxa have been identified, with 21 being documented for the first time in Espírito Santo State and one being a new record for Brazil. The list of taxa and their respective occurrence frequencies can be found in Table 1.
The cell is typically 1.1-1.2 times longer than broad, occasionally around 1.1 times broader than long. The median constriction is pronounced, with a linear sinus that is slightly open at the extremity. The semicells are trapezoidal in shape, with a truncate apex and rounded angles, while the lateral margins are either convex or slightly straight. The cell wall appears smooth, with one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. In apical view, the cell is elliptical, while in lateral view, the semicell appears circular. The dimensions of the cell range from 6.8-14.1 µm in length, 6.3-11.3 µm in width, and 1-4.3 µm in the constriction depth.
This variety exhibited significant morphological plasticity, particularly in terms of their length:width ratio and the shape of their lateral margins. Bicudo (1988) delved into the polymorphism observed in Cosmarium abbreviatum var. minus and its implications for the taxonomic classification of these diminutive desmids, hinting at the likelihood that several taxa, including Cosmarium succisum G.S.West var. jaoi Willi Krieger & Gerloff and C. abbreviatum var. minus, could potentially represent different morphological manifestations of the same species. The current specimens showcased the same range of morphological variations outlined in the aforementioned literature.
The present material was found in all studied lentic and lotic environments, spanning from oligotrophic to hypertrophic conditions and from acidic to alkaline environments.
The cell is approximately 1.4 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. The semicells are quadratic in shape, with a retuse to slightly truncate apex, parallel lateral margins, concave apical angles, and rounded basal angles. The cell wall is smooth, containing one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The dimensions of the cell are approximately 22.8 µm in length, 15.8 µm in width, and 5.1 µm in the constriction depth.
During the current study, only one specimen of this species was discovered, exhibiting slight variations from those documented in Brébisson (1856) and Coesel & Meesters (2007). The specimens observed in this study displayed a slight convexity at the middle of the apex, contrasting with the truncate apex seen in previous records. Additionally, the apical angles of the present specimens were concave, in contrast to the straight angles noted in earlier descriptions.
The current study gathered samples from a lentic environment characterized by oligotrophic alkaline conditions.
The cell is approximately 1.1 times broader than long, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. The semicells are semicircular in shape, with a truncate apex and rounded angles. The cell wall is punctate, containing 2 chloroplasts and 2 pyrenoids per semicell. The dimensions are as follows: length approximately 29.9 µm, width approximately 32.8 µm, and the median constriction depth around 10.4 µm.
Cosmarium baileyi exhibits morphological similarities to Cosmarium obsoletum (Hantzsch) Reinsch; however, a distinguishing feature is evident in their basal angles. While Cosmarium obsoletum showcases thickened, angular, and convergent basal angles, Cosmarium baileyi, in contrast, displays rounded basal angles.
The current data was collected in a lentic environment characterized by mesotrophic, eutrophic, hypertrophic, and circumneutral conditions.
The cell is approximately 1.1 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. The semicells are semicircular in shape, with rounded apices and angles. The cell wall is smooth, containing one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The dimensions of the cell are as follows: length ranging from 11.1 to 17.8 µm, width ranging from 9.7 to 15.2 µm, and the median constriction depth ranging from 3.1 to 5.4 µm.
The current variation observed deviates from the norm by featuring semicircular semicells rather than the more common triangular or nearly triangular shapes.
The materials utilized in this study were collected from a lentic environment characterized by a range of conditions from oligotrophic to eutrophic and alkaline.
The cell is approximately 1.4-1.5 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a widely open sinus. The semicells are ellipsoid in shape, with rounded apices and angles. Each semicell contains one chloroplast and one pyrenoid. Additionally, they are often enclosed in a spherical, inconspicuous mucilaginous envelope. The length of the cell ranges from 15.9 to 24.7 µm, the width from 10.9 to 17.4 µm, and the index from 3 to 4.4 µm.
This variant is distinguished by its smaller cell dimensions, with a length ranging from 29 to 30 μm and a breadth ranging from 18 to 25 μm, as reported by Coesel & Meesters (2007).
The current data was gathered from deep lakes spanning a range of conditions, from ultraoligotrophic to eutrophic and acidic to alkaline environments.
The cell is approximately 1.2-1.3 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a widely open sinus. The semicells are elliptical in shape, with a truncate to slightly rounded apex and rounded angles. The cell wall is punctate, containing one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The length of the cell ranges from 12 to 16.9 µm, the width from 9.4 to 14 µm, and the depth of the constriction from 2.8 to 3.9 µm.
According to Oliveira et al. (2016), Cosmarium contractum var. sparsipunctatum distinguishes itself from the standard variety through its reduced dimensions, punctate cell wall, elliptical semicells, and a more rounded and wider isthmus.
The current study gathered data from organisms residing in moderately deep lakes, specifically Nova and Limão, characterized by ultraoligotrophic, eutrophic, and circumneutral environmental conditions.
The cell is approximately 1.8 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a closed sinus near the isthmus that is open at the extremity. The semicells are quadratic in shape, with rounded apical and basal angles, a truncate apex, and a refractive thickening in the center. The cell wall is smooth, featuring three horizontal rows of punctations on each semicell. Each semicell contains one chloroplast and one pyrenoid. The dimensions of the cell are as follows: length ranging from 19.4 to 30.7 µm, width ranging from 10.8 to 17.9 µm, and the isthmus measuring between 3.5 and 3.7 µm.
The present species exhibits a unique characteristic not commonly seen in Cosmarium difficile Lütkemüller, specifically, a refractive thickening at the apex of the semicells. While the only known representative of C. difficile with this apical thickening is C. difficile f. laeve Scott & Prescott, this forma lacks the typical pore rows characteristic of the species. Consequently, it was determined that the current material is most appropriately classified as C. difficile, primarily due to the presence of the characteristic punctuation rows despite the initially unreported feature.
The potential for the current material to represent a novel strain of C. difficile remains an unresolved question that warrants future investigation. Further studies are needed to better define this strain at the intraspecific level.
The current study gathered data from lentic ecosystems spanning a range of trophic states, from oligotrophic to eutrophic, and encompassing circumneutral to alkaline pH levels.
The cell is approximately 1.1 times longer than it is broad, with a median constriction that is deep and a linear sinus. The semicells are trapezoidal in shape, with a truncate apex and rounded angles. The cell wall is punctate, containing 2 chloroplasts and 2 pyrenoids per semicell. The length of the cell ranges from 31.6 to 45.5 µm, the width from 31.2 to 43 µm, and the index from 10.8 to 14.3 µm.
The variety Cosmarium galeritum var. subtumidum is distinguished from the nominate variety by its more rounded semicells, as noted by Borge in 1903. The specimen under examination exhibits a rounded to slightly truncate apex, a variation reminiscent of Borge's illustration from 1903, which facilitated its current identification.
The current study identified the presence of the material in lentic systems characterized by a range of conditions from ultraoligotrophic to eutrophic, all of which maintained circumneutral pH levels.
The cell is typically 1.4-1.5 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. The semicells are pyramidal in shape, with a sharp or truncate round apex and rounded to straight basal angles. The cell wall is generally smooth, occasionally thickened at the apex, and contains one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The dimensions of the cell are as follows: length ranging from 20 to 38.2 µm, width from 13 to 26.7 µm, and the constriction depth from 4.4 to 9.7 µm.
Specimens examined exhibited a range of morphological characteristics. Cell shapes varied from pyramidal to slightly trapezoidal, basal angles ranged from wide concave to straight, and apices varied from rounded to truncate to slightly sharp. Bortolini et al. (2010) noted significant morphological variation in this species, a finding that was corroborated in the current study.
The materials under investigation were found in both lentic and lotic environments, spanning from ultraoligotrophic to supertrophic conditions and ranging from acidic to alkaline pH levels.
The cell is approximately 1.5 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. The semicells are semicircular in shape with undulating margins, exhibiting 6-7 undulations per semicell and rounded basal angles. The cell wall is smooth, containing one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The dimensions of the cell are as follows: length approximately 17 µm, width around 11.4 µm, and the median constriction measures about 3.2 µm.
Only one specimen of this species was identified in the current study. In comparison to the population described by Silva & Cecy (2004), the specimen discovered is notably longer and exhibits less prominent marginal undulations. Furthermore, it is smaller than the material documented by Felisberto & Rodrigues (2010) and displays fewer undulations at the lateral margins when contrasted with the findings of Menezes et al. (2011). While Cosmarium impressulum bears resemblance to Cosmarium undulatum Corda ex Ralfs, Bicudo et al. (2019) assert that they can be distinguished by the number of marginal undulations (C. undulatum possessing 10-12 undulations, while C. impressulum has up to 6) and their cell dimensions (C. undulatum being comparatively larger: 44-64 x 30-52 µm).
The current study focuses on the material found in the Doce River, which is characterized by mesotrophic and alkaline conditions.
The cell is 1.5-1.6 times longer than broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. The semicells are semicircular to subpyramidal, with an often asymmetrical apical margin, a rounded to slightly truncate apex, and rounded basal angles. The cell wall is smooth, with one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. In lateral view, the cell appears subcircular, with a length ranging from 18 to 20.4 µm, a width between 12.9 and 13.8 µm, and an index of 3.7-4.4 µm.
The current study gathered data from both flowing water (lotic) and standing water (lentic) environments, encompassing a wide range of nutrient levels from ultraoligotrophic to supertrophic and pH levels from circumneutral to alkaline.
The cell is approximately 1.2 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus that gradually opens towards the extremity. The semicells are pyramidal in shape, with a rounded to slightly truncate apex and rounded basal angles. The cell wall is punctate, containing 2 chloroplasts and 2 pyrenoids per semicell. The length ranges from 50 to 61.8 µm, the width from 40.2 to 51.6 µm, and the index from 13 to 20.4 µm.
The current study focuses on a unique aspect of present variety, which is characterized by being longer than broad but not as long as broad. The specimens examined in this research were found to be smaller in size compared to those described in the study by West and West (1895), with a length of approximately 81 µm, a width of around 70 µm, and an index of 33 µm.
The current study gathered data from a lentic ecosystem characterized by mesotrophic and alkaline conditions.
The cell is approximately 1.6-1.7 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a wide open sinus. The semicell is subcircular, with a wide rounded apex, convex lateral margins, and rounded angles. The cell wall is smooth, with one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The length ranges from 29.7 to 34.8 µm, the width from 17.5 to 21.3 µm, and the constriction depth from 4.5 to 6.5 µm.
According to Biolo et al. (2013), Cosmarium moniliforme bears a striking resemblance to Cosmarium contractum Kirchner, yet distinguishes itself by possessing semicells that are more subcircular and an apical view that is elliptical. While the apical view of the specimens under study was not directly observed, the identification of C. moniliforme was supported by the distinctive outline of its subcircular semicells.
The data presented in this study was collected from both flowing water (lotic) and standing water (lentic) ecosystems, consistently characterized by oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and alkaline conditions.
The cell is approximately 1.1 times longer than broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus that is slightly open near the extremity. The semicells are rectangular with a truncate apex, concave lateral margins, and rounded apical and basal angles. The cell wall is smooth, with one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The dimensions are as follows: length ranging from 11.1 to 12.9 µm, width from 9.7 to 11.6 µm, and the constriction depth from 3.5 to 4.8 µm.
Cosmarium norimbergense var. depressum is distinguished from the species' type by its vertically flattened cells, typically 1.1-1.2 times longer than broad (Aquino et al., 2014).
The samples for this study were obtained from a lentic system characterized by ultraoligotrophic, oligotrophic, and circumneutral-alkaline conditions.
The cell is approximately 1.4 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a wide-open sinus. The semicells are trapezoid in shape, with a truncate apex, slightly convex apical angles, and rounded basal angles. The cell wall is punctate, containing one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The dimensions of the cell are approximately 26.2 µm in length, 18.8 µm in width, and with an index of about 5.0 µm.
During this survey, only a single specimen of Cosmarium ocellatum was identified.
The current data was collected from a lentic system characterized by mesotrophic conditions and circumneutral pH levels.
The cell is 1.2-1.4 times longer than broad, with a moderate median constriction and a closed sinus near the isthmus that gradually opens towards the extremity. The semicells are semicircular, with a rounded to slightly truncate apex and rounded basal angles. The cell wall is punctate, with two chloroplasts per semicell, and no pyrenoid is observed. The dimensions are as follows: length ranging from 86-130 µm, width from 65-94 µm, and isthmus width from 31-39 µm.
This particular variety is distinguished by its thinner cell wall, a more open sinus, and relatively broader cells (Krieger & Gerloff, 1962). The specimens in the population under current study exhibit a wider range of length-to-width ratios, in contrast to the findings of Krieger & Gerloff (1962) who reported that the length of the present variety is approximately 1.25 times longer than its width.
The current study collected data from both lentic and lotic systems, encompassing a range of oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions with varying alkalinity levels.
The cell is approximately 1.1-1.3 times broader than long, with a deep median constriction and a closed sinus near the isthmus that gradually opens towards the extremity. The semicells are hexagonal in shape, with a truncate apex and acute apical angles. The cell wall is smooth, with one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. Papillae are located in the mid region of the semicells, appearing diamond-shaped in apical view, while not observable in lateral view. The dimensions are as follows: length ranging from 8-9.2 µm, width from 10-11 µm, and isthmus width from 3.2-3.5 µm.
The present variety, as noted by Messikommer in 1942, deviates from the typical variety by being broader than long and having half its size. The material under current study also diverges from the standard type due to its slightly larger dimensions, with a length ranging from 8 to 8.7 µm, a width between 9.3 and 9.8 µm, and an index of 3 µm.
The current study gathered samples from Areão Lake, characterized by mesotrophic conditions and a pH range that is circumneutral to alkaline.
The cell is approximately 1.3-1.4 times longer than it is broad, with a shallow median constriction and a wide-open sinus. The semicells are semicircular in shape, with rounded apices and angles. The cell wall is densely punctate, with a smooth isthmus area. There are four chloroplasts and four pyrenoids per semicell. In the apical view, the cell appears circular, while in the lateral view, it is the same as the front view. The dimensions of the cell are as follows: length ranging from 30-63 µm, width from 23-47 µm, and isthmus area from 21-44 µm.
Cosmarium pseudoconnatum closely resembles Cosmarium connatum Brébisson ex Ralfs, with the main distinguishing feature being the presence of four chloroplasts in each semicell in the former, as opposed to two in the latter. As noted by Scott & Grönblad (1957), the cell walls of both species exhibit identical characteristics, being scrobiculate with clearly visible pores interspersed between the scrobicules.
The current material was found in both lentic and lotic systems, thriving in a range of conditions from oligotrophic to eutrophic and acidic to alkaline. Delazari-Barroso et al. (2007) had previously documented its presence in the phytoplankton of a small water supply reservoir in Espírito Santo State.
The cell is approximately 1.6 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. The semicells are pyramidal in shape, with a rounded apex and broadly rounded apical and basal angles. The cell wall is punctate, containing one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The dimensions of the cell are as follows: length approximately 36 µm, width approximately 22.5 µm, and the median constriction depth is around 8.2 µm.
According to Coesel and Meesters (2007), Cosmarium pseudopyramidatum bears morphological similarities to Cosmarium pyramidatum Brébisson ex Ralfs, yet distinguishes itself by possessing a solitary pyrenoid per semicell and reaching lengths of up to 60 µm. Only a solitary specimen of this species was obtained during the current survey.
The current data was collected in a lentic environment, specifically Limão Lake, characterized by oligotrophic and alkaline conditions.
The cell is approximately 1.2-1.3 times longer than it is broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. The semicells are hexagonal in shape with rounded angles, and the apex ranges from truncate to retuse. The cell wall is smooth, containing one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The dimensions of the cell are as follows: length ranging from 16.5 to 22 µm, width ranging from 14.8 to 17.3 µm, and the intercalary distance measuring between 3.7 and 4.8 µm.
The current variety of Cosmarium rectangulare var. hexagonum deviates from the norm by featuring relatively shorter cells, with a length approximately equal to their width as noted by West & West (1908). Within the scope of this study, two distinct phenotypic variations of this species were identified. Certain specimens exhibited a reduced length-to-width ratio and a retuse apex, resembling the type depicted in the work of West & West (1908). Conversely, a solitary specimen stood out for its elongated form, surpassing the others in length, and possessing an exceptionally wide and truncate apex.
The current study collected data from both lentic and lotic environments, characterized by oligotrophic and alkaline conditions.
The cell is 1.2-1.3 times longer than broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. The semicell is trapezoidal with a truncate apex and rounded basal angles, while the cell wall is smooth with one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The dimensions are as follows: length ranging from 17.8 to 28.1 µm, width from 13.2 to 21.1 µm, and the index from 7.6 to 5 µm.
According to Bicudo et al. (2019), Cosmarium trilobulatum var. abscissum distinguishes itself from the standard variety through its wider lateral lobes and a broad apical lobe, characteristics that align with the specimens currently under examination. While this variety bears resemblance to Cosmarium pseudoretusum F. Ducellier, it can be differentiated by its less pronounced apex.
The materials utilized in this study were exclusively sourced from lentic environments, thriving in conditions ranging from ultraoligotrophic to supertrophic and characterized by alkaline pH levels.
The cell is 1.2-1.3 times longer than broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. The semicells are trapezoidal in shape, with a truncate apex that is thickened, and rounded to slightly truncate angles. The cell wall is smooth, with one chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. The dimensions are as follows: length ranging from 26.3 to 28.7 µm, width from 20.3 to 22.9 µm, and the constriction depth from 6.7 to 7.3 µm.
This variant deviates from the typical characteristics of the species due to its larger dimensions, the inflated region noticeable in the apical view, and the slightly truncated angles as noted by Krieger and Gerloff in 1962. The specimens currently under examination are slightly smaller in size compared to those described in the original study by Krieger and Gerloff in 1962.
The current material was found in both flowing and stagnant water environments, ranging from low nutrient levels to very high nutrient levels, and with pH levels varying from neutral to alkaline. This marks the initial documentation of Cosmarium trilobulatum var. tumidum in Brazil.
Cosmarium abbreviatum var. minus was the sole species found across all environments under study, including lakes, lagoons, and rivers. The majority of species were observed in standing water bodies, with only seven species in flowing water systems, and Cosmarium impressulum displaying a clear preference for the latter habitat type. The most commonly encountered species was Cosmarium granatum var. granatum, closely followed by C. abbreviatum var. minus. Limão lake and Monsarás lagoon exhibited the highest diversity, hosting 14 and 12 out of the 22 identified species, respectively. Contrary to the prevailing notion that Cosmarium species predominantly inhabit clean and acidic waters, only four taxa were found in acidic conditions, with the majority thriving in circumneutral to alkaline environments. The species displayed a broad range in terms of trophic state, with 10 species occurring in mesotrophic conditions and 12 in eutrophic conditions. Total iron concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 7.1 mg L-1 in the studied systems, with detailed values provided in Zorzal-Almeida et al. (2021). The majority of species were found in conditions below 4.5 mg L-1, with nearly half below 1.5 mg L-1. Two species, Cosmarium norimbergense var. depressum (5.7 mg L-1) and Cosmarium granatum var. granatum (7.1 mg L-1), were notable for occurring in high iron levels compared to others. This study contributes valuable ecological and taxonomic insights into the genus Cosmarium Corda, particularly in tropical freshwater environments, emphasizing the necessity for further floristic investigations in Brazil, particularly in overlooked regions like Espírito Santo State.
