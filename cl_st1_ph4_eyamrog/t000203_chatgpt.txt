The global health and economic challenges brought about by the new coronavirus pandemic have spurred a race to develop effective therapies for disease control, underscoring the critical need for a comprehensive understanding of its pathophysiology. The BCG (bacillus Calmette–Guérin) vaccine, known for its ability to activate and modulate innate immunity, presents a promising avenue for investigation into its potential protective effects against the new coronavirus.
Objective: This study aims to analyze and compare the incidence, mortality, and lethality rates of COVID-19 among the most heavily impacted countries by the pandemic, based on their respective Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination programs.
Methods: The second phase of data collection for this study involved extracting information from official sources regarding the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported between April 11 and May 11, 2020. Subsequently, the incidence, mortality, and lethality rates were computed and compared across pre-defined groups based on their respective BCG vaccination programs. Additionally, an analysis of the acceleration rates between these groups during the specified period was conducted to further investigate potential correlations.
Results: Consistent with the findings from the initial phase in April, countries lacking an active BCG vaccine program exhibited significantly higher ratios in the incidence, mortality, and lethality rates, averaging 3.96, 9.34, and 2.35 (p < 0.001), respectively.
In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest a protective association between the implementation of active BCG vaccination programs and the incidence of cases and mortality rates per capita in the countries examined. These results indicate a potential cross-protective effect of innate immunity against the novel coronavirus.
The initial insights gleaned from epidemiological data on COVID-19 highlight that the elderly population with systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) and diabetes mellitus (DM) constitute the primary at-risk groups for adverse outcomes. Additionally, reports detailing severe cases among young individuals, adolescents, and adults without underlying health conditions serve to underscore alternative hypotheses.
The progression of the pandemic has unfolded from East to West, prompting the need for a thorough examination of the varying mortality and lethality rates in border regions.
The response of innate immunity, comprising macrophages, lymphocytes (CD4+), and natural killers, is crucial in eliminating the virus. The varying impacts observed in border countries and among individuals with similar exposures likely stem from how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, comprehending the quality of individual or collective innate responses becomes paramount. In an effort to investigate this, the authors sought to correlate the epidemic impact of various countries over three consecutive months with their BCG vaccine status. BCG, known for activating or training innate immunity, may hold the key to understanding these diverse outcomes.
Countries that maintain ongoing and widespread BCG vaccination programs are likely to experience lower rates of COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and lethality when compared to nations that have either discontinued or never implemented such vaccination initiatives.
Surveys were conducted to track the case numbers and fatalities attributed to COVID-19 from December 31, 2019, to April 11, 2020, and from April 11 to May 11, 2020. The countries included in this study mirrored those identified in a previous report from April 2020, but were now categorized into eight distinct groups based on specific characteristics outlined below for comparative analysis.
Group 1.1 comprises the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom, selected based on their geographical proximity and distinct vaccine landscapes compared to those in group 1.2.
Group 1.2 comprises Mexico, Portugal, and Ireland, selected based on their geographical proximity and distinct vaccine distribution scenarios compared to Group 1.1.
Group 2.1 comprises countries such as the United States, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Iran, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. These nations either have vaccination programs targeting specific groups exclusively or have altogether discontinued their vaccination initiatives.
Group 2.2 comprises countries that have established BCG vaccination programs, including Mexico, Ireland, Portugal, Chile, Hungary, Poland, Turkey, South Korea, Japan, Russia, Israel, Brazil, and Austria.
Group 3.1 comprises the United States, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Iran, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. This grouping is identical to group 2.1 and is reiterated here for the purpose of comparison with the countries listed in group 3.2.
Group 3.2 comprises Mexico, Ireland, Portugal, Chile, Hungary, Poland, Turkey, South Korea, Japan, Russia, Israel, Brazil, Austria, India, and China. These countries are an extension of those in group 2.2, with the addition of China and India.
Group 4.1 comprises the United States, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands, which are countries from group 2.1 that have never implemented universal vaccination programs.
Group 4.2 comprises France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Iran, and Switzerland. These countries were initially part of group 2.1, which had implemented vaccination programs. However, they have since ceased these programs.
In detailing the profile of each group, the study presented measures including incidence (Eq. 1), mortality (Eq. 2), and lethality rates (Eq. 3). Confidence intervals for each rate were calculated using the confidence interval method for proportions.
The incidence ratio, calculated by dividing the incidence rates of the compared groups, was presented for the comparison of the interest groups, along with the mortality and lethality ratios. In order to test the null hypothesis that the rates are equal between the groups of interest, the Z-test was employed to compare proportions.
In examining the acceleration/inhabitant variable, descriptive measures including the mean, standard deviation, median (q50), and quartiles (q25 and q75) were utilized. To compare the groups at this stage, the Mann-Whitney test was employed for assessing differences between independent groups.
The analyses were conducted using R software version 3.6.3, with a significance level set at 5%.
The incidence, mortality, and lethality rates for each group were calculated and are displayed in Table 1. To aid in result interpretation, incidence and mortality figures are depicted per 100,000 inhabitants, while lethality figures are presented per 100 cases.
Among the countries examined, those lacking a vaccination program exhibited the highest incidence and mortality rates (group 1.1) as well as the highest lethality (group 4.2). Conversely, nations with established vaccination programs demonstrated lower incidence, mortality, and lethality rates.
Table 2 displays the incidence, mortality, and lethality ratios for the groups being compared, along with the p-value derived from the hypothesis test for comparing two proportions. This outcome suggests that there exists a distinction among all pairs of groups that were examined.
The primary comparisons between countries in groups 2.1 and 2.2 or 3.1 and 3.2 lend support to the central hypothesis of this study, revealing elevated incidence, mortality, and lethality ratios in nations lacking vaccination programs. For instance, when examining groups 1.1 and 1.2 (as shown in Table 3), the incidence ratio highlights a 6.762-fold increase in group 1.1 compared to group 1.2. Similarly, mortality and lethality rates are 7.354 and 1.088 times higher in group 1.1 than in group 1.2, respectively. Notably, no discernible differences were observed in terms of acceleration/inhabitants within this comparison.
Tables 3, 4, and 5 depict the descriptive statistics for acceleration per inhabitants within the interest groups, alongside the outcomes of the interest groups comparison test. Specifically, Table 4 delineates the findings from the comparison between groups 2.1 and 2.2. Notably, a statistically significant disparity is evident in the accelerations over the last 30 days for both cases (p = 0.008) and deaths (p = 0.001). Group 2.1 exhibits higher mean and median acceleration values compared to group 2.2. Conversely, when contrasting the acceleration up to April 11 in group 2.1 with that up to May 11 in group 2.2, no significant difference is observed in the acceleration of cases (p = 0.284). Nevertheless, a notable distinction emerges in the accelerations of deaths (p = 0.001), with group 2.1 displaying a higher acceleration rate.
Table 5 illustrates the outcomes of the comparison between groups 3.1 and 3.2. Analogous to the findings in Table 4, a discernible statistical distinction is evident in the accelerations within the last 30 days for both cases (p = 0.003) and deaths (p = 0.001), with the mean and median acceleration values being notably higher in group 3.1 compared to group 3.2. In terms of the comparisons between the acceleration up to April 11 in group 3.1 and the acceleration up to May 11 in group 3.2, a discrepancy was solely noted for the acceleration of deaths (p = 0.001), where the acceleration in group 3.1 surpasses that of group 3.2.
In a recently published study, researchers conducted an analysis on March 21, revealing consistent correlations between the significance of BCG vaccination and the rates of incidence and fatality associated with COVID-19. Despite the similarity in data sources, this study diverged by examining the initial acceleration rates of case numbers and fatalities up to April 11, followed by subsequent accelerations from April 11 to May 11, as depicted in Figures 1 and 2.
One major critique of the research conducted by this group in the initial phase was the suggestion that countries without active vaccination programs exhibited higher incidence, mortality, and lethality rates on April 11th due to being approximately ten days ahead of countries with active programs. To address this potential time bias, the second phase of the study compared current data from April 11 to May 11 for countries with active vaccination to data up to April 11 for countries without active vaccination. This adjustment aimed to reduce the time discrepancy to an average of 20 days, minimizing the previous bias. Tables 3, 4, and 5 now demonstrate that, despite the time advancement, countries in the active vaccination group still exhibit higher rates, challenging the notion of a temporal correlation and consistent severity of disease impact.
A randomized controlled study conducted in Israel revealed that there was no significant difference in the incidence rates among young individuals born three years prior to and three years following the interruption of their vaccination program. The authors caution against using these findings to evaluate the impact or severity of COVID-19. The study's conclusion simply reinforces the results obtained, as there were no variations in case accelerations in scenarios where mortality and lethality ratios were compared (refer to Table 2). This observation strengthens the notion that the BCG vaccine may not necessarily impede the transmission of the disease but likely offers protection against severe outcomes.
The updated analysis conducted in the May 2020 assessment compared non-BCG countries, including Belgium, the United States, the Netherlands, and Italy, which have never implemented vaccination programs, with those that have ceased their programs. The findings revealed a consistent pattern of increased cases and fatalities, as depicted in Table 3, albeit with a higher incidence and mortality rate, as illustrated in Table 2.
This study suggests that BCG vaccination coverage may have varying impacts across different countries, shedding light on unanswered questions such as its potential significance for older adults who are more likely to lose BCG immune memory. It also raises the possibility of different impacts in populations and regions with similar exposure and contamination levels. Furthermore, it underscores the potential for increased lethality in countries with better healthcare systems but without vaccination coverage. To gather more evidence, a double-blind, randomized trial utilizing the tuberculin test (PPD) as a parameter for vaccine memory could be considered for further investigation.
The primary bias of the initial paper, published in April by this research group, was mitigated through temporal adjustments accounting for the evolving nature of the pandemic. Despite these corrections, a statistically significant disparity favoring countries with active BCG vaccination coverage was still observed.
The lower incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in countries with established BCG vaccination programs is both intriguing and biologically plausible. Current data on the pandemic suggests a correlation between the extent of BCG vaccination coverage and the rates of cases and fatalities observed in these nations over a two-month period. Urgent encouragement for prospective, controlled studies is warranted to further investigate the potential of BCG as a primary preventive measure against severe cases until a dedicated vaccine is formulated.
