The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the revised version of the PreAcademic Battery (B-PREA-R) for Cuban preschoolers. The battery was administered to 300 children aged between four and six in Cienfuegos, Cuba. Item analysis indicated that out of the 199 items, 61 were deemed high quality, 132 were of good quality, and 6 were of moderate quality. Cronbach's alpha demonstrated satisfactory values at α= .85. Factor analysis unveiled three distinct factors. Factor 1, labeled "Executive Skills," encompassed subtests such as visual selective attention, matrices, story comprehension, graphomotor skills, and quantity counting. Factor 2, termed "Memory Skills," grouped the visual working memory subtest. Factor 3, denoted "Linguistic Skills," comprised the vocabulary, verbal working memory, and repeating syllables subtests. By utilizing quartiles for the different age groups (4, 5, and 6 years), insights into the development of executive, linguistic, and memory skills in preschoolers were gained. The B-PREA-R emerged as a convenient and efficient tool for educational settings, boasting adequate psychometric properties for assessing neurocognitive development during the preschool phase. It serves as a valuable resource for identifying a child's strengths and weaknesses, aiding in their readiness for formal schooling.
Cognitive development during early childhood lays the groundwork for a positive educational path in childhood and adolescence, leading to academic and professional success in adulthood (Doebel, 2020). In numerous low- and middle-income Latin American nations, over half of children exhibit cognitive proficiency delays upon entering primary education (Abufhele et al., 2021; Borrescio & Valenzuela, 2021; Vollman & Richland, 2020), rendering them ill-prepared for learning and often encountering additional challenges in school. Furthermore, there has been a rise in learning and behavioral disorders linked to disruptions in cognitive development during the initial years of life in recent decades (Albes et al., 2021). To bridge this gap at school entry, early identification of cognitive development issues is crucial for timely intervention to prevent the perpetuation of limited academic, socioeconomic, and social mobility opportunities. However, there is a scarcity of culturally validated assessment tools in Latin America. This research aims to address this gap within the Cuban cultural context, where ensuring adequate cognitive development in early childhood is a significant concern for educators and researchers.
In recent decades, Luria's cultural neuropsychology has gained significant traction in the evaluation and rehabilitation of preschool children, as evidenced by studies conducted by Solovieva & Quintanar (2021), Solovieva et al. (2019), Bonilla-Sánchez et al. (2019), and Cadavid-Ruiz et al. (2019). This approach, rooted in Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, is underpinned by two fundamental principles. Firstly, it posits that child development unfolds within a sociocultural milieu, shaped by interactions and learning experiences within specific social and cultural contexts. Secondly, it emphasizes the systemic nature of mental processes, rejecting the notion of isolating functions such as attention, language, and memory, in favor of viewing them as an interconnected system (Solovieva & Quintanar, 2021; Solovieva et al., 2019).
The sociocultural approach provides a significant theoretical framework for evaluating and enhancing the growth of preschool children within educational settings, complemented by cognitive neuropsychology in studying the brain-behavior relationships in developing children. A literature review reveals a trend among researchers to design and modify cognitive assessments for preschoolers using an integrated approach that combines the knowledge of cognitive neuropsychology with the principles of the sociocultural approach (Piedra et al., 2021).
From this perspective, several researchers have advocated for this integration (Flores et al., 2012; Manga & Ramos, 2006; Matute et al., 2007) and have put forth three essential requirements for the development of tests in the child population. Firstly, it is crucial to evaluate neuropsychological skills as an indicator of the maturation and functioning of specific brain structures in formation. Secondly, it is imperative to take into account the most suitable procedures for crafting the test and its items within a particular cultural context. For instance, the go-no go procedure has been extensively utilized in developing attention tests across various cultural settings. Lastly, the interpretation of results should be done through norms, which involve comparing the subject with a reference group, and/or criteria, which entail comparing the subject with an objective to be achieved.
Several authors have developed and validated instruments tailored for preschool children in low- and middle-income Latin American countries to meet specific requirements (Bornstein et al., 2015). In Argentina, the Childhood Executive Functioning Inventory (CHEXI) was formulated (Gutiérrez et al., 2021), while in Chile, the Test de Evaluación Neuropsicológica Infantil (TENI) was introduced (Tenorio et al., 2014). In Mexico, the Evaluación Neuropsicológica Infantil (ENI) and the Batería de Funciones Ejecutivas y Lóbulos Frontal (BANFE) were developed (Matute et al., 2007; Flores et al., 2012). In Cuba, Ramírez et al. (2013) utilized the Luria Inicial neuropsychological battery for preschool children assessment, which demonstrated satisfactory validity and reliability. However, despite its strengths, this battery has limitations for educational application due to its lengthy and intricate administration process, making it challenging for educators to implement and assess children within classroom settings.
Ramirez et al. (2018) addressed a specific limitation by developing the PreAcademic Battery (B-PREA), designed to evaluate cognitive development in children aged 4 to 6 and to determine their readiness for formal schooling. Administering the B-PREA is relatively efficient, requiring only 20 to 25 minutes. The battery draws on two key theoretical frameworks: the insights from Luria's theory during the preschool years (Solovieva & Quintanar, 2013; Manga & Ramos, 2006) and the principles of cognitive neuropsychology in creating assessments for preschoolers (Tenorio et al., 2014; Portellano, 2000). Despite its theoretical foundations, the B-PREA remains a challenging assessment tool for preschool educators.
To address these limitations, enhancements were implemented to the B-PREA to enhance its appeal, brevity, and usability for educators in the preschool educational setting. Specifically, the revisions were guided by the methodological standards of early childhood education experts in Cuba (Gallo et al., 2018), leading to a restructuring of the B-PREA subtests to align with the requirements of the preschool curriculum. This restructuring aimed to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of children based on the educational and developmental dimensions outlined in the enhancement. Additionally, adherence to resolution 238/2014, which outlines the guidelines for the implementation of the Ministry of Education's school evaluation system in Cuba, enabled the integration of B-PREA subtests into the preschool-level evaluation framework. These subtests could be utilized either during the interim evaluation period (four months into the school year) or during the final evaluation phase (conducted at the conclusion of the academic year).
The revised B-PREA (B-PREA-R) for educators is essential in the Cuban educational setting, addressing various practical and theoretical considerations. Firstly, there is a scarcity of validation studies in Cuba for educational assessments targeting children aged three to six. Secondly, the existing Cuban tests are intricate and time-consuming, rendering them unsuitable for preschool educators. Lastly, there has been a rise in preschool children with developmental challenges across multiple provinces in Cuba, as highlighted by Ramírez & Bernal (2020) and Íñiguez et al. (2017).
In light of the alterations implemented in the B-PREA, alongside the imperative to incorporate assessments within the educational framework, this study aims to assess the validity and reliability of the B-PREA-R through item analysis, internal consistency, and factor analysis.
The research sample comprised 300 preschoolers aged between four and six years (equivalent to 46-82 months), with 100 children falling within the 46-58 months range (pre-kindergarten), another 100 within 60-70 months (kindergarten), and the remaining 100 between 72 and 82 months (first grade in Cuba). The sample consisted of both genders, with 54% boys and 46% girls, drawn from three educational institutions in Cienfuegos, Cuba. These institutions were selected due to their enrollment of over 150 children each and their diverse geographical locations within the province.
The children were grouped based on the tombola procedure, where groups were named (institution, number of children, age) and placed in three boxes functioning as tombolas (Group 1: children aged 46 and 58 months; Group 2: children aged 60 and 70 months; Group 3: children aged between 72 and 82 months). Two groups were then randomly selected by age through a lottery to form a sample of 100 or more children. The study, approved by the Ministry of Education of the province, aligns with the University of Cienfuegos, Faculty of Education's project "Stimulation of neurodevelopment in early childhood." Inclusion criteria for participants included children aged between 46 and 82 months, displaying typical development for their age, and belonging to a medium socioeconomic level (families where both parents earn salaries ranging from 2100 to 4000 Cuban pesos). Ethical documents, including parental consent and children's agreement, were obtained for research purposes. The sample's characteristics are detailed in Table 1.
The study conducted in three selected educational institutions within the Municipality of Cienfuegos was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Education at the University of Cienfuegos, as well as by the Ministry of Education in the province. Additionally, informed consent was diligently obtained from both the parents and the 300 children involved in the study.
The data for the final evaluation of the educational process were gathered between June and July 2019 across nine groups of children, with each group being assessed by their respective educator (all nine educators were female). To prepare for this evaluation, the educators underwent training at the onset of the school year, spanning from September to October 2018, which involved methodological workshops comprising two 45-minute sessions per week over a month. The educators excelled in their training, mastering the application of the assessment tool and its integration into the educational process to guide the child's education and development. Subsequently, armed with this knowledge, the educators individually evaluated the children at the school year's end, conducting two sessions lasting between 10 to 15 minutes each. These evaluations typically took place in the morning, following the standardized protocol of the B-PREA-R.
The Pre-Academic Battery for Educators (B-PREA-R) was utilized in this study. This assessment tool is based on the Pre-Academic Battery originally developed in Cuba to evaluate the cognitive development of preschool children within a Cuban context (Ramírez et al, 2018). The B-PREA-R comprises nine subtests containing a total of 199 items that measure various cognitive abilities including attention, language, working memory, numerical cognitive processing, motor skills, and thinking. These subtests enable the assessment of a child's cognitive development through activities typical of the preschool stage, such as drawing, listening to stories, and role-playing. These activities align with the skills and knowledge required for each dimension of education and development as outlined in the methodological guidelines for enhancing early childhood education in Cuba (Gallo, et al., 2018), as illustrated in Table 2.
Content validity was assessed through an item analysis of the B-PREA-R, focusing on the discrimination index (item-total correlation) and item difficulty index. Following Ebel & Frisbie's criteria (cited in Backhoff et al., 2000), items were categorized based on their discrimination index values: items with values ≥.39 were deemed of high quality, those between .30 and .39 were considered good, values between .20 and .29 indicated fair quality, and items with values < .20 were classified as low quality. The difficulty index, as per Crocker and Algina (1986), categorized items as low difficulty (.80), medium difficulty (between .79 and .50), and high difficulty (<.50).
Internal structure validity was assessed through an exploratory factor analysis aimed at identifying the requisite number and composition of components needed to effectively summarize the observed scores of the B-PREA-R. In conducting this analysis, the theoretical assumptions proposed by Lloret-Segura et al. (2014) were considered, including the normality of the data, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test (KMO), and the benefits associated with various extraction and rotation methods.
Reliability was assessed using internal consistency measures, specifically Cronbach's alpha and item analysis (alpha if the item is removed).
The cut-off point was determined by obtaining percentile values, including quartiles, using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). A score of 20.0 was used on the nine subtests of the B-PREA-R to differentiate between children with low and high abilities based on their age.
The item-total correlation analysis revealed satisfactory values, with 61 items demonstrating high quality (30%), 132 items exhibiting good quality (66%), and 6 items displaying fair quality (4%) out of a total of 199 items (Table 3). The difficulty index indicated a well-distributed range of item difficulties, with 98 items falling into the category of neither easy nor difficult (49%), 54 items classified as easy to perform (28%), and 47 items deemed difficult for children to perform (23%) out of the total 199 items (Table 3).
The multivariate normality distribution was assessed by estimating the skewness and kurtosis indices. The normality assumption is deemed met when the indices fall within the range of ± 1.5 (Cuadras, 2016) (Table 4). Furthermore, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test yielded a value of .81, indicating that the data is suitable for factor analysis.
The study employed factor analysis utilizing the maximum likelihood method with quartimax rotation. However, the analysis revealed three factors accounting for only 47.61% of the common variance. This finding falls short of meeting Cuadras' (2016) assumption, which suggests that the adequacy of factor analysis should explain a common variance greater than or equal to 60%.
Following the obtained results, it was determined to utilize the principal component method with quartimax rotation, revealing that the nine subtests can be categorized into three factors, collectively accounting for 62.74% of the total variance of the test (refer to Table 5). Factor 1, denoted as "Executive Skills," comprises the sub-tests visual selective attention, matrices, story comprehension, graphomotor skills, and counting quantities, explaining 34.69% of the variance of B-PREA-R. Factor 2, labeled as "Memory Skills," clusters the visual working memory sub-test, elucidating 15.30% of the variance. Lastly, factor 3, termed "Linguistic Skills," encompasses the vocabulary, verbal working memory, and repeating syllables subtests, elucidating 12.74% of the variance.
The final instrument demonstrated strong internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .85. Furthermore, upon removal of individual items, the alpha values ranged from .83 to .86, suggesting that the overall reliability of the instrument remained consistently high even when specific items were excluded.
Cut-off points were determined for the nine subtests across the three age groups, as illustrated in Table 6. Quartiles were utilized for this identification process.
The current study investigated the content validity, internal structure validity, and internal consistency reliability of the B-PREA-R, an assessment tool tailored to evaluate the cognitive development of preschool children within the Cuban cultural context and intended for use by educators. Notably, the content validity of the B-PREA-R demonstrated enhancements compared to its predecessor (Ramirez, et al., 2018). Initially comprising 110 items, the original B-PREA exhibited 28% of items with low discrimination. Following revisions, the B-PREA-R now features nine subtests, totaling 199 items, with 193 items deemed of high and good quality, and six items classified as regular quality. Recommendations from the previous version to enhance the performance of specific subtests, such as vocabulary, syllable rhymes, matrices, and comparing quantities, were addressed in the B-PREA-R. Improvements included the matrices subtest, now comprising 15 items of good discrimination, the counting quantities subtest with all items of good quality, the elimination of the syllable rhyming subtest, the introduction of a syllable repeating subtest with 16 items of good quality and four of fair quality, and enhancements to the vocabulary subtest, featuring 18 items of good quality and two items of fair quality.
In the revised version of the research article, the subtest that exhibited a ceiling effect due to its ease for children, which compared quantities, has been removed and substituted with the subtest focusing on counting quantities. This new subtest incorporates two crucial skills essential for a child's academic development in the initial three years of schooling: enumeration and quantity comparison (Canto-López et al., 2019).
The internal structure validity of both the previous and revised versions of the B-PREA remains sound. In the previous version, factor analysis revealed three factors: Numerical Cognitive Processing Skills, Executive Skills, and Linguistic Skills. The revised version also confirmed three factors: Executive Skills, Memory Skills, and Linguistic Skills. Factor 1, "Executive Skills," encompassed five subtests (visual selective attention, matrices, story comprehension, graphomotor skills, and counting quantities) that reflect various skills and actions at the stage. These findings align with theoretical models of executive functions as proposed by Doebel (2020) and Zelazo (2020).
Doebel (2020) builds upon Miyake et al.'s (2000) analysis by delineating three fundamental cognitive functions within executive functions: inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, which serve as the foundation for higher executive functions like planning and problem-solving (Zelazo, 2020). Among these functions, the visual selective attention subtest appears to be the least ambiguous. However, the matrices, story comprehension, graphomotor skills, and counting quantities subtests share a common thread of requiring planning and problem-solving abilities, which in turn encompass cognitive flexibility and working memory.
These elements become apparent upon a detailed analysis of each subtest. In the matrices subtest, the child is tasked with identifying, from four possible solutions, the one that completes the abstract figure, thereby necessitating the use of higher cognitive abilities that also require executive functions. Within this subtest, the child must engage in size perception, spatial orientation in one or multiple directions, holistic and part-based figure analysis, generation of correlated figures, and deduction of relationships (Gizzonio et al., 2021).
In the realm of story comprehension, akin to subtest 3 "story recall" within the Woodcock-Muñoz Battery III achievement test (Muñoz-Sandoval et al., 2005), children are tasked with attentively listening to an adult's narrative to grasp the explicit message conveyed (identifying characters, understanding relationships, and comprehending the storyline) and subsequently responding to six literal questions per story. This particular subtest exhibits a notable correlation with oral language development, with the Woodcock-Muñoz Battery III categorizing "story recall" under the comprehension-knowledge factor. Notably, successful completion of the story comprehension subtest necessitates high levels of focused attention and working memory to effectively retain, manipulate, and process the pertinent story details. It is crucial to emphasize that this subtest lacks visual aids, underscoring the importance of active listening and retention of narrative details by the child. Consequently, the latent variables underpinning the story comprehension subtest lean more towards executive functions rather than linguistic abilities; however, it is worth noting that future research may yield different results based on sample size considerations.
In the graphomotor subtest, akin to subtest 6 "visuoperception" in the Child Neuropsychological Maturity Questionnaire (CUMANIN) (Portellano et al., 2000), children are tasked with following a graphic model that necessitates the correct pencil grip with their guiding hand, executing continuous strokes, tracing the stroke line accurately, drawing within the designated space, striving for maximum similarity, and demonstrating proficient hand-eye-space coordination. Several validation studies have indicated that the visoperception subtest is a nonverbal assessment, well-suited for evaluating executive function development in preschool-aged children (Parra et al., 2016; Avila, 2012).
In the non-symbolic quantities subtest, akin to the quantitative concepts subtest Series A in the Woodcock-Muñoz Battery III achievement test (Muñoz-Sandoval et al., 2005), children are tasked with recognizing quantities ranging from 3 to 12 elements within a figure. Subsequently, they are required to locate the same quantity among four options, utilizing cognitive processes like enumeration and comparison of quantities. These operations necessitate the child to uphold the objective of problem-solving, thereby engaging in a variety of numerical, verbal, and visual reasoning strategies (Spiegel et al., 2021).
On the contrary, the battery tends to cluster tasks that pertain to the child's language and memory development. Specifically, in terms of language development, three subtests were employed to evaluate the child's semantic and phonological abilities, including vocabulary, verbal working memory, and syllable repetition. Regarding memory, the battery categorizes a third factor known as working memory skills, where task characteristics allow for the identification of this factor among the other subtests of the B-PREA-R.
The visual working memory subtest of the B-PREA-R was designed with features akin to the "Visual Memory Span" version of the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised. This task has consistently emerged as a distinct factor in various studies utilizing confirmatory or exploratory factor analysis (Fernandez et al., 2019; Zapata et al., 2019; Rosas et al., 2022; Marreros-Tananta & Guerrero-Alcedo, 2022).
The internal consistency of the B-PREA-R demonstrated satisfactory values for a psychometric test comprising multiple subtests, with alpha coefficients ranging from .83 to .86 and an overall alpha of .85. The earlier version also exhibited acceptable internal consistency (alpha ranging from .78 to .81), but displayed a wider range of internal consistency when assessed using the test-retest method, with values between .82 and .94. Therefore, it is advisable for future research to include an analysis of internal consistency using the test-retest method.
While this study makes a significant contribution to assessing cognitive development during the preschool years by providing nine subtests for educators to implement in their teaching practices and establish criteria for monitoring a child's progress, a notable limitation lies in its sample size relative to the national population. To enhance the study's robustness, future research should aim to expand the sample size across various provinces within the country. Additionally, incorporating statistical measures like the ROC curve could offer further insights, allowing for comparisons of cut-off points with populations of children having special educational needs or developmental challenges.
Future research should prioritize the refinement or removal of B-PREA-R items that consistently demonstrated discriminatory tendencies. Additionally, a crucial next step involves establishing percentiles or defining cut-off points within a nationally representative sample to create Cuban norms. This will facilitate broader application of the B-PREA-R in clinical and educational settings.
The B-PREA-R is a convenient and efficient assessment tool within educational settings, demonstrating satisfactory psychometric properties for evaluating cognitive development during the preschool years, identifying a child's strengths and weaknesses, and aiding in their cognitive readiness for basic schooling. The recent update of the battery has enhanced its validity and reliability, particularly in terms of item performance, with 96% of items exhibiting high or good quality and only 4% rated as fair. Additionally, the update has expanded the quantity and quality of subtests, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of the child and a more accurate assessment of their readiness for the upcoming school stage. These features make the B-PREA-R suitable for educators to utilize in educational settings, whether for interim or final evaluations, offering an alternative method to assess preschoolers in alignment with the guidelines outlined in resolution 238/2014, which govern the implementation of the school evaluation system in Cuba.
