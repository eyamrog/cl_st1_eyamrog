Abstract 
 
Many well-known commercial pharmaceuticals have been used in the therapy against 
SARS-CoV-2, although in a random and experimental way, since this use is only based 
on the knowledge about culture cells in vitro. But, it is widely known that it is not 
correlated with assays in vivo conducted with in animals or with clinical trials in humans. 
Knowledge about treatments applied to previous pandemic infections caused by viruses 
such as MERS and SARS may be the most interesting strategy used to screen products 
with potential to act against SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistic aspects of virus infections and 
antiviral action mechanisms were herein analyzed based on the assumption that these 
commercial pharmaceuticals can eliminate the virus. Perspectives about these procedures, 
as well as about finished clinical trials and the ones yet in progress, were also addressed 
in the current study.

Introduction 
 
The large number of clinical trials carried out to research likely therapies against 
COVID-19 emphasizes both the necessity and ability of the scientific community to 
generate high-quality proof, even during the Covid-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, 
treatments applied so far were not fully efficient (Sander et al., 2020). 
It is well-known that inflammatory caspases represent a key function in innate immunity, 
since they reproduce cytosolic signals and induce dual responses (Jorgensen and Miao, 
2015). Two important targets can be used to eliminate viruses, mainly SARS-CoV-2; the 
first one is pyroptosis, which is an important process triggered by caspase-1 - which 
activates and releases pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-18 (IL-18) and IL-
1β. In addition, caspase-11 or caspase-1 are capable of activating some type of lytic, 
programmed cell death. Pyroptosis acts by removing the reproduction site of intracellular 
pathogens, like bacteria or viruses, and it makes them susceptible to phagocytosis and to 
be destroyed by subsidiary phagocytes. However, in several cases, abnormal systemic 
activation of pyroptosis in vivo can lead to sepsis. Emphasizing the ability of 
inflammasome recognition of viral infections, several pathogens have improved its 
abilities to prevent or disrupt pyroptosis (Durán and Fávaro, 2020a). These observations 
are also found in many other diseases (Ma et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2020) such as cancer 
(Durán and Fávaro, 2020b) and cardiovascular diseases (Zeng et al., 2019). The other 
target lies on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) because SARS-CoV-2 is a strand 
RNA virus, whose propagation is based on multiple subunit reproduction or/and 
transcription complex of viral proteins (Ziebuhr, 2005).  
Although there are many other targets that can be used against SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., 
blocking the host target TMPRSS2 (ACE2 receptor), three of the most important ones 
(pyroptosis, RNA-dependent polymerase and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of viral 
proteins), which are associated with pharmaceuticals used nowadays, will be addressed 
in the current study. 
 
Pyroptosis 
 
Recently, Zhao and Zhao (2020) have investigated PRRs (pattern recognition 
receptors) such as LRR, PYD and NACHT domains. These PRRs present protein-3 
inflammasome, which is a complex consisted of the NOD-like receptor protein-3 - 
NLRP3 (NOD domain (nucleotide-binding oligomerization) NOD-like receptor NLRP3), 
which, in its turn, is the transcriber of apoptosis connected speck-like protein (ASC) and 
caspase-1. This kind of complex is crucial to hosts’ defense against microbes since it 
stimulates IL-1β and IL-18 release and triggers pyroptosis, as previously mentioned. 
NLRP3 is capable of recognizing a whole diversity of PAMPs (pathogen-connected 
molecular patterns) and DAMPs (danger-connected molecular patterns) generated 
through viral replication; this process activates the NLRP3 inflammasome which is really 
of antiviral immunological responses and makes viral eradication possible. 
Unfortunately, many viruses use very sophisticated strategies to prevent the immune 
system from attacking the NLRP3 inflammasome (Sollberger et al., 2014). Few viruses 
have been reported to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation to avoid innate immunity 
and enhance viral replication. The virus is capable of suppressing either the adjustment 
or the stimulation of NLRP3 inflammasome through a direct/indirect interaction.  
Influenza virus NS1, paramyxovirus V and measles virus inhibit NLRP3 
inflammasome induction and diminish IL-1β release. This interaction of viral protein and 
 
4 
NLRP3 avoid self-oligomerization and, at the same time, the enrolment of ASC, 
culminating in the blocks inflammasome activation (Zhao and Zhao, 2020).  
Yang et al. (2020) conducted a study focused on investigating the history and 
epidemiology of SARS and emphasized several points, such as pathogenesis, 
epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis and guidance of individuals infected with 
SARS-CoV-2. 
At the first coronavirus contamination stage, epithelial and dendritic cells are 
activated and present a cluster of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as 
interleukins (IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferons (IFN-α/β), 
C-C motif chemokines and IP-10, among others. All these pro-inflammatory factors are 
modulated by the immune system. Thereby, excessive generation of all these chemokines 
ad cytokines accelerates disease progress. Interleukin IL-10 is generated by T-helper-2 
(Th2) and has antiviral activity; however, SARS-CoV-2 infection is capable of 
significantly inhibiting it (Zhang et al., 2020a). 
Thus, patients contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 present raised serum IL-1β levels 
(Huang et al., 2020), which is a strong symptom of cell pyroptosis. This factor may 
indicate that cell pyroptosis induction is implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-
infected patients.  
It is well-known that both non-classical and classical pyroptosis indication can 
trigger IL-1β release, a fact that should be further investigated in SARS-CoV-2-associated 
pneumonia patients. Besides, both leucopenia and lymphopenia are observed in 
pneumonia patients, most SARS-CoV-2-contaminated patients show lymphopenia, that 
likely indicates that lymphocytes may be susceptible to cell pyroptosis throughout 
infection processes.  
Chen et al. (2020a) have found the same conduct in many patients with SARS-
CoV-2-associated pneumonia; nearly all patients who died presented lymphopenia 
(Durán and Favaro, 2020a; and references therein). Interestingly, Chang et al. (2020) 
reported that all assessed patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis have recovered 
and presented scarcely elevated contents of inflammatory markers like the number of 
lymphocytes; all these facts were confirmed by Lipi and Plebani (2020) and Henry et al 
(2020). Besides, based on current data, SARS-CoV-2 presumably immunomodulatory 
effects leads to cell pyroptosis, mainly in lymphocytes, due to NLRP3 inflammasome 
induction. Steps involved in the induction of the signaling linking NLRP3, IL-18, IL-1β, 
and gasdermin D were suggested (Yang, 2020; Yang et al., 2020a). 
A study review provided the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 contamination and 
described the SARS-CoV-2/immune system interaction, as well as the sequential aid of 
dysfunctional immune responses to infection progression. Based on the current 
knowledge about coronavirus infections, the authors of the aforementioned study have 
pointed out the participation of these strategies in potential therapies focused on attacking 
viral infection and/or immunomodulation (Tay et al., 2020). 
Many immunosuppressive therapies contributed at limiting immune-mediated 
damage in COVID-19 patients are at different evolution stages. Trials conducted with 
corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone) to treat COVID-19 are currently in progress, although 
this class of therapy was not suggested during the 2003 SARS epidemic. An assay at 
clinical trial level, focused on testing the effectiveness of tocilizumab, a IL-6 antagonist 
is also in progress; sarilumab is also under investigation. Many others clinical trials are 
studying the effects of targeting granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
(GM-CSF), incorporating the application of gimsilumab, lenzilumab and namilumab. 
Cytosorb is another complement therapy that operates by absorbing a wide spectrum of 
cytokines, PAMPs and DAMPs with the view to reduce their circulating levels and 
 
5 
improve immunopathology. Thalidomide is a pharmaceutics with immunomodulatory 
qualities; it has also been effectively administered to patient with COVID-19. Thus, two 
clinical trials have been recently implemented to test thalidomide potential to diminish 
lung injury. TNF (tumor necrosis factor) antagonism was indicated, although not tested, 
in SARS-CoV-contamination cases, but not in patients with COVID-19. An open-label, 
non-randomized study indicated that the combination of hydroxychloroquine (well-
known antimalarial agent) and azithromycin (common antibiotic) might be useful to 
patients with acute COVID-19. While hydroxychloroquine’s effect on direct virus 
suppression, as well as its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities are 
known, if these mechanisms play a role against COVID-19 remains unclear (Tay et al., 
2020, and references therein). A scarcity of clinical information with ribavirin for 
SARSCoV-2 means its therapeutic function must be inferred from other nCoV 
information (Sander et al., 2020). Nitazoxanide was effective as antiviral activity in vitro 
against MERS and SARS-CoV-2 (Rossignol, 2016; Wang et al., 2020a). Awaiting further 
evidence, immunodulatory effect and the antiviral activity and safety profile of 
nitazoxanide requires further investigating it as alternative treatment for SARS-CoV-2. 
Another pharmaceutical called ivermectin has also appeared in some studies. A phase-III 
clinical trial focused on investigating ivermectin effectiveness against dengue virus 
infection was conducted in Thailand; results have shown that this pharmaceutical was 
safe and reduced the serum levels of viral NS1 protein, although it did not show 
significant clinical benefit to the investigated patients (Yamasmith et al., 2018). 
It is known that extensive cytokine release due to immune system’s  reaction to 
viral contamination can lead to cytokine explosion and sepsis, which may lead to death 
in approximately 30% of severe COVID-19 cases. Uncontrolled inflammation condition 
lead to multiple organ injuries, which, in their turn, may lead to organ failure, mainly in 
hepatic, renal and cardiac functions. Patients contaminated with SARS-CoV who evolved 
to renal failure have died. Contrary, patients whose recruited cells healed the lung 
contamination, showed immunological response retreat and were healed. Meanwhile, 
dysfunctional immune reaction was observed in some cases due to cytokine explosion 
aimed at regulating extensive inflammation. Critical COVID-19 patients in need of 
rigorous hospital care presented exacerbated parameters such as significantly high G-CSF 
(granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) blood plasma levels, interleukins, such as IL-2, 7 
and 10, IP-10, MCP1 and MP1α (inflammatory protein 1α from macrophage) and NTF 
(tumor necrosis factor). The IL-6 cytokine levels in these cases were also high, which led 
to higher death than survival rates. Importantly, there was a wide macrophage content of 
inflammatory monocyte from FCN1+ in the Broncho-alveolar material extracted from 
individuals with serous, although not mild, COVID-19. Likewise, individuals at advanced 
disorder stage have shown significant incidence of inflammatory monocytes 
(CD14+CD16+) in their peripheral blood in comparison to patients with mild COVID-
19. These cellular systems release inflammatory cytokines and lead to cytokine explosion, 
incorporating MCP1, MIP1α, and IP-10 (Tay et al. 2020, and references therein). 
Some of the main covid-19 trials were carried out with the following compounds: 
Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, thalidomide, ivermectin, remdesivir and 
favipiravir (pro-drugs) and prednisolone/dexamethasone (Figure 1). 
 
 
 
 
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 
 
 
6 
Chloroquine is a potent NLRP3 inflammasome-pathway inhibitor. Therefore, it 
can suppress mature IL-1𝛽 and IL-18 production and enhance the survival rates of 
patients with endotoxic shock by suppressing NLPR3 inflammasome activation, as well 
as IL-1𝛽 and IL-18 maturation. In addition, the inhibitory process of chloroquine on 
NLRP3 inflammasome activation comprises the inhibition of NLRP3, IL-1𝛽, and IL-18 
transcription by restricting in NF-𝜅B and MAPK pathways, as well as the inhibition of 
NLRP3 complex assembly by restraining K+ efflux and ASC speck formation (see Figure 
2).  
These results indicate that chloroquine might be an auspicious therapy against 
LPS-induced endotoxin shock and other type of disease depending of NLRP3 
inflammasome-related diseases (Chen et al., 2017) 
Hydroxychloroquine has anti-inflammatory activity on Th17-related cytokines (IL-6, -
17, and -22) in healthy subjects, as well as in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) systemic and  
lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients (da Silva et al., 2013). According to Borba et al. 
(2020), high (600 mg x 2 day) and low (450 mg x 2 day) chloroquine doses delivered for 
10 days, in association with azithromycin and oseltamivir, were not safe enough to assure 
the continuation of the study group. Chloroquine did not show any apparent benefit to 
patients’ lethality rate. 
COVID-19 patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York, who was treated with 
hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, did not shown significant differences in in-
hospital mortality rate in comparison to patients who were not subjected to these 
treatments. But, the interpretation of these observations may have been restricted by the 
observational design (Rosenberg et al., 2020).  
Based on another study conducted with hospitalized patients with Covid-19, 
hydroxychloroquine treatment was not related to either significantly lower or higher risk 
of patient intubation or death. The main analysis did not find important association 
between hydroxychloroquine administration and patient intubation or death. Results in 
multiple sensitivity analyses were similar and it was necessary conducting randomized 
regulated trials with hydroxychloroquine in individuals with Covid-19 infection (Geleris 
etal., 2020).  
However, France, Belgium and Italy and recently USA have recently expressed 
their objection about administration of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 cases and 
banned its use. All of these countries were not the first to reject the use of this medicine. 
The 
World 
Health 
Organization 
(WHO) 
excluded 
the 
global 
trial 
with 
hydroxychloroquine a few days ago due to safety concerns. Similarly, Oxford University 
has 
paused 
a 
global 
trial 
a 
week 
after 
its 
implementation 
(https://www.wionews.com/world/covid-19-france-italy-and-belgium-ban-usage-of-
hydroxychloroquine-301449) (accessed on May 28th, 2020). Nowadays, confusing data 
about hospital treatment were reported including a retracted paper posteriorly by Lancet 
(Mehra et al., 2020) and reopened the controversy about chloroquine use. However, 
health professionals are aware that this pharmaceutical is not safe to be used in an 
indiscriminate manner.   
 
Nitazoxanide 
 
Since nitazoxanide uncouples mitochondrial electron transport, the current study 
took into consideration the chance that mitochondrial effects, apart from DNA leakage, 
might intervene the antiviral responses. The defeat of pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD 
(Selleckchem) in blocking nitazoxanide antiviral activities debates against pyroptosis or 
 
7 
apoptosis; both of them can be interceded by mitochondrial factors and are key elements 
of the nitazoxanide mechanism (Hickson et al., 2018). 
Besides to its antiviral activity (Antony et al., 2020), nitazoxanide suppress the 
generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-2, IL-4, I-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IL10 in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Mice subjected to oral administration of 
nitazoxanide in vivo have reduced plasma IL-6 levels by 90% in comparison to vehicle-
treated mice. The relevancy of all of the data to humans has not yet been investigated, 
however, these information indicate that nitazoxanide can enhance outcomes in patients 
infected with MERS-CoV by inhibiting the overproduction of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-6 (Rossignol et al., 2016). 
Clinical trials focused on investigating monotherapy with nitazoxanide are 
currently in progress (Clinical Trials. gov. Identifier NCT04348409-Aciduz-Brazil; 
NCT04343248-Romak Lab.-USA and NCT04359680-Romak Lab.-USA).  
 
Thalidomide 
 
Studies conducted in vitro or in vivo have shown that thalidomide damages the 
synthesis of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha). It raises peripheral blood CD8+ T cells, 
IL-12 levels, IFN-γ generation and cytotoxic activity. According to the study in vitro by 
Tabata et al. (2015), thalidomide was capable of decreasing IL-1β and IL-6 expression in 
human lung epithelial cells and helped preventing emphysema.  A study conducted with 
animals has shown that thalidomide notably mitigated pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative 
stress and inflammation in mice’s lungs. Similarly, thalidomide has decreased the 
production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and modifying growth factor-β.  Dogs with 
transplanted lung had better corticosteroids in early postoperative immunosuppression 
after the transplantation due to decreased incidence of pneumonia. Besides, it was 
published that thalidomide had anti-fibrotic effects against bleomycin-induced 
pulmonary fibrosis in rats. The anti-inflammatory activity of thalidomide on lung injury 
induced by H1N1 influenza virus in mice have shown that thalidomide significantly 
improved their survival rate, reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as 
cytokine (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α), and chemokine (chemokine ligand 5, C-X-C motif 
chemokine 10) levels, and inhibited p-NFκB p6 activation. A combination of thalidomide 
and low-dose glucocorticoid therapy against Covid-19 has shown beneficial results 
(Dastan et al., 2020; and references therein).  
Thalidomide has inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 secretion by human 
primary keratinocytes and monocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Beside, this 
pharmaceutical also diminished the liberation of pro-angiogenic growth factor FGF2 and 
of several other proteins. The secretion of all these proteins demands caspase-1 activity. 
Proteolytic enzyme itself is activated by multimeric innate immune complexes called 
inflammasomes. Then, thalidomide has inhibitory effects on NLRP3 inflammasome, 
since it blocks caspase-1activity (Keller et al., 2009; Thi and Hong, 2017). 
A positive-Covid-19 patient treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and, subsequently, 
with thalidomide, did not show any results. Laboratorial analyses showed a high increased 
C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and cytokine levels (interleukin IL-6, IL-10 and interferon 
(IFN)-γ),  as well as significantly decreased T cell absolute value (including CD4 + T 
cells, CD8 + T cells,  NK cells and B cells). Six days after thalidomide treatment 
implementation, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ cytokine levels returned to the normal range.  
Besides its ability to inhibit cytokine release and regulate immune functions, 
thalidomide can be used to relax COVID-19 patients for reducing their oxygen 
 
8 
consumption and alleviate digestive symptoms. Therefore, thalidomide may shed new 
light on an adjuvant treatment strategy focused on this potentially lethal viral disease. It 
is necessary conducting a randomized controlled trial focused on investigating the 
effectiveness of thalidomide use, in association with low-dose glucocorticoid therapy, to 
treat COVID-19 pneumonia (Chen et al., 2020). Actually, a clinical trial is already in 
course (Clinical trial.gov:NCT04273529-China). 
 
Methylprednisolone and Dexamethasone 
 
It is known that inhaled corticosteroids diminish the number of inflammatory cells 
(e.g., eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, mast and dendritic cells) at cellular level in any disease 
affecting individuals’ airways. Corticosteroid activity lies on suppressing the recruitment 
of inflammatory cells in patients’ airways by inhibiting the generation of chemotactic 
intermediates and adherence molecules and by suppressing the subsistence of 
inflammatory cells (e.g., T-lymphocytes, eosinophils, mast cells) in the airways. 
Epithelial cells are the major action site of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), since they are 
capable of inhibiting several activated inflammatory genes in airway epithelial cells and 
the epithelial unity is recovered by normal ICS (Figure 3). Mucosal inflammation is 
overall rapidly inhibited due to significant reduction in the number of perceptible 
eosinophils within six hours; such an inhibition is linked to reduced airway hyper 
responsiveness. The reversal of this stage may take months to reach a threshold that may 
indicate improved structural changes in airways (Barnes, 2010). 
Overall, corticosteroids dissipate through the cell membrane and link to 
glucocorticoid receptors (GRα) in the cytoplasm; next they translocate to the nucleus cell 
and trigger molecular effects. A GR homodimer is linked to a GRE (glucocorticoid 
response element) located in the promotor region of genes susceptible to steroids; this 
association is connected, or not, to gene transcription. Genes activated by corticosteroids 
comprise genes encoding anti-inflammatory proteins such as secretory leukoprotease 
inhibitor, β2-adrenergic receptors and the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-
1 (MKP-1), which suppresses MAP kinase routes. These outcomes may enable the anti-
inflammatory activity of corticosteroids. GR association with negative GREs may inhibit 
gene transcription; assumingly, this inhibition may play a key role in influencing many 
of the collateral effects caused by corticosteroids (Barnes, 2010). 
Systemic treatments with glucocorticoids were largely applied to patients infected 
with coronavirus (SARS-COV) who developed severe respiratory complications during 
the SARS epidemic in 2003. The administration of pulsed high-dose methylprednisolone 
enabled clinical enhancement in SARS patients. A female patient subjected to bone 
marrow transplant due to acute myeloid leukemia was infected with SARS; she was 
subjected to treatment with oral prednisolone and ribavirin, which improved her 
lymphopenia, modified transaminases, chest X-ray and computed tomography results 
very fast (Lam et al., 2004). Interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and Th1 
chemokine interferon-g-inducible protein-10 levels have decreased after 5-8 days of 
glucocorticoid therapy. Nevertheless, some data showed that pulsed doses of 
methylprednisolone presented high-risk factor associated with increased 30-day 
mortality. Besides, an observational study has shown that glucocorticoid treatment 
application in patients with MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
MERS-CoV) was associated to delay respiratory syndrome. However, the clinical 
therapeutics of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in patients with COVID-19 is not actually 
evident; thus, the systemic use of glucocorticoids, or not, in severe COVID-19 cases 
demands further investigation (Qin et al., 2020, and references therein). 
 
9 
However, a recent study has shown that glucocorticoids used in combination with 
antibiotics have significantly diminished the viral infection. In this case, patients with 
severe COVID-19 pneumonia presented significantly increased number of inflammatory 
markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6 and ferro protein (FER), which 
corresponded to the inflammatory reaction stage. Wang et al. (2020b) suggested that once 
the secondary infection happens in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, besides 
methylprednisolone doses, full-dose antibacterial drugs (e.g. cephalosporin) should be 
immediately added to the treatment. Data have shown that this treatment was related to 
faster decrease in CRP and IL-6. Thus, early low-dose and short-term administration of 
corticosteroids was associated in patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia with faster 
progress of clinical symptoms. In addition, methylprednisolone has been used in COVID-
19 patients, in association with antibiotics, oseltamivir and oxygen therapy (Huang et al., 
2020; Rosa and Santos, 2020). However, a recent study has shown that prednisolone was 
not capable of suppressing viral SARS-CoV-2 growth in infected VeroE6/TMPRSS2 
cells. Moreover, another corticosteroid called ciclesonide, which is an inactive prodrug 
and activated by esterase in the lung to the metabolite des-ciclesonide, was highly 
effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data strongly indicate that ciclesonide 
activity was specific to coronavirus; the authors of the aforementioned study have 
suggested that ciclesonide is a promising pharmaceutical to treat MERS or COVID-19 
patients (Matsuyama et al., 2020).  
Actually, clinical trials are already in course (Clinical trial.gov NCT04323592-
Italy; NCT04343729-Brazil. 
Recently, a clinical trial (randomized) has demonstrated that a low-price steroid 
named dexamethasone (low-dose) was able to prevent death in one over eight ventilated 
COVID-19 patients and one over of 25 patients receiving oxygen only. Over 11,500 
patients have been enrolled from over 175 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in 
the UK. (https://www.recoverytrial.net/files/recovery_dexamethasone_statement_ 
160620_v2final.pdf) (Clinical trial gov.: NCT04381936). This study showed that 
dexamethasone diminished deaths by one-third in ventilated patients and by one fifth in 
patients receiving only oxygen. The medical staff implied that based on these outcomes, 
one death could be avoided by treatment of about eight ventilated patients or near 25 
patients requiring oxygen alone.  
Actually, there are several clinical trials in recruiting phase (NCT04325061-
Spain; NCT04347980-France; NCT04395105-Argentina; NCT 04344730-Fance; 
NCT04327401-Brazil).  
 
RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase 
 
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is another possible target against 
SARS-CoV-2. It is so, because SARS-CoV-2 is certainly a strand RNA virus, whose 
reproduction is based on a multiple subunit replication or/and transcription complex of 
viral unstructured proteins (nsp) (Ziebuhr, 2005). The main element of this structure is a 
subunit of catalytic activity (nsp12) of an RNA, which is RNA polymerase-dependent 
(RdRp) (Ahn et al., 2012; Te Velthus et al., 2010). It was observed that nsp12 has 
insignificant activity and that its functions need supplementary factors such as nsp7 and 
nsp8 (Subissi et al., 2014; Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019), which lead to increased RdRp 
scaffold binding and treatability. Remdesivir is one of the best antiviral targeting RdRps 
(Wang et al., 2020c; Holshue et al., 2020; Warren et al., 2016); this pro-drug is 
transformed into an active product derivative (triphosphate) form (RTP) in cells (Siegel  
et al., 2017). All  structures related to RdRp were of  rigorous structural biological 
 
10 
achievements (Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019; Zhai et al., 2005; Peti et al., 2005; Johnson 
et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2020), make available the complete design of the RdRp complex 
(Yin et al., 2020). 
In order to understand the actual and in course antiviral activity against Covid-19 
it will be an analysis of the actual pharmaceutics using on this disease. 
 
Remdesivir 
 
Remdesivir was effective against SARS and MERS in murine models (Holshue et 
al., 2020). It is an RNA polymerase-dependent RNA antagonist that leads to early viral 
RNA termination (Sheahan et al., 2017); this prodrug must undergo metabolization to 
enable its active form of GS-441524-triphospahate. Remdesivir presented excellent 
outcome during the West African Ebola virus epidemic (2013–2016) and the Kivu Ebola 
epidemic (2018) (Warren et al., 2015), a fact that also made this drug tested against 
COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020b). 
Remdesivir (RDV) and IFN-β have higher antiviral activity than lopinavir (LPV) 
and ritonavir (RTV) in vitro. Both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir applications 
have improved the pulmonary function, as well as reduced lung viral loads and severe 
lung pathology in mice. On the other hand, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFN-β treatment has 
slightly reduced viral loads, although without affecting other disease parameters in the 
investigated model. Therapeutic LPV/RTV-IFN-β has enhanced the pulmonary function 
but it did not diminish virus replication or severe lung pathology in mice. This outcome 
provided evidence in vivo of remdesivir potential to treat MERS-CoV infections (Sheahan 
et a., 2020). 
SARS-CoV-2 replication needs viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 
which is a target of the antiviral drug called remdesivir. The cryo-EM structure of the 
SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was reported either in its apo-form or in the complex with 50-base 
template-primer RNA and remdesivir can be a good solution under these conditions. This 
complex structure shows that the partial double-stranded RNA template is introduced in 
the central channel of the RdRp, where remdesivir is covalently added to the primer strand 
at the first replicated base pair and terminates the chain elongation. This structure 
provides critical insights about the viral RNA replication mechanism and a rational model 
for drug design to treat viral infections (Yin et al., 2020). 
A clinical trial with double-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized of 
intravenous remdesivir was recently conducted with adult Covid-19 patients hospitalized 
with confirm of lower respiratory tract implication. All patients were randomly assigned 
to accept either remdesivir or placebo for up to 10 days.  The total of 1,063 patients 
underwent randomization (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04280705-USA). Data and safety 
monitoring board advised early unblinding the results based on analysis findings that 
showed shortened recovery time in the remdesivir group. Initial results of 1,059 patients 
(538 treated with remdesivir and 521 with placebo) based on data available after 
randomization have indicated that individuals who received remdesivir recorded median 
recovery time of 11 days, whereas those who received placebo recorded median recovery 
time of 15 days. Based on Kaplan Meier’s estimates for 14 days, remdesivir and placebo 
recorded 7.1% and 11.9% patient mortality, respectively. Severe adverse events were 
reported in the remdesivir (21.1%) and placebo (27.0%) groups subjected to 
randomization. Thus, remdesivir was more effective than placebo in shortening the 
recovery time in adult Covid-19 individuals hospitalized with evidence of lower 
respiratory tract involvement. However, given the high mortality rate observed despite 
remdesivir use, it is clear that treatments with antiviral drug alone are not likely to be 
 
11 
sufficient against Covid-19 (Wang et al., 2020; Beigel et al., 2020). A randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial conducted in China with 237 patients 
with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (ClinicalTrials.gov.: NCT04257656-
China) has observed faster clinical improvement; however, adverse events were also 
reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients and in 50 (64%) of 78 placebo 
recipients. Remdesivir treatment was interrupted early in 18 (12%) patients because of 
adverse events versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo treatment early. The 
authors of the aforementioned study inferred that remdesivir was not related to 
statistically significant clinical benefits. However, further studies should be conducted in 
order to confirm the shorter time necessary for individuals subjected to early remdesivir 
treatment to present clinical improvement (Wang et al., 2020c). 
Actually, clinical trials are already in course (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 
NCT04365725-France; NCT04280705-USA; NCT04302766-USA). 
 
Avifavir (Favipiravir) 
 
Favipiravir (Fig.1) has been authorized as therapy to treat influenza in Japan. But, 
only suggested for new influenza (strains causing acute disease) instead than seasonal 
influenza (Shiraki and Daikoku, 2020).  
The action´s mechanism is believe to be associated to the selective suppress of 
viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Jin et al., 2013). Baranovivh et al. (2013) 
suggested that favipiravir caused lethal RNA transversion mutations, causing a no-viable 
viral phenotype (Baranovich et al., 2013). Favipiravir is a pro-drug which is metabolized 
to its reactive form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP), usable in 
both intravenous and oral formulations (Guedj et al., 2028). HGPRT (human 
hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase) is presumed to play a crucial role in 
this activation activity. Interesting, that favipiravir acts as non-inhibitor of RNA or DNA 
synthesis in mammalian cells and is non-toxic to them. From 2014 is used in Japan, but, 
favipiravir has not been demonstrated to be efficient in primary human airway cells, 
causing doubt on its efficiency in influenza therapy (Yoon et al., 2018)  
In 2020, favipiravir was used as treatment in China in emergent COVID-19 (Li and De 
Clercq, 
2020) 
(https://www.fujifilmamericas.com.br/press/news/display_news? 
newsID=881796). 
A 
study 
on 
80 
patients 
comparing 
the 
use 
of 
lopinavir/ritonavir demonstrated that it diminished viral clearance period, and that 91% 
of patients had enhanced CT scans with almost no side effects. Unfortunately, this was 
not randomized double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial (Cai et al., 2020; Dong et al., 
2020). Recently, the favipiravir has been approved for use in clinical trials of coronavirus 
disease in 
China 
(https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/17/ 
WS5e49efc2a310128217277fa3.html).  
Italy, in March 2020,  Italy authorized favipiravir for research use against COVID-
19 and has initiated trials in three locals most involved in the contamination 
(https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2020/03/22/coronavirus-il-veneto-sperimental-
antivirale-giapponese-favipiravir-ma-laifa-ci-sono-scarse-evidenze-scientifiche-su-
efficacia/5745426/).  
There are in progress to initiate in three hospitals in Massachusetts, USA , trials 
with 
favipiravir 
(https://advances.massgeneral.org/research-and-
innovation/article.aspx?id= 1171). In a first week of May 2020, a trial is initiating in 
London, 
UK. (https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/uk-coronavirus-patients-trial-
japanese-covid19-drug-a4429731.html)  
 
12 
The favipiravir was also approved for the therapy of COVID-19 in the hospital 
installations in Russia on May 29, 2020, after taking place open-label randomized clinical 
trial had recruited 60 patients on. As claimed by the government clinical trial registry as 
COVID-FPR-01 is predicted to enroll 390 patients overall and end by December 31, 
2020. On May 30, 2020, the Russian Health Ministry authorized a generic form of 
favipiravir called Avifavir.  Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) supported the 
exploration of Avifavir and established it high efficiency in the first stage of clinical trials 
(https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/russian-health-ministry-approves-anti-coronavirus-drug-
avifavir-1.1443601); 
https://www.reuters.com/article/ 
us-health-coronavirus-russia-
cases/russia-plans-coronavirus-vaccine-clinical-trials-in-two-weeks-report-
idUSKBN2360BJ). 
Then, avifavir or favipiravir appears as a potential to treat Covid-19 in Russia and 
probably soon in England, Italy and USA.  
 
Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of viral proteins 
 
Ivermectin 
 
Protein signal-dependent targeting inside and outside the nucleus is regulated by 
components belonging to the importin (IMP) family of transport receptors, which are 
capable of identifying targeting signals in a load protein and of mediating transit over the 
complexes of nuclear pores in nuclear wrapping. This process is essential to activate cell 
division and differentiation; however, it is also crucial for viral reproduction and disease 
development. The phosphorylation process plays a key role in regulating viral protein 
nucleocytoplasmic 
trafficking 
and 
other 
post-translational 
transformations. 
Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking mechanisms are modulated by IMPs/EXPs (export 
members of the IMPβ superfamily) levels and distribution, as well as by the number 
and/or components of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). One of the most investigated 
nuclear transport modulation mechanisms refers to the phosphorylation process near the 
NLS/NES (nuclear localization signal/nuclear export signal) and to change identification 
through IMP/EXP; however, transformations such as esterification (e.g., acetylation, 
ubiquitinoylation, among others) have also been reported  to modulate the 
nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of cellular proteins (e.g., p53) and tumor suppressors 
(p110Rb), survivin, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10), nuclear 
factor NF-κB and MEMO (NF-κB essential modulator).  It is clear that viral proteins are 
often post-translationally transformed, and fully incorporate the action of cyclin-
dependent kinases(CDKs), which account for the cell cycle-dependent regulation of 
nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (Fulcher and Jans, 2011; and references therein). 
Ivermectin was the central point of a phase-III clinical trial conducted to 
investigate dengue virus (DENV) infection in Thailand in 2014–2017;  results have 
shown that a single oral dose a day was safe and significantly reduced serum viral NS1 
protein levels, although it did not lead to changes in viremia or presented clinical benefits 
(Yamasmith et al., 2018). 
A study has demonstrated that ivermectin was capable of dissociating the pre-
formed IMPα/β1 heterodimer, beside avoiding its generation by linking to the IMPα 
armadillo (ARM) repeat domain to enable IMPα thermal stability and α-helicity. 
Ivermectin has also inhibited a non-structured protein 5 deriving from dengue virus 
(NS5)-IMPα association in cell context (Yang et al., 2020).  
Caly et al. (2020) have shown that ivermectin had antiviral action against SARS-CoV-2 
clinical isolate in vitro; a single dose was capable of controlling viral replication within 
 
13 
24–48 h under that condition. It was hypothesized that it may have happened due to the 
inhibition of IMPα/β1-mediated nuclear import of viral proteins, as demonstrated in other 
RNA viruses. The confirmation of this mechanism in the case of SARS-CoV-2, and the 
identification of the specific SARS-CoV-2 and/or affected host constituent(s), is relevant 
topics to be investigated in future studies in this field (Figure 4). 
According to Patel et al. (2020), the application of 150 µg/kg of ivermectin to 
patients after mechanical ventilation application has potential to diminish hospitalization 
time and to improve survival rates in comparison to conventional treatments. 
Unfortunately, this report did not take into consideration comorbidities that could lead to 
these results. Thus, if ivermectin really provided these clinical findings, it would suggest 
that the study in vitro conducted by Caly et al. (2020) did not correlate to low amounts of 
the drug at the action site in humans. A clinical study with ivermectin must follow well-
controlled clinical dose-response at low dose (dose approved) and at dose higher than that 
of placebo in COVID-19 patients (Schmith et al, 2020). Ivermectin doses up to 120 mg 
have only been applied to a small number of patients (Guzzo et al., 2002). Daily 
ivermectin applications at the approved dose (200 µg/kg) for longer periods (e.g., 14 days) 
have only been investigated in case of severe infections where non-approved 
subcutaneous formulation was applied (Turner et al., 2005). Thus, if higher doses are 
applied on a weekly basis, or other administration method is adopted, patients should be 
closely monitored. Therefore, an interesting solution would lie on investigating whether 
ivermectin-inhaled therapy is realistic. Unfortunately, only one non-clinical research on 
inhaled ivermectin has been reported and presented NOAEL (no-observed-adverse-effect 
level) equal to 380 mg/m3 after 1 month of treatment  (Ji et al., 2016). The literature lacks 
studies focused on investigating this administration route in humans. Experts must 
evaluate whether ivermectin has the ideal properties for inhalation treatments and whether 
it does not present any risk that might limit this application route. Therefore, Schmith et 
al. (2020) suggested that the outcomes observed in the study by Caly et al. (2020) 
stablished the opportunity for an interdisciplinary collaboration to help better understand 
the best likelihood of achievement in ivermectin-based therapy, before the application of 
a less-than-ideal dose in clinical studies. 
Actually, clinical trials are already in Couse (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 
NCT04381884-Argentina; 
NCT04390022-Spain; 
NCT04392713-Pakistan; 
NCT04373824-India). 
 
Final remarks 
 
Based on data analyzed in the current study, it is clear that despite tremendous 
efforts to access a new and effective antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials 
conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic, an efficient antiviral drug has not yet been 
found. The problem observed in clinical trials carried out to research potential therapies 
against COVID-19 hampers both the requirement and ability to generate high-quality 
prove, even in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although there are different 
mechanisms capable of inhibiting or killing SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is possible believing 
that the scientific community will be able to find a successful pharmaceutical capable of 
finishing this pandemic.  Once we get to fully know the pathogenesis of Covid-19, we 
will be able to select a compound capable of presenting efficient results in vivo, rather 
than in vitro. This, it is due to the projection of the activity from culture cells is negligible 
to animal and then worse to human.   Thus, it is necessary developing a well-stablished 
protocol for clinical trials in order to find a new and safe antiviral drug.

It is important emphasizing that,  in march 2020, WHO made public plans to 
initiate a global “megatrial” named SOLIDARITY, based on a practice trial design, for 
to randomize attested cases into either basic care or 1 of 4 active therapy arms 
(chloroquines, lopinavir/ritonavir alone, or lopinavir/ ritonavir plus IFN-β) based on 
regional medicone availability (Kupferschmidt and Cohen, 2020). It was a really 
interesting proposal at that time; however, unfortunately, all priorities have changed from 
March to June 2020 and it is necessary re-evaluating all these possibilities.

Figure 4. Ivermectin is a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate 
Australia/VIC01/2020. Vero/hSLAM cells were in infected with SARS-CoV-2 clinical 
isolate Australia/VIC01/2020 (MOI = 0.1) for 2 h prior to addition of vehicle (DMSO) or 
Ivermectin at the indicated concentrations. Samples were taken at 0–3 days post infection 
for quantitation of viral load using real-time PCR of cell associated virus (A) or 
supernatant (B). IC50 values were determined in subsequent experiments at 48 h post 
infection using the indicated concentrations of Ivermectin (treated at 2 h post infection as 
per A/B). Triplicate real-time PCR analysis was performed on cell associated virus (C/E) 
or supernatant (D/F) using probes against either the SARS-CoV-2 E (C/D) or RdRp (E/F) 
genes. Results represent mean ± SD (n = 3). 3 parameter dose response curves were fitted 
using GraphPad prism to determine IC50 values (indicated). G. Schematic of ivermectin's 
proposed antiviral action on coronavirus. IMPα/β1 binds to the coronavirus cargo protein 
in the cytoplasm (top) and translocates it through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into 
the nucleus where the complex falls apart and the viral cargo can reduce the host cell's 
antiviral response, leading to enhanced infection. Ivermectin binds to and destabilises the 
Impα/β1 heterodimer thereby preventing Impα/β1 from binding to the viral protein 
(bottom) and preventing it from entering the nucleus. This likely results in reduced 
inhibition of the antiviral responses, leading to a normal, more efficient antiviral response 
(extracted from ref. Caly et al., 2020; authorized by Elsevier B.V.).
