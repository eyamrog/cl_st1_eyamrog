Prison health is inherently intertwined with public health. The COVID-19 pandemic presents a significant global threat, highlighting the importance of preventing disease escalation within prisons as part of the broader societal response to the novel coronavirus. Social isolation has emerged as the most effective known measure to contain the spread of the virus. However, in overcrowded penal institutions, implementing social isolation is challenging, often leading to overisolation among the incarcerated population and impacting their mental well-being. Prisoners also face issues such as cramped living conditions, inadequate personal hygiene supplies, substandard sanitary facilities, and limited access to healthcare services. To mitigate the spread of the virus, many countries have implemented measures like releasing prisoners temporarily or permanently and imposing restrictions on visitation. This paper presents a narrative review of the pandemic's impact on prisons and examines how governments and civil society have responded to minimize the disease's consequences in these settings. The discussion is structured into three sections: the first provides a literature review on the current health crisis, the second explores various countries' approaches to managing prisons during the pandemic, and the final section delves into the response of the Brazilian Penal System to the new health threat.
The emergence of the COVID-19 disease, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, originated in China and quickly escalated to a global scale, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. With the absence of specific treatments or vaccines to effectively manage the disease, the COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant public health risk on a global level, necessitating preventive measures like social distancing and enhanced hygiene protocols.
The potential for virus transmission is well-documented in indoor settings and crowded environments. Mizumoto and Chowell2 detailed the epidemiological progression on an Asian cruise ship, where the average reproduction number in the confined space peaked at nearly 11, surpassing estimates seen in community transmission dynamics in China and Singapore, which typically range from 1.1 to 7. Within a span of just 16 days, cases on the cruise ship surged from 1 to 454. Notably, the Spanish flu had a significantly higher prevalence among prisoners, affecting approximately a quarter of the incarcerated population, a stark contrast to the lower prevalence observed in the general population3.
Criminal institutions impose confinement authorized by a judicial body, often accompanied by stigma and vulnerability. The confinement experienced within a prison setting differs significantly from other forms of isolation, such as those found on cruises, in schools, or during quarantine, as the loss of freedom in prison is involuntary. Within the prison environment, the isolation measures lead to a unique situation where multiple layers of confinement overlap, a phenomenon referred to as overisolation.
Numerous prisons in Brazil and globally grapple with severe overcrowding issues, providing insufficient space in comparison to the recommended standards for adequate distancing. Alarmingly, 59% of countries report prison occupancy rates surpassing their designated capacities, heightening the risk of rapid transmission of the coronavirus within these correctional facilities. A stark example of this threat unfolded in China, where in a single day in February, 200 cases were recorded in one of its prisons, despite the overall infection curve in the country showing a decline.
Incarcerated individuals face a significant risk of contracting viral respiratory infections, posing a threat not only within prison populations but also potentially serving as a source of infection for the broader community. Prisons, akin to porous institutions, resemble the borders of countries in today's globalized world. The movement of individuals such as prison officers, staff, visitors, released and transferred prisoners can facilitate the transmission of viruses like the coronavirus beyond the confines of the prison walls, extending the reach of infection into local communities.
Prison health inherently intersects with public health and warrants recognition as such by governmental bodies and the scientific community. This narrative review delves into the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and incarcerated individuals, synthesizing existing literature from health journals to shed light on this critical issue. The primary objective is to underscore the imperative of upholding basic human rights for those in confinement while also prioritizing the overall health and well-being of the broader population.
To enhance readability and comprehension, this publication is structured into distinct sections: an overview of the current situation regarding COVID-19 and its impact on incarcerated individuals; an examination of global strategies for preventing the spread of the virus within prison settings; an analysis of the challenges faced by the Brazilian prison system in managing the novel coronavirus outbreak; and concluding remarks.
To conduct this narrative review, articles published in health journals up to April 25, 2020, were examined. Texts in English, Spanish, and Portuguese in various formats including editorials, comments, correspondence, opinions, and empirical studies were considered for inclusion in the analysis.
The search was conducted across two databases, PubMed and Google Scholar, with the search strategy outlined in Table 1. Initially yielding 605 results, a thorough screening process based on title and/or abstract narrowed down the selection to 13 articles for comprehensive review. While a formal quality assessment was not conducted, the analysis of methodological attributes played a crucial role in the narrative interpretation of the results presented in this study.
A search on PubMed yielded 3,710 articles related to "COVID-19", with a mere six publications (0.16%) focusing on the pandemic within the prison setting. Among the 13 articles reviewed, only one qualifies as an original study, as detailed in Table 2.
Social distancing proves challenging within correctional facilities due to the confined living conditions, overcrowding, and inadequate ventilation. Inmates share bathrooms, showers, and common areas like cafeterias, patios, and classrooms, further increasing the risk of transmission. Additionally, hand hygiene practices are hindered by limited access to soap, while restrictions on alcohol consumption in prisons may also impede efforts to maintain proper hygiene standards.
Populations subjected to incarceration exhibit a heightened susceptibility to infectious diseases, including HIV infections and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Disparities in social determinants of health impacting groups disproportionately affected by imprisonment - such as racial and sexual minorities, individuals with mental health conditions or substance use disorders, and those lacking access to healthcare or education - contribute to elevated disease burdens within incarcerated populations. In Brazil, the likelihood of a detained individual contracting tuberculosis is 30 times greater than that of the general populace. Infectious diseases are responsible for approximately 17.5% of fatalities within correctional facilities.
In addition to the aforementioned physical and social structural challenges, administrative obstacles also pose a significant concern, primarily stemming from the inadequate allocation or mishandling of financial resources. This issue can impede the access of potential COVID-19-infected inmates to essential healthcare services, particularly in situations requiring advanced medical support. It is imperative that the rights of all affected individuals are upheld, and that public health interventions are executed without any form of discrimination.
The revised publications underscore the critical importance of implementing measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within prison settings. It is crucial to recognize prisons as potential reservoirs that could fuel the resurgence of the epidemic if not effectively managed within these facilities. To address this, three key premises need to be met: delaying the introduction of the virus into correctional institutions as much as possible, promptly identifying and containing any circulating cases, and adequately preparing prisons to manage individuals who develop COVID-19.
In the context of COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics, the outbreak among inmates, in the absence of interventions, proves notably more severe compared to the general population, necessitating increased hospitalizations and resulting in higher fatality rates. Mathematical modeling indicates that the epidemic peak within correctional facilities occurs significantly earlier, approximately 63 days prior to the peak in the broader community. Research further suggests that delaying the incarceration of 90% of high-risk individuals could potentially reduce the mortality rate within prisons by 56.1%. Despite only a small fraction (1.5%) of the prison demographic being elderly in Brazil, the act of imprisonment itself contributes to a decline in individuals' health, rendering them more susceptible to infections and severe disease outcomes.
There is a consensus that an effective action to mitigate the evolution of the pandemic in correctional environments is the release, whether temporary or definitive, of prisoners. For instance, Iran has already released 70,000 individuals who were previously incarcerated. Two articles discussing the current situation of immigrants imprisoned in the United States advocate for the release of all individuals who do not pose a threat to local security and suggest a temporary halt to the policy of incarceration against illegal immigration that has been adopted in recent years. Yang and Thompson propose that sentences for individuals tried with misdemeanors could serve as alternatives to deprivation of liberty.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that individuals deemed at risk for COVID-19 within prison populations should be released if they do not pose a threat to society. This measure is supported by the assumption that halting the arrest of individuals for minor offenses, leading to an 83% decrease in overall arrests, could potentially result in a 71.8% reduction in infections among incarcerated individuals. Additionally, this strategy could also lead to a 2.4% decrease in infections among prison staff and a 12.1% decrease in infections within the broader community.
Public policies aimed at mitigating inequality should align with judicial decisions regarding the release of individuals from the prison system, particularly considering that many of these individuals lack family and social support networks. Failing to address this issue could inadvertently result in released individuals becoming carriers and transmitters of SARS-CoV-2 as they navigate challenges such as securing income, housing, or even ending up in street situations. Stephenson highlights initiatives in California and New York where the government is providing hotel accommodations for some released prisoners, underscoring the need for a coordinated, intersectoral approach involving public authorities, social assistance programs, NGOs, healthcare services, and the judiciary to ensure successful reintegration and support for individuals leaving incarceration.
If the sole focus is on decreasing the prison population, numerous essential tasks may be overlooked. Mitigation efforts within detention facilities should be augmented with regular screening and containment protocols. This entails screening all individuals entering the facility, such as new inmates, staff, visitors, and suppliers, and isolating those who test positive for potential exposure to the novel coronavirus.
Various recommendations are put forth in the updated bibliography. Yang and Thompson (11) propose enhancing health education for both inmates and prison staff, emphasizing the importance of training everyone to recognize COVID-19 symptoms and prevent its spread. Akiyama, Spaulding, and Rich (7) advocate for the suspension of visits from family and lawyers, along with minimizing transfers, while also suggesting the implementation of teleconferencing to mitigate emotional isolation. The government is advised to prioritize cleaning and disinfecting prison environments, as well as providing necessary toiletries and masks (12, 14).
In the revised publications, it was noted that measures should consider the psychological reactions of individuals deprived of liberty, which may differ from those observed in individuals practicing social distancing in the community due to the heightened sense of isolation in prison settings. It is crucial to take into account the unintended consequences of these mitigation policies.
The recent uprisings in Italian prisons have underscored the detrimental psychological effects of emergency measures designed to curb the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within correctional facilities. This highlights the increasing necessity for emotional and psychological assistance, as well as the transparent dissemination of information regarding the disease. It is crucial to ensure that individuals deprived of their freedom maintain ongoing communication with their families, enabling them to actively participate in efforts to mitigate the pandemic.
This review aims to demonstrate that despite the efforts made by individuals deprived of liberty during the current pandemic, the support provided remains inadequate and marginalizing. In 2018, the global population of individuals deprived of liberty exceeded 10 million, primarily residing in unsanitary conditions, lacking access to adequate healthcare services, and residing in overcrowded facilities. The prison populations in various countries, along with those reentering society post-incarceration, face social stigma, governmental neglect, and what philosopher Mbembe terms as necropolitics. This concept revolves around a State of Exception, granting authorities the power to determine who lives and who dies, stripping individuals of their political agency and, if not directly causing their demise, leaving them vulnerable to death.
Information regarding how various countries are addressing the pandemic within the prison setting was examined by reviewing and summarizing data from the Prison Insider initiative, established by the founder of the International Observatory of Prisons. This platform compiles current information on diverse prison-related topics globally, including a dedicated section on the novel coronavirus. It is important to acknowledge a constraint in this data, as not all countries or organizations disclose their data, and when they do, it may not be in real-time.
As of May 5, 2020, data from 145 countries was available, comprising a total of 23,019 records of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The United States led with over 17,000 incarcerated individuals affected. Conversely, numerous countries have raised concerns regarding the lack of transparency in data reporting. Activists, international organizations, and parliamentarians have faced challenges in monitoring the situation, with restrictions on access to prisons due to COVID-19 cited as a primary reason. Apprehensions have been raised about the potential exploitation of the pandemic by the Syrian regime to target prisoners, intensifying repression against them. Similarly, Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons have been identified as a high-risk group for contracting the virus.
One potentially effective strategy identified in the review of 145 countries was mass testing of confined individuals, a measure reported in only 5 of the countries. The most commonly implemented actions were the suspension or limitation of visitations and the release of prisoners. It is important to highlight that despite the significant number of prisoners being released, correctional facilities continue to struggle with overcrowding issues.
There have been reports of uprisings in various penal institutions globally, attributed to overcrowding, health concerns, and the suspension of visitations. For instance, Luxembourg witnessed a hunger strike, while Italy experienced rebellions in multiple regions. In Argentina, riots led to at least one fatality and several injuries. The unrest in prisons could be linked to the lack of health education provided to inmates, with only a few countries investing in this aspect during the pandemic. The World Health Organization emphasizes the significance of offering comprehensive health information and legal assurances to individuals in detention to alleviate their anxieties and those of their families.
While it is imperative to safeguard prisoners through effective public health measures, it is noteworthy that they are also engaging in the battle against SARS-CoV-2. Numerous nations have observed that incarcerated individuals are willingly involved in producing masks for distribution within healthcare facilities and the broader community. In Guatemala, a youthful inmate expressed during an interview while crafting masks, "If I was capable of causing harm to Guatemala previously, today I am determined to rectify my wrongdoings."
In Brazil, the health needs of individuals deprived of liberty fall under the jurisdiction of the State, as outlined in the Criminal Execution Law (LEP35). Additionally, efforts have been made to integrate the prison population into the Unified Health System (SUS). The National Policy for Integral Health Care of the Private Person of Liberty (PNAISP) was established in 2014 with the aim of guaranteeing comprehensive healthcare for individuals deprived of liberty across all levels of complexity. This policy focuses on enhancing and structuring the financing of prison health teams, as well as implementing key health interventions for incarcerated individuals.
A significant challenge faced by prison systems globally is the COVID-19 pandemic, which underscores the importance of preventive measures such as individual hygiene, maintaining ventilated environments, and implementing social isolation to curb transmission. This crisis has particularly highlighted the vulnerability of prisons in Brazil, prompting prison managers to ensure the efficacy of measures outlined in the PNAISP. Additionally, healthcare professionals working within prisons are at the forefront of organizing responses to mitigate the risks associated with a potential surge in cases and fatalities.
In 2019, Brazil had a total of 1,422 prisons, with 49% designated for provisional detainees and 79% suffering from overcrowding issues. Notably, half of these correctional facilities lack a medical office. The National Penitentiary Department reported that in the same year, the country held 755,274 individuals in custody, with 31% being provisional detainees. Brazil adhered to the World Health Organization's guidelines, as outlined in Recommendation 62/2020 by the National Council of Justice (CNJ). This recommendation encompasses both custodial and non-custodial measures, along with various health protocols detailed in Table 3. Specifically, Recommendation 62/2020 identifies individuals at higher risk, including the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic respiratory or immunosuppressive conditions.
Furthermore, the Brazilian Society of Family and Community Medicine has emphasized the necessity for additional measures in a document. These measures include educational initiatives, the fight against misinformation, promoting individual and collective hygiene practices, ensuring cleanliness in environments, disseminating information to family members, and maintaining the hygiene of safety equipment for professionals. The recommendations also encompass actions aimed at prisoners and various personnel working within correctional facilities.
As of May 11, 2020, Brazilian prisons reported 603 confirmed cases of COVID-19, leading to 23 deaths. Within a mere 20 days, the figures surged from 1 to over 100 in Brazil. Despite the recommendations and efforts of civil society, significant challenges persist. A religious organization operating within prisons revealed that 65.9% of food and hygiene supplies sent by families were not reaching the inmates. This same entity highlighted issues of inadequate transparency, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), and poor hygiene conditions, exemplified by reports indicating that 35 prisoners were sharing a single toothbrush.
It is significant to highlight that out of the 603 reported cases of COVID-19 in Brazilian prisons, a substantial majority of 444 cases (74%) are concentrated within the Penitentiary Complex of Papuda in the Federal District. This particular facility is known for housing a significant number of incarcerated politicians and individuals with higher financial means. These statistics suggest a concerning disparity within the Penitentiary System, mirroring the broader societal trend where individuals in positions of social or financial privilege have greater access to testing for the novel coronavirus.
The PNAISP and the recommendations of the CNJ, tailored to the specific context of each location, represent significant initiatives in the healthcare provision for incarcerated individuals, shedding light on a sensitive and pertinent issue in public health. It is crucial to recognize that the repercussions of the challenges within prison systems extend beyond their walls due to their permeable nature, emphasizing the need for comprehensive and adaptable strategies to address the health needs of this population.
Managing the impact of COVID-19 within Brazilian prison facilities presents a significant challenge, mirroring the difficulties faced in many other parts of the world. This challenge is exacerbated by the inherent precariousness that defines these institutions, a condition stemming from the persistent neglect by public authorities and civil society. This neglect not only perpetuates the harsh conditions within prisons but also compounds the hardships faced by inmates, effectively extending their punishment beyond the formal sentence. Examples of this include the denial of fundamental sanitary provisions, such as access to clean drinking water, further complicating the already dire situation within these facilities.
During a pandemic, the prison environment is further complicated by a combination of pre-existing and emerging issues that necessitate heightened sanitary protocols, including the cessation of visitations. This increased isolation can have detrimental effects on the mental well-being of incarcerated individuals.
Pandemic containment measures implemented globally highlight a consensus regarding the release of prisoners and the suspension of visits. However, certain crucial actions, like health education and mass testing within the prison population, are often overlooked despite their potential to aid in epidemiological projections, particularly due to the closed and controlled nature of these groups. It is also widely agreed upon that the absence of comprehensive health data pertaining to this demographic hinders the adoption of more targeted and effective strategies.
Scientific publications concerning COVID-19 and other infectious diseases within the prison population are notably limited, indicating a potential lack of interest in this subject within the scientific community. This lack of attention could stem from the stigma associated with incarcerated individuals and the challenges in accessing this particular group for research purposes.
The ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus has shed light on the detrimental and inhumane conditions that have been prevalent in efforts to restore human health. It is imperative that public authorities, civil society, and the scientific community derive valuable lessons from this current public health crisis to bring about positive changes and improve the well-being of vulnerable populations.
