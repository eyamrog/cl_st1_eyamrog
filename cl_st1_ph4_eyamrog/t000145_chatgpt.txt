Objective: This study aims to examine the sociodemographic and lifestyle variables linked to screen-based sedentary behavior, specifically focusing on individuals in Brazil who spend three or more hours per day watching television.
Methods: A quantitative analysis was conducted on ten editions of the cross-sectional health survey VIGITEL, which is representative at the population level. Individuals residing in state capitals and living in households with landline telephones were randomly selected and interviewed using a structured questionnaire over the telephone. A multivariate logistic regression model was then utilized to identify factors associated with screen-based sedentary behavior.
Results: The trends in sedentary behavior prevalence remained stable from 2008 to 2017. Individuals with unhealthier lifestyles exhibited higher rates of sedentary behavior: those consuming less than two in natura food items (vegetables, fruits, and beans) per day had a prevalence of 26.73% (95%CI 25.2%;28.31%), compared to those consuming two or more items per day at 23.79% (95%CI 21.92%;25.77%); individuals consuming soft drinks five or more days per week had a prevalence of 31.24% (95%CI 29.58%;32.95%) compared to those consuming less than five days per week at 23.82% (95%CI 22.2%;25.52%); and those engaging in less than 150 minutes of physical activity per week had a prevalence of 28.2% (95%CI 26.17%;30.33%) compared to those engaging in 150 minutes or more per week at 22.54% (21.27%;23.86%). Factors such as regular consumption of in natura food items (OR=0.984), physical activity (OR=0.798), and residing in a wealthier municipality (OR=0.826) were protective against screen-based sedentary behavior, while regular consumption of soft drinks (OR=1.440), smoking (OR=1.375), and alcohol abuse (OR=1.334) were identified as risk factors.
In conclusion, the prevalence of screen-based sedentary behavior among adults in Brazil during the years 2008-2017 was found to be significantly associated with modifiable behavioral factors.
Sedentary behaviors are significant risk factors for adverse health outcomes, distinct from the mere lack of physical activity. Research has shown strong links between sedentary behavior and chronic non-communicable diseases, including cardiometabolic and cardiovascular conditions, cancer, overweight, obesity, and increased mortality rates. These findings underscore the importance of addressing sedentary behaviors in promoting overall health and well-being.
The World Health Organization's recently released guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behavior advise adults aged 18-64 to reduce sedentary behavior by substituting it with physical activity for a minimum of 150 to 300 minutes per week. This shift is recommended due to the significant health advantages it offers, ultimately enhancing well-being and overall quality of life for individuals.
Despite the detrimental impact of sedentary behavior on health, it remains highly prevalent in various countries globally. A recent study revealed that around 65% of adults in the United States spent two or more hours daily watching television in the year 2015-2016.
It is crucial to highlight that sedentary behavior and physical activity can take place in various domains, such as leisure, transportation, labor, and other occupational or educational activities. Typically, sedentary behaviors during leisure are viewed as discretionary, with television viewing time often used as a proxy variable for optional sedentary behavior in epidemiological research due to its susceptibility to influences from cultural and socioeconomic factors.
While there is a growing academic interest in the factors linked to sedentary behaviors, the majority of studies tend to concentrate on high-income countries. This leaves a notable gap in the literature regarding population-level evidence for low- and middle-income countries like Brazil. Particularly crucial is the consideration of the concurrent nature of health behaviors and health conditions over extended periods.
The study aimed to examine the trends, protective factors, and risk factors linked to the adoption of screen-based sedentary behavior, specifically watching television for three or more hours per day, among adults aged 18 years and above residing in the state capitals of Brazil between 2008 and 2017.
The study provides an analysis of datasets obtained from the Surveillance of Risk and Protection Factors for Prevention of Chronic Diseases through Telephone Survey (VIGITEL), which was carried out by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. This analysis encompasses ten years of cross-sectional observational individual-level data collected from a representative sample of the adult population residing in Brazilian state capitals and the Federal District between 2008 and 2017.
The VIGITEL is an annual telephone health survey initiated in 2006 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to monitor risk and protective factors for chronic diseases within the Brazilian population. The databases contain individual-level data for each survey year, accessible on the Brazilian Ministry of Health website. Microdata from surveys conducted from 2008 onwards were specifically chosen, taking into account the survey's initial two-year consolidation phase. The VIGITEL sampling methodology mandates a minimum sample size of 1,500 individuals from each Brazilian state capital and the Federal District to accurately estimate the frequency of risk and protective factors for chronic diseases among the adult population, ensuring a 95% confidence level and a maximum error margin of three percentage points.
The initial stage of sampling involves the random selection of a minimum of 5,000 landlines per municipality from the landline registrations of major telephone companies in the country. Following this selection, eligible lines for the survey are identified, specifically active residential lines. The subsequent stage of sampling entails selecting one adult from each household to partake in the survey. To facilitate statistical inferences concerning the population of 26 state capitals and the Brazilian Federal District, individuals interviewed are assigned weights based on the survey sample design, employing the rake method. Data collection was executed through structured interviews utilizing a closed questionnaire administered via telephone.
In addition to data sourced from VIGITEL, information regarding the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population figures for each municipality were incorporated into the dataset, sourced from the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE). These additions aimed to capture specific environmental characteristics of the municipalities and the economic status of their populations, enabling an evaluation of potential impacts of economic conditions on other variables throughout the survey period spanning from 2008 to 2017.
Sedentary behavior as an outcome variable was assessed through self-reported daily television viewing time, specifically focusing on individuals classified as sedentary if their screen time exceeded or equaled 3 hours per day.
Variables of interest in the current study included: (1) self-reported weekly consumption frequency of in natura food items such as vegetables, fruits, and beans; (2) self-reported weekly consumption frequency of soft drinks; (3) sociodemographic characteristics encompassing age, biological sex, educational attainment, ethnicity/skin color, marital status, and occupation; (4) health characteristics comprising self-assessment of health status, self-reported diagnoses of diabetes, hypertension, overweight, and obesity; (5) self-reported behavioral characteristics like physical activity, alcohol abuse, and smoking habits; and (6) GDP per capita in the municipality of residence, sourced from data provided by IBGE.
Data from the VIGITEL databases spanning from 2008 to 2017 were consolidated into a unified dataset. Variables that were consistent throughout the analysis period were selected to facilitate statistical examination of trends and factors linked to the prevalence of screen-based sedentary behavior in adult populations.
A set of variables from VIGITEL underwent conversion into binary variables, with values coded as 0 (no) or 1 (yes) based on specific criteria derived from literature evidence or cutoff points set by national and/or international organizations. These variables included screen-based sedentary behavior, as well as regular consumption of in natura food items and soft drinks. The classification of screen-based sedentary behavior relied on self-reported daily television viewing duration, with a defined cutoff point of three or more hours per day.
Participants' regular consumption of in natura food items and soft drinks was assessed through self-reported frequency for each item, ranging from none to all days of the week. Three variables capturing the self-reported frequency of in natura food items consumption, specifically beans, fruits, and vegetables (recognized as indicators of healthier dietary habits), were transformed into the number of days per week each item was consumed. These values were then aggregated and divided by seven days to determine the total in natura food items consumed per day. Subsequently, this total was categorized based on a cutoff point of a minimum of two items consumed per day throughout the week.
Regular consumption of soft drinks, which is considered a marker of unhealthier food consumption patterns, was categorized based on a cutoff point of consuming five or more days per week.
In terms of sociodemographic characteristics, age and educational attainment were treated as continuous variables in their original form for analysis. However, biological sex, ethnicity/skin color, marital status, and occupation were transformed into categorical variables. These categories included female (0) and male (1) for biological sex; white (0) and black, brown, and indigenous (1) for ethnicity/skin color; living with companionship, such as being married or in a stable union (0), and living without companionship, including being single, divorced, or widowed (1) for marital status; and currently working (1) and not working (0) for occupation.
In the study, health characteristics were assessed through self-assessment of health status in five categories (very good, good, fair, poor, or very poor), which was then converted into a binary variable to identify individuals who reported poor or very poor health status. The presence of diabetes or hypertension was recorded based on self-reports from the participants. Additionally, the occurrence of overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) in the VIGITEL study was determined by calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) using self-reported information on weight and height.
Behavioral characteristics were derived in their original form from VIGITEL, encompassing physical activity level (≥ 150 minutes per week), alcohol abuse (≥ 5 doses for men; ≥ 4 doses for women on at least one occasion in the last 30 days), and smoking (current use of tobacco products, irrespective of quantity)14.
GDP per capita values were revised by adjusting for inflation using the National Consumer Price Index (IPCA-IBGE). This adjustment involved aligning the accumulated price index from each annual survey to the reference period of January 2019.
A multivariate logistic regression model was utilized to assess the association between screen-based sedentary behavior and the selected variables of interest, leading to the identification of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors that either protect or pose a risk for the adoption of screen-based sedentary behavior as the outcome. The model incorporated control variables for municipality, year of survey, and the interaction effects of municipality and year of survey to account for potential influences of local policies. The analyses were conducted using the statistical software Stata® (Stata Corp., College Station, USA), version 14.2 for Windows, with the svyset command employed for sample design utilizing the rake weighting method, and considering statistical significance at p≤0.05.
The VIGITEL survey project received approval from the National Commission on Research Ethics (CAAE: 65610017.1.0000.0008). Verbal informed consent was obtained during telephone contact.
Participants in the VIGITEL survey predominantly consisted of female individuals, those who self-identified as black, brown, or indigenous, and individuals who were employed. Initially, the survey showed a higher representation of young adults aged 18 to 39 years; however, over time, there was a noticeable increase in the participation of older adults aged 40 to 59 years and elderly individuals over 60 years old, as indicated in Table 1 and Table S1.
The prevalence of self-reported health conditions among individuals showed an increase over the study period. Specifically, the rates for diabetes rose from 6.22% (95%CI 5.44% to 7.09%) in 2008 to 7.63% (95%CI 7.10% to 8.19%) in 2017 (p<0.001), while obesity rates increased from 13.66% (95%CI 13.18% to 14.15%) in 2008 to 18.92% (95%CI 18.08% to 19.79%) in 2017 (p<0.001). Additionally, the prevalence of overweight individuals also saw a notable rise, from 44.88% (95%CI 43.64% to 46.14%) in 2008 to 54.00% (95%CI 52.58% to 55.41%) in 2017 (p<0.001), as indicated in both table 1 and table S1.
The adoption of screen-based sedentary behavior exhibited stability, with minor fluctuations observed over the period, ranging from 22.53% [95%CI 21.11% to 24.02%] in 2015 to 28.58% [95%CI 26.73% to 30.51%] in 2013. Despite the relatively small variations, the differences recorded throughout the timeframe were statistically significant (p<0.001), as indicated in both table 1 and table S1.
Over the period under study, there was a notable increase in the prevalence of physical activity ≥150 minutes/week, rising from 43.07% (95%CI 40.77% to 45.40%) in 2008 to 53.41% (95%CI 49.57% to 57.21%) in 2017 (p<0.001). Similarly, abusive alcohol consumption also exhibited an upward trend, climbing from 17.22% (95%CI 14.75% to 20.01%) in 2008 to 19.06% (95%CI 17.7% to 20.49%) in 2017 (p=0.003). Conversely, there was a decline in the frequency of soft drink consumption, dropping from 26.41% (95%CI 23.10% to 30.01%) in 2008 to 14.62% (95%CI 11.71% to 18.10%) in 2017 (p<0.001), as well as in smoking prevalence, decreasing from 14.77% (12.73% to 17.07%) in 2008 to 10.11% (7.94% to 12.79%) in 2017 (p<0.001) (refer to table 1 and table S1 for detailed data).
No statistically significant differences were found among the individuals interviewed over the study period in terms of biological sex, occupation, self-assessment of poor health status, and self-reported hypertension diagnosis, as indicated in Table 1 and Table S1.
The results from the logistic model examining the adoption of screen-based sedentary habits indicate a statistically significant association with various demographic factors. Specifically, age, biological sex, ethnicity/skin color, marital status, educational attainment, and occupation were found to be significant predictors. Older individuals (OR=0.999) and those with higher levels of education (OR=0.991) were less likely to adopt screen-based sedentary behavior. Conversely, women (OR=1.086), individuals identifying as black, brown, or indigenous (OR=1.063), those living without companionship (OR=1.148), and individuals who were not employed (OR=1.889) were more likely to engage in such behavior (see table 2).
Statistically significant associations were observed with overweight (OR=1.111), obesity (OR=1.103), self-reported diagnosis of diabetes (OR=1.117), and hypertension (OR=1.097). Regarding behavioral characteristics, the findings revealed that regular consumption of in natura foods (OR=0.984) and engagement in physical activity (OR=0.798) were protective factors against the adoption of sedentary behavior. Conversely, the consumption of soft drinks (OR=1.440), smoking (OR=1.375), and alcohol abuse (OR=1.334) were identified as risk factors. Furthermore, within the economic context, individuals residing in municipalities with higher per capita GDP demonstrated lower adherence to sedentary habits (OR=0.826) as shown in Table 2.
The self-assessment of poor health status (OR=1.047) did not demonstrate statistical significance concerning screen-based sedentary behavior among the adult individuals analyzed in the specified period.
The prevalence of screen-based sedentary behavior, defined as watching television for three or more hours per day, among adults in Brazil has shown a notable correlation with health behaviors that could potentially be altered through the implementation of public policy strategies aimed at primary health care interventions.
The study's evidence underscores the impact of sociodemographic, economic, and behavioral factors on lifestyle choices that shape the health status of the Brazilian population. Previous research has identified mechanisms of reinforcement between screen-based sedentary behavior and other behavioral patterns. Healthier lifestyle choices, such as regular physical activity and frequent consumption of in natura foods, were found to be protective factors against prolonged television viewing of three or more hours per day. Conversely, unhealthy behaviors like frequent soft drink consumption, smoking, and alcohol abuse tended to be risk factors for sedentary behavior.
In a previous study conducted among public school teachers in Presidente Prudente municipality, state of Sao Paulo, evidence was found supporting the protective role of regular consumption of fresh, unprocessed foods and adherence to recommended levels of physical activity in relation to the adoption of sedentary behavior. Additionally, associations were identified between overeating, alcohol consumption, and the amount of time spent watching television. These findings align with the broader understanding of the impact of lifestyle choices on sedentary behaviors in Brazil.
The study's results, supported by previous research, highlight the simultaneous occurrence and impact of detrimental habits on an individual's health, underscoring the necessity of discussing the presence of multiple behavioral risk factors and their effects on health outcomes. Embracing healthy lifestyles, characterized by a combination of positive behaviors, was notably linked to a decrease in premature mortality in the United States, leading to an extension in life expectancy, particularly in terms of healthy years devoid of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD). Comparable findings have emerged in investigations involving Brazilian adolescents and Polish adults, especially concerning dietary habits associated with sedentary screen time activities like television viewing. This association suggests a potential mechanism that promotes the consumption of unhealthy food items (such as sugary drinks, snacks, and desserts) while watching television. Moreover, the practice of watching television has been correlated with the accumulation of body fat, heightening the risks of obesity, abdominal fat deposition, elevated BMI, and increased waist circumference, findings that were partially mirrored in the study's results. It is crucial to note that obesity and overweight are significant risk factors for NCD, imposing substantial health and economic burdens on populations, healthcare systems, and households globally. These burdens encompass direct expenses related to treatments and indirect costs like productivity losses, family obligations, and emotional well-being impacts.
Our findings indicate that individuals who self-reported diabetes and hypertension diagnoses, in addition to being overweight or obese, were more inclined towards engaging in screen-based sedentary behavior, a correlation that has been noted in prior research studies. This connection between non-communicable diseases (NCD) and sedentary behavior underscores the importance of involving individuals with NCD in programs that promote physical activity. This is particularly crucial in addressing perceived obstacles to meeting recommended physical activity levels and embracing healthier dietary habits, emphasizing the impact of social and environmental factors on behavioral modifications.
In terms of sociodemographic characteristics, the study revealed a greater inclination towards screen-based sedentary behavior among individuals who identified as single, divorced, or widowed, indicating a lack of companionship. This finding aligns with prior research conducted with Canadian and Japanese adults (37, 38).
However, a systematic review has revealed certain inconsistencies regarding the impact of family and household factors, such as marital status, on the adoption of sedentary behavior during leisure. Therefore, while some evidence suggests a tendency towards screen-based sedentary behavior among individuals living alone, further research is necessary to determine whether marital status plays a role in sedentary habits like television watching and its correlation with other sociodemographic variables over time. Nonetheless, the evidence underscores the need for discussions on the influence of peers in promoting healthier lifestyles, advocating for and participating in physical activities during leisure, rather than engaging in sedentary recreational pursuits like television viewing.
When considering ethnicity and skin color, it is crucial to note that the increased prevalence of screen-based sedentary behaviors among individuals identifying as black, brown, or indigenous may be attributed to environmental factors that create obstacles to physical activity within ethnic minority communities. This observation is supported by research conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, it presents an opportunity to address the development of health policy interventions with a focus on equity, taking into account the unique characteristics of black, brown, and indigenous populations in Brazil.
Sedentary behavior is influenced by socioeconomic and cultural factors that are intertwined with the structure of modern society, work environments, and educational practices. These routines are often designed to be carried out in a seated position with minimal physical exertion, thereby fostering a sedentary lifestyle among individuals and communities. The correlation between physical activity and socioeconomic status is typically linked to leisure activities in affluent nations and occupational demands in less economically developed countries. However, in middle-income countries such as Brazil, a mix of both scenarios can be observed, highlighting the complex interplay of factors shaping sedentary behaviors.
Therefore, the utilization of indicators such as watching television for three or more hours daily to analyze sedentary behavior could serve as a significant gauge of discretionary recreational engagement, distinguishing it from other forms of screen-based sedentary behavior, such as prolonged computer use, which might be associated with occupational tasks. Our findings indicated that individuals who reported not being employed exhibited a greater inclination towards sustaining screen-based sedentary behavior during leisure time by watching television for three or more hours daily.
However, given the variations in time allocated to sedentary activities across various life domains in Brazil, as evidenced by a study conducted in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, it is imperative to delve deeper into the sedentary behavior patterns within different spheres of life among the Brazilian populace.
The primary limitations of this study pertain to the methodological aspects of the VIGITEL databases, particularly concerning the data collection methodology based on a cross-sectional survey design. This design hinders the ability to establish causal relationships between screen-based sedentary behavior and the sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics of the Brazilian adult population.
Throughout the period of analysis, alterations in the survey questionnaires posed limitations on the inclusion of specific characteristics of interest in the study, such as the presence of hypercholesterolemia and the consumption of other food items like milk, meat, and sweets. Consequently, only variables that maintained consistency and comparability over the analyzed period were chosen for inclusion in the study. This approach ensured the reliability and accuracy of the model proposed for estimation.
The VIGITEL survey incorporates self-reported data obtained through telephone interviews, a method that may lead to an underestimation of characteristics that individuals deem as "wrong" or "socially unacceptable," while potentially overestimating traits perceived as "right" or "socially acceptable." This could compromise the accuracy of analyses related to specific individual characteristics and behaviors. Additionally, the variable concerning screen-based sedentary behavior focuses solely on time spent watching television, neglecting the time spent on other devices such as computers, tablets, and mobile phones. This oversight could potentially inflate the prevalence of sedentary habits among the Brazilian adult population, particularly given the widespread use of information and communication technologies during the period under examination.
Sample selection in VIGITEL is predicated on the population representativeness of individuals residing in Brazilian state capitals and the Federal District who possess landline telephones, primarily encompassing areas of high urbanization. Consequently, there is a notable absence of representation from the rural population within the study cohort. Prior research underscores the necessity of employing alternative weighting methodologies in regions characterized by limited coverage of household landlines, highlighting the potential for underestimation biases stemming from the increasing trend of substituting landlines with mobile phones over time.
It is crucial to note that an evaluation of the sampling and stratification processes utilized in VIGITEL has demonstrated validity and representativeness for researching and monitoring risk and protective factors concerning the health status of the Brazilian population. Additionally, the survey's sample size and sampling procedures work to reduce potential biases in responses that could either underestimate or overestimate the monitoring of trends and risk or protective factors linked to sedentary behavior in the Brazilian adult population.
The escalating trends towards sedentary lifestyles, alcohol abuse, and the rise in overweight and obesity observed during the analyzed period underscore the urgent need for action within the Brazilian health system. This call to action is particularly crucial for the implementation of primary health care strategies aimed at promoting health and preventing diseases. Given the absence of nationally representative cohort data in Brazil, the findings of this study have the potential to inform the development of targeted interventions in public health policies. These interventions could play a pivotal role in fostering healthier lifestyles among adults in Brazil.
