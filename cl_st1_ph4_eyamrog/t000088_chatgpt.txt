Aims: The primary objective of this pilot study was to characterize the predominant and less prevalent microbiota present in the saliva of individuals suffering from advanced periodontitis, with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), while also examining the correlation between the relative abundance of microorganisms and various clinical parameters.
Materials and Methods: Six individuals diagnosed with periodontitis were included and classified based on their diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Various parameters including salivary pH, number of teeth with active caries lesions, number of remaining teeth, periodontal status, and glycemic parameters were assessed. Salivary DNA was extracted and the V4 region amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced using Ion PGM. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were then compared in relation to the clinical parameters under investigation.
Results: Correlation analysis revealed that eight low-abundant bacteria exhibited significant correlations with various co-variables, displaying either positive or negative associations. Specifically, the bacteria associated with periodontitis demonstrated a pattern of increasing abundance in relation to higher pH levels and a greater number of remaining teeth.
Conclusions: This survey has identified potential correlations between minority microbiota and various clinical parameters, including the number of remaining teeth, fasting blood glucose levels (FBG), and salivary pH. The presence of certain low-abundance microorganisms in individuals with advanced periodontitis, whether or not they have type 2 diabetes mellitus, suggests the existence of microbial signatures that have not been thoroughly investigated.
Changes in salivary flow and composition are crucial factors contributing to the shift in oral microbiota. Disruptions in the balance of oral microorganisms can lead to oral diseases as a result of dysbiosis. Salivary secretion is significantly influenced by various factors such as age, medications, and hypoglycemia, with the latter being particularly common in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM). While the impact of DM on periodontitis is well-established, its relative significance in other oral diseases remains a topic of debate. Extensive research indicates that DM not only results in salivary dysfunctions in terms of flow rates (hyposalivation) but also leads to notable alterations in the composition of saliva, including elevated levels of salivary glucose.
There is compelling evidence indicating that glycemic control plays a pivotal role in regulating the subgingival biofilm associated with periodontal health (11-14). Recent investigations have also explored the potential impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the salivary microbiome (15-18), with correlations between the salivary microbiome, periodontitis, and DM-related parameters being established (19). These studies have revealed significant changes in microbial composition. However, they have not differentiated between the severity of periodontitis or linked the microbiota to clinical oral conditions beyond those related to periodontal health. Moreover, research on the DM-associated salivary microbiome has primarily focused on identifying the most abundant microbiota associated with health or disease, neglecting the less prevalent microbiota. It is our contention that this approach may lead to a misunderstanding of the overall environment, as the metabolic functions of low-abundance microorganisms could be crucial in shaping dysbiotic microhabitats (20).
The salivary microbiome, being a reflection of the entire oral microenvironment, makes saliva a more representative sample for investigating shifts towards dysbiosis. By examining the salivary fluid of individuals with DM, one can delve deeper into how oral manifestations of DM, beyond periodontitis, impact the microbial composition. The notable salivary dysfunctions observed in individuals with DM may be linked to variations in their microbiome. Goodson et al. conducted a study that assessed alterations in the abundance of certain bacterial species in the saliva of adolescents with elevated levels of salivary glucose, revealing an inverse relationship between salivary glucose concentrations and saliva pH. Given that glucose serves as a prominent energy source for numerous oral bacteria, fluctuations in its levels could play a crucial role in shaping the salivary microbiome, resulting in decreased overall bacterial diversity and notable shifts in the relative frequencies of bacterial species, particularly favoring acidic ones.
This pilot study sought to delineate the predominant and minority microbiota present in the saliva of individuals afflicted with advanced periodontitis, with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D), while also examining the correlation between the relative abundance of organisms and various factors such as salivary pH, the count of teeth exhibiting active caries lesions, the number of remaining teeth, as well as periodontal and glycemic parameters.
This study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Health Sciences at the University of Brasília (process number 87962818.4.0000.0030) in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to participation, all patients provided written informed consent and underwent basic dental treatment.
A pilot study was conducted with six individuals diagnosed with periodontitis based on the New Classification of Periodontal Disease (22) at the "Diabetes Dental Clinic" at the University Hospital of Brasília. The patients were recruited, and data collection took place between August 2018 and March 2019.
Individuals included in this study were required to be aged 30 years or older and have at least two teeth with interproximal insertion loss of 3mm or more. Exclusion criteria encompassed complications related to diabetes mellitus (DM) and severe systemic comorbidities, individuals who had undergone transplantation, those with a positive history of epilepsy, a past of head and neck radiotherapy, and individuals who had received chemotherapy within the last three months. The diagnosis of DM status was confirmed through medical reports indicating type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the use of insulin or other oral hypoglycemic medications. The study comprised six patients with periodontal disease, categorized based on their DM status: three patients without a prior DM diagnosis (P21, P10, and P2) and three patients previously diagnosed with DM (DMP14, DMP27, and DMP33).
Examiners who were trained assessed the periodontal status of the participants. Using a Williams-type periodontal probe from Hu-Friedy MFG. Co. Inc. in Chicago, IL, USA, they recorded periodontal parameters such as probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and bleeding on probing (BOP). The remaining teeth were counted through visual inspection, and the number of teeth with non-cavitated or cavitated caries lesions was also noted. Trained and calibrated examiners classified lesion activity, ensuring a weighted Kappa value exceeding 0.7.
Participants underwent testing for their fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels within three months prior to the collection of saliva samples at Sabin Laboratories in Brasília, Brazil.
Stimulated and passive salivary flow collections were conducted in the morning (8-10 am) to mitigate the influence of circadian rhythms. Participants were instructed to abstain from consuming food, beverages, and engaging in physical activities for a minimum of two hours prior to saliva sampling (17). Passive drooling was employed for a collection period of 5 minutes. Subsequent to collection, unstimulated saliva was divided into aliquots of 500μL each, which were then transferred into sterile microtubes devoid of DNAse and RNAse and preserved at -20oC until required for DNA extraction and sequencing. The suspension underwent centrifugation for 30 seconds at 10,000 rpm, following which the supernatant was discarded.
The salivary pH and buffer capacity were evaluated in the stimulated saliva. Following one minute of chewing a rubber device, the total volume of stimulated saliva was collected over a 5-minute period through passive drool into a plastic container. The pH was determined using an indicator strip, while the buffer capacity was assessed by adding 3mL of 0.005M hydrochloric acid for every 1mL of stimulated saliva. After a 2-minute interval, the pH was measured, with a low buffering capacity indicated by pH values below 4.0.
The total DNA extraction was conducted according to the established protocol by Smalla et al. (24). The amplification of the 16S rRNA gene using universal primers F515/R806 was detailed in a separate publication (25). In summary, about 10ng of genomic DNA was combined with a 50-μL PCR mixture containing 1U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (with a Tm of 52 °C).
Following purification of the amplicons with Agencount AMPure Beads (Beckman Coulter), library construction was carried out according to the protocol outlined in the Ion Plus Fragment Library kit, starting with an initial 100ng of DNA. Subsequent sequencing was executed on an Ion PGM System (Thermo Fisher) utilizing an Ion 316 chip, adhering to the guidelines provided by the manufacturer.
The 16S rRNA gene reads underwent processing through DADA2, a rigorous pipeline for identifying amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in a single read dataset, focusing on low-abundance microorganisms. Quality and size filtering, along with error rate estimation, were conducted on the reads. Singleton sequences were eliminated during dereplication, and chimeras were removed. Taxonomic assignments were made using the Silva v.132 database. ASVs linked to Eukaryote, Chloroplast, or Mitochondria were excluded from subsequent analysis. The sequences have been archived at the National Biotechnology Information Center (NCBI) under the BioProject PRJNA558499.
The Mann-Whitney test was utilized to compare clinical parameters between groups following the confirmation of the non-parametric nature of the data using SPSS software version 25.0 for Mac (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The values per Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were aggregated per phyla, and subsequently, the average was computed based on the clinical characteristics. A metadata table was constructed containing the clinical characteristics of the individuals, encompassing salivary pH, number of active caries lesions, number of teeth, fasting blood glucose (FBG), the proportion of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP), and the proportion of insertion loss exceeding 5mm. Spearman correlation was employed to assess the relative abundance (RA) of ASVs in relation to these metadata. Furthermore, the saliva microbiome of individuals was categorized based on clinical characteristics for a descriptive analysis. Mean and standard deviation were determined for the clinical variables, with a significance level set at p < 0.05.
In terms of the extension of periodontal disease, it was observed that all patients exhibited generalized periodontitis, with the exception of individual DMP33 who presented with localized periodontitis. Among the patients, two individuals (DMP27 and P10) were diagnosed with periodontitis stage IV, while four patients (DMP14, P2, P21, DMP33) were classified as having periodontitis stage III. Notably, only one individual diagnosed with diabetes mellitus exhibited uncontrolled levels of blood glucose, measuring at 369 mg/dl. Conversely, subjects without a diabetes mellitus diagnosis displayed borderline fasting blood glucose levels, approximately around 100 mg/dl.
Individuals in the DMP group, comprising those with both periodontitis and DM, were found to be older compared to those in the P group, who had periodontitis without DM. Salivary pH levels in individuals diagnosed with DM ranged from pH 7 to 8, while in the P group, it ranged from pH 6 to 7. Parameters such as the number of remaining teeth, salivary pH, buffering capacity, and teeth with active caries did not show significant differences between the two groups (p>0.05). Both groups exhibited high proportions of sites with BOP and teeth with clinical attachment loss >5mm, with similar rates (Table 1). In terms of sequencing output and the relative abundance of microbiota, a total of 252,964 reads were generated from saliva samples, with 116,935 qualified reads distributed among 442 ASVs. Following screening and optimization, 332 ASVs were retained for further analysis, forming 117 OTUs, two of which were assigned to archaea. The relative abundance of the predominant microbiota (ASVs ≥1%) accounted for over 99% of the total sequences, as depicted in Figure 1. At the phylum level (1A), Firmicutes were predominant in both groups, yet individuals in the DMP group showed enrichment in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Conversely, those with periodontitis but no DM displayed a tendency towards enrichment in Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Spirochaetes.
At the genus level (or respective ASV), the predominant microbiota accounted for 93-94% of the total microbiota in both groups. Streptococcus was the dominant genus in the salivary microbiome, comprising approximately 30% of the overall microbiota in both groups. Fusobacterium (average DMP=6%; P=13%), Porphyromonas (average DMP=7.5%; P=7.8%), and Gemella (average DMP=4.7%; P=5.1%) were also prevalent in both groups, each representing ≥1% of the total relative abundance across all samples. Veillonella exhibited higher abundance in individuals diagnosed with DM, exceeding 1.5% in all DMP samples (average=2.8%), while remaining below 1% in all P samples (average=0.6%). Similarly, Prevotella showed an average abundance of 5.3% in DMP samples but less than 0.3% in all P group samples. In contrast, Treponema and Tannerella, genera associated with periodontitis, displayed low abundance in the DMP group (average 0.03% and 0.1%, respectively) but higher levels in the P group (3% and 0.7%, respectively).
In our analysis of the ASV, we observed that the minority microbiota, constituting less than 1% of the total, accounted for 0.6% and 0.8% of the relative abundance in the DMP and P groups, respectively, with a dominance of the Epsilonbacteraeota phylum (Figure 1C). Notably, the saliva of the P group exhibited an enrichment of Synergistes. A significant finding was the detection of reads from two Archaea groups, Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota (0.17% and 0.03%, respectively), in a single DMP sample (DMP14), which also displayed the lowest salivary pH (pH=6) and the highest BOP (75%). Despite their low prevalence, ASVs associated with genera not commonly linked to periodontitis were widespread across all individuals, including Fermentimonas (≥0.2%, same family as Porphyromonas and Tannerella), Caldicoprobacter (≥0.13%), Rikenellaceae (≥0.1%), Lentimicrobiaceae (≥0.05%), Fastidiosipila (≥0.08%), Alishewanella (≥0.07%), unnamed CK06-06-Mud-MAS4B-21 (≥0.05%). Solobacterium was present in all DMP samples, with a relative abundance of at least 0.1%.
To delve deeper into the insights gleaned from the descriptive analysis, a Spearman correlation was conducted to assess the relationship between clinical parameters and the relative abundance (RA) of microorganisms (refer to Figure 2). Eight Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) exhibited significant correlations with clinical variables, displaying either positive or negative associations. Notably, the observed pattern differed from that seen when variables were grouped together. Surprisingly, neither salivary pH nor the presence of lesions with caries activity showed significant correlations with the microbial composition.
The Fibroblast Growth Factor (FBG) exhibited positive correlations with Absconditabacteriales (SR1) and Caldicoprobacter, while showing negative correlations with Leptotrichia, Parviromonas, and Balneolaceae; specifically, unnamed CK06-06-Mud-MAS4B-21. Abiotrophia displayed a negative correlation, whereas Johnsonella showed a positive correlation with the number of remaining teeth. Clinical attachment loss exceeding 5mm was positively associated with the relative abundance of Balneolaceae CK06-06-Mud-MAS4B-21 and Fastidiosipila. Notably, none of these taxa constituted the predominant microbiota, with Leptotrichia (present in 3 out of 6 samples at 1%), Absconditabacteriales (SR1) (observed in a single sample at >1%), and Parviromonas (found in 2 out of 6 samples at 1%).
The CCA triplot revealed a contrasting relationship between salivary pH and FBG, BOP (referred to as the bleeding index in the figure), and clinical attachment loss >5mm. The periodontitis-associated bacteria, including Tannarela, Treponema, and Porphyromonas, exhibited a pattern of increasing pH and number of remaining teeth as shown in Figure 3.
In this pilot study aimed at understanding the relationship between the salivary microbiome and clinical parameters in patients with periodontitis, with or without DM, microbial ASVs commonly found in oral cavity sites were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. The core microbiome identified was akin to those typically associated with dental biofilms, such as Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Gemella, with certain bacterial abundances notably influenced by the presence of DM. However, the molecular survey employed in this study offered a more comprehensive view of the overall differences in the minority microbiota. Various organisms like Fermentimonas, Caldicoprobacter, Rikenellaceae, Lentimicrobiaceae, Fastidiosipila, Alishewanella, and an unnamed CK06-06-Mud-MAS4B-21 were consistently present but in low abundance. Solobacterium, a less prevalent organism, was linked to the presence of DM. The study also revealed intricate competition patterns among low abundance microbial populations, influenced by factors such as the inflammatory state in periodontal sites, salivary pH fluctuations, blood glucose levels, and the number of remaining teeth. Significant correlations were observed between clinical parameters and ASVs representing the minority microbiota, shedding light on the complex interplay within the oral microbiome.
There has been a resurgence of interest in the impact of minority organisms within the microbiome during dysbiosis, as these lesser members can play significant roles in the community. Exploring the minority microbiome could unveil distinct signatures linked to both periodontal and diabetic conditions, offering insights into the mechanisms of microbial communities and their role in disease development. Despite this, only a limited number of NGS-based studies have delved into describing microbiota present in low abundance (<1%), primarily due to issues such as low detection sensitivity and a higher likelihood of inaccuracies. To address this challenge, a more robust pipeline was employed in this study to mitigate detection errors in the data, opting for a single-read-based classification over assembly-based methods, which is particularly crucial for low-abundance species. Our observations also highlighted the prevalence and characteristic abundance of certain taxa. The analysis of low-abundance organisms is not aimed at pinpointing a 'culprit', but rather at understanding how the metabolic activities of certain species can influence or be influenced by the shift from health to disease. Intriguingly, none of the organisms correlated with clinical parameters constituted the majority of the microbiota, with Leptotrichia (present in 3 out of 6 samples at 1%), SR1 (found in a single sample at >1%), and Parviromonas (detected in 2 out of 6 samples at 1%) standing out.
The disruption of homeostasis by abnormal blood sugar levels can have a significant impact on the microbiota profile, especially when coupled with periodontitis. In a recent study by Matsha et al., nine phyla were identified in plaque samples from individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) and periodontitis, including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria. While their findings align with ours, we observed an enrichment of Proteobacteria in DM in our study. Our results revealed a positive correlation between blood glucose levels and Absconditabacteriales (SR1) and the anaerobic Caldicoprobacter, while Leptotrichia, Parviromonas, and Balneolaceae decreased significantly with rising blood glucose levels. The periodontal clinical parameters assessed in our study indicated a positive correlation between clinical attachment level and Balneolaceae and Fastidiosipila, with the latter being present in all samples. Notably, genera strongly linked to periodontitis such as Tannerella, Treponema, and Porphyromonas showed associations with increased pH and the number of remaining teeth. Abiotrophia exhibited a negative correlation, while Johnsonella was positively correlated with the number of remaining teeth. However, due to insufficient power to confirm these correlations, further studies focusing on the minority salivary microbiota are warranted. We estimate that a minimum sample size of 14 is required to detect a correlation of 0.7 with 80% power and a 5% alpha level using Fisher’s Z test.
The patients' clinical parameters reveal a slightly lower salivary pH in the presence of DM, potentially attributed to the elevated glucose levels in saliva and crevicular gingival fluid, enhancing bacterial acidogenicity. This phenomenon may lead to a reduction in pH, fostering the growth of fermenting organisms and acid metabolization. Yang et al. noted an increase in Lactobacillus fermentum in DM patients' saliva, which decreased post-DM treatment. Lactate metabolism plays a crucial role in pH regulation by aiding in neutralization and producing propionate, acetate, CO2, and H2, alongside nitrogen utilization by certain species and the release of basic substances to lower pH. Notably, the enrichment of specific bacteria in the DM group, like Veillonella and Prevotella, was observed in the CCA triplot following decreased pH and increased FBG. Veillonella, recognized as an "acid sink" organism, is associated with Socransky's purple complex, thriving in reduced O2 environments like periodontal pockets. Its abundance in DM patients may be linked to heightened salivary glucose levels, warranting further investigation. Interestingly, prior research has highlighted Veillonella's gene activity at low pH, suggesting metabolic functions that aid in pH recovery, positioning it as a pH-neutralizing organism. Additionally, these health-promoting organisms in periodontal sites contribute menadione (vitamin K) through their metabolism, crucial for the growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia.
The diversity of bacterial genera present in saliva may be influenced by the abundance and composition of bacteria adhering to dental surfaces, especially as all participants in this study were diagnosed with periodontitis regardless of their systemic health. These findings underscore the notion that saliva mirrors the microbiota of the subgingival environment, albeit with expected variations in abundance, making it a straightforward and representative tool for assessing the microbiome of individuals with periodontitis. We argue that saliva should be the preferred sample for studying intricate oral conditions, particularly when compounded by systemic illnesses. Furthermore, individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) exhibited heightened levels of certain phyla like Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes compared to healthy counterparts. Notably, this preliminary investigation revealed an enrichment of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in the salivary microbiome of individuals with DM, mirroring patterns observed in the gut microbiome. This observation hints at a potential correlation between gut and oral microbiomes that warrants further exploration.
All participants exhibited high degrees of periodontitis, with the clinical inflammatory parameter BOP showing a positive correlation with Actinobacteria enrichment and a negative correlation with Spirochaetes. Sun et al. (19) also found that periodontal parameters were linked to various well-known periodontitis-associated microbiotas, such as P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, P. capri, Alloprevotella rava, P. denticola, Catenibacterium mitsuokai, Prevotella stercorea, and Treponema medium. Additionally, Porphyromonas gingivalis, identified as a keystone species in periodontitis, was highly prevalent in the salivary microbiome of all samples, supporting the notion that P. gingivalis may play a crucial role in orchestrating an inflammophilic microbiota that disrupts the oral environment. This aligns with the 'polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis' (PSD) model (35), suggesting that while these microorganisms may not always directly cause a shift from a symbiotic to a dysbiotic microbiota, they can benefit from and contribute to maintaining an imbalanced state.
Based on the compelling evidence derived from a limited sample size, it is imperative to exercise caution in drawing definitive conclusions. Subsequent studies are essential to validate the effects of controlled and uncontrolled DM. Additionally, it is crucial to underscore the significance of selecting an appropriate primer to ensure sample diversity. While the V4 hypervariable region is conventionally favored for its lower error rate and sufficient information for taxonomic classification of microbial communities, the choice of primer remains a critical consideration in research design.
In conclusion, these initial findings potentially indicate that clinical parameters may be reflected in the minority salivary microbiome of individuals with both Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and periodontitis. The results suggest potential signatures of low-abundance microbiota numbers correlating with the number of remaining teeth, fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, and salivary pH. Further studies with larger sample sizes are essential to comprehend these patterns of oral manifestations of diabetes mellitus (DM) for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. This pilot study could serve as a foundation for future research on the salivary microbiome, particularly focusing on low-abundance species, and could support investigations aimed at manipulating the oral microbiota in clinical settings for medical benefits. If confirmed, low-abundance microorganisms correlated with clinical parameters could represent a promising therapeutic target strategy.
