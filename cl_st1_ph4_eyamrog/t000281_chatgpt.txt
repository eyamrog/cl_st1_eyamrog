In the context of health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying prognostic factors is crucial for delivering optimal patient care and efficiently managing healthcare resources. Therefore, our objective is to conduct a systematic review of prognostic factors associated with various outcomes in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
Design and Setting: This study outlines a protocol for a rapid living systematic review methodology, adhering to the guidelines set forth by the Cochrane Handbook.
METHODS: Cohorts and case-control studies will be included in this research. The search will be conducted on various databases including Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane Library - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Portal Regional BVS- LILACS, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies. Language restrictions will not be imposed during the search process. The critical appraisal of the included studies will be carried out using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool, and the certainty of evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.
Since the initial report released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in early December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has rapidly intensified. As of April 29, 2020, over 3 million cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection had been documented across 210 countries and territories, with a death toll exceeding 200 thousand.
During a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, the spectrum of illness presentation and its severity profile play crucial roles in facilitating effective decision-making (3). These parameters aid medical personnel in patient assessments, particularly when faced with the challenge of allocating limited healthcare resources. Furthermore, they are instrumental in ensuring the delivery of optimal care to patients while also maintaining the sustainability of the healthcare system (1, 3).
Prognostic factors serve as reliable indicators for predicting disease progression and severity levels. It is widely acknowledged that the case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection escalates with advancing age and the presence of comorbidities. Additionally, factors like immune function decline, proinflammatory profile, and alterations in Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) have been identified in pertinent clinical reports as potential predictors for the progression of COVID-19.
Despite the encouraging data, the predictive capacity and reliability of these potential indicators have not been definitively clarified. Therefore, the aim of this rapid living systematic review is to examine the evidence regarding prognostic factors in patients with COVID-19. This review will address the following research questions:
What are the risk and protective factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals who do not have the disease?
What prognostic factors contribute to hospital admission in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, both in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases?
What are the risk factors associated with Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and the need for respiratory support among adult inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19?
In critically ill patients in intensive care units, what distinctions exist between those who survive and those who do not?
The protocol for this systematic review was registered on the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) platform with the registration number CRD42020183437. In conducting this rapid living systematic review, we will utilize abbreviated systematic review methods. In contrast to the comprehensive methods typically employed in a systematic review, our review team will implement specific methodological shortcuts as outlined in reference (6).
The study did not include targeted searches of grey literature.
The abstracts were not independently screened.
We will incorporate both prospective and retrospective longitudinal cohorts in our study. Additionally, due to the scarcity of available data, we will incorporate case-control studies into our analysis. Cross-sectional studies will not be included in our research, as they do not allow for the determination of prognosis based on their design.
We will incorporate studies that have assessed patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We will incorporate studies conducted since November 2019, without imposing any language restrictions on the selection process.
We will conduct searches on MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE via Elsevier, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - CENTRAL), Scopus, Portal Regional BVS - LILACS, and Web of Science, utilizing appropriate descriptors and synonyms tailored to each database's specifications. Additionally, we will explore the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to locate published, ongoing, and unpublished studies. To further enhance our search, we will employ the snowballing technique by scrutinizing the reference lists of the included studies.
We will employ the terminology associated with the issue of interest and the prognostic study filter outlined by Wilczynski and Haynes (8). The search methodology conducted in MEDLINE through Pubmed is detailed in Table 1.
Based on predefined eligibility criteria, two authors, KMM and ACPNP, will identify studies for inclusion in the review. In cases where duplicate studies are identified across multiple databases, with studies sharing the same participants but employing different outcome measures or assessment time points, both reports will be incorporated, yet treated as a singular study. However, if duplicate reports are discovered, such as studies with identical participants, outcomes, and assessment time points, the report with the smaller sample size will be omitted. Following the elimination of duplicates, the authors will assess study titles and abstracts, excluding those that clearly do not meet the review's inclusion criteria. Subsequently, the selected studies will undergo a thorough examination, with reasons for exclusion of fully reviewed studies documented. Any disagreements among authors regarding study inclusion will be resolved by the third author, APR. To streamline the screening and selection process, the Rayyan application will be utilized.
Two authors (ACPNP and CRRF) will independently extract data, with discrepancies or disagreements resolved by a third author (APR). Data extraction from included studies will adhere to a predefined form encompassing key information: (i) patient demographics and clinical characteristics; (ii) study setting; (iii) assessment time points; (iv) number of patients lost to follow-up per group; (v) reasons for loss to follow-up; (vi) interventions administered; (vii) approach to handling missing data, including data imputation methods and use of intention-to-treat analysis; (viii) funding sources; (ix) potential conflicts of interest; (x) adverse events; (xi) outcome measures; and (xii) protocol deviations.
In evaluating the potential for conducting a meta-analysis, data will be gathered for both primary and secondary outcome measures, including: (i) the total number of patients in each group; (ii) the number of events in each group for dichotomous outcomes; (iii) metrics such as mean, standard deviation, standard error, median, interquartile range, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence interval for continuous outcomes; (iv) p-values; and (v) hazard ratios along with their corresponding standard errors or 95% confidence intervals.
The critical appraisal of included studies will be conducted using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) scale, as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. The certainty of evidence will be assessed through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. GRADE judgement will consider factors such as the overall risk of bias, consistency of results, directness of evidence, publication bias, and precision of results for each outcome. To summarize our findings on the quality of evidence, we will utilize the GRADE profiler software, which is accessible online. Two review authors (ACPNP and APR) will independently assess the risk of bias, while two other authors (VTC and NCJ) will evaluate the quality of evidence. Any discrepancies in the assessment of bias or evidence quality will be resolved through discussion or, if necessary, by involving a third author (ANA).
We will conduct analyses in accordance with the guidelines set forth by Cochrane and the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group. When applicable, we will utilize Review Manager 5 to conduct meta-analyses for hazard or odds ratios.
We will combine hazard ratios (either unadjusted (crude) or adjusted) or odds ratios along with their corresponding standard errors pertaining to hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and/or respiratory support among adult inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as mortality. This amalgamation will be achieved through the application of the generic inverse variance method utilizing a random-effects model.
In the forthcoming analysis, we intend to combine incidence results pertaining to prognostic factors along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals through the inverse variance method employing a random-effects model. The DerSimonian-Laird estimator for τ2 will be utilized in this process. Data will be adjusted using the Freeman-Tukey double arcosen transformation, and confidence intervals will be computed using the Clopper-Pearson method for individual studies. To conduct a proportion meta-analysis on this data, we will utilize the RStudio© software, incorporating the “meta” package (version 4.9-6) and the “metaprop” function.
For studies lacking HR and its associated standard error (SE), we will rely on the information and outcomes presented in the text, tables, and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves.
We will reach out to the principal investigators of the studies included in our research to request any supplementary data or seek clarification on any issues pertaining to the studies. Should we not receive a response from the authors, we will present the data in a descriptive fashion, refraining from making any assumptions or imputations.
We will utilize the Cochran’s Q test to evaluate the presence of heterogeneity, with a threshold of a P value < 0.1 indicating the presence of heterogeneity. Furthermore, we will evaluate statistical heterogeneity by analyzing the Higgins I2 statistic, adhering to specific thresholds:
With less than 25% heterogeneity observed, the study findings indicate a lack of diversity within the sample population.
In studies where the heterogeneity falls within the range of 25% to 49%, it is considered to be low.
In the range of 50% to 74%, there exists a level of moderate heterogeneity within the data.
In the analysis conducted, it was observed that there was a high level of heterogeneity, specifically exceeding 75%. This indicates a significant variation or diversity within the data set being examined. The presence of such a substantial degree of heterogeneity suggests that the data points or elements being studied are quite different from one another, potentially stemming from various sources or factors. This finding underscores the complexity and diversity inherent in the dataset, highlighting the need for careful consideration and interpretation of the results. The high heterogeneity observed in this study may have implications for the generalizability of the findings or the robustness of the conclusions drawn. It is essential to acknowledge and address this heterogeneity in order to ensure the validity and reliability of the research outcomes.
This rapid literature review aims to systematically assess the most reliable evidence available to identify both the risk and protective factors associated with COVID-19, with the intention of aiding frontline decision-making processes. While some studies (13) have indicated that older adults face a higher risk of experiencing severe outcomes, other research has raised questions regarding potential risk factors such as immune function decline (4), proinflammatory profiles (5), and alterations in angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (4) that may also contribute to worse outcomes. Simultaneously, our review seeks to address the uncertainty surrounding which characteristics could potentially serve as protective factors following exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
To ensure the quality of our results, we will adhere to the recommendations outlined in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews (7). Our intention is to aggregate data for meta-analysis in order to minimize the likelihood of type 2 errors in our comparisons. However, it is important to acknowledge potential limitations in this study, such as the risk of encountering biased studies that may render them unsuitable for clustering or meta-analysis, as well as the inclusion of small sample studies that could hinder our ability to provide precise estimates.
This rapid systematic review is characterized by its transparency, rigorous methods, assessment of evidence quality, and comprehensive, refined searches. These attributes enable us to discern the existing evidence, delineate prognostic factors specific to each disease stage, and furnish crucial insights for clinical decision-making regarding the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has swiftly evolved into a global pandemic with severe consequences.
This systematic review protocol has been developed in accordance with the PRISMA-P guidelines (14).
