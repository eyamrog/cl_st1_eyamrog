Objective: This research aimed to analyze the spatial distribution and investigate potential associations between epidemiological factors and feminicide rates in the municipalities of the State of Sergipe, located in northeastern Brazil.
Methodology: An exploratory ecological study was conducted to examine the global spatial autocorrelation of epidemiological aspects with feminicide rates in municipalities of the State of Sergipe, Brazil (n=75) during the 2013-2017 period. This investigation utilized the "global" and "local" Moran statistic methods, along with a multiple spatial regression analysis, with variables including socioeconomic status, demographic factors, healthcare services, and feminicide rates. The software packages employed for data analysis were Stata 11.0, SPSS 18.0, and GeoDa 0.95-i.
Results: The spatial distribution of femicide rates exhibited non-random patterns, displaying high spatial autocorrelation and a prevalence of significant spatial clusters in municipalities with the highest feminicide mortality rates, primarily concentrated in the central region of Sergipe State. Through multiple regression analysis, it was found that the percentage of women heading families and the Municipal Human Development Index were positively correlated with femicide rates in Sergipe's municipalities during the study period (p < 0.05). Conversely, an inverse relationship was observed between the GINI Index and femicide rates.
Conclusions: This study represents the first analysis of the factors linked to spatial clusters of feminicide rates within a geographical area characterized by a prevailing patriarchal culture. The findings indicate a rise in femicide occurrences in regions characterized by lower social inequality, higher levels of human development, and increased authority held by women within the family setting.
Femicide, as a phenomenon, is deeply entrenched in gender inequality and serves to reinforce the subordinate status of women across legal, social, and economic spheres. Recognized as a grave public health concern, the World Health Organization highlighted this issue over three decades ago.
Brazil ranks 5th globally in femicide, trailing only El Salvador, Colombia, Guatemala, and Russia. The Map of Violence in Brazil (2015) highlighted a concerning trend of increasing female deaths due to aggression from 1980 to 2013, with mortality rates ranging from 2.3 to 4.8 per 100,000 women. This distressing pattern has persisted, as evidenced by the 2019 edition of the Atlas of Violence in Brazil, which reported a surge in 2017 with an average of 13 women murdered daily - totaling 4,936 women killed by aggression, the highest figure since 2007. The period from 2007 to 2017 saw a 30.7% rise in women murdered by aggression, with a 6.3% increase from 2016 to 2017. Notably, the northeastern region of Brazil stood out in 2017 for its alarming rates of femicide, with Rio Grande do Norte (67.4), Ceará (64.0), Pernambuco (62.3), Sergipe (58.9), Bahia (55.3), Alagoas (53.9), Paraíba (33.9), Maranhão (31.9), and Piauí (20.9) reporting high numbers. Among Brazilian states, Sergipe was particularly noteworthy for experiencing a staggering 163.9% increase in femicide rates per 100,000 women between 2017 and 2018.
Despite the implementation of the "Maria da Penha Law" in Brazil, aimed at curbing domestic and family violence against women, female mortality from aggression has more than doubled in the past 30 years. It remains uncertain whether the rise in police reports of femicide signifies an actual increase in cases or a reduction in underreporting, given the law's recent enactment and the potential learning curve for judicial authorities. The ambiguity surrounding the law may have inadvertently allowed for retaliatory actions that tragically culminated in femicide. To address this concerning trend, the "Femicide Law" was introduced to impose stricter measures on perpetrators and enhance the visibility of this issue. By amending Article 121 of the Brazilian Penal Code, femicide is now classified as a heinous crime, marking a significant step towards combating gender-based violence in the country.
Research has indicated a rise in femicides within major Brazilian cities and capitals during the periods of 2007-2009 and 2011-2013, particularly impacting young, impoverished, black, single, and less educated women. Paradoxically, certain studies on femicide have highlighted that women in poverty are disproportionately affected, as they have identified a correlation between poverty and female fatalities. The circumstances surrounding women's homicides vary, adhering to unique social dynamics and specificities inherent to the geographical regions of origin, where gender plays a consistent role.
Moreover, northeastern society, particularly in the state of Sergipe, uniquely preserves provincial customs and traditions, placing significant value on families distinguished by surnames, titles, and economic status, which has left an enduring imprint on the patriarchal history of Northeast Brazil. It is crucial to note that there is mounting evidence indicating a rise in such violence in regions where patriarchal values persist, as these communities tend to uphold strict gender norms, leading to women being subjugated and confined to traditional roles for extended periods, as dictated by the prevailing culture.
In this study, our objective is to examine the co-occurrence of spatial distribution and investigate potential correlations between epidemiological factors and rates of feminicide in the municipalities of Sergipe, a state situated in northeastern Brazil, during the period from 2013 to 2017.
This exploratory ecological study, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Sergipe (CAEE 17504319.0.0000.5546), utilized secondary data from the Sergipe population, readily accessible in Brazilian databases.
Sergipe, the smallest Brazilian state and sixth least populous in the country, spans a geographical area of 21,926.908 km² and is home to a population of 2,068,017 individuals. The state is divided into 8 territories (Agreste Central, Alto Sertão, Baixo São Francisco, Centro Sul, Grande Aracaju, Leste, Médio Sertão, Sul) and comprises 75 municipalities, with the farthest distance from the state capital being approximately 200 km. Sergipe ranks 20th in the national Human Development Index and holds the 4th position in this category among the states of the Northeast. Its capital, Aracaju, serves as a significant social and economic hub, boasting the best development rates and indicators in Sergipe, thus providing prime job and service opportunities. This has led to an influx of residents from the state's interior to the capital. However, over half of Sergipe's municipalities exhibit low Human Development Index and high social vulnerability index, highlighting disparities within the state.
The geographic and spatial data for each municipality in Sergipe, including latitude, longitude, perimeter, area, and location, were sourced from the website of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).
The study's dependent variable was derived from female mortality rates due to aggression, calculated for each municipality in Sergipe from 2013 to 2017. Coefficients were aggregated over five years to mitigate temporal and geographic fluctuations common in events of minor scale. Mortality data related to aggression against women were sourced from the Brazilian Ministry of Health's Mortality Information System, with causes of death categorized according to the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) within the X85 to Y09 range. Population figures for each municipality in Sergipe during the study period were based on the 2010 population census and estimates for inter-census years, obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics website. Femicide rates were computed by dividing mortality data from aggression against women in each municipality in Sergipe by the corresponding total female population figures in those areas.
The independent variables chosen for this study were gathered from various national databases spanning the period of investigation (2013-2017). The averages of the data pertaining to each of these variables were calculated. A detailed description of these variables is provided below:
Socioeconomic status indicators were gathered from various sources. The Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), Income Concentration Index (GINI Index), average household income per capita, percentage of the population earning less than half the minimum wage, percentage of unemployed individuals, and the proportion of female-headed households were sourced from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics website. Additionally, the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was acquired from the Institute of Applied Economic Research.
Demographic characteristics were obtained from the IBGE website, including the proportions of civil and/or religious marriages, Catholics, Evangelicals, individuals without religious affiliation, urban residents, and rural inhabitants.
The study examined various indicators related to services and health status in Brazil, including the percentage of the population covered by the Unified Health System, mortality rates from Human Immunodeficiency Virus, maternal mortality rates, and cervical cancer mortality rates. Data for these indicators were obtained from the Health Information System websites of the Brazilian Ministry of Health.
Univariate exploratory analysis of spatial data was conducted to examine the global spatial autocorrelation of femicide rates in Sergipe's municipalities using the Moran I index, assuming normality and randomization. The Moran index values range from -1.0 to +1.0, assessing whether neighboring areas exhibit more similarity in the studied indicator than would be anticipated in a random distribution. Therefore, the Moran I index quantifies the proximity of objects in comparison to other nearby objects, categorizing the results as positive, negative, or lacking spatial autocorrelation.
In this study, the variables were categorized into three blocks to collectively evaluate the indicators linked to femicide through Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). The correlation matrix was utilized to determine the direction and strength of the relationships among the independent variables within the following groups: 1) socioeconomic status; 2) demographic status; and 3) services and health status. To facilitate the analysis, all variables were standardized with a mean of zero (0.0) and a standard deviation of one (1.0) owing to their diverse dimensions, which could otherwise hinder their incorporation and comprehension within the model.
In the final analysis phase, multiple spatial regression was conducted. The quality of the spatial regression model was found to be comparable to that of the traditional linear regression model, as confirmed through residual analysis and the Moran I index 22. Various criteria were employed to determine the inclusion or exclusion of variables in the model: 1) Selection of the variable with the highest statistical correlation; 2) Inclusion of variables that, when collectively analyzed, exhibited a higher F value in simple regression analysis; Variables from the same block could still be included as "adjustment variables" irrespective of their association. 3) Incorporation of variables that, when subjected to partial correlation controlled by modeled variables, displayed significant correlation with the dependent variable. The final model's exclusion criteria for variables were set at a p-value of ≥0.05. The software utilized for this analysis included Stata 11.0, SPSS 18.0, and GeoDa 0.95-i.
The standardized average mortality rate of 26.80 deaths per 100,000 women was observed in Sergipe's municipalities. The spatial distribution of femicide rates is depicted in Figure 1, revealing that the highest rates were concentrated in Sergipe's regions, namely Grande Aracaju (45.54 deaths per 100,000 women), Sul (32.97 deaths per 100,000 women), Agreste Central (32.44 deaths per 100,000 women), Médio Sertão (27.37 deaths per 100,000 women), Centro Sul (26.39 deaths per 100,000 women), Baixo São Francisco (17.59 deaths per 100,000 women), Alto Sertão (16.79 deaths per 100,000 women), and Leste (16.04 deaths per 100,000 women), respectively. Among the 75 municipalities in Sergipe, the capital city of Aracaju ranks 37th in terms of femicide rates.
The distribution of femicide rates did not exhibit randomness, showing positive spatial autocorrelation (I=0.0993881; p-value = 0.001 for 999 permutations). Spatial autocorrelations of the "high-high" type were evident, indicating a clustering of municipalities in Sergipe with the highest feminicide rates situated in the central region (Areia Branca, Malhador, Santa Rosa de Lima, Ribeirópolis), while the "low-low" type represented municipalities with the lowest rates (Nossa Senhora de Lourdes, Propriá, São Francisco, Japaratuba) (Fig. 2). Additionally, spatial autocorrelations of the "low-high" type were observed in Maruim, suggesting low femicide rates within the municipality but high rates in neighboring areas (Fig. 2). Conversely, Lagarto, Aquidabã, and Carmópolis exhibited spatial autocorrelations of the “high-low” type, indicating high femicide rates within these municipalities but low rates in surrounding areas (Fig. 2).
Figure 3, Moran Local's Statistics I, holds significant importance for the analysis as it indicates the level of significance within specific groups. Utilizing the Local Space Association Indicator (LISA), the research highlights Santa Rosa de Lima and Aquidabã as the municipalities with the highest femicide rates. The analysis further reveals notable LISA sector clusters, underscoring the significance of this indicator during the period under review. This suggests the presence of positive multidirectional externalities concerning femicide rates across various municipalities in the State of Sergipe.
In the bivariate analysis (Table 1), it was found that the percentage of unemployed individuals and the percentage of women heads of families (matriarchy) exhibited a statistically significant positive correlation with the rates of femicide (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Additionally, negative significant correlations were observed between the proportion of the population earning less than half the minimum wage and feminicide rates (p < 0.05).
Table 2 presents the outcomes of the ultimate spatial regression analysis model. It was observed that the proportion of women heading families (matriarchy) and the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) exhibited a positive correlation with the femicide rates in Sergipe's municipalities from 2013 to 2017 (p <0.05). Conversely, an inverse relationship was noted between the Income Concentration Index (GINI Index) and the femicide rates within the same municipalities during the specified period.
This study acknowledges limitations stemming from the methodology employed. The potential for ecological fallacy remains a concern, as an association identified at an aggregate level may not necessarily hold true at an individual level. Additionally, the low construct validity is a possibility, given that not all explanatory outcomes of the variables may have been encompassed in the methodology. To mitigate some of these limitations, the study utilized variables sourced from various national databases, which may introduce variations in quality due to the reliance on indirect estimates.
The findings of the current study reveal a significant disparity in the incidence rates of femicide per 100,000 women across the municipalities of Sergipe during the period under investigation, with standardized rates ranging from 11.74 deaths/100,000 women to 87.80 deaths/100,000 women (see Figure 1). To address variations in population distribution by gender and potential confounding effects on femicide rates in Sergipe's municipalities, the study employed the direct standardization method for these rates. This approach was necessary due to the possibility of fluctuations in the female population relative to the male population in certain areas. While using a proxy variable for feminicide in identifying women's deaths from aggression may lead to an overestimation of this phenomenon, it is important to note that there is an expected 24% underreporting of deaths in the Northeast region of Brazil. This underreporting could potentially offset any inaccuracies resulting from underreporting or ambiguities in diagnosing the cause of death related to female aggression.
There was a notable prevalence of significant spatial clusters of femicide rates in the central Sergipe region, as depicted in Figure 2, a pattern further confirmed by Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis shown in Figure 3. While studies indicate the potential existence of a distinctive context in the central region of Sergipe, spatial dependence on femicide rates across the municipalities of Sergipe in 2017 was not identified. Despite this, the research of Grana and Meneghel & Portella suggests a higher incidence of femicide in urban agglomerations and cities with greater population density. The landscape of feminicides is known to be multifaceted, reflecting unique geographical contexts intertwined with gender dynamics. Notably, there is a surge in femicide in areas characterized by a prevailing patriarchal culture, a deeply ingrained aspect of Sergipe society. This observation is underscored by the spatial autocorrelations of the "high-high" type within municipal clusters in Sergipe, where livestock activities dominate, reinforcing traditional male gender roles that emphasize qualities like courage, strength, and virility, extending these norms to gender relations and daily interactions. Similar circumstances are mirrored in other Brazilian regions with comparable economic structures and enduring patriarchal values, perpetuating the subordination of women to men.
In the context of multiple spatial regression analysis, the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) exhibited a direct correlation with femicide rates, highlighting a notable contradiction wherein regions with higher human development indices experienced increased incidences of femicide. This finding stands in contrast to prior research, which has suggested an inverse association between feminicide rates and both economic development and overall quality of life within a population.
The GINI index, used to measure income concentration, revealed an inverse relationship with femicide rates in the final spatial model, indicating that regions with lower social inequality exhibit higher rates of femicide. This finding contradicts the results of Leite et al. (2017), who reported a direct correlation between social inequality and femicide rates. However, the study also highlighted regional exceptions, such as in Espírito Santo State, where despite better inequality indicators, high rates of female mortality due to aggression were observed compared to other Brazilian States. It is crucial to emphasize that while socioeconomic factors are linked to femicide, the underlying causes of violence extend beyond poverty and inequality. This underscores the complex nature of violence against women, influenced by a combination of individual, relational, social, cultural, and environmental factors.
The presence of a matriarchy in Sergipe's municipalities during the studied period was found to be significantly correlated with higher rates of femicide. This indicates that shifts in traditional gender roles can potentially lead to conflicts as they challenge the prevailing patriarchal norms within society. Consequently, the attainment of women's socioeconomic autonomy in patriarchal settings has the capacity to disrupt traditional gender dynamics, thereby heightening the vulnerability to feminicide.
In this context, it is evident that feminicide is intricately linked to socioeconomic conditions, yet its multifaceted nature stems from a complex interplay of individual, relational, social, cultural, and environmental factors. Gender inequality serves as the foundational root of feminicide, manifesting in various contexts that adhere to unique social dynamics specific to the geographical origins of the phenomenon.
This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to spatial clusters of femicide within a geographic region characterized by a prevailing patriarchal culture. Despite Brazil having implemented public policies to address femicide for over a decade, our research reveals a starkly uneven distribution of femicide rates, directly correlated with human development and matriarchy, and inversely linked to income concentration. These results underscore the multifaceted nature of violence against women, stemming from a complex interplay of individual, relational, social, cultural, and environmental factors. Further investigations are crucial to uncover the underlying factors driving the high rates of femicide in the municipalities of Sergipe. It is imperative to consider a localized approach in redirecting Brazilian public policies to combat femicide, recognizing that feminicide is deeply rooted in gender inequality and influenced by diverse social dynamics and geographical peculiarities.
