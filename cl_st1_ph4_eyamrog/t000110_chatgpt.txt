The current study focuses on the floristic survey and distribution of diatoms found in two sediment cores from the Xingu River in Pará State, northern Brazil, spanning approximately 6,000 calibrated years before present. A total of thirty-eight taxa belonging to twenty genera were identified, with five taxa being new records for Brazil and nineteen new for the Brazilian Amazon. The genus Gomphonema Ehrenberg was the most prominent, comprising six species. These new findings represent a significant 75% increase in the total number of diatom records for the Brazilian Amazon, indicating both the region's underexplored nature and the potential underestimation of its biodiversity. This underscores the importance of utilizing paleolimnology as a valuable tool for biodiversity assessment, particularly in areas where human impacts may threaten the pristine conditions of the environment.
The Holocene represents the most recent epoch in Earth's history, extending to the present day. Alongside the Pleistocene series, it constitutes the Quaternary period and is arguably one of the most extensively researched periods in recent geological history (Suguio, 1999). Despite its brevity as a geological period, sedimentary records from the Holocene are remarkably well-preserved, facilitating comparisons with contemporary data and processes (Walker & Geissman, 2009).
Paleolimnological studies have proven to be a valuable tool for reconstructing environmental biodiversity and floristic changes, as evidenced by research conducted by Smol (2008), Bennion and Simpson (2011), Davidson and Jeppesen (2013), and Wengrat et al. (2018). Additionally, past environmental communities often serve as the sole source of information when investigating biodiversity before human impacts, as highlighted in studies by Smol (2002) and Le Treut et al. (2007).
Diatoms are extensively utilized within biological groups preserved in sediments due to their taxonomic distinctiveness, abundance, preservation in sediments, and rapid responsiveness to environmental changes (Reid, 2005; Bennion & Simpson, 2011). Nevertheless, employing diatoms for environmental change indication necessitates a high level of taxonomic precision (Birks, 1994) as misidentifications could alter interpretations and compromise the reliability of data concerning modern diatom biodiversity (Buczko & Magyari, 2007; Wetzel & Ector, 2014).
In Brazil, research on the floristic and taxonomical aspects of sedimentary diatoms over an extended period remains limited. Presently, only four significant contributions exist in this area. These include a floristic survey and an analysis of the spatial-temporal distribution of diatoms from surface sediments and core samples (approximately 90 years) taken from an urban reservoir in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (Faustino et al., 2016). Another study focused on water level fluctuations by examining the abundance and distribution of two diatoms in core samples spanning around 830 years from a marsh situated on Mutum Island within the Upper Parana river floodplain (Ruwer & Rodrigues, 2018). Additionally, a study aimed to reconstruct paleoenvironments of the lacustrine Pinguela-Palmital-Malvas system during the Holocene period (Hermany et al., 2013), and another study sought to understand paleoecological and paleohydrological changes by analyzing five sedimentary cores from Itupanema Beach in Pará State (Ribeiro et al., 2010).
The current study documents the floristic survey and diatom distribution spanning approximately 6,000 years from two sediment cores retrieved from the Xingu River in Pará State, Brazil. The Amazon Basin, encompassing around 40% of the national territory and hosting over 60% of the country's water resources (PNRH 2006), occupies a significant portion of South America, covering 5% of the Earth's surface with an expansive area of about 7 million km². As the largest drainage basin globally, the Amazon Basin plays a crucial role in preserving biodiversity (Wetzel et al. 2011). In this context, the study aims to enhance understanding of tropical diatom biodiversity prior to human interventions, shedding light on its richness by presenting novel records for Brazil and the Brazilian Amazon region.
The Xingu River basin, a prominent eastern Amazonian river system (Figure 1a), covers an area of 531,250 km² and maintains an average flow ranging between 2,582 and 9,700 m3 s-1. The climate in this region is tropical, characterized by an average temperature fluctuating between 25 ºC and 27 ºC (ISA 2012). Notably, the downstream stretch of the Xingu River is renowned for its distinctive river course and diverse morphology, recognized as the Volta Grande do Xingu (Xingu Great Bend, Figure 1c). As it nears the mouth, the river transforms into a lowland Amazonian river featuring a single slack water channel influenced by tides (Sawakuchi et al. 2015). For the purposes of this study, samples were gathered from the lower Xingu River, specifically from a floodplain lake situated at 3°12’51.24”S, 52°11’24.25”W on Arapujá Island (within the Volta Grande do Xingu), as well as from a Ria area at 01°42’32.12”S, 52°16’47.42”W in close proximity to Porto de Moz city.
During the dry season of 2014, divers retrieved cores from a deep zone at both sites, chosen based on water depth profiles and riverbed sediment sampling. Specifically, a 122 cm core (XC1-02) was collected from Arapujá island, and a 362 cm core (XC-03) from the Ria, using a 6 m long PVC tube sectioned at 2 cm intervals. Core chronology was established through Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and 14C dating methods. Quartz OSL dating involved two samples processed at the Luminescence and Gamma Spectrometry Laboratory of the Instituto de Geociências at the Universidade de São Paulo, while four samples underwent 14C dating at the Analytic Radiocarbon Dating in Miami and the Radiocarbon Laboratory at the Universidade Federal Fluminense (LAC-UFF). For further information, refer to Sawakuchi et al. (2015). The OSL and 14C dating results indicated that the base of the XC1-02 and XC-03 cores corresponded to approximately ~6,000 cal yr BP and 4,000 cal yr BP, respectively, marking the transition from the Mid-Holocene to the Late Holocene period.
For diatom analyses, organic matter was oxidized using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 35%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl 37%) following standard procedures (Battarbee et al., 2001). Permanent slides were prepared with Naphrax (R.I. 1.6) as the mounting medium, and optical observations, measurements, and photomicrographs were captured at 1,000× magnification using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus microscope equipped with an Axiocam ERc5s high-resolution digital camera. A minimum of 400 valves per slide were enumerated (Battarbee et al., 2001). Species abundance was determined by dividing the count of individual species by the total count, expressed as percentages for each slide (subsample). Taxonomy and nomenclature adhered to specific publications (e.g., Lange-Bertalot, 1993; Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot, 1998; Morales & Manoylov, 2006; Garcia, 2010; Lange-Bertalot et al., 2011; Reichardt, 2015; Almeida et al., 2015; Tyree & Vaccarino, 2016; Costa et al., 2017b; Bartozek et al., 2018) and the valid names in the online catalog by Fourtanier & Kociolek (2011). Classification systems followed Medlin & Kaczmarska (2004) for supra-ordinal taxa and Round et al. (1990) for subordinal taxa, with exceptions made for genera published post-1990. New records for Brazil and the Brazilian Amazon (Amazons, Amapá, Mato Grosso, western Maranhão, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Acre, and Tocantins States) were identified after consulting relevant literature. Additionally, morphometric data for the new records (M: valve mantle, D: diameter, L: length, W: width, L/W: length/width ratio, S: striae, A: areolae, and F: fibulae) were provided. Sediment samples are housed at the "Herbário Científico do Estado Maria Eneyda P. Kauffmann Fidalgo" (SP) in São Paulo, Brazil, with access numbers SP470331 to SP513834.
The diatom flora of the Xingu River over the past approximately 6,000 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP) comprises a total of 38 taxa, consisting of 30 species and varieties, along with eight taxa identified at the genus level, spread across 20 genera. Among these, eight taxa were only classified at the genus level due to the absence of similar taxa in existing literature, suggesting they may be novel taxonomic entities. Taxa denoted by a single asterisk denote new records for the Brazilian Amazon region, while those marked with two asterisks represent the first documented citations for Brazil. The complete list of all aforementioned taxa is provided below.
The species under study exhibits distinct characteristics from Aulacoseira canadensis (Hustedt) Simonsen (1979: 57), particularly in the robust and solid nature of the ringleist located at the center of the column. Additionally, a notable disparity lies in the small and rounded outline of the areolae, a feature unique to Aulacoseira crassipunctata Krammer (Bahls et al. 2009). Encountered in a mere 2% of the core samples, with a peak abundance of 6%, this species is traced back to the Late Holocene period, spanning from approximately 2,200 cal. yr BP to around 320 cal. yr BP. Notably, this marks the initial documentation of the species' presence in Brazil.
Valves are linear-lanceolate, hyaline, with rounded ends, and the axial area is wide, occupying the entire valve face. Striae are not observed in LM. This taxon bears resemblance to Rimoneis inanis M. Garcia (2010) in terms of valve shape, although its valve ends are more pronounced and less rounded. Additionally, Rimoneis sp. exhibits smaller valve dimensions compared to R. inanis (L: 17-25 µm, W: 2.7-3.3 µm). Currently, the genus Rimoneis is represented by only two species worldwide, with R. inanis being confined to freshwater/brackish waters in sandy beaches of the Lagoa dos Patos lagoon and Guaíba river in Southern Brazil. Rimoneis sp. was found in 5% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 4%. It is present in samples dating from the Late Holocene, approximately 3,750 cal. yr BP to 1,450 cal. yr BP.
The population discovered bears a resemblance to Staurosira construens Ehrenberg (1843) in terms of its valve outline, yet it distinguishes itself by exhibiting narrower ends. Staurosira sp. was detected in 82% of the core samples, with a peak abundance of 24%. This species is evident in samples dating from the conclusion of the Mid-Holocene, approximately 6,000 calibrated years before present, up to the uppermost section of the core.
The species S. acidophila was initially proposed by Almeida et al. (2015) based on specimens collected from the Cachoeira da Graça Reservoir in São Paulo state. According to the authors, S. acidophila bears resemblance to Staurosirella confusa E.A. Morales (2005: 54-58), albeit with discernible differences in the organization and density of the striae, approximately 11 in 10 µm. Furthermore, this species can be distinguished from Staurosirella oldenburgiana (Hustedt) E.A. Morales (2005: 118) by the width of the valve center and the presence of minute areolae. In core samples, S. acidophila was identified in 52% of cases, with a maximum abundance of 4%.
The species is detected in samples dating back to the end of the Mid-Holocene, approximately 6,000 calibrated years before present, extending up to the core top. This study marks the initial documentation of this species' presence in the Brazilian Amazon region.
The species identified in this study was determined to be Staurosirella cf. acutirostrata (Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot) Almeida & Wetzel (2015: 267) based on its less tapered extremities and shorter valve length (L: 22-36 µm) compared to those described in Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 89, pl. 1, fig. 18-19, pl. 2). This species was found in 48% of all core samples, with a maximum abundance of 4.3%. It was observed in samples collected towards the end of the Mid-Holocene, dating back to approximately 5,760 calibrated years before present up to the core top.
Staurosirella dubia (Grunow) E.A.Morales & K.M.Manoylov exhibits a valve outline similar to that of Staurosirella pinnata (Ehrenberg) D.M.Williams & Round (1988: 274), with notable distinctions. S. dubia showcases larger valves, displaying a lanceolate valve outline in larger specimens and an elliptical shape in smaller ones, along with wider striae (Morales 2010). This species was identified in 56% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 6%. Its presence was noted in samples dating from the end of the Mid-Holocene (~6.000 cal. yr BP) up to the core top. This survey marks the initial documentation of S. dubia in the Brazilian Amazon region.
The current species bears a resemblance to S. dubia (Grunow) Morales & Manoylov; however, as noted by the authors, S. subcapitata (Frenguelli) E.A. Morales exhibits valves that are less lanceolate and silicified compared to the former. It was present in 98% of all core samples, reaching a maximum abundance of 15%. S. subcapitata was consistently identified in all subsamples from the Late Holocene (~4,000 cal. yr BP) to the core top (~300 cal. yr BP). While this species has been previously reported in the Brazilian Amazon, specifically in the Negro River (Wetzel 2011), this study marks the first published citation for the Brazilian Amazon region.
Costa et al. (2017b) noted that the type material of Eunotia camelus Ehrenberg, as illustrated in Reichardt (1995), consisted of a population comprising two distinct species, leading to potential confusion in species classification. In southeastern Brazil, the majority of populations identified as E. camelus are, in fact, Eunotia longicamelus L.F.Costa, D.C.Bicudo & C.E.Wetzel. This species was present in 15% of core samples, with a maximum abundance of 3%. Its presence spans from samples dating back to the early Late Holocene (~1.514 cal. yr BP) up to the core top.
Eunotia longicamelus L.F.Costa, D.C.Bicudo & C.E.Wetzel was formally described by Costa et al. (2017b) based on specimens collected from the Ponte Nova Reservoir in Southeastern Brazil. While often confused with E. camelus Ehrenberg, E. longicamelus can be distinguished by its narrower valves, dorsal margin featuring two or four prominent undulations, and less concave ventral margin (Costa et al. 2017b). This species was found in 11% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 2.5%, and has been present since the end of the Mid-Holocene, approximately from ~5.192 cal. yr BP to the present core top. Notably, this study marks the first documented occurrence of E. longicamelus in the Brazilian Amazon region.
This variety bears resemblance to Eunotia rabenhorstii Cleve & Grunow var. triodon Cleve & Grunow (1881: 12a), yet its distinguishing feature of a single undulation on the dorsal margin sets it apart as unique to var. monodon Cleve & Grunow (Patrick & Reimer 1966, Costa et al. 2017b). The species, though scarce, was identified in merely 2% of the core samples, with a peak abundance of 1%. Its presence was noted in samples dating back to the Late Holocene (~408 cal. yr BP), marking the initial documentation of var. monodon in the Brazilian Amazon region.
Eunotia superbidens Lange-Bertalot closely resembles Eunotia praerupta Ehrenberg (1843: 414) in terms of size, but distinguishes itself through the presence of a single undulation on the dorsal margin and a higher striae density. Furthermore, it deviates from Eunotia bigibba Kützing (1849: 6) primarily due to its more pronounced undulations and larger valves. This species exhibited low occurrence rates in the current study, appearing in only 2% of the core samples with a maximum abundance of 1%. Its presence was noted in samples dating back to the Late Holocene (~1.514 cal. yr BP), marking the first documented instance of its existence in the Brazilian Amazon region.
Eunotia sp. bears a resemblance to Eunotia myrmica Lange-Bertalot (2011), although the latter is distinguished by its narrower and cuneate apices, along with smaller valve dimensions (Pavlov & Levkov 2013: L: 58.8-67 µm). This taxon was infrequently sighted, appearing in only 2% of the core samples and attaining a maximum abundance of 1%. Its presence is noted in samples dating back to the Late Holocene (~811 cal. yr BP).
The present species bears a resemblance to Placoneis constans (Husted) Cox var. symmetrica (Hustedt) Kobayasi in terms of its valves and rostrate ends. However, P. exigua distinguishes itself by possessing larger valves compared to P. constans and displaying a central area with shorter striae surrounded by longer striae (Bartozek et al., 2018). This species was identified in 6% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 1.5%. It has been observed in samples ranging from the end of the Mid-Holocene to the core top, spanning approximately 5.479 calibrated years BP to the present day.
The species was detected in 21% of the core samples examined, with a maximum abundance of 2.5%. Its presence spans from the end of the Mid-Holocene to the core top, approximately from 5.479 cal. yr BP to the present day. This study marks the initial documentation of this species in the Brazilian Amazon region.
Based on the valve outline, Gomphonema acuminatum C.G.Ehrenberg exhibits striking similarities to Gomphonema brebissonii F.T.Kützing (1849: 66) and Gomphonema coronatum C.G.Ehrenberg (1841: 211). However, G. brebissoni displays a notably reduced apical inflation, while G. coronatum showcases a smaller inflation near the headpole (Kociolek 2011). The occurrence of G. acuminatum was infrequent, as it was only present in 2% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 1%. This species was identified in samples ranging from the Late Holocene to the core top (~1.757 cal. yr BP to the present day). This study marks the initial documentation of G. acuminatum in the Brazilian Amazon region.
The dimensions of Gomphonema brasiliensoides Metzeltin, Lange-Bertalot & García-Rodriguez exceed those of Gomphonema brasiliense Grunow (Metzeltin et al. 2005: L: 24.0-60.0 μm, W: 6.6-9 μm and L: 22.0-44.0 μm, W: 5.5-6.7 μm; respectively). This species was detected in 13% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 2%. Its presence spans from the end of the Mid-Holocene to the core top (~3.774 cal. yr BP to the present day). This study marks the initial documentation of this species in the Brazilian Amazon region.
Distinguished from Gomphonema hawaiiense Reichardt (2005: 119) by its smaller valve dimensions (L: 24.5-34.0 µm; W: 4.5-6.0 µm and L: 32.6-55.0 μm; W:6.3-9.5 μm respectively) and curved subcapitate apices, the taxon was identified in 5% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 1%. This particular species was detected in samples dating back to the end of the Mid-Holocene (~4.345 cal. yr BP), marking the initial documentation of its presence in the Brazilian Amazon region.
Gomphonema pseudosphaerophorum H. Kobayasi exhibits slightly narrower valves compared to Gomphonema sphaerophorum Ehrenberg (1845: 78, Tyree & Vaccarino 2016: W: 8.1-9.4 µm and W: 12.8-13.2 µm, respectively). Furthermore, G. pseudosphaerophorum showcases dimly punctate striae radiating across the valve, while G. sphaerophorum displays nearly parallel striae at the mid-valve, transitioning to a radiate pattern towards the apices. The presence of representative specimens of this species was infrequent, detected in only 2% of the core samples with a maximum abundance of 1%. These specimens were identified in samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~456 cal. yr BP), marking the first documented occurrence of this species in Brazil in the current study.
Valves are lanceolate to rhombic-lanceolate with rostrate apices, a narrow axial area that is linear and slightly widened in the central region. The raphe is slightly curved, and the striae are parallel, slightly radiating towards the ends, with the stigma positioned at the end of the longest central striae. This taxon shares morphological similarities with Gomphonema naviculoides W.Smith in terms of valve shape, but differs in valve dimensions and striae density. According to Reichardt (2015), G. naviculoides typically measures 35-45 µm in length, 7.8-9.5 µm in width, with 12-14 striae in 10 µm. Due to the lack of ultrastructural details (SEM), we have chosen to classify Gomphonema sp. as a distinct taxon. It was found in 8% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 2.3%. This taxon is present during the Late Holocene from approximately 1.322 cal. yr BP.
The species initially described as Achnanthes exigua by Grunow (1880: 21) was later reclassified as Achnanthidium exiguum by Czarnecki (1994: 157). However, Taylor et al. (2014) noted significant morphological differences between the type of A. exiguum and other Achnanthidium species, indicating that the transfer based on raphe structure was erroneous. Kulikovskiy et al. (2020) subsequently reassigned the species to Gogorevia based on distinctive features such as a sigmoid raphe, uniseriate striae, and valve shape. Present in 5% of core samples with a maximum abundance of 1.5%, this species was identified in the Late Holocene (~1.514 cal. yr BP). While previously reported in the Brazilian Amazon's Negro River as Achnanthidium exiguum (Grunow) Czarnecki, this study marks the first accurate record of the species in the country under its correct name.
The species initially described by Hustedt (1952: 392, fig. 99-100) as Cocconeis pulcherrima was later reclassified as Achnanthes pulcherrima by Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 18, pl. 69, fig. 9-14, pl. 70, fig. 1, 4, p. 366, pl. 66, fig. 1-9). However, this reclassification was deemed invalid due to the absence of the basionym reference (Coste et al. 2010). Subsequently, the species was reassigned to Planothidium by Coste et al. (2010) based on the presence of a cavum, a distinctive feature within the genus. Its occurrence was limited, appearing in only 2% of core samples with a maximum abundance of 1%. These samples were dated to the end of the Mid-Holocene (~5.479 cal. yr BP). This marks the first documented instance of this species in Brazil under its correct nomenclature and the initial mention of its presence in the Brazilian Amazon region.
The material under investigation is identified as Achnanthes cf. inflata (Kützing) Grunow, distinguished by slightly less rounded ends in comparison to Grunow's (1868) original description. Nevertheless, other morphological features align with Grunow's (1868) account. Notably, our specimens exhibit wider valve ends than Achnanthes inflata var. elata (Leuduger-Fortmorel) Hustedt (1937: 206) and differ from Achnanthes coarctata (Brébisson ex W.Smith) Grunow (1880: 20) due to the presence of a central inflation at the valve margin and lack of constriction as seen in the latter. This species was detected in only 2% of the core samples, with a peak abundance of 1% in samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~625 cal. yr BP), marking the first documented occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon.
The species under investigation bears a resemblance to Luticola acidoclinata Lange-Bertalot (1996) in terms of its valve outline and dimensions, with a length ranging from 10 to 30 μm and a width between 5.0 and 8.5 μm. However, Luticola intermedia (Hustedt) Levkov, Meltzeltin & A.Palov displays a distinct narrow and linear axial area, featuring 4-5 isolated areolae at the valve margin as described by Levkov et al. (2013). This species was detected in a mere 3% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 1%. Its presence was noted in samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~689 cal. yr BP), marking the first documented occurrence of this species in the Brazilian Amazon region.
Caloneis sp. closely resembles Caloneis sp. Nº. 163/14 as described in Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 560, pl. 163, fig. 14); however, the specimens from the Xingu River exhibit slightly panduriform valves. Further investigations are necessary to ascertain whether this taxon represents a novel species. Within the scope of this study, the taxon was identified in 11% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 2.5%, predominantly in samples corresponding to the conclusion of the Mid-Holocene period (~5.192 cal. yr BP).
The population of Diploneis elliptica (Kützing) Cleve var. elliptica exhibited valve morphology and striae density akin to those depicted by Krammer & Lange-Bertalot (1986: fig. 108: 1-4). Nevertheless, specimens from the Xingu River analyzed were smaller than the species' described range (L: 20-130 μm). This species was found in 2.6% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 3%. D. elliptica var. elliptica was identified in samples dating back to the Late Holocene (~1,730 to 560 cal. yr BP), marking the first record of its presence in the Brazilian Amazon.
In terms of valve shape, Navicula notha Wallace bears resemblance to Navicula cryptocephala Kützing (1844: 95), yet distinguishes itself by possessing smaller valves, featuring an inconspicuous central area in the smaller specimens, and adopting a rhombic shape in the larger ones (Potapova, 2011). This species was identified in merely 3% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 1.3%. Its presence was noted in samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~2.909 cal. yr BP), marking the initial documentation of its occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon.
Sellaphora emilia Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot, a member of the bacillum group within the Sellaphora genus (Mann et al., 2008), distinguishes itself from Sellaphora renata Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot by its valves featuring consistently straight margins, less broadly rounded ends, and smaller dimensions (2007: L: 45.0-124.0 µm, W: 12.0-14.0 µm and L: 45.0-140.0 µm, W: 15.0-21.0 µm; respectively). This species was detected in a mere 2% of core samples, with a maximum abundance of 1%. Its presence was noted in samples dating back to the Late Holocene (~1.757 cal. yr BP), marking the first documented occurrence of this species in Brazil in the current study.
This species, classified within the "pupula" group of Sellaphora, distinguishes itself from Sellaphora pupula (Kützing) Mereschkovsky (1902: 187) due to its linear elliptical valves with broadly rounded poles (Mann et al. 2008). It was found in 35% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 6%. The species was identified in samples ranging from the end of the Mid-Holocene to the core top (~6,000 cal. yr BP to the present day). This study marks the first documentation of this species in the Brazilian Amazon.
Based on the valve outline, Sellaphora renata Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot bears a striking resemblance to Sellaphora lambda (Cleve) Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 206). However, S. renata lacks the marginal spines that are present in S. lambda (Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 2007). This particular species was discovered in 5% of the core samples and exhibited a maximum abundance of 1.5%. Its presence was noted in samples corresponding to the early Late Holocene, approximately around 1.322 cal. yr BP.
According to Wetzel et al. (2015), Naviculadicta sassiana Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998) was initially described in the Amazonian region, specifically the Tapajós river in Brazil, and subsequently reclassified as Sellaphora based on the light microscopy (LM) illustrations provided in Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998). Sellaphora sassiana was identified in 5% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 9.6%. This species was found in samples dating back to the Late Holocene period (~408 cal. yr BP). While Naviculadicta sassiana had been previously documented in Brazil, specifically in the Tapajós river (e.g., Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 1998), this study marks the first official report for the country under its correct taxonomic designation.
In a review of various Sellaphora materials, Mann et al. (2004) noted that Sellaphora ventraloconfusa (Lange-Bertalot) Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot should be classified within the Sellaphora seminulum (Grunow) D.G.Mann group, yet the available information remains insufficient for definitive confirmation. This particular species was identified in just 2% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 1%. Its presence was observed in samples dating back to the Late Holocene (~408 cal. yr BP). This ongoing investigation represents the initial documentation of this species within the Brazilian Amazon region.
Lacuneolimna novagallia Tudesque & Le Cohu can be distinguished from Lacuneolimna zalokariae Tudesque & Le Cohu (2015: 21) by its continuous depressions in the valve face, wider costae, and a more expanded "cross-bar network" as noted by Tudesque et al. (2015). It was found in 0.6% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance reaching 2%. The species was identified in samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~1.790 cal. yr BP), marking the first documented presence of this species in Brazil.
In this study, the taxon was identified as Pinnularia cf. liyanlingae due to the smaller dimensions of the specimens compared to those outlined by Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (2007, L: 94-200 µm, W: 24-32 µm). This taxon was present in 15% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 1.5%. It was detected in samples ranging from the early Late Holocene to the core top (~1.322 cal. yr BP to the present day).
This taxon bears resemblance to Stauroneis sylviabonillae Metzeltin, Lange-Bertalot & García-Rodríguez in terms of its lanceolate valve shape; however, Stauroneis sp. features smaller valve dimensions and a higher striae density compared to those outlined by Metzeltin et al. (2005: L:103-120 µm, W:20-22 µm, S:15-16 in 10µm). Additionally, S. sylviabonillae exhibits slightly deflected proximal raphe fissures, a characteristic not observed in Stauroneis sp. The material examined also distinguishes itself from Stauroneis anceps Ehrenberg (1843: 291-445 105) due to its narrow, rostrate, and elongated apices (Bahls 2011). In the current investigation, Stauroneis sp.1 was identified in 5% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 2%. Its presence was noted in samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~2.909 cal. yr BP).
This material bears resemblance to Stauroneis schinzii (Brun) Cleve (1894: 146); however, the latter exhibits broadly rounded valve apices and larger cell dimensions (Patrick & Reimer 1966: L: 130-221 µm, W: 17-19 µm, S: 15-18 in 10 µm) compared to Stauroneis sp.1. The latter material is distinguished by its linear valves, obtusely rounded subrostrate apices, a broad linear slightly irregular axial area that transitions abruptly to an ovoid shape at the terminal ends, a relatively small fascia that slightly widens towards the margin, a broad raphe that tapers near the proximal and distal ends, branched distal raphe ends forming semicircular hooks bending in the same direction, and radiate striae at the valve center that converge towards the ends. It is found in 35% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 2.6%. This taxon was identified in samples ranging from the end of the Mid-Holocene to the core top (~5.760 cal. yr BP to present).
Nitzschia pusilluhasta E.A. Lehmkuhl & C.E.M. Bicudo can be distinguished from Nitzschia amphibia Grunow (1862: 574) by its lanceolate valves with slightly protracted ends and a gap between the central fibulae (Lehmkuhl et al. 2019: 25-26). While it may be mistakenly identified as Nitzschia semirobusta Lange-Bertalot (1993: 149), N. pusilluhasta exhibits larger valve dimensions and rectangular, short to slightly extended fibulae. This species was found in 0.6% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 3%. In this study, N. pusilluhasta was detected in samples dating back to the Late Holocene (~2,400 cal. yr BP), marking the first documented occurrence of this species in the Amazon basin.
Surirella sp. shares similarities with Surirella terryi D.B.Ward ex W.A.Terry (1907: 127) in terms of its heteropolar valves and cuneate valve apices. However, the latter species exhibits a more prominent central area along the apical axis and larger valve dimensions (Ferreira & Bicudo 2017: L: 67-176 μm, W: 23-35 μm). This species is further distinguished by its asymmetric linear valves with a rounded headpole and cuneate footpole, a narrow hyaline axial area, absence of costae and visible fibulae, as well as low keel and alar canals that run parallel to each other. Found in 5% of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 1%, this taxon was identified in samples dating back to the Late Holocene (~973 cal. yr BP).
Throughout the study period of approximately 6,000 calibrated years before present, a total of 38 taxa belonging to 20 genera were documented. Additionally, this research contributed five new records of diatom species for Brazil and nineteen new records specifically for the Brazilian Amazon region.
Gomphonema emerged as the most prevalent genus in terms of species count, boasting six distinct species, closely trailed by Eunotia with five species, Sellaphora also with five species, and Staurosirella with four species.
During the studied period, only three species were found exclusively occurring at the end of the Mid-Holocene, reaching a maximum abundance of 4.5%. This low abundance of diatom species during this period may be attributed to the deeper waters with hydrological flow. This discovery aligns with findings from studies conducted in the Amazon Basin, as evidenced by research conducted by Cordeiro et al. (2008), Moreira et al. (2013), Brugger et al. (2016), and Fontes et al. (2017).
During the Late Holocene, 20 species were reported to have reached 45.2% maximum abundance, with five being new records for the Brazilian territory (Aulacoseira crassipunctata, Gomphonema pseudosphaerophorum, Sellaphora emilia, S. sassiana, and Lacuneolimna novagallia). The diatom assemblage during this period consisted of benthic species, indicating shallower water conditions with low conductivity, oligotrophic, and acidic waters (Moro & Fürstenberger 1993, Van Dam et al. 1994, Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 2007, Bahls et al. 2009, Tudesque et al. 2015). A similar outcome was observed by Cardozo et al. (2014) in Lake Tota, Colombia, also during the Late Holocene, which was attributed to a drier period characterized by high temperatures and low precipitation.
An additional 14 species were evenly distributed across the core, accounting for up to 75.3% of the maximum abundance. The findings suggest that the fluctuation in diatom species composition may serve as an indicator of water level fluctuations in the Xingu River. Specifically, the transition from deep waters at the conclusion of the Mid-Holocene to shallower waters during the Late Holocene is evident in the data.
In recent years, the Brazilian Amazon Basin has witnessed a significant influx of new species (Wetzel et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2011, 2012a, 2012b, Burliga et al., 2013, Tremarin et al., 2013a, 2014a, 2014b, Pereira et al., 2014, 2015, 2017, Almeida et al., 2017, Almeida et al., 2018, Canani et al., 2018), underscoring the limited understanding of diatoms in this region. These new findings constitute a 75% surge in the total number of records for the Brazilian Amazon, emphasizing the region's inadequate exploration and the substantial underestimation of its biodiversity. This study underscores the significance of employing a paleolimnological approach as a valuable tool for evaluating biodiversity changes over extended periods and enhancing the comprehension of diatoms, particularly in Amazonian ecosystems.
