This study aims to investigate differences in ambiguity resolution among English, Spanish, and Portuguese speakers, the impact of L1 on L2 learners in ambiguity resolution, and how factors such as clause order, anaphor salience, and verb choice may influence this process. A total of 181 participants completed an online survey, selecting the antecedent for 16 ambiguous sentences. The Position of Antecedent Strategy was examined across the three languages, revealing its applicability to European and Brazilian Portuguese but not to Spanish or English. Native Spanish and English speakers tend to align the subject of the subordinate clause with that of the main clause, while L2 learners show uncertainty, particularly in resolving pronominal cataphora. The study concludes that semantics significantly impact the resolution of ambiguous anaphora in these languages, emphasizing the importance of considering semantics in the design of similar studies.
Ambiguity in anaphora resolution is a longstanding issue, extensively explored in the literature (Alonso-Ovalle et al., 2002; Keating et al., 2011; Lobo & Silva, 2016; Sorace & Filiaci, 2006; Valenzuela et al., 2011). Previous research has aimed to elucidate how both L1 and L2 speakers navigate ambiguity across languages, yet consensus on the most suitable theoretical framework to capture this complexity remains elusive.
This paper builds upon our prior research (Bruscato & Baptista, 2022a, 2022b) and conducts a comparative analysis of ambiguity resolution in the three most widely spoken European languages globally (Eberhard et al., 2020): English, Spanish, and Portuguese. The primary objectives of this study are to investigate: (a) the variations in ambiguity resolution strategies across English, Spanish, and Portuguese; (b) the impact of a learner's native language (L1) on ambiguity resolution in their second language (L2); and to explore whether (c) the sequencing of main and subordinate clauses, (d) the prominence of anaphors, or (e) the selection of lexical verbs may influence this cognitive process.
Data from Portuguese and Brazilian speakers studying English or Spanish in universities in Brazil or Portugal are compared with data from native speakers of these languages. Participants voluntarily completed an online questionnaire assessing their proficiency levels in the second language (L2) and required them to identify the subjects of ambiguous sentences in both their native language (L1) and the L2.
The paper is structured as follows: the second section offers a concise overview of the theoretical framework, the third section delves into the methodology employed for the study, the fourth section presents and analyzes the research findings, and lastly, the fifth section outlines the conclusions drawn from the study.
According to King and Lewis (2018, p. 1), anaphora can be defined as the phenomenon where the interpretation of one expression (the anaphor) depends on the interpretation of another expression (the antecedent). The anaphor and antecedent may be in the same or different sentences, and the anaphor can precede or follow its antecedent in the discourse. When the anaphor follows its antecedent, it is referred to as forward anaphora or simply anaphora (example 1). Conversely, when the anaphor precedes its antecedent, it is known as backward anaphora or cataphora (example 2). In this study, we will use the term anaphora to encompass both anaphora and cataphora, unless it is necessary to distinguish between them.

While he was on the phone, John ignored Mary.
Examples (1) and (2) exhibit pronominal anaphora, where the anaphor is a pronoun. In Spanish or Portuguese, however, the use of a pronoun in the subject position of the subordinate clause is unnecessary if the antecedent occupies the subject position in the main clause. These languages are classified as pro-drop languages, or null subject languages (Chomsky, 1981; Rizzi, 1982), permitting null or zero anaphora when the antecedent can be inferred either grammatically or pragmatically, as illustrated in (3).
João ignored Maria while he was on the phone.
If the subject of the subordinate clause differs from that of the main clause, Spanish and Portuguese speakers utilize a personal pronoun, as exemplified in (4).
John ignored Mary while she was on the phone.
The examples presented thus far lack ambiguity, making it easy to pinpoint the anaphor's antecedent. However, if we were to substitute Mary with Peter, as shown in (5), would individuals perceive the anaphor's antecedent to be the subject or the complement of the main clause? Alternatively, could they potentially identify a different referent altogether - perhaps an individual not referenced in the sentence at all?
João ignored Pedro while he was on the phone.
The primary objective of this study is to investigate intrasentential, coreferential, pronominal, and zero anaphora with nominal human antecedents. In essence, the research will concentrate on these specific linguistic phenomena within sentences.
Traditionally, it has been argued that there is a preference in English to correlate the pronoun in a subject position to the subject of the main clause (Chambers & Smyth, 1998; Crawley et al., 1990), as demonstrated in (6), unless it is emphasized. In such instances, stressed pronouns in subject position would yield a distinct (disjoint) interpretation from the subject of the main clause (Luján, 1986; Smyth, 1994), as illustrated in (7). This pattern mirrors the behavior observed in speakers of null subject languages, where a differentiation is made between employing zero anaphora (null pronoun) and pronominal anaphora (unstressed overt pronouns).

Carminati's (2002) Position of Antecedent Strategy (PAS) posits that the interpretation of anaphors in Italian sentences featuring intrasentential anaphora hinges on the syntactic function of their antecedents. Null pronouns occupying the subject position typically refer back to the subject of the main clause (as exemplified in (3)), whereas unstressed overt pronouns in the subject position generally refer back to the complement of the main clause (as illustrated in (4)). Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether this theory can be extrapolated to account for the distinctions between unstressed and stressed pronouns in a non-null subject language such as English.
This paper aims to examine Pronominal Argument Structure (PAS) with English and Spanish learners, native speakers of both languages, as well as Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and European Portuguese (EP) native speakers. Various authors (Duarte, 2000; Holmberg et al., 2009; Kempchinsky, 1984) have argued that Brazilian Portuguese, in contrast to European Portuguese, falls under the category of "partial null-subject languages," which are languages permitting null subjects but with more restricted conditions compared to consistent null-subject languages (Holmberg et al., 2009, p. 1). Consequently, the resolution of ambiguity may vary across these linguistic varieties.
In addition to the prominence of the anaphor, the sequence of clauses can also impact anaphora resolution. The Active Search Mechanism (ASM) hypothesis proposed by Kazanina et al. (2007) posits that in instances of pronominal cataphora in English (such as in (8)), speakers tend to select the initial potential antecedent that follows the anaphor. Typically, this initial potential antecedent corresponds to the subject of the main clause.
While he was on the phone, John ignored Peter.
Previous studies have explored the impact of clause order and anaphor salience on ambiguity resolution, along with the role of L1 in anaphora resolution in L2. Sorace and Filiaci (2006) examined ambiguous anaphora resolution in Italian, while Alonso-Ovalle et al. (2002) and Keating et al. (2011) focused on Spanish, Valenzuela et al. (2011) on Spanish and English, and Lobo and Silva (2016) on Portuguese. However, there is a scarcity of studies comparing anaphora resolution across multiple languages, with Portuguese often being excluded. Furthermore, existing research lacks specificity regarding the semantic criteria for verb selection in exercises. In contrast, our study not only delineates these criteria but also delves into how various verb combinations can impact anaphora resolution.
Building on the work of Valenzuela et al. (2011), this study aims to examine the resolution of zero and pronominal forward and backwards anaphora in Spanish and Portuguese, contrasting them with non-emphatic and emphatic pronominal forward and backwards anaphora in English. Following preliminary investigations conducted in our pilot studies (Bruscato & Baptista, 2022a, 2022b), our research has been extended to explore how both native (L1) and second language (L2) speakers navigate ambiguity in these linguistic contexts.
As outlined in the Introduction, this study aims to investigate the variations in ambiguity resolution strategies across English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additionally, it seeks to explore the impact of L1 on L2 learners in terms of ambiguity resolution and to ascertain whether factors such as the sequence of main and subordinate clauses, the prominence of the anaphor, or the selection of lexical verbs play a role in this cognitive process.
A quantitative approach was utilized to investigate the factors influencing ambiguity resolution. A written questionnaire, modeled after Valenzuela et al. (2011), was developed and subsequently approved by the ethics committee before being distributed online to undergraduate students within the language departments of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (in March 2020) and the University of Algarve (in October 2020). The questionnaire, hosted on Google Forms, was additionally disseminated through the researchers' social media platforms to target a wider audience of English and Spanish native speakers. Participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous, with respondents providing their consent to be involved in the research.
A total of 181 individuals, ranging in age from 18 to 54 years with a median age of 20, participated in the survey. The sample consisted predominantly of females, comprising nearly 70% of the respondents, with over 90% reporting their enrollment in a university. Among the participants, there were 78 Portuguese and 73 Brazilian undergraduate students, with 61 and 56 individuals, respectively, studying English as a foreign language, and 17 individuals from each group studying Spanish. Additionally, the sample included 20 native English speakers and 10 native Spanish speakers.
Initially, Portuguese native speakers responded to 20 questions derived from Cambridge or Cervantes' reading proficiency tests, spanning across levels A2, B1, B2, and C1. Subsequently, participants were tasked with choosing the subject of 20 sentences in both languages, with 16 of these sentences intentionally crafted to be ambiguous. For instance, Example (9) serves as a demonstration of the nature of this task.

The sentences featured a structure where a person's name occupied the subject position, followed by a verb in the simple past, another person's name in the object position, the temporal conjunction "when/cuando/quando," a third-person pronoun in the subject position (or ellipsis in Portuguese and Spanish), another verb in the simple past, and a third-person pronoun in the object position. These verbs were drawn from a verbal constructions database (Baptista, 2013) that specifically required a human agent as the subject, a human patient as the object, and no additional complement. Participants were tasked with selecting one of three options for the antecedent of the reduced subordinate clause's subject: it could refer to either (a) the subject of the main clause, (b) the complement of the main clause, or (c) another referent not explicitly mentioned in the main clause.
Half of the sentences in the study exhibited anaphora, while the remaining half featured cataphora. Specifically, half of these sentences contained a salient anaphor, which manifested as an unstressed pronoun in Portuguese or Spanish, or a stressed pronoun in English. Conversely, the other half of the sentences included a non-salient anaphor, represented by ellipsis in Portuguese or Spanish, or an unstressed pronoun in English. Participants were explicitly instructed to interpret pronouns written in capital letters as stressed. For instance, sentence (9) provided an illustration of stressed pronominal anaphora, whereas sentence (10) exemplified unstressed pronominal cataphora in the English language.
During the interview, Matthew subjected George to harassment.
The examples provided above constitute a subset of sentences specifically crafted to exhibit a "neutral" pairing of verbs, where minimal semantic interference is expected between the chosen verbs and the reference resolution strategy employed. This design encompassed half of the sentences. Conversely, the remaining half was intentionally constructed with "tendentious" verb pairs, emphasizing verbs that ideally direct the reference back to either the subject or the complement of the main clause. Sentence (11) was formulated to prompt a preference for resolving the anaphor as referring to the subject of the main clause, while sentence (12) was structured to encourage resolution to the complement of the main clause.

In the appendix of this paper, all sentences in the three languages are provided. Subsequently, the results are presented and discussed in the following section. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software (version 26). The limited size of the dataset precludes the generalization of conclusions. Nevertheless, it aids in testing the syntactic and semantic hypotheses in the languages.
As previously mentioned, Portuguese speakers completed a brief reading proficiency assessment in their target language prior to selecting the subjects of the ambiguous sentences. The findings from this assessment are presented in Table 1.
In the preliminary assessment, Portuguese and Brazilian students exhibited comparable outcomes, with participants from Portugal and Spanish learners attaining marginally higher scores than their counterparts, as illustrated in Table 1. To ascertain potential disparities in anaphora resolution based on the participants' language proficiency, we opted to segregate the sample into two categories: intermediate and advanced learners in each respective language.
In the subsequent section, we will examine the resolution of ambiguous anaphora by Portuguese speakers in their mother tongue. Subsequently, we will scrutinize the outcomes in Spanish and, ultimately, in English. The tables will display the percentages of responses for various scenarios.
Intrasentential anaphora and cataphora refer to the use of pronouns or other linguistic elements within the same sentence to refer back to or forward to an antecedent. These devices play a crucial role in maintaining coherence and cohesion within a text by linking ideas and concepts together. Intrasentential anaphora involves referring back to an earlier element within the same sentence, while cataphora involves referring forward to a subsequent element. Understanding and effectively using these devices can enhance the clarity and flow of a text, aiding readers in following the logical progression of ideas. Researchers have extensively studied the use of intrasentential anaphora and cataphora in various languages and contexts to better comprehend their functions and implications for discourse structure. By examining how these devices are employed in different types of texts, researchers can gain insights into the mechanisms underlying referential coherence and the ways in which language users establish and maintain connections between different parts of a discourse.
In the context of anaphora, distinctions can be observed among Portuguese, Spanish, and English. While Portuguese and Spanish commonly utilize unstressed pronouns or ellipsis as anaphors, English employs both stressed and unstressed pronouns for this purpose. This variation in anaphoric strategies across languages highlights the importance of understanding the specific linguistic features and conventions that govern reference and cohesion in each language. By examining these differences, researchers can gain valuable insights into the ways in which language structures influence communication and discourse organization.
Certainly! Here is the improved passage:

In linguistics, an antecedent refers to a word, phrase, or clause that a pronoun or other linguistic element refers back to. The antecedent can be the subject of a sentence, a complement, or any other element within the sentence. Understanding the relationship between an antecedent and its corresponding pronoun is crucial for maintaining clarity and coherence in writing. By clearly identifying and connecting pronouns to their antecedents, writers can ensure that their ideas are communicated effectively and that readers can follow the flow of the text without confusion.
In examining verb combinations, it is crucial to distinguish between those that are neutral and those that exhibit bias. Neutral verb combinations present information objectively without any added connotations or judgments, while biased verb combinations may subtly influence the reader's perception by introducing a subjective viewpoint. Researchers must be vigilant in their choice of verbs to ensure that their writing remains impartial and free from any potential bias that could skew the interpretation of their findings. By employing neutral verb combinations, researchers can maintain the integrity of their work and uphold the standards of academic writing.
The results pertaining to the Position of Antecedent Strategy (PAS) were emphasized in bold in the study.
When reporting the outcomes pertaining to the biased sentences, the anticipated preference will be denoted by an asterisk (*). The results are articulated in terms of the percentage of responses received: each cell within the tables signifies a comparison between two sentences that was evaluated by all participants within the sample.
The data from this study includes responses from a total of 78 Portuguese and 73 Brazilian undergraduate students majoring in languages. Initially, we will outline the distribution of responses to the neutral statements before proceeding to a comparative analysis with the biased statements.
Results from EP and BP speakers, as depicted in Table 2, exhibit striking similarities, particularly in instances of zero anaphora where Brazilians tend to associate the ellipsis with the subject more frequently than Portuguese individuals (90% and 75% respectively). Evidently, all participants adhere to the Position of Antecedent Strategy, albeit with varying degrees of strength across pronominal cataphora and anaphora cases. Notably, the alternative other option was exclusively selected when the anaphor was a pronoun, with a significantly higher preference in cataphora instances compared to anaphora. These findings suggest that resolving pronominal cataphora poses a greater challenge than other forms of anaphora.
Upon comparing the outcomes presented in Tables 2 and 3, it is evident that participants' responses were swayed by the biased sentences. The percentages notably increased when the verb combination led to a preference aligned with PAS (instances of anaphora). Conversely, in cases where the verb combination resulted in a preference contrary to PAS (instances of cataphora), participants' preferential choices shifted. It appears that participants are more swayed by semantics rather than syntax when resolving ambiguous anaphora, with the exception of Brazilians, who still exhibit a tendency to be influenced by PAS in instances where there is an ellipsis in the subject position. As illustrated in Table 2, the alternative "other" was exclusively selected in Table 3 when the anaphor was a pronoun, particularly in cases of cataphora. Notably, this choice was made solely by Portuguese students this time.
The Portuguese questionnaire was exclusively completed by native speakers, whereas the Spanish questionnaire had participation from 10 native speakers, 17 learners from Portugal, and 17 learners from Brazil.
The results for the neutral sentences will be presented prior to those for the biased ones.
In our previous studies (Bruscato & Baptista, 2022a, 2022b), only 5 Spanish native speakers (all learners of Portuguese) participated, and respondents generally adhered to PAS, with the exception of pronominal cataphora. With a doubled participant pool (non-learners of Portuguese), we now observe that the exception extends beyond pronominal cataphora to pronominal anaphora. Spanish native speakers appear inclined to interpret ellipsis in the subject position of the subordinate clause as aligning with the main clause's subject more than they do with pronouns. However, they do not typically interpret the unstressed pronoun in the subject position of the subordinate clause as corresponding to the main clause's complement. These outcomes align with the conclusions drawn by Alonso-Ovalle et al. (2002) and Keating et al. (2011).
Spanish learners often tend to interpret ellipsis in the subject position of the subordinate clause as corresponding to the subject of the main clause, particularly Brazilians when dealing with zero anaphora. However, participants did not exhibit a clear preference for the antecedent of the pronoun. Furthermore, the alternative "other" was solely selected in instances of pronominal cataphora, and solely by native speakers and advanced Portuguese learners. Interestingly, the two groups of EP speakers displayed contrasting outcomes for pronominal cataphora, with intermediate learners aligning more closely with native speakers than advanced learners. It is worth noting that the group sizes varied significantly, with the intermediate group consisting of only 4 participants.
Upon comparing Tables 4 and 5, it becomes evident that participants' responses were notably impacted by the verb combinations present in the biased sentences, particularly among native speakers. The data reveals that when a semantic preference aligned with PAS, the percentages increased, with the exception of intermediate learners whose inclination towards zero anaphora decreased, despite it remaining the subject of the main clause. Conversely, when the semantic preference contradicted PAS, native speakers exhibited a greater susceptibility to semantic influences. While learners also displayed a degree of semantic influence, their preference only shifted towards pronominal cataphora (excluding Portuguese intermediate learners who did not exhibit a clear preference - albeit with a small sample size of 4 participants in this category). The analysis of Portuguese biased sentences further underscores the continued influence of PAS on Portuguese speakers, particularly evident when ellipsis occurs in the subject position. In such instances, their tendency to align the ellipsis in the subordinate clauses with the main clause's subject decreased in cases of zero cataphora, yet it remained their favored choice.
The English questionnaire was completed by 20 native speakers, 61 learners from Portugal, and 56 learners from Brazil. Consistent with the structure of previous sections, the findings pertaining to the neutral sentences will be discussed prior to those concerning the biased statements.
In previous studies (Bruscato & Baptista, 2022a, 2022b), it has been noted that English native speakers typically interpret anaphors as corresponding to the subject of the main clause, regardless of clause order or anaphor salience. In contrast, learners exhibit less consistent interpretations, with most showing uncertainty. However, Brazilian advanced students tend to interpret stressed pronouns in the subject position of subordinate clauses as corresponding to the complement of the main clause, while Portuguese students tend to interpret non-emphatic pronominal cataphora as corresponding to the main clause's subject.
Upon comparing Tables 6 and 7, it is evident that participants continue to be swayed by the biased sentences. Despite being influenced by semantics related to non-emphatic pronominal cataphora, learners appear to remain unsure about the optimal choice for the pronoun's antecedent.
After obtaining the percentages from SPSS, subsequent multiple t-tests were conducted to ascertain the factors influencing antecedent choice in sentence pairs. Results indicated that Portuguese speakers' choices were significantly impacted at the 0.001 level by anaphor salience across the three languages, particularly in cases where there was no semantic opposition to the Position of Antecedent Strategy. Conversely, Spanish and English native speakers did not exhibit sensitivity to clause order or anaphor salience, but all participants across languages were influenced by the semantic relationship between verbs (p < 0.03). Notably, there were no significant differences observed among students from various Portuguese varieties or proficiency levels.
This study builds upon prior research conducted by Bruscato and Baptista (2022a, 2022b) and seeks to investigate several key aspects. Firstly, it aims to explore the variations in ambiguity resolution strategies across English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Secondly, the study intends to examine the impact of a learner's first language (L1) on ambiguity resolution in their second language (L2). Additionally, the research will investigate whether factors such as the sequence of main and subordinate clauses, the prominence of the anaphor, or the selection of lexical verbs could potentially influence the ambiguity resolution process.
A total of 181 participants completed an online survey in which they identified the antecedent of the anaphor in 16 ambiguous sentences. The study examined the Position of Antecedent Strategy (PAS) across three different languages and analyzed the impact of semantics and syntax on resolving ambiguous anaphora.
Our research indicates that Portuguese native speakers tend to employ the Position of Antecedent Strategy when resolving ambiguous anaphora, while Brazilian speakers exhibit a tendency to interpret zero anaphora as referring to the subject of the main clause more frequently than Europeans. Despite these distinctions, participants from both language varieties encounter greater difficulty in resolving pronominal cataphora compared to other forms of anaphora. While the majority of participants typically select the subject or complement of the main clause as the antecedent for the anaphor, some individuals opt for an alternative referent not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, a phenomenon previously observed in Italian by Sorace and Filiaci (2006).
The Antecedent Strategy position was not confirmed with either Spanish or English native speakers. Both groups tend to interpret the subject of the subordinate clause as aligning with the subject of the main clause, although Spanish native speakers exhibit a stronger inclination to establish this correspondence in instances of zero anaphora rather than pronominal anaphora.
When acquiring a foreign language, Portuguese native speakers appear to be influenced by their L1 anaphora resolution strategy (PAS) irrespective of their proficiency level in the L2. In the case of Spanish, Brazilians tend to interpret zero anaphora as referring to the subject of the main clause more frequently than Europeans. Nevertheless, learners have exhibited uncertainty in selecting the antecedent of pronouns in Spanish, particularly in instances of cataphora, as well as in English.
The outcomes derived from the analysis of the "neutral" and "biased" sentences exhibited significant disparities. Despite the continued impact of PAS on Portuguese speakers, particularly evident with ellipsis anaphors in Portuguese or Spanish, our findings suggest that the selection of lexical verbs and the semantic relationship between them significantly affect the resolution of ambiguous anaphora. This particular facet of our research has been largely overlooked in prior studies. Based on these findings, we argue that the semantic nuances of verb combinations should be taken into account when constructing ambiguous sentences for tasks related to anaphora resolution.
