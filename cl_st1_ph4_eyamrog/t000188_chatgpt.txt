In this study, we aimed to project the anticipated number of COVID-19 fatalities in Brazil over the upcoming months.
Methods: This study encompassed all verified instances of COVID-19 related fatalities, starting from the initial confirmed death on March 17 through May 15, 2020. The data was sourced from an official Brazilian Ministry of Health website. To analyze the data from all states in the country, the Boltzmann function was utilized for data simulation in each dataset.
Results: The model data exhibited a strong fit, as indicated by R2 values approaching 0.999. As of May 15, the country had confirmed 14,817 COVID-19 deaths. Amazonas reported the highest rate of accumulated cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants at 321.14, followed by Ceará at 161.63. Our projections suggest that Rio de Janeiro, Roraima, Amazonas, Pará, and Pernambuco are likely to witness a significant surge in cumulative cases by July 15. Conversely, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina are expected to display lower rates per 1,000,000 inhabitants.
In conclusion, our analysis suggests a significant surge in the cumulative case rate in Brazil in the coming months. The Boltzmann function has emerged as a valuable and straightforward tool for epidemiological forecasting, offering insights that can aid in the strategic planning of interventions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
The global community is currently grappling with a severe and urgent public health crisis stemming from the rapid transmission of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, commonly referred to as COVID-19. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially designated the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, marking the highest level of alert under the International Health Regulations. Subsequently, on March 11, 2020, the WHO escalated the classification to a pandemic, underscoring the widespread and escalating nature of the disease.
Despite the stringent social isolation measures mandated by health authorities worldwide to curb the virus's spread and mitigate the strain on healthcare facilities, the number of infected individuals and fatalities attributable to the disease persistently rise. The aim is to diminish the need for hospitalization and prevent the health system from becoming overwhelmed and collapsing.
According to the real-time COVID-19 world map provided by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center as of the evening of May 31, 2020, a total of 6,194,508 cases of the disease and 372,501 deaths had been confirmed globally. The countries with the highest number of confirmed cases at that time were the United States (1,790,191), Brazil (514,849), and Russia (414,878). Leading in the number of deaths were the United States (104,383), the United Kingdom (38,571), and Italy (33,415), with Brazil ranking fourth (29,314) up to that date.
A study conducted by a team of researchers from the United Kingdom has outlined various pandemic scenarios across 202 countries up to the epidemiological week ending on April 26, 2020. The study proposed three distinct models concerning mitigation strategies: (1) a scenario without any interventions, including non-pharmacological interventions and social distancing measures; (2) a scenario involving social distancing measures for the entire population; and (3) a scenario with enhanced social distancing specifically targeting the elderly. Based on the chosen mitigation approach, projections for the total number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil were estimated at 187,799,806, 122,025,818, and 120,836,850 cases, respectively. In terms of COVID-19 related deaths, the projected figures were 1,152,283 for the first scenario, 627,047 for the second, and 529,779 for the third. The report emphasized that measures such as social isolation, school closures, and the closure of non-essential services could potentially save millions of lives.
In collaboration with the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has devised a set of resources aimed at aiding governments in their decision-making processes concerning the implementation or relaxation of measures. One such resource is the technical guide titled "Considerations on adjustments to social distance measures and travel-related measures in the context of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic." Additionally, the "Epidemic Calculator" serves as a crucial tool, generating scenarios based on values, data, and parameters (such as the number of available beds, transmission speed, and social contact) rather than making predictions about the future. The efficacy of this model is intricately linked to the accuracy and reliability of the information utilized in the calculations.
Despite the availability of these tools, the low testing of suspected cases of COVID-19, coupled with a rising trend in new deaths, results in a significant underreporting of cases and, to a lesser extent, deaths from the disease. Additional factors, such as a persistently high rate of contagion and the population's limited adherence to social distancing measures, paint an extremely dire picture for Brazil leading up to the end of May. Three months following the first confirmed case reported by the Ministry of Health, and two months after the initial death announcement, Brazil has now exceeded the threshold of over one thousand daily deaths attributed to the coronavirus. The current fatality rate stands at 6.3%, ranking among the top 10 globally, with a mortality rate of 10.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.
When an event experiences exponential growth, uncertainties also increase exponentially, as exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Various mathematical models, constructed from available knowledge and data, can simulate diverse scenarios and detect trends. Despite inherent uncertainties, akin to any scientific outcome, insights derived from mathematical models are deemed crucial for shaping public policy strategies. A more accessible model, utilized in prior Chinese studies, is Boltzmann's model. Consequently, this study aimed to predict the potential total deaths from COVID-19 in Brazil over the next two months using Boltzmann's function, employing regression analysis.
This epidemiological study employed mathematical modeling and geoprocessing techniques to analyze all twenty-seven states of Brazil, a country known for its vast territorial expanse of 8,514,876 km2. Brazil's landmass constitutes approximately 1.6% of the global surface area and encompasses 20.8% and 48% of the total area of the Americas and South America, respectively.
The study encompassed all confirmed cases of COVID-19 deaths from the initial confirmed fatality up to May 15, 2020. COVID-19 was defined as a case exhibiting a positive outcome for viral nucleic acid testing in respiratory specimens or through a positive serological test. This data was sourced from the official website that provides updates on the COVID-19 situation in Brazil. The data utilized for model development was current as of May 16, 2020. The rates of cumulative disease cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants were computed by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths in each state by the estimated population at risk, based on data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística- IBGE).
The data were organized using Microsoft Excel (Windows version 2016, Microsoft Corporation; Redmond, WA, USA) and then imported into Microcal Origin software version 6.0. Each set of data from various geographical regions in the northeast of Brazil was subjected to simulation using the Boltzmann function. The parameters of the function were determined, with the total number of confirmed cases being directly linked to parameter A2. The Boltzmann function utilized for future projections is represented by a specific formula, where C(x) denotes the cumulative number of confirmed cases after the first day x, and A1, A2, x0, and dx are constants. The inflection point x0 signifies the date when daily cases are expected to peak, followed by a decline in total daily cases. The coefficient dx reflects the rate of increase in COVID-19 deaths concerning the increase in days x, while A2 indicates the potential total number of deaths. The data derived from parameter A2 was utilized to compute the rate of cumulative COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants.
Density maps were created using inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation to visualize the distribution of cumulative COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants, utilizing both actual and modeled Boltzmann data. The cartographic base of Brazil from the IBGE electronic database was employed, along with COVID-19 reported data. The Terra Datum model SIRGAS 2000 and Mercator Transversal Universal system cartographic projection were utilized for this analysis. Georeferenced data were integrated into Quantum GIS (Version 3.10.5), an open-source geospatial software developed by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) based in the USA.
The initial recorded case of COVID-19 fatality in Brazil occurred in São Paulo on March 17, 2020. Between that date and May 15, 2020, a total of 14,817 deaths attributed to COVID-19 were officially reported nationwide. São Paulo stands out as one of the states with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 fatalities, accounting for 4,501 deaths, and ranks seventh among states with the highest death rates at 98.02 per 1,000,000 inhabitants (Figure 1). Regarded as the epicenter of the outbreak in Brazil, São Paulo is closely followed by Rio de Janeiro, Ceará, Pernambuco, and Amazonas, collectively contributing to nearly 11,000 deaths.
During this period, the state of Amazonas exhibited the highest cumulative rate of COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants at 321.14, followed by Ceará (161.63), Pernambuco (144.50), Rio de Janeiro (141.21), and Pará (133.10). Conversely, the states of Mato Grosso do Sul (5.04), Minas Gerais (6.90), Mato Grosso (7.46), and Goiás (9.55) reported the lowest rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants.
In the context of Boltzmann data analysis, it was observed that each region exhibited a strong fit, with R2 values approaching 0.999 during the period from March 17 to May 15, 2020 (refer to Table 1). Subsequently, projections were made regarding the potential total COVID-19 deaths in Brazil for the ensuing 60 days post-May 15, as detailed in Table 1. Notably, the anticipated cumulative COVID-19 death rates per 1,000,000 inhabitants up to June 15, 2020, are expected to be notably higher for regions such as Roraima (881.98), Rio de Janeiro (761.45), Amazonas (665.56), Pará (559.62), and Pernambuco (316.87). Conversely, regions like Mato Grosso do Sul (6.32), Minas Gerais (12.07), Paraná (12.18), Rio Grande do Sul (18.24), and Santa Catarina (19.86) are projected to have lower rates.
On July 15, the projected total number of deaths in the country is estimated to be 56,955, while model A2 suggests a potential figure of 64,262. This value is subject to variation based on the standard deviation provided for each state (refer to table 1). The anticipated number of cumulative cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants is expected to be notably higher in Rio de Janeiro, Roraima, Amazonas, Pará, and Pernambuco, with rates of 1586.02, 1054.57, 697.91, 586.77, and 353.16, respectively. São Paulo is projected to have a rate of 152.12 COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants. Conversely, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina are anticipated to exhibit lower death rates per 1,000,000 inhabitants (6.68, 12.32, 13.79, 18.90, and 30.24, respectively). The visualization of the country's data illustrates the potential rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths for all states as of June 15 (Figure 2) and July 15 (Figure 3), reflecting the varying intensity of colors.
In this study, we aim to estimate the cumulative rate of COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants in Brazil for the upcoming two months, focusing on the dates of June 15 and July 15, 2020. This estimation is based on the analysis of existing data spanning from March 17, 2020, to May 15, 2020, in conjunction with a mathematical model.
We projected that states in the southeast and north regions are likely to experience a significant surge in the cumulative COVID-19 death rates, with Rio de Janeiro, Roraima, and Pará potentially seeing increases of up to 5.39, 13.36, and 4.20 times within a month, and 11.23, 15.97, and 4.41-fold rises by July 15, respectively. Additionally, our analysis indicates that Amazonas (north region) and Pernambuco (northeast region) are currently in a phase where death cases may stabilize, albeit with a slight uptick in mortality rates (2.17 and 2.44, respectively). Nevertheless, these states are still expected to rank among those with the highest death rates by the end of the period. Conversely, states in the midwest and south regions are projected to experience a more modest increase in cases, with the lowest potential cumulative rates anticipated by the end of the estimated timeframe.
The data on COVID-19-related deaths in specific geographic regions holds significant importance, serving not only to gauge the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections but also to indirectly estimate the total number of cases and, by extension, evaluate the efficacy of healthcare services from prevention through diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, this information plays a crucial role in shaping strategic interventions aimed at curtailing the transmission cycle of the pathogen.
Brazil's high COVID-19 death toll has been attributed to a series of failures within the country. The severity of the pandemic in any nation is largely contingent on the government's ability to swiftly provide appropriate support for diagnosing and treating infected individuals. Brazil's current predicament is exacerbated by its low testing rates compared to other countries with mass testing initiatives, indicating a significant gap in the country's approach to combating the virus.
Furthermore, the outcomes of tests conducted using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) molecular test still require over 15 days for dissemination in numerous regions of the country. This delay contributes to the underreporting of cases, omits the identification of asymptomatic individuals or those with mild symptoms who do not pursue medical attention or lack access to healthcare facilities, and hinders the prompt diagnosis of cases at a heightened risk of progressing to severe forms of COVID-19.
Social isolation measures and the use of masks, which have been adopted in several countries and recommended by local governments in Brazil, have been consistently contradicted by the central government. The speeches and attitudes of the central government have served to minimize the importance of these measures as effective prevention strategies. In the state of Amazonas, which has the highest death rate due to COVID-19, no city has achieved the minimum ideal adherence rate of 70% to social isolation. This lack of adherence is not unique to Amazonas, as many Brazilian cities have also experienced low rates of social isolation. Consequently, the rate of transmission of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil remains one of the highest in the world.
In addition to prevention and diagnosis, predicting COVID-19 deaths is crucial for hospital organization to provide care for severe cases. A study in Brazil revealed that regions with high mortality rates from conditions like hypertension, neoplasms, diabetes, heart, and respiratory diseases also face shortages of ICU beds and ventilators. This underscores the need for efficient resource distribution to effectively combat the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil. Without proper planning, the health system breakdown could exacerbate the death toll in the country.
Our findings indicate that the model employed is suitable for analyzing and forecasting cumulative COVID-19-related deaths, as all datasets exhibited a strong fit to the Boltzmann function. Variations in host factors, pathogen survivability, and environmental influences could potentially impact the estimated figures, given that the model assumes stable general conditions. Moreover, the projected death toll might be higher due to potential underreporting. Nevertheless, the primary advantage of the model lies in its reliance solely on cumulative confirmed cases or deaths, offering a rapid tool to aid in decision-making regarding pandemic containment strategies for COVID-19.
