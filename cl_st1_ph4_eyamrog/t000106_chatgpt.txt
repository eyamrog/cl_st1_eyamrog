Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated social distancing measures, potentially resulting in decreased levels of physical activity among individuals. This study aims to delineate and contrast the various forms of physical exercise in which participants partook, along with their respective frequencies, durations, and intensities, across three distinct time frames: 2019 (1), January/February 2020 (2), and the period of social distancing enforced due to the COVID-19 pandemic (3).
Methods: This cross-sectional study targeted adults and elderly individuals attending a public recreation center. Participants were recruited via social media to complete a survey on Google Forms focusing on the characteristics of physical exercises undertaken during the three specified research periods. The survey was accessible throughout October 2020.
Results: A total of 194 participants (mean age 63.49±14.14 years; 93.2% women) were involved in this study. In period 1, the predominant exercise regimen was a strength/aerobic class, conducted twice a week for sessions lasting between 46 minutes to 1 hour, at an intensity level of 6. Moving on to period 2, walking emerged as the most commonly reported activity, undertaken three times a week for sessions lasting between 31 to 45 minutes, at an intensity level of 7. Finally, in period 3, the trend reverted back to the strength/aerobic class being the most prevalent exercise, occurring three times a week for sessions lasting between 31 to 45 minutes, at an intensity level of 5.
In comparison to period 1, periods 2 and 3 exhibited a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the overall exercise duration. Furthermore, during these latter two periods, there was also a notable decline (p < 0.05) in the number of participants who met the WHO guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week.
The COVID-19 pandemic, declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, prompted various countries to implement social distancing measures at different times and levels of severity, particularly targeting individuals over 60 years old due to their vulnerabilities and underlying health conditions. In Porto Alegre, Brazil, the local government initiated movement restrictions on March 16, 2020, which included the closure of all educational institutions. These restrictions were progressively tightened until they began to ease on April 24, 2020, primarily affecting the service sector, both public and private, which encompassed physical exercise facilities. Gyms were permitted to reopen in a limited capacity on May 5, but were subsequently mandated to close again on July 7, only to reopen once more on August 11. Despite the official authorization for reopening, public recreation centers did not resume offering in-person physical exercise sessions to the public until early November.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, online exercise programs were highly recommended for the general population. The WHO European Regional Office advocated for a "stay physically active" initiative for individuals in self-quarantine, promoting home-based exercise as outdoor and indoor facilities remained closed. In Brazil, the Ministry of Health released two web pages offering guidance on maintaining fitness during the mandated period of staying at home and practicing social distancing. Regrettably, the dissemination of these crucial health recommendations has been limited, primarily due to varying approaches taken by the federal, state, and municipal administrations in addressing the challenges posed by the novel disease.
Fortunately, within the public service sector, certain civil servants took personal initiative at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, providing citizens with a web-based platform to engage in exercise from home. Initially, these gym classes targeted specific closed groups through a personal messaging app. Over time, these individual efforts evolved into institutionalized activities facilitated through social and corporate networks. More recently, the city of Porto Alegre has initiated a program offering a range of classes tailored for pregnant women, encompassing physical exercises, nutritional guidance, and psychological support.
Various individual and institutional initiatives were established to promote activity among individuals, particularly the elderly. While social and corporate social media platforms did not fully engage the entire city's population, the short videos produced, ranging from 4 to 20 minutes in length, garnered over 40,000 views between March and November 2020.
The reduction in physical exercise frequency, duration, and intensity due to social distancing measures can have detrimental effects on overall health, particularly in older individuals. The World Health Organization advises individuals over 18 to engage in a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. The challenge of meeting these exercise guidelines while confined to home can lead to health issues, particularly related to muscle strength loss.
The primary aim of this study is to quantitatively assess and contrast individuals' participation in physical activity across three distinct time frames: (1) the year 2019, (2) the months of January and February 2020 (Jan/Feb 2020), coinciding with the summer break in Porto Alegre, and (3) the period of social distancing protocols (SDP) enforced as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, commencing in March 2020.
This cross-sectional study accessed participants' information from a survey examining their lifestyle habits, specifically their physical exercise practices in 2019 and 2020. Originally targeting individuals aged 18 and above who engaged in regular exercise at a public recreation center, the study expanded to include a random sample of 194 individuals aged 30 to 89 years (mean = 63.49 ± 14.14). The majority of the sample comprised women (92.3%) and individuals over 60 years old (75.6%).
All procedures in this study were carried out remotely. The Google Forms platform was utilized to design a questionnaire focusing on physical exercise habits in the years 2019 and 2020. This questionnaire was disseminated through various social media channels and remained accessible to participants throughout the month of October 2020.
The questionnaire on physical exercise practices in 2019 and 2020 comprised 22 questions regarding the exercises undertaken by participants across three distinct time frames: 1) in 2019, 2) during January/February 2020, specifically the summer break in Porto Alegre, and 3) amidst the SDP prompted by the COVID-19 outbreak. The inquiries delved into the nature of physical activities (presenting 16 varied types such as basketball, indoor or outdoor cycling, biodance, cambio, treadmill or outdoor walking, treadmill or outdoor running, dance, strength and aerobic classes, water aerobics, pool jogging, weight training, swimming, pilates, tennis or beach tennis, volleyball, yoga, and an "other" category), their frequency (ranging from once to daily), duration (spanning from under 15 minutes to over 1 hour and 15 minutes), and intensity (measured on a 0-10 scale). Additionally, participants were asked about their frequency of leaving home for essential purposes during the SDP, with response options including never, once to daily.
The data were initially analyzed for distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges were employed to characterize the data. To assess variances across time periods and age ranges, statistical tests including Friedman’s Two-Way Analysis (with Bonferroni's correction), Independent Samples Median Test, and Chi-Squared Test were conducted. Data descriptions and inferences were carried out using SPSS®26 software, with a confidence interval of 95% being assumed for the analyses.
All procedures outlined previously underwent analysis and approval by the Ethics Committee of Porto Alegre (CAAE #32661620.3.0000.5338). Prior to completing the online form, all participants were required to provide their consent for the utilization of their information.
This study focused on the physical exercises undertaken by participants in the year preceding the onset of COVID-19 and during the current year. The inquiries did not delve into the specifics of their activities but rather focused on their predominant exercise routines, frequency per week, duration, and intensity. Participants were prompted to recall their typical activities during the research period, introducing the potential for recall bias in their responses. To mitigate this bias, the questions were phrased in an open-ended manner, allowing participants the flexibility to provide approximate rather than precise answers. Furthermore, the majority of participants had been regular attendees at the same recreational center for an extended period, reducing the likelihood of memory bias.
The subsequent sections provide a descriptive summary of the data followed by various inferential analyses aimed at elucidating the described phenomena. Nonparametric statistical methods were employed due to normality tests indicating that the data originates from a non-normally distributed sample.
When participants were queried about their regular physical exercise routines, a total of 19 distinct activities were identified. These activities, listed in descending order of frequency, included strength and aerobic classes, treadmill or street walking, weight training, dance, yoga, Pilates, indoor or outdoor cycling, stretching, water aerobics, treadmill or street running, biodance, volleyball, swimming, tennis or beach tennis, cardio workouts, pool jogging, Chinese exercises, elliptical training, and functional exercises. In 2019, the most prevalent exercises were strength and aerobic classes (29.76%), weight training (15.77%), and walking (11.90%). Conversely, during the Jan/Feb 2020 period, the top three exercises were walking (48.34%), weight training (10.60%), and strength and aerobic classes (8.61%). Notably, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the most commonly mentioned exercises were strength and aerobic classes (34.25%), walking (29.83%), and yoga (8.84%).
During the Stay-at-Home Order, participants were queried about their frequency of leaving home for essential needs. A significant portion, comprising 43% of the participants, reported either never venturing out for essential demands or doing so just once a week, as illustrated in Table 1.
Participants' information was categorized based on age range, revealing that all groups, with the exception of those under 60 years old, predominantly left their homes for essential needs once a week during the SDP, as indicated in Table I. An independent sample median test (X2(6) = 8.987; p>0.05) demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the frequency of participants leaving home during the SDP across all age ranges.
Participants were subsequently queried about their weekly physical exercise routines. The predominant frequency reported overall was exercising twice a week, accounting for 52.27% of responses. When examining the breakdown for each time period, it was found that in 2019, 74.91% of participants exercised twice a week, in January/February 2020, 26.04% exercised three times a week, and during the SDP, 26.61% engaged in physical activity three times a week. The distribution of participants' exercise frequency is detailed in Table II.
In the subsequent inquiry, participants were queried about the amount of time dedicated to exercise. The predominant duration reported was between 46 minutes to 1 hour, accounting for 43.91% of responses. Specifically, in 2019, 58.25% of participants indicated spending between 46 minutes to 1 hour per exercise session. For the months of January and February 2020, 31.91% reported exercising for 31 to 45 minutes, while during the Self-Distancing Period (SDP), 42.45% reported the same duration of 31 to 45 minutes. The breakdown of exercise duration per session is detailed in Table II.
Participants were queried about the intensity of their exercise routines, rating them on a scale from 0 (indicating the lowest intensity) to 10 (representing the highest intensity). The predominant intensity level reported by the entire sample was 6. Specifically, in 2019, 60.57% of participants indicated exercising at an intensity level of 6, while during January and February 2020, 20.21% selected an intensity level of 7, and during the period of social distancing protocols (SDP), 19.27% mentioned exercising at an intensity level of 5. The distribution of intensity levels reported by participants is detailed in Table II.
The total time spent exercising per week was not directly queried in the questionnaire; instead, it was derived from participants' responses regarding the frequency and duration of their exercise sessions. The mean overall total time spent exercising was calculated to be 115.46 minutes per week (±89.29; CI=102.82-128.11). In 2019, the mean total time spent per week was the highest among the three periods analyzed, amounting to 167.83 minutes (±100.03; CI=153.66-181.99). This was followed by Jan/Feb 2020, with an average of 93.51 minutes (±132.97; CI=74.68-112.34) per week, and the SDP period, with an average of 85.05 minutes (±108.62; CI=69.66-100.43) per week.
Based on the previous calculations of total weekly exercise time and intensity, participants were categorized according to the World Health Organization's exercise recommendations, which include 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise. Throughout all time periods, it was found that 67.01% of the participants did not meet the WHO recommendation, while 32.99% did. Notably, there was a decline in the proportion of participants meeting the WHO recommendation from 2019 to 2020. Specifically, in 2019, 45.88% achieved the WHO recommendation, whereas in January/February 2020 and during the SDP, only 26.29% and 26.80% reached it, respectively.
Friedman's Two-Way Analysis revealed a statistically significant disparity in the total time allocated to exercise across the years 2019, January/February 2020, and the period of the SDP (X2(2) = 106.93; p<0.05). Specifically, the total time dedicated to exercise in 2019 significantly exceeded that of both January/February 2020 and the SDP. However, there was no statistically significant variance between the latter two time frames. It is important to note that the significance levels were adjusted using Bonferroni's correction. The distribution of total exercise time across the different periods is visually depicted in Figure 1.
The independent samples median test revealed no statistically significant differences between age ranges in 2019 (X2(6) = 8.273; p>0.05), in Jan/Feb 2020 (X2(6) = 6.464; p>0.05), and during the SDP (X2(6) = 3.002; p>0.05). Figure 1 illustrates the medians and ranges for each period across all age ranges.
The study also examined the total time dedicated to exercise based on age groups across the three specified time frames. Utilizing Friedman’s Two-Way Analysis, a notable statistical decrease was observed between 2019 and Jan/Feb 2020 across all age categories, with the exception of individuals aged 75-79. Similarly, a significant decrease was noted between 2019 and the SDP for all age groups, except for those aged 80-84. No significant variances were identified between Jan/Feb 2020 and the SDP, and there were no discernible distinctions within the 85-89 age bracket across the time intervals. To maintain accuracy, significance values were adjusted using Bonferroni's correction. Figure 1 illustrates the medians and ranges depicting the total time spent exercising for each age group throughout the specified time periods.
The time allocated to exercise was categorized based on WHO recommendations. In 2019, nearly half of the participants met these guidelines, but this proportion decreased to approximately a quarter during both periods in 2020 (see Figure 2).
The prevalence was assessed through a chi-squared test, revealing a weak yet statistically significant correlation between adherence to the WHO exercise recommendation and time period (X2(2)=21.872; p<0.05; Cramér’s V = 0.194). Surprisingly, there was an overrepresentation of participants meeting the WHO recommendation in 2019 compared to the expected numbers. Conversely, there was an underrepresentation of participants meeting the recommendation in January/February 2020 and during the SDP. This indicates a statistically significant association between meeting the WHO recommendation in 2019 and not meeting it in January/February 2020 and during the SDP.
During the time periods examined in this study, participants reported their level of physical activity based on the total time dedicated to exercise per week. Individually, participants could exhibit a decrease, an increase, or no change in the total time spent exercising between 2019 and 2020. The majority of participants experienced a significant decrease in their exercise engagement from 2019 to Jan/Feb 2020 and to the start of the Stay-at-Home Directive Period (SDP). In contrast, there was an even distribution in personal performance between Jan/Feb 2020 and the SDP, as illustrated in Figure 2.
The prevalence was further examined through a chi-squared test, revealing a weak yet statistically significant correlation between personal achievement and time period (X2(4)=155.645; p<0.05; Cramér’s V = 0.366). Surprisingly, there was a higher number of participants who reported decreased exercise engagement in 2020 compared to 2019, indicating an association with reduced total time spent on exercise during both 2020 periods.
The study observed a significant decrease in the amount of time spent exercising just before the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in January/February 2020 and during the subsequent Social Distancing Period (SDP), with reductions of 42.7% and 41.6% compared to the previous year, respectively. This aligns with findings by Malta et al. (2020), who reported a mean decrease of 60.14%. While both studies categorized participants into age groups, they differed in how they defined borderline ages: Malta et al. grouped those over 60 years old, whereas this study focused on participants under 60 years old. However, both studies concurred that all age groups experienced a decline in the time spent exercising adequately. The research revealed that a significant portion of participants reduced their exercise levels during the pandemic, with nearly half failing to meet the recommended activity levels to prevent various diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, overweight/obesity, and sarcopenia. Furthermore, the lack of physical activity during the SDP was associated with increased levels of anxiety, stress, and depression.
Among younger adults, a decline in exercise participation in 2020 was evident, as noted by Huber et al. (2020), albeit to varying degrees. Their study group consisted of young adults (23.3±4 years old; 71.5% women) from Bavaria, Germany. Following the imposition of a lockdown in Bavaria, 44.5% reduced their physical activity levels, while 32.8% increased them, and 22.7% maintained their exercise routines. A similar trend was observed in a study conducted in northern Brazil. The findings of our study, which involved participants aged 30-89 years, are concerning: 76.3% reported a decrease in their overall exercise duration, 22.2% increased it, and 1.5% maintained their previous levels. When focusing on a subset of participants below 60 years old (n=61; 49.16±14.94 years old; 95.1% women), the results were comparable (70.6% decreased, 26.2% increased, and 3.3% unchanged), highlighting a notable contrast with the younger cohorts from Germany and northern Brazil. This suggests that older adults and the elderly curtailed their physical activity more significantly, possibly due to retirement or heightened health concerns related to the pandemic. It is crucial to recognize that older individuals are at a higher risk of muscle loss from inactivity, which could detrimentally affect their functional capacity and, consequently, their overall quality of life.
Participants aged over 60, with the exception of the 80-84 age group, exhibited a significant decrease in exercise duration during the SDP. This finding aligns with the outcomes reported by Yamada et al. (2020) in a study involving a population residing in a continuing care retirement community in Japan. Utilizing a pace counter, Yamada et al. noted notable declines in daily walking distance among residents aged 67-92, with a majority being women (70.4%). The overall reduction in daily walking distance amounted to approximately 24%. In our study, a comparable sub-sample was established, comprising individuals aged 67-89 (n=82; 89% female), although they resided outside institutional settings. Similar to Yamada et al.'s findings, this sub-sample also experienced a significant decline in exercise levels following the imposition of movement restrictions by the city of Porto Alegre on March 16, particularly affecting older individuals. The reduction in exercise among this group was substantial, at 58.2% when comparing data from 2019 to the SDP, nearly double the decrease observed in the Japanese study. This variance could be attributed to the more controlled environment provided by a continuing care retirement community, fostering a sense of security that encourages continued physical activity. Furthermore, a separate study examining the physical activity of patients (n=82; aged 58-72; median age=65; 35.4% female) utilizing implantable cardiac electronic devices with remote monitoring in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic, reported a 27.1% decline in physical activity over a monitoring period of 77 days, including a 38-day lockdown. While these results mirrored those in Japan, they diverged significantly from the outcomes of our research.
The decrease in overall physical activity post the COVID-19 outbreak is an undeniable reality, affecting individuals of varying demographics and prior exercise habits globally in 2020. This decline can be attributed to the necessity of staying home and maintaining social distance. While numerous online exercise programs were available, they were not universally accessible, particularly for older individuals or low-income families due to technological complexities and the cost of reliable internet access. Prolonged inactivity can have detrimental effects on health, especially for the elderly. Authorities in Porto Alegre and Brazil advised older individuals to remain at home from March to December. Moving forward, it is imperative to develop initiatives that promote healthy exercise habits across all age groups and encourage previously inactive individuals to engage in physical activity. Governments now face the challenge of preparing their cities to accommodate both new and returning exercise enthusiasts in the post-vaccine era.
