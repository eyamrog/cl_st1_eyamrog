This study delves into the modal constructs present in advertising commercials, specifically focusing on Oral-B® Toothpaste, in order to elucidate the mechanistic integration of modes that work together to create a cohesive and comprehensive message. By utilizing the mood system and concepts of kinesics, the author effectively interprets the video for readers. In addition to employing statistical elements such as tables and graphs to analyze the modes, there is a noticeable fragmentation in the structures of certain linguistic items like "The answer?", "Easy", "still fresh", and "strong". Repetition is a notable feature, with the communicator emphasizing the generic "You", "your teeth", and "your mouth" for added emphasis. Communicative devices such as "strong and healthy" and "long-lasting fresh breath" serve as specific details that highlight Oral-B's 2-IN-1 qualities. Gestural modes, particularly smiling, are repeatedly observed in phrases like "Smile, Smile, Smile", while intimate and personal distances enhance meanings, with Social Actors 1 and 2 serving as indexical participants. The use of metaphorical professional actors and the dual 2-IN-1 features further characterize the communication, projecting a sense of interchangeability. While the advertisement is captivating, the metaphor of interchangeability could potentially be simplified to cater to a broader audience, particularly those who may be illiterate.
The question surrounding the precise representation of Mode has sparked significant interest within the knowledge-based industry. Since the emergence of Multimodality, various elements that define mode have garnered numerous scholarly interpretations, yet a definitive consensus on a specific definition remains elusive (Jewitt, 2009; Bateman, Wildfeuer & Hiippala, 2017; Forceville, 2020). It is crucial to recognize that disciplines such as multimodality embody contextualized concepts tailored to align with the knowledge driving a particular field of study. This understanding underscores the ongoing debate regarding the constituent content and structure of the entity known as mode. The resulting delineation ripples should not come as a surprise, as there is a pressing need for a clear understanding of the module of mode (Kress, 2010). In my view, such clarification would equip every enthusiast of multimodality with comprehensive insights into the focal point of this expansive yet adaptable field of inquiry.
Essentially, the miniature components of micro-linguistics can serve as a window, offering a clear channel to elucidate the concept of mode. In this context, micro-linguistics encompasses phonetics/phonology, morphology, grammar/syntax, and semantics. These micro-linguistic domains encompass phone/phoneme, morph/morpheme, and lexeme, potentially representing the smallest units for analyzing phonetics/phonology, morphology, and grammar/syntax. Additionally, it is crucial to consider semes as relevant elements within the realm of semiotics.
Against this backdrop, it is essential to delve into the concept of mode, drawing inspiration from the realms of micro-linguistics, which serve as a foundation for social semiotics. This connection highlights the significance of incorporating linguistically insightful frameworks into the discourse of social semiotics, despite objections to what some may perceive as linguistic conceptual imperialism (Bateman, Delin & Henshel, 2002; Bezemer & Jewitt, 2010).
At this point, the question of 'what is mode?' remains pertinent. Building on van Leeuwen's (2005) definition, a mode is an interactive tool with its meaning potential rooted in historical legacies, contemporary cultures, and future standards. Jewitt (2009) further elaborates that a mode serves as a semiotic resource for creating meaning, intertwined with cultural contexts. Jewitt (2009) identifies various communicative tools such as images, texts, gestures, and postures. However, Kress (2010) offers a dual perspective on modes, distinguishing between informal and formal views. The informal perspective is social in nature, while the formal perspective leans towards academic realms. According to Kress (2010), the informal aspect is socially determined, with communities shaping the interpretation of a mode. Consequently, a mode's effectiveness is influenced by the social group, leading to a mode that is geographically contextualized.
The latter, often regarded as formal, delves into a theoretical realm, specifically focusing on a particular theoretical foundation that serves as a guide for analysts in understanding the embodiment and description of a mode, presenting the semiotic resource as rooted in professionalism. It can be inferred that the defining characteristics of a mode revolve around history, culture, and science, with this trio enhancing the potential for conveying meaning within a communicative context. Consequently, one could posit that a mode acts as an analytical unit facilitating the transmission of meaning between social actors. These attributes underscore the rationale for viewing multimodality as an interdisciplinary pursuit, one that is investigated through the lens of social semiotics.
The axiomatic nature of mode significantly impacts existing literature in multimodal discourse domains, as evidenced by O’Toole’s (1994) work on comprehension, Kress and van Leeuwen’s (2021) exploration of thought, and Scollon’s (1998, 2001) emphasis on interactional sensitivity. Additionally, Scollon’s unique ethnographic perspective adds depth to the discourse. Halliday’s systemic functional linguistics serves as a robust foundation for understanding mode as the key agent in creating meaning during communication. Constantinou (2005) delves into the portrayal of modes in media techniques, while Silvestre (2008) examines the role of emotion in multimodal messages. Cambria, Arizzi, and Coccetta (2012), along with van Leeuwen and Jewitt (2001) and Adami (2015a), shed light on the practical affordances of web tools, the significance of meaning in social semiotic entities, and the strategies for enhancing interactivity within the context of websites. The scholarly contributions of Ly and Jung (2015) and Holsanova (2016) focus on the modal design of advertising systems and the exploration of integrative communication elements.
Discussions on modes interconnect various subjects, including the exploration of aesthetics in digital configurations (Adami, 2014), the analysis of pictorial images in online newspapers functioning as a form of language (Knox, 2016), and the contextualization of filmic discourse within the framework of GeM (Bateman, 2013). Additionally, there is a discussion on the placement of multi-literacy within the realm of multimodality (Eisanmann & Meyer, 2018), the cognitive semiotics of gesture (Iriskhanova & Cienki, 2018), and the role of gestural modes as companions to political persuasive commentary (Kraśnicka, 2020). Martin and Zappavigna (2018) and Unsworth (2020) emphasize the elucidation of embodied meaning in paralanguage, particularly in relation to Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) precision and intermodal connections within the school science genre. Hiippala and Bateman (2020), Bezerra (2020), and Dalamu (2021) delve into communicative challenges in explaining the diagrammatic mode and multimodal constructs of cinematic portrayals of female actresses within a specific film and semiotic genre.
The current study contributes to the understanding of modal activities within communicative environments. Its aim is to illustrate how the concept of mode functions across various devices and settings within a semiotic framework. Essentially, this research explores how modal components interact to create different affordances that facilitate the production and dissemination of meaning to the intended audience. Drawing on the insights of Halliday and Matthiessen (2014), Kress and van Leeuwen (2021), Baldry and Thibault (2010), and Norris (2019), this study employs their perspectives as analytical tools to examine modes, applying conceptual frameworks to analyze a semiotic system present in a New Oral-B Toothpaste advertisement (referred to as the ad).
It is evident that both linguistic and communication studies offer various approaches to understanding meaning. This perspective underpins multimodality, which bases its meaning creation on the selection and arrangement of different modes. Page (2010) posits that a mode serves as a tool for interpreting the physical world, typically embodying certain capacities for generating potential meanings. These capacities are diverse, often contingent on factors such as the audience's background, the type of meaning being conveyed, and the subject matter that the modes aim to represent (Herman, 2010). Expanding on this notion, one could recognize that a mode is a dynamic entity that remains open-ended. Since a mode is expressed through a medium, it can convey varying interpretations in different media contexts. This complexity may prompt researchers to view this meaning-making construct as somewhat dependent, as it relies on external contexts for determining meaning.
In multimodal discourses, the mode serves as a semiotic channel for both artistic and scientific expressions. The artistic aspect originates from a specific background, allowing a sign-maker to construct meaning tailored to the intended audience. On the other hand, the scientific dimension is influenced by individuals interacting with an artifact utilized as a mode. Furthermore, the analytical value of an analyst's engagement with the materiality of a mode positions it as a scientific entity. It is evident that a mode possesses a tangible human element, with its conceptual manifestation being heuristic, utilizing various media to convey contextual meanings. Constantinou (2005) argues that this communicative framework not only facilitates meaning realization but also serves as an abstract resource for semiosis (Fei, 2004). This perspective drives Norris (2011) to propose that modes are inherently distinct entities, emphasizing that every meaning-maker employs one or a combination of modes to convey ideas across different domains. This recognition underscores the essential role of modes in communication, highlighting their significance in facilitating meaning creation for readers. Each mode within a semiotic system contributes uniquely to the process of meaning-making, generating distinct interpretations within various contextual realms.
One could argue that there exist established norms that encompass the concept of mode. Mode can be viewed as a text, a process, a product, or a choice, and can be either animate or inanimate. It operates as a system that is coherent and meaningful. When classified as a text, mode pertains to the object through which meaning is constructed, such as words, pictures, gazes, and gestures, prompting a social actor to select the appropriate mode for a semiotic system. This choice connects readers to the Paradigmatic perspective of text, with the selection process indicating how modes are processed within a given context. Drawing from Halliday and Matthiessen’s (2014) theoretical framework, Paradigmatic denotes a communicative vertical axis that focuses on what is chosen over what is not, resulting in a syntagmatic outcome.
Syntagmatic relations refer to a grouping of elements along a horizontal axis that gives rise to a semantic syntagm within lexico-grammar. The coherence within paradigmatic modal entities, which constitute a unified semiotic presence, is instrumental in creating meaning. Building on this foundation, Kress and van Leeuwen (2001) suggest that modes are structured lexically and grammatically, forming a cohesive system of meaning, akin to the hierarchical organization of linguistic ranks (Thompson, 2014; Dalamu, 2018c). Drawing on this analogy, it can be inferred that just as linguistic elements exhibit systemic properties, modes also possess systemic characteristics, potentially fostering a network of interconnected systems. This perspective views modes as integral components of a system dedicated to the construction of meaning, a concept that will be explored further in the subsequent discussion.
The focus of this study revolves around modes, which are considered the core of meaning production in multimodality. The analyst has clarified that mode serves as the conceptual lens through which various forms of modes are explored. This concept aligns with Halliday and Matthiessen's (2009) idea that grammar serves to illuminate grammar itself. Within Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), the term "grammatics" is used to describe a situation where grammar interprets itself, drawing parallels to Hall's (1966) concept of proxemics derived from proximity. Could one then propose the theory of modes as "Modics," a self-explanatory construct? Building on the understanding that mode is systemic and attracts a network of systems, Figure 1 visually represents the systematic nature of mode.
The terms "system" and "system network" are central to the discussion. According to Butler (1985), a system is a defined collection of choices within a specific environment, consisting of items with various alternatives in terms of their utility. Essentially, a system offers the freedom to select a specific mode for carrying out a particular task (Kress, 1981; Dalamu & Ogunlusi, 2020). A system network, on the other hand, is a visual representation that illustrates the choices available in communication activities, considered an innovative concept within Hallidayan linguistics. Halliday and Matthiessen (2014) characterize a system network as the potential options accessible to a communicator, enabling an analyst to map out the overall organization of semiotic resources. This network serves as a chart demonstrating the optional variables present in textual resources.
A system network embodies delicacy, which serves as the fundamental principle governing the interrelation of system indices. Delicacy, in this context, denotes the level of intricacy and specificity within a semiotic resource, delineating a hierarchical order ranging from broad to detailed. This concept of delicacy, as a form of classification, signifies the arrangement of systems from a general to specific orientation through entry conditions (Dalamu, 2019b). Consequently, it can be posited that the system network reflects the element of choice in all communicative exchanges due to its discretionary nature. Illustrated in Figure 1, communicative modes are validated as the entry conditions of a network system, encompassing language, imagery, color, and music.
It is important to note that Figure 1 does not encompass all modes worldwide. Some modes may contain sub-modes functional within their domain, such as human beings and clothing, entire architectural constructions, and a car (O’Halloran & Baldry, 2011). However, it could be argued that the inclusion of language, image, color, and music serves to adequately represent the nature of modes at work in various communication contexts. Language, as depicted in Figure 1, encompasses spoken and written modes, with different theoretical perspectives evaluating their structures within linguistic frameworks (Kress, 2011; Yule, 2020; Jaworski & Coupland, 2016). The image, divided into animate and inanimate components, is further subdivided for clarification. Proxemics, gesture, and gaze, as discussed by Hall (1974), Hostetter (2012), Kendon (2015), and Antas and Gembalczyk (2018), are elements explored in terms of distance and gestural interactions. Martin and Zappavigna (2019) suggest that gestures serve as indicators of paralanguage, while Kress (2010) contextualizes the use of lower animals to mimic human behavior as transduction.
The examination of inanimate objects as modal devices can be seen as a multifaceted and intricate process due to their inherent natural and scientific implications and interconnections. Each mode within this category is supported by relevant theoretical frameworks for exploration (Heitzmann, 1998; Howells, 2003; O’Toole, 2011; Ravelli & McMurtrie, 2016; Bateman, Wildfeuer & Hiippala, 2017; Forceville, 2020). Consequently, the modes selected for analysis dictate the specific conceptual frameworks to be employed. It is important to note that no single data set can encompass the entire conceptual scope of Modics (theory of modes). There exists a division of conceptual labor within the discourse on multimodality. Color and music represent the latest modal additions, with van Leeuwen’s (2010; 2014; 2016) parametric principle and van Leeuwen’s (2011) rhythmic insights being key exploratory avenues for these modes. All elements outlined in Figure 1 are considered modes as they meet the criteria for scientific analysis, yielding significant potential for meaning generation. The diverse facets of human society that reflect modes contribute to the expansive landscape of multimodality as a dynamic and ambitious field. This consolidated academic model currently serves as the foundation for meaning production through dialogue, interaction, conversation, and communication in a broader context.
This study necessitates statistical analysis to uncover and interpret the intended meaning potentials. Consequently, the research delves into the meaning potentials of communication related to the New Oral-B Toothpaste, addressing the following pertinent questions.
The communicator strategically utilizes various modes in the New Oral-B Toothpaste video to create a comprehensive and cohesive message. By integrating visual, auditory, and textual elements, the video aims to engage viewers on multiple sensory levels, enhancing their understanding and retention of the information presented. Through the careful selection and combination of these modes, the communicator effectively conveys the benefits and features of the product, appealing to a wide audience and maximizing the impact of the message. This holistic approach to communication not only captures attention but also ensures that the key points are effectively communicated and understood by the viewers.
What is the frequency at which the spoken modes operate in the Oral-B advertisement?
Gestural activities have played a significant role in enhancing meaning-making within the context of Oral-B Toothpaste communication. Through the use of gestures, individuals are able to convey non-verbal cues that complement and reinforce the verbal message being communicated. These gestures can include hand movements, facial expressions, and body language, all of which serve to emphasize key points, clarify information, and engage the audience on a deeper level. By incorporating gestural activities into their communication strategies, Oral-B Toothpaste has been able to create a more dynamic and interactive experience for consumers, enhancing the overall effectiveness of their messaging. This integration of gestures not only helps to capture the attention of the audience but also aids in the retention and comprehension of the information being presented. In essence, gestural activities have proven to be a valuable tool in shaping the meaning-making process within Oral-B Toothpaste communication, contributing to a more engaging and impactful interaction between the brand and its consumers.
This research delves into the operational modes within a semiotic system, aiming to discern the interactions of semiotic resources that give rise to comprehensive meaning potentials. The rationale behind selecting a New Oral-B Toothpaste advertisement on YouTube stems from the abundance of advertising materials present on this platform, with advertisers viewing YouTube as a social media hub with a vast user base (Adami, 2015b). Given the rapid popularity of this product in Sub-Saharan Africa, the researcher opted to analyze a New Oral-B Toothpaste communication due to the sign-maker's use of a metaphorical 2-IN-1 concept as a key selling point, employing both animate and inanimate participants to convey interchangeable meanings (Williamson, 2002).
The researcher utilized an HP 2000® laptop and an MTN® Internet modem as electronic devices to facilitate the downloading of a video from a YouTube site, specifically https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F69YVBvF58, with the assistance of Savefrom.net for converting the YouTube video into a more easily accessible format. It is important to note that this advertisement is not the sole Oral-B ad available on YouTube. What sets this particular ad apart is the clever time management exhibited by the social actors, who maintain a constant smile throughout the duration of the ad.
After converting the YouTube text into a readable manuscript, the analyst utilized the computer's snipping tool to divide the formatted script into approximately 35 shots, categorized into four distinct high-level mediated actions (HLMA) (Baldry & Thibault, 2010; Norris, 2019). These HLMA shots encompass various low-level mediated actions (LLMA) with diverse modes of meaning-making. Each shot, denoted as O-BT (Oral-B Transcript), displays the operational period of the transcript (e.g. O-BT1 (00:00 – 00:01)), as indicated at the bottom left corner. The intricacy of kinesics actions prompted the generation of numerous shots featured in the discussion domains. With Table 1 showcasing HLMA shots and their corresponding times, alongside another table illustrating the conversion of spoken modes into written structures, the study juxtaposes the shots and analysis of spoken modes within the discussion section's framework.
Bloor and Bloor (2013) provide valuable insight into the mood system, which contextualizes the explication of written modes. By applying distinct social semiotic ideas, the recurrence of spoken modes and the kinesics functions of images are illustrated in the results section. The frequencies presented to readers reveal the functional patterns of certain modes in communication. Abbreviations like S = subject, F = finite, P = predicator, C = complement, A = adjunct, and CL = clause are used for textual economy, as noted by Dalamu (2019a).
The table presented below illustrates the cultivation of HLMA over various time frames, along with the corresponding number of shots associated with each segmented action.
Table 2 illustrates the dialogues among the three social actors involved in the communication process, with their speeches being transformed into clauses.
The video advertisement for Oral-B toothpaste analyzed in this study serves as a demonstration of human and material interactions mediated through higher-level and lower-level terms. The various modes at play, operational in specific contexts, facilitate these interactions, ranging from animate to inanimate materiality due to their distinct affordances. Building upon the theoretical framework outlined in Figure 1, this study delves into written modes (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014; Dalamu, 2018b), images (Kress & van Leeuwen, 2021; Baldry & Thibault, 2010), proxemics (Norris, 2019), and gestures (Kendon, 2015) as domains of exploration. The discussion is structured around the presentation of modes, as exemplified by HLMA 1, HLMA 2, HLMA 3, and HLMA 4. Notably, the entire duration of this advertisement is a concise 30 seconds.
HLMA 1 encompasses LLMA ranging from O-BT 1 to O-BT 18, representing image transcripts of Oral-B. The researcher systematically analyzes the systemic conversation, converted into written modes, within the communication. The advertisement initiates its persuasive approach by showcasing the structural design of the Oral-B Dental Institute, accompanied by musical rhythmic notes. The visual representation of the structure appears to reflect a theme-rheme configuration (O’Toole, 2011), as the section projecting the Oral-B Dental Institute is visibly smaller and shorter compared to the other building, which exudes a glassy and grandiose aesthetic.
Following this, a social actor (referred to as Social Actor 1) dons a deep blue tie over a light blue long sleeve shirt and proceeds to make a comment in the restroom, stating: "You clean your teeth every morning." This statement, as depicted in 1a, carries an assertive tone, recognizing the common practice of daily teeth cleaning. The use of "You" as the subject in this clause is generic, encompassing all viewers of the advertisement and creating a sense of exclusivity. The intended audience for this message by Oral-B is anyone who uses toothpaste. The phrase "every morning" serves to highlight the daily nature of teeth care, typically performed in the morning before breakfast or commencing daily activities. Social Actor 1 reinforces the statement "You clean your teeth every morning" with accompanying gestures involving hand and head movements. Mimicking a boxer preparing for a fight, Social Actor 1 interlocks their fingers and raises their hands towards the chest. With a toothbrush in hand, they make a sagittal head movement while emphasizing the point with their right hand. These verbal and non-verbal cues serve as demonstrative expressions of conviction.
The communication domain in question pertains to the Oral-B Dental Institute, which is why the institute is introduced at the outset as a prologue. Furthermore, the introduction of Social Actor 2 into the scenario serves as evidence of this positioning. Social Actor 2 strategically intervenes in the negotiation by stating, "But that breath feeling just doesn’t last." The use of the paratactic conjunction "But" (Thompson, 2014) serves to contradict and negate the statement made by Social Actor 1. The term "But" signals to the audience that there is something lacking despite regular teeth brushing. According to Social Actor 2, the missing element is the lasting breath feeling, which is a key selling point for Oral-B at present. This argument implicitly criticizes other toothpaste brands that fail to provide a long-lasting breath sensation that is characteristic of a fresh mouth. Oral-B, on the other hand, claims to sustain a fresh breath feeling for users for up to 14 hours, as later disclosed in communication segments O-BT24 to O-BT27.
Social Actor 1 supports the issue of breath feeling, as raised by Social Actor 2, by gesturing with the toothbrush in his hand. He rotates his head to facilitate gaze and poses the question: "The answer?" This question, structured as an interrogative clause, is punctuated to emphasize its elements (Cook, 2001). The individual would likely have phrased it as: "What is the answer?" This fragmentation adheres to the principles of appropriateness and textual economy in advertising (Leech, 1966; Gieszinger, 2001). In response, Social Actor 2 communicates with the simple word "Easy." This response, delivered as an imperative clause, could have been expanded to "Take it easy." However, for the purposes of advertising efficiency, the concise "Easy" in this context is crucial (Leech, 1966; Gieszinger, 2001). Social Actor 2's calm demeanor reflects confidence in Oral-B, yet Social Actor 1 is left in suspense, adding to the intrigue of the interaction.
Social Actor 2 surprisingly fosters a sense of belonging for Social Actor 1 by both giving and donning a white lab coat, thereby establishing a symbolic connection between them (Dyer, 2005). The act of donating and wearing the lab coat implies that only dental professionals possess the ability to effectively endorse Oral-B in accordance with the expected marketing standards. Through this gesture, Social Actor 2 subtly communicates to Social Actor 1 that an ordinary individual lacks the credibility to promote Oral-B, emphasizing that only esteemed dentists affiliated with the Oral-B Institute are equipped to educate the target demographic on the toothpaste's quality and heritage.
Upon donning the lab-coat in O-BT9 and O-BT10, Social Actor 1 exits the scene, leaving Social Actor 2 present. Subsequently, Social Actor 2 engages viewers by presenting a carton of Oral-B with their left hand. As Social Actor 2 holds the carton, Social Actor 1 reemerges to collaborate with Social Actor 2 in promoting the product. This interaction showcases a turn-taking dynamic, as noted by van Leeuwen (2005). The exchange position fosters cooperation between Social Actor 1 and Social Actor 2.
In this scenario, Social Actor 2 is depicted holding a carton of Oral-B with the left hand and Social Actor 1 with the right hand. This action is facilitated by the fact that Social Actor 1 is now a highly qualified dentist, known for endorsing the quality and value inherent in the toothpaste. This professional qualification serves as a catalyst for Social Actor 1, as evidenced in O-BT13 to O-BT18, to extend his left hand and place it on the shoulder of Social Actor 2. This gesture signifies the trustworthiness of the information being conveyed by Social Actor 2 to Social Actor 1, specifically regarding the enduring freshness Oral-B provides. Consequently, Social Actor 1 feels confident in aligning himself with Social Actor 2, believing in the efficacy of the product being promoted.
Social Actor 2 emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong and healthy teeth, to which Social Actor 1 responds by highlighting the long-lasting fresh breath that Oral-B provides. The conjunction "And" plays a significant role in this paratactic structure, contrasting with the earlier discussed conjunction "But." Social Actor 2 employs "But" to challenge the assertion made by Social Actor 1, as evidenced in the preceding statements. However, Social Actor 1 diverges by using "And" to confidently endorse the claim that Oral-B not only enhances breath freshness but also ensures overall oral health. This dual functionality of the toothpaste, caring for both teeth and mouth simultaneously, energizes the teeth while leaving the mouth with a pleasant scent. This dual benefit leads the communicator to classify Oral-B as a 2-IN-1 toothpaste.
The research article highlights the demonstration of Oral-B's 2-IN-1 excellence in HLMA 2, specifically within the O-BT19 to O-BT23 configuration. The sequence commences with the presentation of two Oral-B cartons, the promoted product, being showcased from both the left and right sides with the aid of two hands. The horizontal movements of these cartons from opposite directions set the stage for the potential merging of the two entities into a unified whole. The accompanying statements, "With Oral-B 2-in-1 toothpaste, it helps your teeth; And gives your mouth long lasting fresh breath," serve as declarative clauses reinforcing the amalgamation of the toothpaste images into a singular entity. Given that Oral-B is the focal point of the advertisement, the creator utilizes O-BT21 as a form of emphasis. This choice is driven by the intention to highlight features such as 2-IN-1; NEW, and the positioning of the Oral-B carton being held by a social actor's right hand to enhance viewer engagement and perception.
Among all the LLM domains, O-BT21 stands out as the first domain where the image of the advertised product is fully revealed. The pronunciation of "With New Oral-B 2-IN-1 Toothpaste" serves to emphasize to viewers the importance of purchasing and using the product for daily teeth cleaning. During this presentation, Social Actor 1 strategically directs his gaze, using vectors and hand gestures to establish a strong eye contact with the target audience of the advertisement. The communication designer further enhances the message by introducing a social actor who physically interacts with a teeth-like structure, illustrating how Oral-B contributes to dental strength and long-lasting freshness. While holding the teeth-like object, the social actor turns his head towards the viewer in a sagittal nodding motion, maintaining eye contact to effectively engage the audience. This interaction is visually depicted in Figure 6 – Shots of HLMA 3 (images).
The advertisement highlights the 2-IN-1 superiority of Oral-B in HLMA 3, with the LLMA starting in O-BT24 and concluding in O-BT27. Time plays a crucial role in these sequences, indicated by timestamps at 7:00, 7:43, 13:00, and 19:00. These narratives present a historical perspective on a proven product. The timestamps suggest that the individual (referred to as Social Actor 3) used Oral-B to clean her teeth at 7:00 in the morning, leaving for the office at 7:43 with fresh breath, aligning with the initial statement of daily teeth cleaning. By 13:00 while at work, the fresh breath persisted. Remarkably, by 19:00 upon returning home, Oral-B continued to maintain the advertised fresh breath.
The remarkable efficacy of the New Oral-B Toothpaste prompted the individual to note that the product left her mouth feeling incredibly fresh at 7:00, maintaining that freshness at 13:00, and still retaining it by 19:00. Were it not for concerns of economy and avoiding redundancy, the complete expressions would have been "It is so still fresh," "It is still fresh," and "And it is still fresh." This deliberate emphasis serves to make a defining feature of Oral-B memorable. Through a semantic analysis, the qualifiers "so," "still," and "still" serve to illustrate the degree of intensity that the advertised toothpaste imparts on the teeth and mouth in terms of both strength and breath sensation. These linguistic devices further validate the accuracy of the assertions made by Social Actor 1 and Social Actor 2. The statements made by these individuals regarding Oral-B, as endorsed by Social Actor 3, the consumer, are indeed truthful.
In HLMA 4, it is evident that the woman's testimony serves to inspire the social actors referenced in the indexical to rejuvenate the toothpaste campaign, advising both viewers and the witness to "Stay strong and Stay fresh." Consequently, it is recommended that viewers adhere to the 2-IN-1 support offered by Oral-B. Consumers are encouraged to remain loyal to the product, as their consistency and stability will contribute to the maintenance of strong teeth and fresh breath over an extended period. Furthermore, the visual representation of Oral-B is dynamic, as depicted in three instances from O-BT30 to O-BT32. These visual representations are significant, showcasing the effervescent movement of the whitish substance of the toothpaste as it cascades in a rolling motion from its source downwards to the branded packaging (body) of Oral-B.
In the culmination of the advertisement, a voice asserts that New Oral-B toothpaste is designed for strong teeth with long-lasting fresh breath, accompanied by the image of the lady engaging in specific gestural behaviors. These include raising her hands and exhaling a fresh breath into them, followed by raising her right hand and tapping her teeth with a finger twice. The former gesture symbolizes fresh breath, while the latter signifies strong teeth to the broader audience. The communication begins with a rhythmic music of low tempo and concludes with melodious sounds of high tempo. The ambient musical backdrop, functioning as an orchestra throughout the communication events, sets the tone (Till, 2017). The final two seconds feature a high musical tempo and repeated shouts of "Smile, Smile, Smile." These imperative clauses urge viewers to smile, showcasing the nature of their teeth—whether they are white or not. If white, it attributes the result to Oral-B's effect on their teeth; if not, Oral-B is presented as a solution to rectify any issues. Essentially, the repeated smile commands prompt viewers to mimic the smiling actions of the actors in the advertisement, aiming to assess the quality of their teeth against the advertised 2-IN-1 characteristics.
In the Oral-B ad, four distinct settings are utilized: the Oral-B Dental Institute office, the toilet, the home of Social Actor 3, and her office. Each of these locations features unique layout systems that are recognizable in society. The color schemes employed also play a significant role, with blue representing the traditional color of the product, white positioning Social Actors 1 and 2 as professional figures, and the female actor adorned in a cool but dull green attire. The mint content of Oral-B is predominantly in white, each color serving a symbolic function. Blue is associated with calmness, tranquility, and acceptance, while white symbolizes purity, cleanliness, and unity, transcending human criticisms. The green worn by Social Actor 3 likely symbolizes harmony, honesty, and a natural connection to the environment. The use of red, typically linked to fire, is employed to convey excitement, courage, and passion, particularly in the representation of the word "New." These symbolic elements are strategically integrated to enhance the qualities of Oral-B, aiming to inspire viewers to engage with and support the product.
Two significant instances of proxemics are evident in this communication. The first occurs when Social Actor 2 opens the door to confront Social Actor 1's statement in the restroom. Initially, there is a noticeable personal distance, which is then diminished as Social Actor 2 moves closer, eventually reaching an intimate distance by placing a lab coat on Social Actor 1. The second scenario unfolds as Social Actor 1 enters a different scene to join Social Actor 2 in jointly promoting Oral-B with their right hands. Similar to the first situation, the proximity between them shifts as Social Actor 1 closes the personal distance, allowing for an intimate interaction where he places his hand on Social Actor 2's shoulder, symbolizing a unified resolution in the mutual marketing of Oral-B.
The presence of Oral-B in the upper right corner of the LLM spheres and other visible locations serves as an indicator of two specific functions. Firstly, Oral-B is the focal point of the advertisement, drawing attention to the brand. Secondly, the designer aims to embed Oral-B within the cognitive processes of viewers. A close examination reveals that Social Actors 1 and 2 are portrayed by a single individual, assuming two distinct roles facilitated by computer-mediated characteristics. Consequently, the intentional duality of roles is apparent. This metaphor establishes a connection between the actor and Oral-B, suggesting a parallel between the 2-IN-1 nature of the actor from the dental institute and Oral-B itself. This concept aligns with Williamson's (2002) notion of the interchangeability of semiotic resources. Additionally, the presence of the toothbrush and toothpaste, products that are typically in joint demand, further emphasizes the 2-IN-1 characteristic.
The modal density of the Oral-B ad contributes to the enrichment of various meaning potentials. These elements are discerned by the analyst within specific parameters. The evident smiling behaviors exhibited by Social Actors 1, 2, and 3 are prominently featured throughout the campaign segments. The primary objective of these smiles is to visually highlight the exceptional whiteness of the social actors' teeth. The radiance of their teeth, accentuated by their laughter, serves to demonstrate the efficacy of the toothpaste in enhancing dental aesthetics over a prolonged period.
This manifestation serves as an invitation for individuals to engage with Oral-B, signifying the assurance that consumers' teeth will attain a pristine white appearance through the use of this toothpaste. This aspect acts as the driving force behind the sign-maker's unwavering endorsement of smiles that showcase the actors' teeth's whiteness through various grammatical elements in diverse contexts.
The grammatical communicative devices employed in this research include the generic "you" teeth, utilized functionally about three times, and the mode "fresh," operational in various forms such as long-lasting fresh breath, breath feeling, so fresh, still fresh, and stay fresh. Additionally, the text, strong, and smile serve as linguistic tools that contribute to the promotion of dental features. The communication reveals the word "strong" in the context of strong and healthy, aiding in strengthening and maintaining strength, while the term "smile" is utilized three times consecutively. The consistent use of blue and white color schemes in the modalities demonstrates an adventurous quality (Chiazzari, 1998; van Leeuwen, 2016). Emphasizing smiles, linguistic structures, and color palettes not only adds weight and distinction to Oral-B but also enhances its prominence and fame, compelling viewers to pay unusual attention to the communication and potentially patronize the advertised product.
The researcher categorizes the results of the analysis into two forms: (i) the utilization of modes for holistic meaning; and (ii) the frequency of spoken modes in the video. These findings correspond to Research Question 1 and Research Question 2, as outlined in the introductory section.
In the communication setting of HLMA1, the Oral-B Institute, Social Actors, and the toilet are prominently featured. A comment is made emphasizing the importance of daily cleaning for both teeth and toilets to maintain hygiene and prevent odors. The advertisement underscores the necessity of using Oral-B specifically for oral hygiene, promising strong and fresh breath for up to 14 hours. The ad employs techniques such as a sagittal head movement, demonstration of toothbrush holding, and the use of the right hand to persuade viewers. Social Actors 1 and 2, both dentists, appear in the ad, with Social Actor 2 endorsing the cleaning efficacy of Oral-B. The dentists collaborate seamlessly to endorse Oral-B, creating a unified promotional message.
The fusion of two Oral-B cartons into a singular item, as depicted by HLMA2, serves as a symbolic representation of unity of purpose between Social Actors 1 and 2. This visual cue prompts Social Actor 1 to engage in direct eye contact with the target audience, signaling a call for their cooperation. By physically interacting with a teeth-like image, a social actor conveys the message of Oral-B as a toothpaste that promotes dental strength and health.
The HLMA3 study highlights Oral-B's competitive edge over its rivals by showcasing the 2-IN-1 profile, which offers both toothpaste and a toothbrush in a single carton. Social Actor 3 provides a historical perspective on Oral-B's ability to maintain long-lasting fresh breath over time. Specifically, the study illustrates how Oral-B effectively sustains fresh breath from 7:00 at home, through 13:00 at the office, and all the way to 19:00 back at home in the evening.
In the HLMA4 advertisement, social actors are depicted engaging with the white sparkling content of Oral-B as it descends from top to bottom, aiming to captivate potential customers. Social Actor 3 is shown touching her teeth, symbolizing the attributes of cleanliness, strength, and long-lasting fresh breath associated with the promoted product. The advertiser concludes the message with a repetition of "Smile, Smile, Smile," emphasizing the positive outcome of using Oral-B. Furthermore, the use of color and musical tunes in the advertisement serves to attract and excite viewers, encouraging them to consider choosing Oral-B for their oral care needs.
In this section, one table and two figures are presented, detailing the frequencies of the spoken modes in the Oral-B advertisement. The statistical analysis focuses on modal structure recurrence and higher-level mediated discourse recurrence. This study places emphasis on the clause as the fundamental unit of analysis for the examined resources.
The modal structure of Oral-B ad's conversational modes, as depicted in the Total aspect of Table 3, reveals the presence of mood and residue units. Notably, the residue garners more points compared to the mood, with 15 points specifically allocated to the complement. This observation suggests a recognition of the residue within a clause as the rhematic aspect that encapsulates the essence of the message, aligning with the perspectives of Halliday and Matthiessen (2014) and Dalamu (2018a).
In terms of residue analysis, the predicator and adjunct are assigned scores of 11 and eight points, respectively. These scores categorize the predicator as the second level and the adjunct as the third level of components' functions within Oral-B communication. Moving forward, the subject, as illustrated in Figure 10, is utilized approximately five times, while the finite element also plays a role with a score of five points. The conjunction, depicted as the lowest scoring element in the graph, receives only three points.
Typically, the conjunction is not typically associated with the interpersonal metafunction; analysts often view this component as simply conveying information to the audience in a shared context, which is why its significance is acknowledged. Upon observing the elements depicted in Figure 6, one immediately notices the abundance of nominal items within the clauses, positioning the residue as the most prominent element in Figure 10. Consequently, the communicator demonstrates a preference for utilizing nouns over verbal constructs to influence the audience.
Based on the data presented in Table 2, the Oral-B video showcases four distinct HLMA segments. This orientation significantly impacts the calibration of the HLMA frequency, particularly in the horizontal dimension as outlined in Table 3. Figure 11 visually represents how the social actors within HLMA 1 emphasize the most substantial grammatical components, totaling 21, compared to other phases. HLMA 4 and HLMA 2 each utilize 10 components to effectively engage the target audience towards consumption, while HLMA 3 operates with a lesser number of linguistic components, specifically six. The calibration analysis suggests that advertising practitioners tend to incorporate more words in the introductory and concluding sections of their communication. Consequently, HLMA 2 and HLMA 3 rely more on visual elements such as images, colors, and sounds rather than textual content.
This Oral-B marketing video serves as a prime example of rich meaning conveyed through the utilization of various semiotic resources. The diverse modes employed in the video span different domains, each offering unique affordances that collectively contribute to the communication's potential for meaning. The integration of modal resources follows a principle that underscores the significance of conversational structures, visual elements such as animate and inanimate objects, music, and color in conveying holistic meanings to the audience. These elements collectively act as propagators of the publicist's intended message, enhancing the overall impact of the video on viewers.
In written discourse, the use of the lexeme "You" functions as a deictic, directing the message towards a general audience, as seen in examples like "You clean your teeth every morning." This generic approach extends to phrases like "Your teeth" and "your mouth," emphasizing the broad applicability of the message. By addressing a wide audience, the communicator aims to establish a connection with linguistic elements such as long-lasting fresh breath, a fresh feeling, and strong, healthy teeth, all of which serve to highlight the dual qualities embodied in Oral-B products.
The lexical groups draw significant support from visual representations and non-verbal cues, as evidenced by the indexical appearances of Social Actor 1 and Social Actor 2 donning identical lab-coats to emphasize the dual benefits of the product to potential consumers. These visual elements prompt a collective argument that the New Oral-B 2-IN-1 Toothpaste not only enhances dental strength but also ensures enduring freshness, as depicted in instances 2a and 2b. In addition to the prominent display of the Oral-B branding throughout the LLMA, the seamless integration of spoken content with visual imagery is unmistakable. The actors consistently exhibit smiles, showcasing their teeth to the audience, which symbolize the positive outcomes of using Oral-B and the product's professional refinement. The white teeth and lab-coats serve as representations of the product's efficacy and the meticulous care it has undergone. The color white, traditionally associated with purity, is complemented by the calming yet bold blue color schemes, positioning the advertisement as both serene and audacious.
The study highlights the impact of Oral-B's 2-IN-1 toothpaste on fresh breath throughout the day, supported by evidence from Social Actor 3. The participant, a woman, brushes her teeth at 7:00 in the morning, experiencing lasting freshness until 13:00 at work and even until 19:00 upon returning home. Social Actor 3 expresses admiration for the product's efficacy with phrases like "So fresh," "Still fresh," and "And still fresh." The advertisement's settings include the Oral-B Dental Institute, a restroom, offices, and a home, where participants engage in communication activities involving head movements, personal distances, gestural tooth touching, and demonstrations of fresh breath sensation. The metaphorical communication in the ad, particularly the portrayal of 2-IN-1 as beneficial for Social Actors 1 and 2, underscores the dual qualities of Oral-B's product. While suitable for academic discourse, the complexity of the message may require simplification for broader understanding.
I would like to express my gratitude to Mrs. Bonke Adeyeni for her invaluable moral and financial support throughout the duration of this research project.
