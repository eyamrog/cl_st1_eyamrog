The aim of this study was to assess the impact of applying Bacillus cereus in conjunction with substrate utilization and a decrease in traditional fertilization on the growth of green dwarf coconut seedlings at the Santa Isabel nursery in Pará, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized, comprising four treatments: soil with 100% fertilization, soil with 50% fertilization and B. cereus, coconut fiber with 100% fertilization, and coconut fiber with 33% fertilization along with B. cereus, each replicated five times. Biochemical analyses were conducted on B. cereus, and field evaluations included biometric measurements, hormonal and nutritional profiling, analyzed using t-tests (P < 0.05). The B. cereus isolate exhibited the production of siderophores, IAA, and phosphate solubilization capabilities. Notably, the treatment involving inoculated coconut fiber and B. cereus demonstrated a reduction in nursery time by two months. Significant increases of 190% in IAA, 31% in GA3, and 17% in GA4 were observed. This combination also led to enhancements of 98% in N, 42% in P, 82% in K, 103% in Ca, 68% in Mg, 84% in B, and 41% in Fe compared to control plants receiving coconut fiber with 100% fertilization. Consequently, the utilization of B. cereus for cultivating coconut seedlings emerges as a technology that fosters accelerated development in nurseries while reducing the need for excessive inputs.
The cultivation of coconut trees holds significant economic and social significance, contributing to the value generated within its production chain. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Indonesia emerges as the leading global producer of coconuts, trailed by the Philippines, India, and Sri Lanka. Brazil secures the fifth position among the world's coconut-producing nations, with a production area spanning 215,700 hectares and an output of around 1,937,484 million fruits. Notably, 1,485,184 of these fruits are attributed to the cultivation of green dwarf and hybrid varieties (SINDCOCO, 2018).
To ensure the robust growth of coconut palm seedlings, it is imperative to prioritize the acquisition of high-quality genetic material, implement effective phyto-sanitary management practices, and optimize the use of synthetic fertilizers. The slow germination and irregular pre-formation of seedlings typically extend over a three-month period (RABELO et al., 2006). Additionally, the selection of an appropriate substrate is crucial, with careful consideration of its physical, chemical, and biological attributes (YAMANISHI et al., 2004). The production of coconut seedlings faces a significant challenge in the lengthy cycle duration before transplantation into the field, typically spanning from eight to 12 months, necessitating a substantial investment of time, resources, and services. Costs associated with fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, and labor must be factored in to ensure successful seedling cultivation (VINODHINI; DESHMUKH, 2017). The inefficiency of synthetic fertilizers often leads to leaching and atmospheric evaporation, resulting in significant losses (TILMAN, 1998; GYANESHWAR et al., 2002). Therefore, the judicious use of synthetic fertilizers is crucial not only for enhancing productivity but also for minimizing environmental harm (PAUNGFOO-LONHIENNE et al., 2019).
The utilization of microorganisms in agriculture is widely acknowledged as a promising and sustainable approach, particularly in the quest for reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers. Rhizobacteria play a crucial role in enhancing plant growth (Gange & Gadhave, 2018). Certain genera, such as Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp., have been identified as growth promoters in coconut seedlings (George et al., 2018). These rhizobacteria possess the capability to modify anatomical features, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency, hormonal balance, and nutrient uptake (Lucy et al., 2004; Lwin et al., 2012; Samaniego et al., 2016). Species like Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas sp., and Azuspirillum brasiliense exhibit diverse mechanisms for nutrient availability, including siderophore production, phosphate solubilization, and organic matter mineralization (Aziz et al., 2012; Sasirekhaa & Shivakumar, 2016; Numoto et al., 2019). Furthermore, they stimulate the synthesis of phytohormones like indole acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellins, which in turn promote root and shoot growth (Pahari & Mishra, 2017).
The aim of this study was to enhance the growth of coconut seedlings through the inoculation with Bacillus cereus, in conjunction with various substrates and decreased use of synthetic fertilizers.
The field experiment was carried out at Reunidas Sococo commercial farm situated in Santa Isabel do Pará, Brazil, at coordinates 1°13'26”S and 48°02'29”W.
A Bacillus cereus isolate was acquired from rhizospheric soil samples collected from commercial coconut palm plantations using serial dilution techniques as outlined by Fillippi et al. (2011). The isolate was then preserved in the crop collection of the Plant Protection Laboratory (LPP) at UFRA.
An isolate of B. cereus was cultured in Kado and Heskett's (1970) culture medium 523 for 24 hours at 28°C. The microbial growth material was then transferred to a micro-tube containing 567µL TE1x and subjected to shaking. Subsequently, 30µL of 10% SDS was added, followed by stirring, and then 3 µl of proteinase K was introduced, followed by shaking and incubation for 60 minutes at 37°C. Following this incubation period, 100 µL of 5 M NaCl was added, stirred, and then 80 µl of CTAB/NaCl was introduced, followed by stirring and a water bath at 65°C for 10 minutes. To this mixture, 780µL of isoamyl chloroform (24:1) was added, stirred for 10 minutes, and centrifuged for five minutes at 14,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was carefully transferred to new micro-tubes, and 960µL of ice-cold isopropanol was added. The micro-tube was then inverted until the DNA became visible and subsequently centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 25 minutes. After discarding the supernatant, 1mL of 70% ethanol was added, followed by centrifugation for 3 minutes at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was once again discarded, and the pellet was dried for 20 minutes in a slide chamber. The DNA was re-suspended in 100 µL of 0.1x TE and 6mg mL-1 ribonuclease, with an incubation at 25°C for 12 hours (DOYLE; DOYLE, 1990). The quantification of DNA was performed using a BioDrop µLite (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), resulting in a final concentration of 10 ngμL-1, and the DNA was stored at -20°C.
The UFRA19 isolate was identified using the 16S rDNA region gene with the assistance of 27F (5'- AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3') and 1492R (5'ACCTTGTTACGACTT-3') primers (Lane, 1991). The PCR amplification reaction consisted of 1X Master Mix 2X (Promega) containing 0.05 U μL-1 Taq DNA polymerase, 4 Mm MgCl2 reaction buffer, and 0.4 Mm of each DNTP; along with 10 µM of each primer and 50 ng DNA. Amplification of the 16S rDNA region was carried out in a thermal cycler (Eppendorf MasterCycler Nexus, Hamburg, Germany) with the following steps: initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 minutes; 25 cycles of 94°C for 1 minute, 55°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 1 minute; and a final extension at 72°C for 7 minutes.
The reactions underwent purification by combining 5 μL of PCR product with 2 μL of Exo-sap enzyme (Exonuclease / Alkaline Phosphatase). Purification was achieved through a thermal cycler, operating at 37°C for 4 minutes, followed by an 80°C incubation for 1 minute to irreversibly deactivate both enzymes. Subsequent to the purification process, sequencing was conducted using an automated sequencer ABI3730 housed at the Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Biology of the Federal University of Pernambuco (LABBE- UFPE).
The DNA sequence analysis and assembly of the UFRA19 isolate contigs were conducted utilizing the Staden Package (STADEN et al., 1998). Subsequently, the nucleotide sequence of the UFRA19 bacteria was compared to available isolate sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database using BLASTn software (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Following this, all sequences underwent alignment using MEGA. Bayesian Inference (IB) analysis was carried out using Mr. Bayes v.3.2.6 (RONQUIST et al., 2012) within CIPRES (https://www.phylo.org/portal2/home.action), employing the best nucleotide replacement model chosen based on Aikake's Information Criterion (AIC) via Mr. Modeltest 2.3 (Nylander 2004). The analysis involved 1,000,000,000 generations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), with sampling every 1,000 and 10,000 generations, and subsequent probabilities were computed after discarding the initial 25% generations. The trees generated from individual genes and concatenated through the IB method were visualized using Fig Tree 1.4.1 software (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtre).
The B. cereus isolate was cultured in Luria Bertani (LB) medium with agitation at 100 rpm and incubated at 28°C for 78 hours. Following incubation, 3 mL of the suspension underwent centrifugation at 4°C for 10 minutes at 4000 rpm (Moustaine et al., 2017). Subsequently, 90 µL of the supernatant and 60 µL of Salkowski reagent were combined in a separate micro-tube and left to incubate in darkness for 30 minutes to assess any change in media color (Gordon & Weber, 1951).
An isolate of B. cereus was introduced into test tubes filled with 10 mL of TSL medium (1:10 diluted) composed of 3 g in 1000 mL of distilled water. The tubes were then placed in an incubator at 28°C with agitation at 114 rpm for a duration of 24 hours. Following incubation, the tube containing the bacterial suspension underwent centrifugation for 10 minutes at 12,000 rpm. Subsequently, 1 mL of the resulting supernatant was carefully transferred into a separate tube containing 1 mL of blue chrome S (BCS) solution. After a period of fifteen minutes post-mixing, the isolate exhibited a color change from dark blue to yellow, indicating the production of siderophore as per the method described by Schwyn and Neilands in 1987.
The isolate of B. cereus was cultured in NBRIP growth medium as described by Nautiyal (1999), comprising 10 g of glucose, 2.5 g of Ca3(PO4)2, 25 g of MgCl2·6H2O, 0.25 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2 g of KCl, and 0.1 g of (NH4)2SO4, with a pH of 7.0 and the addition of 1.5% agar in triplicate. Following incubation for 14 days at 28°C, the presence of halos was assessed as an indicator of phosphate solubilization.
Seedlings of Brazilian green dwarf Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) at one month of age were utilized in a study employing a completely randomized design featuring four distinct treatments. These treatments included T1: soil with 100% of conventional fertilization, T2: soil with 50% of conventional fertilization along with the application of B. cereus, T3: coconut fiber with 100% of conventional fertilization, and T4: coconut fiber with 33% of conventional fertilization in addition to the application of B. cereus. Each treatment was replicated five times to ensure the robustness and reliability of the results obtained.
In this study, a Brazilian green dwarf coconut seedling received conventional fertilization over an eight-month cycle. The fertilization regimen included 18 g of Urea, 240 g of SFS (18% P2O5), 60 g of KCL (60% K2O), 30 g of MgO (30% Mg), and 3 g of Ulexite (10% B). Synthetic fertilization was applied in three plots at the first, third, and fifth months, following the methodology outlined by Lins and Viegas (2008).
The seedlings were cultivated in a 40 x 40 polyethylene bag using a soil substrate with the following chemical composition: pH (CaCl2) 3.9; 0.012g Kg-1 Ca; 0.03 g Kg-1 Mg; 0.019 g Kg-1 K; 0.004 g Kg-1 P; and 0.8% organic matter (OM). The coconut fiber substrate (Golden-Mix type 4-amafribra) exhibited the subsequent chemical profile: 0.086 g Kg-1 N; 0.264 g Kg-1 P; 0.580 g Kg-1 K; 0.128 g Kg-1 Ca; 0.447 g Kg-1 Mg; 272.86mg S; 42.25mg Na; 0.703 g Kg-1 B; 0.12 g/kg Cu; 0.5mg Fe; 0.6mg Mn; 0.78mg Zn; and 92.43% OM.
The bacterial suspension was standardized using a 550 nm Spectrophotometer (with Å550 = 0.1 corresponding to 108 CFU⋅mL-1) as described by Filippi et al. (2011), and the volume was adjusted to 300 mL per pot for each application. Two applications were carried out for each seedling in the experiment.
The biometric evaluations of coconut seedlings were conducted at two distinct time points. Seedlings cultivated in soil substrate were assessed at eight months of age, while those grown in coconut fiber substrate were evaluated at six months, attributed to root extravasation in the coconut fiber treatment. The parameters assessed included plant height, stem diameter, fresh mass of both the aerial part and roots, as well as the dry mass of the aerial part and roots.
The concentrations of the hormones AIA, GA3, GA4, and ACC, the phytohormone ethylene precursor, were determined as per the method described by Munné-Bosch (2011). Fresh tissue weighing 300 mg from the second leaf of the plants was promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and macerated in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, 40 mg of dry mass was measured, and 400 µL of extraction solvents (methanol: isopropyl alcohol: acetic acid 20: 79: 1) were added. The samples underwent four rounds of vortexing for 20 seconds each (on ice), followed by sonication for 5 minutes, a 30-minute incubation on ice, and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. Post-centrifugation, 350 µL of supernatant was transferred to a new micro-tube. Approximately 300 µL of the extract from the flasks was added, and 5 µL were injected into the NuBioMol LC/MS system at the Biomolecule Analysis Center, UFV, Brazil. An Agilent Eclipse chromatography column (RRHD, 1.8 µm, 2.1 x 50 mm) with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min was coupled to a triple quadrupole QQQ mass spectrometer (Agilent). Mass spectra were acquired in alternately negative/positive modes based on retention time for each hormone standard, and samples were scanned through Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) using specific mass transitions: JA 209>59; SA 137>93; ABA 263>153; ACC 106>56. The resulting mass spectra were processed using MassHunter Software to derive the extracted ion chromatograms (XIC) for each transition and corresponding area values, reflecting the abundance of each hormone. A calibration curve for each hormone, ranging from 0.1 to 300 ng/mL, was utilized to convert the XIC area values to ng/g of plant tissue, following the method outlined by Munné-Bosch (2011). Molecular mass spectra analysis was conducted using Skyline software.
To ascertain the phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and iron (Fe) contents, the plant material underwent drying, grinding, and subsequent nitro-perchloric digestion. Boron (B) analysis was conducted through dry digestion of the samples using the Azometrinah method. Nitrogen (N) content determination involved subjecting the plant material to sulfuric digestion as outlined by Malavolta, Vitti, and Oliveira (1997).
Differences among the means of the treatments were assessed using the t-test (p < 0.01). The data were analyzed utilizing R software version 3.5.1 (R, 2019).
The UFRA19 isolate sequence was analyzed using the BLASTn tool in GenBank, revealing a high identity of 99.79% with the Bacillus genus (ATCC14579T). Through the construction of a phylogenetic tree, the species of the Bacillus genus was identified, indicating a similarity to B. cereus species. The sequence has been officially deposited in GenBank under the name UFRA19 with the accession number MN393059 (Figure 1).
Phosphate solubilization was observed in the B. cereus isolate during the in vitro test, as evidenced by halo formation in the peripheral region of the rhizobacteria colonies. Upon exposure to CAS solution, the dark blue color of the solution turned yellow, indicating the isolate's ability to produce siderophores. Furthermore, the production of IAA by the isolate was confirmed through the reaction with Salkowski's reagent, as depicted in Figure 2.
Coconut palm seedlings cultivated in soil and subjected to B. cereus inoculation exhibited a notable 27% increase in height compared to non-inoculated seedlings on identical substrates. Similarly, Brazilian green dwarf coconut seedlings nurtured in coconut fiber and treated with B. cereus displayed significant enhancements, with a 26% height increase, a 47% boost in aerial biomass, and a 28% rise in root biomass (refer to Figure 3).
Inoculating B. cereus in combination with the soil substrate resulted in a notable enhancement of nitrogen, boron, and magnesium contents in green dwarf coconut seedlings, with increases of 23%, 49%, and 12% respectively. Moreover, the introduction of B. cereus in coconut fiber demonstrated a significant boost in macronutrients, showcasing a remarkable surge of 98% in nitrogen, 42% in phosphorus, 82% in potassium, 68% in magnesium, and 163% in calcium. Furthermore, the application of B. cereus led to a substantial increase of 68% in B micronutrients and 84% in iron content when compared to seedlings cultivated on coconut fiber substrate devoid of B. cereus inoculation, as illustrated in Figure 4.
Incorporating B. cereus into the soil led to a 60% rise in GA4 levels in Brazilian dwarf coconut palm seedlings, surpassing the levels observed in seedlings grown in soil devoid of B. cereus. Furthermore, the introduction of B. cereus into seedlings cultivated in coconut fiber resulted in significant enhancements, with a 190% increase in IAA, a 31% boost in GA3, and a 17% elevation in GA4 levels, in contrast to seedlings grown in coconut fiber without B. cereus application (refer to Figure 5).
In this study, it was observed that the inoculation of rhizobacteria in coconut fiber under reduced conventional fertilization treatment led to significant improvements in the growth, as well as alterations in hormonal and nutritional levels, of Brazilian green dwarf coconut seedlings.
In this study, the B. cereus isolate was identified through the analysis of the 16S rDNA region. The sequencing of the 16S rDNA region has proven to be instrumental in distinguishing between bacterial groups (Patwardhan et al., 2014), given its ubiquitous presence in all bacteria. By comparing the sequences of the 16S rDNA region of unknown bacteria with those deposited in databases (Clarridge, 2004; Patwardhan; Ray; Roy, 2014), identification becomes more precise. Previous studies have characterized isolates of this genus as growth promoters (Niu et al., 2011; Hassan et al., 2018).
The synergy between coconut fiber and B. cereus inoculation led to enhanced growth of coconut seedlings, accompanied by hormonal alterations and heightened nutritional value, along with a notable 67% decrease in synthetic fertilizer application. The superior growth observed in the coconut fiber medium as opposed to soil can be ascribed to its high porosity and moisture retention capabilities, which also facilitate the optimal colonization of B. cereus in the coconut fiber substrate. These combined factors facilitated the swift development of roots in coconut seedlings, subsequently enhancing the efficiency of nutrient absorption (GLICK, 2012).
The significant increase in root growth observed in coconut seedlings inoculated with B. cereus and cultivated on coconut fiber substrate can be attributed to the positive interaction facilitated by the release of root exudates that attract the bacteria to the root hairs, initiating infection (Sharma, Kumawat, & Kaur, 2016; Doornbos, Loon, & Bakker, 2012). This inoculation with B. cereus in the coconut fiber substrate induced alterations in root accumulation in seedlings, leading to a noticeable augmentation in both volume and quantity of thin roots, as illustrated in Figure 3. These changes are likely linked to the elevated concentration of indoleacetic acid (IAA) resulting from B. cereus inoculation. IAA, a phytohormone, plays a crucial role in regulating lateral root differentiation and elongation, as well as enhancing the formation of root hairs, thereby facilitating improved nutrient uptake (Bhardwaj, 2014; Turan et al., 2014). The enhanced growth observed following B. cereus inoculation suggests the potential of this isolate to modulate the activity of the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase, which controls ethylene synthesis by breaking down its precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) (Belimov et al., 2009; Siddikee et al., 2011), consequently mitigating the adverse effects on plant growth and enabling the development of a more robust root system (Glick et al., 1999).
Losses resulting from synthetic fertilization can occur due to volatilization, leaching, and adsorption, leading to low plant uptake (ISWAS; LADHA; DAZZO, 2000; GYANESHWAR et al., 2002). The utilization of B. cereus in conjunction with coconut fiber, along with 33% conventional fertilization, facilitated the effective utilization of nutrients and revealed a higher accumulation of both macro- and micro-nutrients. Previous research has demonstrated that the inoculation of corn plants with Bacillus aryabhattai S10 and B. subtilis ZM63 resulted in a 90% increase in phosphate levels, indicating phosphate solubilization (AHMAD et al., 2019). Similarly, the inoculation of mustard plants with Bacillus sp. PZ-1 exhibited efficiency in siderophore production, enhancing nutrient absorption (YU et al., 2017). Apart from the rhizobacteria themselves, which initiate mechanisms such as organic matter mineralization, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore production, thereby making nutrients accessible for absorption, these processes also promote enhanced nutrient uptake by plant roots (ARIF et al., 2017; CHERIF et al., 2017).
Inoculation with B. cereus combined with coconut fiber substrate and 33% conventional fertilization resulted in a notable increase in nutrient content ranging from 30% to 570%. The elevated levels of nitrogen (N) observed could be attributed to the biodegradation capabilities of B. cereus, facilitating the breakdown of organic matter and enhancing nutrient availability while reducing losses through leaching (PAUNGFOO-LONHIENNE et al., 2019). In wheat, the inoculation with B. megaterium SNji (BmeSNji) and Azospirillum brasilense 65B (Abr65B) led to improved N uptake and accumulation in plant biomass (NGUYEN et al., 2019). Coconut seedlings treated with B. cereus and 33% conventional fertilization exhibited higher phosphorus (P) content. Similarly, positive outcomes were observed in sugarcane with the application of Bacillus subtilis in conjunction with B. pumilus and in chickpea with the inoculation of Pseudomonas sp. (SANTOS; KANDASAMY; RIGOBELO, 2018; ZAHEER et al., 2019). These rhizobacteria genera possess the ability to enhance P availability through phosphate solubilization, involving the release of protons and secondary metabolites like organic acids or chelating cations that aid in phosphate anion uptake, along with the production of phosphatases and phytases enzymes that mineralize organic material by hydrolyzing H3PO4 esters and anhydrides (BISHOP et al., 1994; RICHARDSON, 1994).
The seedlings inoculated with B. cereus in coconut fiber exhibited the highest K absorption, similar to the findings in wheat inoculated with B. cereus, showing an increase of over 25% in K content and dry matter (HASSAN et al., 2018). The enhanced availability of K in rhizobacteria-inoculated plants may be attributed to solubilization processes, involving the production of organic acids like tartaric and citrus, as well as polysaccharides, as evidenced in B. mucilaginosus and B. Aphicu species (RICHARDS; BATES, 1989; LIN et al., 2002). These mechanisms could potentially be at play with B. cereus isolates inoculated in coconut seedlings. Furthermore, other essential nutrients such as Fe, Mg, Ca, B, and Mn could also be crucial for optimal plant growth. Notably, when coconut palm seedlings were inoculated with B. cereus in coconut fiber substrate, a notable increase in micronutrient content was observed. The bacteria might have facilitated iron availability through the production of organic acids or siderophores (KLOEPPER et al., 1980; NEILANDS, 1995; AHMED; HOLMSTROM, 2014), which are small molecules that chelate iron (BULGARELLI et al., 2013). Moreover, the contents of Ca, Mg, B, and Mn in B. cereus-inoculated coconut seedlings could have been boosted by its capacity to mineralize organic compounds, as seen in raspberry plants with the inoculation of Bacillus M3 alone or in combination with Bacillus OSU-142, resulting in increased levels of P, Fe, Ca, Mg, and Mn, alongside improved growth and yield (ORHAN et al., 2006).
Seedlings inoculated with B. cereus and grown on coconut fiber substrate, supplemented with 33% conventional fertilization, exhibited increased accumulation of dry matter in the aerial part, enhanced nutritional content, and higher concentrations of GA3 and GA4 gibberellins. This outcome likely stemmed from the augmented root development, which in turn stimulated the production of new leaves in the aerial section. The heightened synthesis of gibberellin in B. cereus-induced leaf tissue could be attributed to the direct production of gibberellin through gibberellin conjugation or the conversion of inactive gibberellins into active forms (LUCANGELI; BOTTINI, 1997; PICCOLI et al., 1997; CASSÁN et al., 2001). Similar to alder (Alnus glutinosa) plants, where the application of Bacillus sp. led to the production of various gibberellin isomers (GA1, GA3, GA4, and GA20) responsible for stem elongation (GUTIERREZ MUNERO et al., 2001). The utilization of coconut fiber substrate in conjunction with B. cereus emerges as a novel approach for coconut tree seedling production systems. Noteworthy among the factors contributing to the positive growth and development of the seedlings is the high organic matter content, approximately 92%, present in coconut fiber. Following mineralization and decomposition processes, this organic matter significantly aids in the supply and release of macro and micronutrients, while also maintaining optimal temperature and moisture levels in the substrate, creating a conducive environment for microbial activities. These microorganisms, acting as primary decomposition agents of organic matter, enhance the bioavailability of nutrients to the seedlings.
The benefits derived from inoculation with B. cereus in coconut fiber, such as enhanced accumulation of macro and micronutrients, increased levels of phytohormones, and greater biomass accumulation, along with a significant reduction in conventional fertilization by 67%, suggest that this approach could serve as a valuable asset in the production system of green dwarf coconut tree seedlings in Brazil.
