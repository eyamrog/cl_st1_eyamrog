Objective: This study aims to examine the spatial distribution of four-year cancer mortality rates in Mato Grosso state, Brazil, spanning from 2000 to 2015.
Methodology: This study employed an ecological design to analyze neoplasia-related mortality rates in the municipalities of Mato Grosso state from 2000 to 2015. Cancer mortality rates were determined by dividing the total number of cancer deaths in each quadrennium by the average population size in the two central years of the period, then multiplying by 10,000 inhabitants. The annual percentage change was calculated by dividing the linear regression coefficient by the initial cancer mortality rates in Mato Grosso state from 2000 to 2003. Thematic maps were created for each quadrennium using equal class intervals to visually represent the data.
Results: Cancer was responsible for 31,097 deaths in Mato Grosso state during the specified period, with 13,058 occurring in women and 18,039 in men, resulting in a male to female ratio of 1.38. The primary causes of cancer-related deaths during this timeframe were lung (12.2%), prostate (8.7%), stomach (7.7%), breast (6.0%), and liver (4.7%). Notably, there was a rise in the number of municipalities exhibiting rates exceeding 23.67 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants within the same period.
In conclusion, the study revealed a rise in cancer mortality rates and an increase in the percentage of municipalities exhibiting elevated mortality rates. Notably, a higher concentration of cancer-related deaths was observed in municipalities situated in the Western, Central-Southern, Southeastern, and Central-Northern regions of the state.
Chronic noncommunicable diseases represent a significant global health burden, accounting for the majority of deaths worldwide. Among these diseases, cancer stands out as a leading cause of mortality, posing a substantial obstacle to improving life expectancy on a global scale.
In 2016, approximately 41 million deaths were attributed to chronic noncommunicable diseases, with cancer accounting for 9 million (22%) of these fatalities. Projections for the year 2030 suggest a significant rise in cancer cases, with an estimated 26 million new cases and 17 million deaths globally. These statistics underscore the significant impact of cancer as a prominent cause of mortality on a global scale.
Between 1996 and 2010 in Brazil, a total of 2,023,038 cancer-related deaths were recorded, with 53.9% affecting men and 46.1% women. In 2017, the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among males in the country were bronchi and lung with a rate of 15.60 per 100,000, followed by prostate at 14.24 per 100,000, stomach at 8.82 per 100,000, esophagus at 6.41 per 100,000, and liver and biliary tract at 5.71 per 100,000. Among females in the same year, breast cancer had the highest mortality rate at 13.22 per 100,000, followed by bronchi and lung at 9.20 per 100,000, cervical cancer at 5.14 per 100,000, colon cancer at 4.62 per 100,000, and pancreatic cancer at 4.06 per 100,000.
The projected number of new cancer cases in Brazil from 2020 to 2022 stands at 625,000, with Mato Grosso state showing estimated crude rates of 252.04 per 100,000 for men and 217.31 per 100,000 for women.
Spatial analysis of data enables the examination of cases based on their distribution within a specific geographical area. It is crucial to note that spaces are not uniform, as spatial differentiation encompasses various other unique factors, including culture, education, income, genetics, and housing characteristics. This study holds particular significance as the environment possesses traits that can serve as risk factors for cancer occurrence. Moreover, the utilization of geoprocessing as an analytical tool in scientific research on cancer remains relatively unexplored, underscoring the importance of this study. The primary objective is to investigate the spatial distribution of four-year mortality rates from neoplasia between 2000 and 2015 in Mato Grosso, Brazil.
An ecological design study was conducted to analyze neoplasia-related mortality rates by municipality of residence in the state of Mato Grosso from 2000 to 2015.
The Brazilian Legal Amazon encompasses the jurisdiction of the Superintendence of Development of the Amazon (SUDAM) and includes the states of Rondônia, Acre, Amazonas, Roraima, Pará, Amapá, Tocantins, Mato Grosso, and the western section of Maranhão. Covering an expansive area of about 5,015,067.749 km², it represents roughly 58.9% of Brazil's total territory.
Population data for the state were obtained from IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) for the year 2018, indicating a total population of 3,441,998 inhabitants, with a population density of 3.36 inhabitants per square kilometer and a territorial area of 903,206,997 square kilometers. Mato Grosso is geographically divided into 7 regions and comprises 141 municipalities, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Mortality data were sourced from the Mortality Information System (SIM) databases, provided by the Mato Grosso State Department of Health. Cancer-related deaths were scrutinized within the spectrum of codes C00 to C97, in accordance with the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). These fatalities encompassed individuals across all age brackets. Population estimates segmented by age groups were retrieved from the website of the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System, Brazil's public healthcare system.
Mortality rates attributed to cancer were computed by dividing the total number of cancer-related deaths within each quadrennium by the average population size during the two central years of the period, then multiplying the result by 10,000 inhabitants. These rates underwent adjustment using the direct method based on age groups with four-year intervals, utilizing the global population distribution as the standard. To enhance the stability of mortality data analysis at the municipal level, efforts were made to mitigate random fluctuations by consolidating rates into four-year segments: 2000 to 2003, 2004 to 2007, 2008 to 2011, and 2012 to 2015.
An annual percentage change was determined by dividing the linear regression coefficient by the cancer mortality rates in Mato Grosso state at the onset of the study period (2000 to 2003), with a significance level set at 5%.
To investigate the spatial distribution of cancer mortality rates, thematic maps were generated for each quadrennium utilizing equal class intervals (0.00; 0.01-12.52; 12.53-23.67; 23.68-36.21; 36.22-48.00; above 48.00) derived from the initial quadrennium's (2000-2003) rate distribution. The analysis focused on the 141 municipalities of Mato Grosso, with the exclusion of Itanhangá and Ipiranga do Norte due to their establishment in 2005, rendering the calculation of mortality rates for the 2000-2003 quadrennium unfeasible and thus marked as missing data. Cartographic data were sourced from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Kernel maps were constructed with adaptive radii, utilizing nine strata divided into equal intervals for visualization and analysis.
For data analysis, the study utilized STATA version 12.0 and the ArcMap Program version 10.3. Approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics and Research Committee of Júlio Muller University Hospital.
From 2000 to 2015, cancer was responsible for 31,097 deaths in Mato Grosso state, with 13,058 occurring in women and 18,039 in men, resulting in a male to female ratio of 1.38. The primary causes of cancer-related deaths during this period were lung (12.2%), prostate (8.7%), stomach (7.7%), breast (6.0%), and liver (4.7%). The mortality rates in the state for the quadrenniums spanning 2000 to 2003, 2004 to 2007, 2008 to 2011, and 2012 to 2015 were 30.0, 32.4, 32.8, and 33.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively, indicating an average annual increase of 8.3% (p = 0.030) (data not shown).
Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of municipalities based on mortality rate intervals as delineated in the maps. Notably, there is a notable rise in the proportion of municipalities falling within the mortality rate ranges of 23.68 to 36.21, 36.22 to 48.00, and exceeding 48.00. Conversely, a declining trend is observed for municipalities within the intervals of 0.00, between 0.01 and 12.52, and 12.53 to 23.67.
Figure 3 illustrates the four-year trends in cancer mortality rates across municipalities, revealing a notable rise in the number of areas experiencing rates exceeding 23.67 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants during the specified period. The regions displaying the highest rates throughout the quadrenniums were West, Center-South, Southeast, Center-North, and North, whereas the Northeast and Northwest regions exhibited the lowest rates.
The kernel intensity map (Figure 4) confirms that the highest density of cancer mortality occurred in the West, Center-South, Southeast, and Center-North regions of the state, with the lowest rates observed in the Northeast and Northwest regions. This spatial distribution pattern appears consistent across the quadrenniums, with a noticeable decrease in mortality densities observed in the North and Northwest regions over the four-year period. Throughout the entire study period, the Northeast region consistently exhibited the lowest mortality densities compared to other regions.
The study revealed an average annual increase of 8.3% in cancer mortality rates, accompanied by a rise in the proportion of municipalities exhibiting higher mortality rates. Notably, municipalities situated in the West, Center-South, Southeast, and Center-North regions of the state demonstrated a higher density of cancer mortality.
The study's findings revealed spatial and temporal trends indicating a rise in standardized cancer mortality rates in Mato Grosso State between 2000 and 2015. Despite data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) showing that over 80% of the state's population is below 50 years old, cancer emerged as the second leading cause of death in mortality records (excluding external factors) as per the Mato Grosso Oncology Care Action Plan. Furthermore, there was a notable increase in the proportion of cancer-related deaths, escalating from 10.8% in 2001 to 14.3% in 2013.
The pattern observed in the state differed from the national trend, which has exhibited some level of stability in disease rates. A study detailing the primary causes of death from chronic non-communicable diseases between 1990 and 2015, based on estimates from the GBD (Global Burden of Disease) 2015 study, indicated that in Brazil, the standardized mortality rates for cancer decreased from 142.7 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1990 to 133.5 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015, remaining relatively stable throughout the analyzed period.
The five primary causes of cancer-related deaths in the state during the specified period, categorized by anatomical location, were lung, prostate, stomach, breast, and liver. Liver cancer, uniquely, was only prevalent in Mato Grosso, while the remaining types were also among the top five fatal cancers in Brazil, albeit not in the same ranking order.
According to the Global Cancer Observatory, lung cancer continues to be the primary cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths projected for 2018, constituting approximately 1 in 5 cancer fatalities. Prostate cancer ranks as the fifth most common cause of cancer mortality in men, while breast cancer holds the top position among women, representing around 1 in 4 cancer diagnoses in this demographic. Stomach cancer maintains its significance on a global scale, responsible for roughly 783,000 deaths, or 1 in 12 cancer-related fatalities. Additionally, liver cancer is identified as the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
The pattern of deaths observed in the state is linked to urbanized, industrialized areas with an aging demographic, mirroring trends seen in developed Western nations. However, the state also grapples with fatalities attributed to infection-related cancers like stomach cancer, which are largely preventable and typically more common in less developed countries.
Cancer is a multifactorial disease, with certain risk factors identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as being closely linked to the majority of deaths caused by chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer, thereby significantly impacting the overall disease burden. Key factors contributing to this burden include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor dietary habits, and lack of physical activity.
Data from the National Health Survey for Mato Grosso revealed that merely 37.0% of the state's population aged 18 or older adhered to the recommended intake of fruits and vegetables. Additionally, a significant 52.9% were categorized as insufficiently active, trailing behind only Rondônia state in this regard. Furthermore, 24.3% reported weekly alcohol consumption, and 12.8% identified as current users of tobacco products.
A higher proportion of deaths was observed among men, which can be attributed to the prevalence of the three main types of cancer in this demographic. A study focusing on the temporal trend of cancer mortality in Brazil from 1996 to 2010, along with projecting mortality rates from 2011 to 2030, revealed that 53.9% of deaths occurred in men compared to 46.1% in women. Notably, while female mortality rates remained stable, there was a significant upward trend in mortality among males during the period from 1996 to 2008.
Existing literature indicates that there are disparities in life expectancies and health habits between men and women, with women exhibiting a higher utilization of health services and a greater inclination towards preventive healthcare measures compared to men.
Spatial analysis of cancer mortality, facilitated by mapping techniques, serves as a crucial method for assessing health risks, particularly when environmental factors are taken into account. The visual representation of data enhances comprehension of the interconnections at play, aiding in the identification of high-priority regions and offering insights into the dynamics of health and disease. This approach also supports more informed health planning initiatives.
The utilization of geoprocessing enables a retrospective examination of the demand for healthcare services, facilitating the enhancement of care provision in healthcare facilities and leading to significant alterations in epidemiological and operational metrics.
The analysis conducted revealed that the West, Center-South, Southeast, Center-North, and North regions of the state exhibited the highest mortality rates. These regions displayed variations that could be elucidated through socioeconomic indicators of the municipalities within them, highlighting disparities in infrastructure and public and private investments, particularly in areas with lower economic activity. Despite the heterogeneity among these regions, a common trend emerged - a general lack of primary care services, coupled with deficiencies such as low health care expenditures in the West Region, limited availability of specialized healthcare facilities in the West and North Regions, and inadequate outpatient care services in medium and high complexity in the West, North, and Center-North Regions.
In the realm of primary health care services, they function as the entry point to the broader health care system. Insufficient availability of these services can hinder the early detection of initial cancerous lesions, leading to specialized services becoming the primary sites for diagnosis. This shift occurs because confirming these lesions necessitates resources and procedures exclusive to medium and high complexity facilities.
Another defining characteristic of the state is that, apart from select municipalities in the Center-South region, agriculture and services serve as the primary economic pillars across nearly all regions within the state.
Mato Grosso currently stands as the leading state in Brazil for soy, corn, cotton, and cattle production, making it a pivotal region for agribusiness expansion over the years. The predominant model in this state revolves around large monoculture properties, the intensive application of chemical and pesticide fertilizers for weed control, and the utilization of biotechnology, particularly transgenics. This situation is underscored by the elevated cancer mortality rates observed in municipalities near the BR-163 federal highway, as depicted in Figure 3. The correlation between soy cultivation, which involves transgenic crops and the use of potentially carcinogenic pesticides, and the proximity of the highway for exporting produce to other nations likely explains this phenomenon.
The state harbors municipalities that serve as focal points for a significant portion of the country's agricultural output, particularly those situated in the central and southeast regions. As a result of the prevalent reliance on chemical-intensive farming practices, these areas exhibit elevated levels of pesticide consumption.
The association between exposure to pesticides and the development of cancer has been well-documented in numerous studies (30-33), with this relationship being influenced by factors such as the specific type of pesticide used, duration of exposure, and the quantity absorbed by the body (34). It is crucial to emphasize that the general population is at risk of multiple pesticide exposures, not solely limited to farmers and individuals directly involved in pesticide production, as these chemicals can also be ingested through contaminated water and food sources (35).
One potential limitation of the study pertains to the possibility of incorrect or incomplete information being filled out on death certificates regarding the causes of death. Notably, there was no adjustment made for deaths attributed to ill-defined causes. Nevertheless, there has been a decline in deaths from such causes over recent decades across all regions of Brazil, particularly in non-capital cities. This trend suggests an enhancement in the accuracy of data recorded in the Mortality Information System, particularly concerning malignant neoplasms. The quality of information pertaining to the primary cause of death within this category appears to be superior compared to other groups of causes.
In 2015, the United Nations embraced a collection of 17 objectives within a sustainable development agenda. Among these goals is an emphasis on diminishing premature mortality resulting from noncommunicable diseases through preventive measures and effective treatment strategies. Consequently, there exists a pressing global imperative to track the patterns in mortality rates associated with these illnesses, facilitated by robust information systems, to ascertain the progress towards meeting both national and international obligations.
The depiction of cancer mortality holds significant potential for enhancing epidemiological investigations grounded in the person-space-time triad. Such large-scale studies are imperative, particularly in Mato Grosso, given the scarcity of research on this subject. Understanding this context could aid in pinpointing priority areas for interventions aimed at lowering mortality rates.
