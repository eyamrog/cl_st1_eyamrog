SARS-CoV-2, along with its predecessors SARS-CoV from 2003 and MERS-CoV from 2012, belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus within the Nidovirales order and is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 manifests with symptoms such as cough, fever, fatigue, and in severe cases, pneumonia, impacting over 9.1 million individuals globally as of June 22nd, 2020. This article provides an overview of the cellular mechanisms involved in the replication of human coronaviruses, focusing on the distinctive molecular processes associated with the replication transcription complex (RTC) of these viruses. It delves into the interactions between viral and cellular proteins, shedding light on the host-pathogen implications in coronavirus biology. Additionally, the review discusses current efforts in developing pharmacological interventions against COVID-19, emphasizing the potential impacts of various drugs on the molecular events of viral replication. The aim of this review is to contribute to future research endeavors aimed at enhancing our comprehension of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and facilitating the development of pharmacological strategies targeting COVID-19.
The initial coronavirus outbreak occurred in Guangdong province, China, in 2002 and 2003, resulting in 8,098 cases and 774 deaths globally, with a mortality rate of approximately 9% (Fehr and Perlman, 2015), leading to the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Subsequently, in 2012, the Middle East witnessed the onset of another outbreak known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), with an alarming initial mortality rate of nearly 50%, although it was eventually brought under control in the subsequent years. The year 2014 saw the emergence of MERS-CoV, reporting 855 cases and 333 deaths, with a mortality rate of 40%, as documented by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (Fehr and Perlman, 2015). Prior to these significant outbreaks, coronaviruses were generally thought to cause only mild, self-limiting respiratory tract infections in humans.
In December 2019, a cohort of patients from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, were initially diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown etiology, epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wildlife market in the city (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020). Subsequent reports indicated the potential for a coronavirus outbreak, with the reproduction number for the new 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19, as designated by WHO on 11 February 2020) significantly exceeding 1, estimated to be within the range of 2.24 to 3.58 (Zhao et al., 2020). From then until June 22nd, 2020, the global tally of confirmed cases has surged to 9,154,232, with 473,849 fatalities reported (Coronavirus Resource Center, John Hopkins University).
Symptoms of COVID-19 infection typically manifest after an incubation period of around 5.2 days. The duration from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to death has a median of 14 days, with a range spanning from 6 to 41 days. Common initial symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, fever, and fatigue, with additional manifestations such as sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, diarrhea, dyspnoea, and lymphopenia reported in some cases (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020).
The Coronaviridae family, belonging to the Nidovirales order, is categorized into two subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. Within the Coronavirinae subfamily, there exist four genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV, is the virus responsible for COVID-19 and, along with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, falls under the Betacoronavirus genus. Research indicates that SARS-CoV-2 shares an 88% genetic identity with two SARS-like coronaviruses found in bats (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, surpassing the similarities with SARS-CoV (approximately 79%) and MERS-CoV (around 50%) (Lu et al., 2020). Another study reveals a 91.02% genetic resemblance between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and Pangolin-CoV, despite a higher 96.2% identity with another bat coronavirus (RaTG13) (Zhang et al., 2020c). The genome of coronaviruses consists of single-stranded positive RNA (ssRNA+), placing them in class IV of the Baltimore classification (Baltimore, 1971). Structurally, the coronaviruses' genome can be segmented into two primary sections: the genes responsible for non-structural poly-proteins pp1a and pp1b, and the genes encoding structural proteins such as S, E, M, and N, as illustrated in Figure 1.
The replication process of SARS-CoV-2 initiates with the translation of the pp1a and pp1b polyproteins from the single-stranded positive polarity genomic RNA (ssRNA+), which is 5’-capped and 3’-polyadenylated (see figure 1). The pp1b polyprotein is synthesized in conjunction with pp1a via a -1 frameshift mechanism, resulting in the production of two polyproteins, namely pp1a (without frameshift) and pp1ab (with frameshift) (Brierley et al., 1989). This frameshift event is triggered by a slippery sequence in the genome (5’-UUUAAAC-3’) and a pseudoknot structure within the RNA's secondary structure preceding the STOP codon of the pp1a ORF. These elements induce a ribosomal pause, leading to the translation of the pp1b ORF in fusion with the pp1a ORF, ultimately yielding the pp1ab polyprotein (Fehr and Perlman, 2015).
Upon synthesis, the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins undergo proteolytic cleavage, resulting in the formation of a total of 16 proteins as delineated in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1. This cleavage process is facilitated by two proteases, namely nsp3, identified as a Papain-like protease (PLpro), and nsp5, recognized as a 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Nsp3 is responsible for cleaving the sites between nsp2 to nsp4, leading to the generation of nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3. Conversely, nsp5 cleaves the remaining sites, thereby producing the remaining non-structural proteins (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Báez-Santos et al., 2015).
The subsequent steps in coronavirus replication and transcription are depicted in Figure 2 below. Following production and processing, a portion of the non-structural proteins, along with nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), come together to form the Replication and Transcription Complex (RTC). The primary function of RTC is to generate a series of single-stranded negative RNAs (ssRNA-), which include copies of the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs. These negative RNA intermediates, constituting approximately 1% of their positive counterparts, contain anti-leader sequences located in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of the antigenome and in the 3’-UTR of the genome (Sethna et al., 1991). Conversely, leader sequences are present in the 5’-UTR of the viral genome and the 3’-UTR of the antigenome. These leader and anti-leader sequences play a crucial role in initiating replication and transcription by the RTC. Additionally, the 5’-UTR of the genome and the start of each open reading frame (ORF) in the structural genes contain Transcriptional Regulatory Sequences (TRS), as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. In the transcription of ssRNA molecules, two mechanisms can occur, as per the established model of coronavirus replication (Pasternak et al., 2006; Sawicki et al., 2007).
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RTC) binds to the 3’ anti-leader sequence of the viral genome, triggering the initiation of negative RNA synthesis that progresses along the molecule until it reaches the leader region at the 5’ end. This process results in the creation of a full-length copy of the genome with negative polarity, known as the antigenome. Subsequently, the antigenome acts as a template for the production of the positive-sense genome, as illustrated in Figure 2 (processes 1a and 1b).
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RTC) has the ability to temporarily halt transcription within the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) regions of each open reading frame (ORF) and instead proceed with transcription in the 5’-untranslated region (UTR) of the genome due to the complementary nature of the TRS regions. Consequently, a leader sequence is integrated into each RNA molecule, resulting in the production of subgenomic RNAs with negative polarity. These subgenomic RNAs act as templates for the synthesis of mRNA with a positive polarity, with their 3’ regions aligning with the genomic RNA terminus (refer to figure 2, processes 2a and 2b). This mechanism, often referred to as the "copy-choice" mechanism, is observed in various viruses and facilitates recombination, a topic that will be further explored later in this discussion (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011).
Upon completion of the synthesis of the complete genomic RNA and mRNAs encoding each structural ORF, the translation process commences, leading to the production of essential proteins such as S, E, M, and N, crucial for viral particle assembly, among others (ORFs 3a, 6, 7a/b, 8, and 9). The specific functions of these proteins will be elucidated subsequently. Subsequently, the viral replication cycle progresses as the N protein interacts with viral genomic RNA, resulting in the formation of the nucleocapsid within the cytosol. Conversely, the synthesis of S, E, and M proteins is targeted towards the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) (Fehr and Perlman, 2015). Ultimately, interactions facilitated by these structural proteins lead to the recruitment of nucleocapsids into the ERGIC (Endoplasmic Reticulum - Golgi Intermediate Compartment) situated between the RER and the Golgi apparatus, culminating in the exocytosis of viral particles (Fehr and Perlman, 2015). Notably, coronaviruses exhibit a propensity for high mutation and recombination rates, resulting in alterations in viral protein characteristics, host range, and pathogenicity. For instance, reports indicate heterologous recombination between subgroup A Betacoronavirus and other viruses, with some coronaviruses possessing the hemagglutinin esterase gene derived from influenza C virus (Zeng et al., 2008). Recombination events between coronaviruses infecting different species are also well-documented and may account for the genomic similarities observed between human SARS-CoV-2 and bat or pangolin coronaviruses (Lu et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020). Several factors contribute to this heightened recombination and mutation capacity:
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses exhibits low fidelity, despite the presence of a 3’-5’ exonuclease proofreading activity. Research indicates that the mutation rate of this polymerase is approximately 2.0 × 10-6 mutations per site, per replication cycle (Eckerle et al., 2010).
The distinctive RNA replication mechanism involving TRS motifs, referred to as the "copy-choice" mechanism, has the potential to trigger homologous RNA recombination among genes from various coronaviruses (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011).
Coronaviruses possess the largest genome size among RNA viruses, typically ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases (kb) (Terada et al., 2014).
Several studies have elucidated the modulation of cellular pathways by coronavirus proteins, either favoring the viral cycle or impacting viral pathogenesis, as succinctly outlined in Table 2. Notably, interactions have been identified between the coronavirus nsp1 protein and cyclophilins PPIA, PPIG, PPIH, and FKBP1A, FKBP1B, which have the capacity to modulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway crucial for immune cell activation (Pfefferle et al., 2011). Utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system, this study demonstrated these interactions and further revealed that the inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) impeded the replication of various CoVs, including human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, CoV-229E, -NL-63, feline CoV, and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Additionally, another investigation highlighted the interaction between SARS-CoV nsp2 and cellular prohibitins, suggesting a potential role for this nsp in disrupting intracellular host signaling (Cornillez-Ty et al., 2009).
The PLpro protein (nsp3) from SARS-CoV significantly activated the TGF-β1 promoter through ROS/p38-MAPK/STAT3, leading to the positive regulation of pro-fibrotic responses in vitro and in vivo (Li et al., 2016). In another study, it was demonstrated that p53 suppresses SARS-CoV replication and is targeted by nsp3 through an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Ma-Lauer et al., 2016). Additionally, the viral protease, 3CLpro (nsp5), was found to cleave STAT2, but not JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, and IRF9, crucial components of the JAK-STAT pathway, thereby counteracting type I interferon signaling (Zhu et al., 2017).
Coronaviruses' nsp6 has been identified as a factor that disrupts autophagy by restricting the diameter of autophagosomes during omegasome formation, potentially aiding viral infection by impeding the autophagy system's ability to degrade viral components through lysosomes (Cottam et al., 2014). Additionally, research has shown that the coronavirus endoribonuclease nsp15 plays a crucial role in evading dsRNA sensors and apoptosis, as the absence of nsp15 activity has been linked to disease attenuation in mice and the induction of a protective immune response (Deng et al., 2017). Furthermore, nsp16 has been found to suppress the functions of RIG-I and MDA5, thereby dampening innate immunity and facilitating viral replication (Shi et al., 2019).
An important recent study delved into the cellular pathways associated with coronaviruses' Replication and Transcription Complex (RTC), utilizing MHV (mouse hepatitis virus) as a model (V’kovski et al., 2019). The research revealed that RTC interacts with translation initiation factors, suggesting a transient significance during specific phases of the replication cycle rather than persisting throughout. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the knockdown of certain factors like eIF3E, eIF3F, and eIF3I had a notable impact on MHV replication. Additionally, proteins linked to transport and intracellular organization were found to be associated with RTC in this investigation.
Among the structural proteins of coronaviruses, the S, E, M, and N proteins are considered essential. The homotrimers of the S protein are responsible for forming spikes on the viral surface, giving the virion a crown-like appearance and lending the family Coronaviridae its name. These spikes play a crucial role in binding to host receptors. The S protein, with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa, contains an N-terminal signal sequence that allows access to the endoplasmic reticulum (RER) for its synthesis and is heavily N-terminal glycosylated. The trimeric S glycoprotein functions as a class I fusion protein and is involved in mediating host receptor binding. Recent research has identified angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, with the trimeric S protein acting as its ligand. Furthermore, the serine protease TMPRSS2, which targets ACE2, facilitates the cellular entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. An inhibitor of TMPRSS2, camostat mesylate, has been shown to partially inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The E protein is crucial in the assembly and release of virions from cells, playing a significant role in viral pathogenesis (DeDiego et al., 2007). This protein, with a size of approximately 8-12 kDa, is present in limited quantities within the virion. It functions as a homopentameric transmembrane protein, featuring an N-terminal ectodomain, a C-terminal endodomain, and ion channel activity. While this ion channel activity is not essential for viral replication in SARS-CoV, it does impact viral pathogenesis (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014). Recombinant viruses lacking the E protein are viable but attenuated, unlike other structural proteins, with the extent of attenuation varying based on the virus type (DeDiego et al., 2007). The E protein interacts with the M membrane protein in the budding compartment of the cell, situated in the ERGIC (Chen et al., 2009a). In SARS-CoV, the E protein interacts with the PALS1 protein (Protein Associated with Lin-Seven 1) through the PDZ binding motif in its C-terminal domain, leading to a delay in the formation of tight junctions and altering epithelial morphogenesis (Teoh et al., 2010). Additionally, research has shown that palmitoylation of the E protein is essential for the assembly of murine coronavirus (Boscarino et al., 2008).
The M protein, with three transmembrane domains, plays a crucial role in virion structure by inducing membrane curvature and binding to the nucleocapsid (Neuman et al., 2011). This protein, the most abundant in the virion, weighs around 25–30 kDa and features a small glycosylated ectodomain at the N-terminal and a larger C-terminal endodomain extending 6 to 8 nm within the viral particle (Nal et al., 2005). Within the virion, the M protein forms dimers and can assume two distinct conformations, interacting with both the nucleocapsid N protein and the S protein (Neuman et al., 2011). The interaction with the nucleocapsid N protein is crucial for virion assembly and is pinpointed to the C-terminal endodomain of the M protein and the N protein CTD (Hurst et al., 2005). Additionally, interactions with the E protein have been documented (Chen et al., 2009a). The M protein orchestrates most of the protein-protein interactions essential for coronavirus assembly. While the expression of M protein alone does not lead to virus-like particle (VLP) formation, co-expression with the E protein results in VLP formation, underscoring the collaborative role of these two proteins in coronavirus envelope production. Furthermore, studies have shown that when the surface proteins S, M, and E of coronaviruses are expressed individually, they exhibit distinct subcellular localizations, hinting at the potential requirement for additional cellular or viral factors for coordinated trafficking to the viral assembly site in the ERGIC (Nal et al., 2005).
The viral nucleocapsid protein, N protein, comprises two distinct domains: the N-terminal RNA binding domain (RBD) spanning residues 45-181 and the C-terminal dimerization domain (DD) spanning residues 248-365. These domains, as reported by Chang et al. (2006), do not interact with each other and are connected by flexible linkers. N protein has been shown to bind to nsp3, facilitating the binding of the viral genome to the RTC and the packaging of the encapsidated genome in virions, as indicated by Hurst et al. (2009) and Chen et al. (2020b). The interaction between N and nsp3 is proposed to tether the genome to newly translated RTCs early in infection, as suggested by Hurst et al. (2013). Furthermore, one of the N protein domains plays a crucial role in recognizing the M protein during virus assembly within cells. The interaction of N protein and the viral nucleocapsid with membrane proteins S, E, and M for viral packaging occurs in the ERGIC, leading to the formation of mature virions that are subsequently released from cells through exocytosis via Golgi, as described by de Haan and Rottier (2005). The expression of N protein enhances the formation of VLPs, indicating that the fusion of encapsidated genomes in the ERGIC contributes to improved viral envelope formation, as observed by Siu et al. (2008).
Several targets of the N protein in cellular interactions have been proposed in the literature. For instance, a study by Cui et al. (2015) revealed that the coronavirus N protein acts as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR), as evidenced by the promotion of MHV-A59 coronavirus replication in RNAi-active cells upon ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV N protein. Conversely, this effect was not observed in RNAi-depleted cells. Additionally, a proteomics investigation conducted by Emmott et al. (2013) identified interactions between the coronavirus N protein and various cellular components, such as ribosomal proteins, translation initiation factors, nucleolar proteins, helicases, and hnRNPs. Some of these interactions, like those with NONO and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), were potentially RNA-mediated, while interactions with caprin-1, G3BP-1, and G3BP-2, involved in cytoplasmic stress granule formation, elucidated the localization of the N protein within these structures. The interaction between the N protein and NCL, as reported by Chen et al. (2002), offers a plausible explanation for the nucleolar localization of coronavirus N proteins. Furthermore, the functional significance of cellular targets for viral replication, such as NCL, RPL19, or GSK3 proteins, was underscored through RNA-interference depletion experiments, underscoring their importance in coronavirus biology (Emmott et al., 2013).
In addition to pp1ab, S, E, M, and N proteins, SARS-CoV-2 also contains at least 5 additional ORFs, namely ORF3a, ORF6a, ORF7a/7b, ORF8, and ORF10, for which limited information is available regarding their molecular mechanisms in the viral replication cycle. Research indicates that SARS-CoV ORF3a interacts with TRAF3 and ASC, leading to TRAF3 ubiquitination and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Siu et al. 2019). Furthermore, studies have shown that ORF3a exhibits binding affinities for caveolin-1 and calcium (Padhan et al. 2007; Minakshi et al. 2014). SARS-CoV ORF6 is found in the ER and Golgi membranes of infected cells, where it binds to karyopherin alpha 2 and karyopherin beta 1 proteins, impeding STAT1 nuclear import and function (Frieman et al. 2007). Additionally, research suggests an interaction between nsp8 and ORF6, hinting at a potential role of the ORF6 protein in virus replication (Kumar et al. 2007).
Coronavirus ORF7a has been identified as a type I IFN antagonist, particularly in the presence of ORF3 protein, shielding the virus from the antiviral effects induced by this cytokine (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2014). Additionally, ORF7a protein interacts with BST-2 (Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 or tetherin), an antiviral protein that hinders SARS-CoV infection by impeding its glycosylation; the absence of ORF7a results in significantly enhanced restriction (Taylor et al., 2015). Furthermore, ORF7a expression has been linked to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in HEK 293 cells through the cyclin D3/pRb pathway (Yuan et al., 2006). Another investigation suggests that the translation of SARS-CoV ORF7b might occur via ribosomal leaky scanning, with localization in the Golgi compartment and incorporation into viral particles (Schaecher et al., 2007). Lastly, a study has proposed that SARS-CoV ORF8 potentially originated from recombination with a SARS-related coronavirus found in bats, potentially influencing animal-to-human transmission (Lau et al., 2015).
To delve deeper into the cellular proteins linked to coronaviruses' biology, we conducted Ingenuity Pathway Analysis utilizing the proteins outlined in table 2. This analysis facilitated the compilation of a canonical pathways list, as depicted in table 3, which could play a crucial role or be influenced during the replication phase of coronaviruses. The selection of the top 10 pathways was based on their respective p-values. The modulation of pivotal molecular entities, such as the p53 and mTOR pathways, the suppression of the host immune response through the control of IFN induction, and alterations in cell cycle and growth, have shown strong associations with coronaviruses' proteins. These occurrences might induce a proliferative environment that supports viral replication while impeding apoptosis, thereby aiding viral cycle advancement.
SARS-CoV infects monocytes/macrophages poorly, despite the expression of viral proteins. Replication in these cell types remains incomplete, leading to a response characterized by low levels of IFN-β and elevated levels of chemokines such as IP-10 and MCP-1, potentially contributing to the inflammatory response implicated in the disease's pathogenesis (Cheung et al., 2005). In contrast, dendritic cells infected by SARS-CoV exhibit low levels of IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL12p40, moderate levels of TNF-α and IL-6, and high levels of MIP-1A, IP-10, and MCP-1 (Law et al., 2005). SARS-CoV demonstrates a delayed induction of IFN-α (Spiegel, 2006). When compared to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) and Newcastle virus, SARS-CoV elicits lower levels of IFN-α, β, and γ, irrespective of viral replication. In contrast to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV can establish a productive infection in human macrophages, triggering higher levels of IL-12, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, RANTES, and IL-8 (Zhou et al., 2014).
The low activation of the IFN pathway is facilitated by viral regulation of IRF3, a transcription factor that becomes activated through phosphorylation or polyubiquitination, subsequently translocating to the nucleus to induce IFN response genes (Chattopadhyay et al., 2016). SARS-CoV PLpro hinders IRF3 phosphorylation, thereby impeding its nuclear translocation and disrupting the IFN response, potentially by inhibiting STING (stimulator of interferon genes), which is responsible for IRF3 phosphorylation (Chen et al., 2014). The Nsp3 DUB domain of MHV-A59 and SARS-CoV facilitates the deubiquitination of IRF3, preventing its activation and blocking NF-κB signaling (Frieman et al., 2009). MERS-CoV PLpro has also been reported to impede IRF3 nuclear translocation (Yang et al., 2014), with interferon inhibition playing a crucial role in determining the virulence of coronaviruses (Niemeyer et al., 2018). Additionally, the SARS-CoV Nsp1 protein contributes to IFN inhibition by reducing STAT1 phosphorylation (Wathelet et al., 2007). Meanwhile, the ORF3a protein induces ER stress, activates PERK (PKR-like ER Kinase), and facilitates the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IFNAR1, thereby dampening the interferon response (Minakshi et al., 2009). The SARS-CoV N protein has also been identified as inhibiting IFN production at an early stage by sequestering PACT (protein activator of the dsRNA-activated protein kinase R) and TRIM25 (tripartite motif protein 25), which are involved in binding to RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) to activate IFN production (Ding et al., 2017). Lastly, ORF4b of MERS-CoV is another protein known to inhibit IFN and NF-κB signaling (Matthews et al., 2014).
Modulation of STAT3 is a crucial factor in both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. For instance, SARS-CoV PLpro has been shown to trigger TGF-β1 activation via the p38MAPK/ERK1-2 pathway, thereby facilitating STAT3 activation (Li et al., 2016). Studies on MERS-CoV variants with mutations in NSP3 and ORF4a have revealed distinct patterns of STAT3 activation and inflammatory cytokine profiles (Selinger et al., 2014). In the context of SARS-CoV infection, a decrease in IL-4, essential for humoral protection, is noted alongside an increase in IFN-γ, crucial for robust cell-mediated immune responses, and an elevation in IL-10, which is associated with disease susceptibility (Zhu, 2004).
SARS-CoV has been reported to halt the cell cycle by interacting with cyclin D and inhibiting the CDK4/Cyclin D complex, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of the Rb protein, a key regulator of cell cycle progression (Surjit et al., 2006). Additionally, IBV infection has been found to decrease Cyclin D1 levels, which are crucial for the G2/M transition, leading to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase (Harrison et al., 2007).
The inhibition of G0/G1 progression has been observed as a result of the actions of SARS-CoV ORF7a and ORF3a proteins, which lead to a decrease in cyclin D3 expression, reduced activity of cyclin D/CDK4/6, and the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation (Yuan et al., 2006). Additionally, Nsp15 has the capability to modify the cellular localization and function of Rb, facilitating pRb ubiquitination and degradation, thereby increasing the proportion of cells in the S-phase. Conversely, the overexpression of ORF4 (3b) protein has been shown to arrest the cell cycle at G0/G1 and induce apoptosis (Yuan et al., 2005; Bhardwaj et al., 2012).
The expression of viral proteins plays a crucial role in regulating cell fate by influencing not only the cell cycle but also apoptosis, which is essential for viral replication. For instance, the SARS-CoV S protein has been shown to suppress the extrinsic apoptotic pathway by downregulating TRAIL and FasL, while simultaneously activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through the upregulation of Bax and the down-regulation of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and MDM2. This leads to increased levels of p53 and p21 induction, ultimately resulting in G1/S arrest (Yeung et al., 2008). Additionally, the ORF9b protein, when accumulated in the nucleus, triggers caspase 3-mediated apoptosis (Sharma et al., 2011). The SARS-CoV E protein, on the other hand, inhibits apoptosis by down-regulating IRE-1 and DUSP1/10 proteins, which are critical regulators of the innate immune response and apoptosis (DeDiego et al., 2011). The SUD domain of PLpro interacts with RCHY1, promoting p53 degradation and influencing cell cycle and apoptosis control. Interestingly, p53 overexpression has been shown to inhibit viral replication (Ma-Lauer et al., 2016). Moreover, SARS-CoV has been found to promote the expression of a truncated form of p53 that inhibits apoptosis mediated by wild-type p53 (Leong et al., 2005), a phenomenon supported by the observation that Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) production is increased in p53 knockout cells (Hao et al., 2019).
Protein synthesis pathways are frequently targeted and manipulated by viruses. RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, often activate the PKR pathway as a crucial cellular defense mechanism, which is then countered by the viruses themselves. For instance, the Dengue virus is known to sustain the activation of the cap-dependent machinery during the early stages of infection, but later switches to a cap-independent process by downregulating key factors like p70-S6K, 4E-BP1, and eIF4. Similarly, the SARS-CoV ORF3a induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, triggering the activation of eIF2α and PERK, ultimately suppressing type 1 IFN signaling and impacting innate immunity. While PKR and PERK can lead to the phosphorylation of EIF2a, inhibiting host translation, studies have shown that SARS-CoV replication remains unaffected by PKR knockdown, suggesting the virus has developed mechanisms to bypass the inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2α on its mRNA translation. Conversely, research indicates that the depletion of the antiviral PKR pathway can actually enhance virus replication, leading to increased SARS-CoV protein expression and virus production.
Metformin and rapamycin are recognized as modulators of viral infection and translation control pathways, particularly mTOR. An example of this modulation is evident in the 1971 influenza outbreak, where diabetic patients treated with phenformin and buformin exhibited a lower incidence of infection compared to those treated with sulfonylureas or insulin (Lehrer, 2020). Recently, there has been a proposal for the immunoregulation of COVID-19 using mTOR inhibitors like rapamycin (Zheng et al., 2020).
Severe infection with the coronavirus results in epithelial cell proliferation and macrophage infiltration in the lungs (Nicholls et al., 2003), potentially leading to pulmonary fibrosis that may persist in recovered patients (Antonio et al., 2003). Approximately 15% of individuals with COVID-19 progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with the most critical cases necessitating treatment in intensive care units (ICUs) involving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation (Li et al., 2020). In severe instances of COVID-19, lung transplantation may be considered as a viable option (Chen et al., 2020a). The pharmacological interventions targeting coronaviruses, as depicted in Figure 1 and Table 4, are evaluated based on their molecular mechanisms of action, efficacy in vitro and in vivo, and ongoing clinical trials. The clinical outcome of COVID-19 is influenced by two crucial factors: viral entry/replication and host response, both of which are interconnected and can be addressed using various compounds.
Various strategies to impede viral binding have been explored in recent research. For instance, human recombinant ACE2 has shown promise in reducing SARS-CoV-2 recovery in vitro and safeguarding mice from acute lung injury induced by SARS-CoV (Monteil et al., 2020). Additionally, a chimeric protein combining the extracellular domain of ACE2 with the Fc region of IgG1 demonstrated pharmacological efficacy in mouse models (Lei et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 can enter cells through either endosome or membrane fusion mechanisms. Arbidol, a potent broad-spectrum antiviral agent, has been found to inhibit viral envelope fusion (Teissier et al., 2011) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Blaising et al., 2013), thereby suppressing SARS-CoV replication in vitro (Khamitov et al., 2008). Notably, patients treated with Arbidol exhibited a shorter duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those receiving lopinavir/ritonavir therapy (Zhu et al., 2020).
Several drugs have been employed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, with one notable example being the adenosine analog remdesivir. This drug targets the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, integrating into viral RNA chains and causing premature termination. Initially effective against the Ebola virus, remdesivir has demonstrated activity against various other viruses, including those within the Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae families. Despite the coronaviruses' RdRps sharing an identity range of 70-90%, remdesivir exhibits a broad spectrum of activity, inhibiting SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Recent studies have indicated its effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, attributing this to its antiviral mechanism as a nucleotide analog. Additionally, other nucleotide analogs like Ribavirin, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir have shown the ability to bind to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Favipiravir, a purine analog traditionally used against Influenza, is currently undergoing testing for COVID-19 treatment and has demonstrated a reduction in viral clearance time compared to lopinavir/ritonavir treatment. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of Remdesivir and Ribavirin against COVID-19, with considerations for their cost, administration routes, potential side effects, and overall effectiveness.
Furthermore, studies have indicated that the protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, commonly used as HIV antivirals, exhibit potential efficacy against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Chu et al. 2004; Choy et al. 2020). Both medications have the ability to interact with the protease 3CLpro, with ritonavir demonstrating a higher binding affinity in comparison to lopinavir (Nutho et al. 2020). Animal experiments targeting SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have demonstrated that the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) with IFN-β can notably reduce viral load and enhance pulmonary function. This combination has shown a synergistic effect in treating SARS patients (Yao et al. 2020). A current clinical trial (NCT02845843) is evaluating the efficacy of a combination therapy involving lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon-β1b against MERS (Arabi et al. 2020). The combined use of LPV/r has been associated with a reduction in the time taken for patients to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 (Yao et al. 2020) and an increase in eosinophils, suggesting a favorable clinical outcome in COVID-19 cases (Liu et al. 2020). However, a separate study reported no significant difference in the administration of lopinavir and ritonavir among patients with advanced COVID-19 (Cao et al. 2020) or in shortening the duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding (Cheng et al. 2020). An analysis of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from COVID-19 patients at the First Hospital of Changsha in China revealed that approximately 64% of observed ADRs were linked to the use of LPV/r (Sun et al. 2020), with patients treated with these medications exhibiting a notably higher incidence of abnormal liver function (Fan et al. 2020). Currently, there are 211 ongoing clinical trials investigating the use of antivirals such as Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Remdesivir, and Favipiravir either in combination, alone, or in conjunction with other drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients (Cochrane COVID-19 Study register).
Chloroquine (CQ) has been extensively studied in the context of SARS-CoV, demonstrating its ability to induce alkalinization of acid vesicles within infected cells by intracellular pathogens (Rolain et al., 2007). Initially explored as a potential alternative to quinine for treating malaria, CQ, along with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), has been investigated for its efficacy against various viral infections, including viral hepatitis (Pareja-Coronel, 1963), dengue virus (Farias et al., 2015), and HIV (Paton et al., 2002), among others. Furthermore, CQ has shown activity against intracellular bacteria like Coxiella burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei, bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila and Mycobacterium spp, as well as fungal infections caused by Histoplasma capsulatum and Cryptococcus neoformans (Rolain et al., 2007). While CQ has demonstrated effectiveness in Vero E6 and Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV (De Wilde et al., 2014), it has not shown the same efficacy in dendritic cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (Cong et al., 2018). Notably, CQ has exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in vitro, both pre- and post-exposure, by interfering with ACE2 glycosylation and impeding viral binding (Keyaerts et al., 2004; Vincent et al., 2005). Additionally, CQ has been found to induce alterations in endosomal pH, thereby inhibiting viral infection (Simmons et al., 2004).
Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated potential in vivo effects of both CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al., 2020b). Notably, Chinese researchers have reported positive outcomes with chloroquine in COVID-19 treatment, although data supporting these claims have not yet been published (Gao et al., 2020). Similarly, French researchers have observed a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 levels in a small cohort of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, with additional benefits noted when combined with azithromycin (Gautret et al., 2020). A comprehensive review of ongoing clinical trials has revealed conflicting results, with some indicating efficacy while others raise concerns about potential toxicity issues (Sharma, 2020). It is crucial to acknowledge the existence of various SARS-CoV-2 strains (Wang et al., 2020a). Notably, chloroquine exhibits pro-apoptotic properties, and its prophylactic use has been associated with the selection of intracellular pathogen strains that enhance cell resistance to apoptosis, as seen in HIV and SARS-CoV infections (Parris, 2004). Despite its affordability, health organizations like the WHO emphasize the necessity for further research before endorsing the clinical use of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 treatment. Currently, there are 390 registered clinical trials investigating the role of HCQ and CQ in managing SARS-CoV-2 infections (Cochrane COVID-19 Study register).
The host response to viral infection plays a crucial role in COVID-19. Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, various cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, IP-10, and MCP-1 are secreted (Huang et al. 2020). Patients requiring intensive care exhibit elevated levels of IL-2, IL-7, GCSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-α, potentially triggering a cytokine storm and intensifying the inflammatory reaction (Huang et al. 2020). Apart from alveolar epithelial cells, SARS-CoV also infects vascular endothelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes. The rapid replication of the virus leads to endothelial cell damage, vascular leakage, and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Host seroconversion results in the presence of IgG anti-S protein, which could enhance the accumulation of proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage and the release of MCP-1 and IL-8, contributing to severe lung injury (Fu et al. 2020). Effective viral clearance hinges on the activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. IFN-γ and IL-6 play roles in neutrophil recruitment and the transition to the adaptive response. However, imbalanced levels of IL-6 and reduced IFN-γ expression may diminish CD4+, CD8+, and NK cells, potentially exacerbating the cytokine storm (Lagunas‐Rangel and Chávez‐Valencia 2020).
Tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL6R monoclonal antibody, functions by inhibiting IL-6 signaling. Preliminary studies suggest its safety and efficacy in combating COVID-19. Given the necessity for additional clinical trial data, it is proposed that its administration be limited to critically ill patients exhibiting elevated IL-6 levels (Zhang et al., 2020a). Initial clinical findings advocate for repeated dosing (Luo et al., 2020). Concerns have been raised regarding potential complications such as osteonecrosis of the jaws and acute hypertriglyceridemia (Bennardo et al., 2020; Morrison et al., 2020).
Interferon release stands as a crucial natural defense mechanism against viral infections. In vivo experiments have demonstrated that treatment with IFN-β1b effectively reduces pulmonary infiltrates, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, and viral load in the context of MERS-CoV (Chan et al., 2015). Furthermore, IFN-α, a mismatched double-stranded RNA Interferon inducer, along with the IFN inducer Ampligen, have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV replication within the lungs (Barnard et al., 2006). IFN-λ has also exhibited efficacy against both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, establishing an antiviral state while causing minimal systemic inflammation (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2020). Notably, 88 studies have explored antibodies against cytokines, with 34 specifically focusing on IFN, either through inhibition or the administration of recombinant forms for patient treatment (Cochrane COVID-19 Study register).
Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties and have been utilized in the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (Sharma, 2020). These drugs interfere with lysosomal acidification, thereby inhibiting processes such as antigen presentation, phospholipase A2 activity, Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), T and B cell receptor function, and the production of cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 (Sinha & Balayla, 2020). Additionally, the immunomodulatory effects of CQ against COVID-19 may be attributed to its inhibition of GSK3β (Embi et al., 2020).
Metronidazole, a redox-active prodrug, has been shown to reduce levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increase circulating lymphocytes, and decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by neutrophils. It has also been proposed as a potential treatment for COVID-19 (Gharebaghi et al., 2020). Another class of anti-inflammatory drugs, Statins, has been included in certain treatment protocols. However, due to their modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) response, the use of Statins in animal experiments against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV led to increased viral load, severe lung damage, and mortality (Dashti-Khavidaki and Khalili, 2020). Nitazoxanide, primarily used against protozoan and helminthic infections, contains tizoxanide, its active form, which has demonstrated inhibition against 16 strains of Influenza A, one strain of Influenza B, rotavirus, HCV, Yellow fever virus, HBV, HIV, norovirus, and others (Rossignol, 2014). Nitazoxanide has shown efficacy in reducing viral load from various coronaviruses (Cao et al., 2015) and suppressing IL-6 production in mice (Hong et al., 2012), making it a potential candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.
In viral RNA infections, the utilization of nutraceuticals has been proposed to inhibit NOX2, thereby restoring TLR7 response to single-stranded viral RNA infection and inducing IFN; nutraceuticals could also enhance mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins (MAVS) and decrease pro-inflammatory signaling (McCarty and DiNicolantonio, 2020). In addition to nutraceuticals, Vitamins A and D, Selenium, Zinc, and probiotics have been suggested to offer potential benefits for COVID-19 patients, by bolstering immunity and preventing respiratory infections (Grant et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020). Consequently, the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients may warrant further investigation in future therapeutic approaches, as it could potentially influence disease progression.
The clinical progression of COVID-19 suggests that initial symptoms arise from increased viral load, with subsequent weeks showing IgG seroconversion reducing viral load while some patients experience worsening symptoms due to immunopathological damage (Peiris et al., 2003). Convalescent plasma (CP) has been utilized in the treatment of SARS, MERS, Ebola virus, and Chikungunya virus diseases to enhance survival rates (Alzoughool and Alanagreh, 2020). Various studies have examined critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with CP, reporting favorable outcomes with minimal adverse effects (Duan et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b). The FDA has sanctioned the use of CP for treating critical patients (Tanne, 2020), despite the potential risk of exacerbating hyperimmune responses, with better outcomes observed when administered early in the disease course (Zhao and He, 2020). Essential considerations for CP use include establishing eligibility criteria for donor COVID-19 convalescent patients, conducting pre-screening tests on donors, defining criteria for CP collection, and outlining plasma treatment protocols (Epstein and Burnouf, 2020). Currently, CP is undergoing evaluation in 212 clinical trials globally for its efficacy against COVID-19 (Cochrane COVID-19 Study register).
In essence, the intricate cellular mechanisms involved in coronavirus replication constitute a sophisticated and interconnected network of molecular processes. This intricate cascade begins with the translation of Nsps, the proteolytic cleavage of polyproteins, the assembly of RTC, the transcription of antigenome, genome, and subgenomic RNAs, the translation of structural proteins, and culminates in the assembly and budding of viral particles. Examination of cellular proteins associated with coronaviruses highlights the modulation of crucial cellular pathways linked to innate immunity, the cell cycle, and protein synthesis. While current therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 are somewhat based on these molecular events and pathways, future pharmacological interventions could benefit from a deeper comprehension of the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2.
