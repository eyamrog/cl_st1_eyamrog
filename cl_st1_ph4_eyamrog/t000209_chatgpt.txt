The global tally of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases has surpassed one million, with a death toll exceeding 50,000 individuals. A critical concern revolves around the exposure of healthcare workers to this novel virus. Initial reports from Wuhan province in China highlighted infection rates of up to 29% among healthcare professionals prior to the implementation of comprehensive personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols. While various guidelines exist for the proper utilization of PPE during aerosol-generating procedures, there remains a lack of specific directives on managing cases necessitating chest tubes in patients with active air leaks and positive COVID-19 status. This study aims to provide guidance to surgeons across different specialties on safely conducting chest drainage procedures for COVID-19 patients, mitigating the risk of contamination to both the healthcare professional and the surrounding environment.
The global tally of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases has surpassed one million, with the death toll exceeding 50,000 individuals. The exposure of healthcare professionals to this novel virus stands as a critical concern. Initial reports from Wuhan province in China indicated infection rates of up to 29% among healthcare workers prior to the implementation of comprehensive personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols. While various guidelines exist for the proper utilization of PPE during aerosol-generating procedures, there remains a dearth of specific directives for scenarios necessitating chest drainage in COVID-19 patients, including those who are positive, suspected, or even asymptomatic, a group constituting approximately 80% of cases. Given the unprecedented nature of this pandemic and the limited availability of diagnostic tests for widespread screening in Brazil, utmost caution is imperative in the management of all patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for COVID-19, has been demonstrated to remain viable in aerosol form and is primarily transmitted through droplets. Throughout the pandemic, patients often require chest drainage, whether in general wards or intensive care units. While drains can be inserted with relatively lower risk of viral transmission in cases of uncomplicated pleural effusions, there is a significant concern regarding the potential for increased aerosol generation in instances of pneumothorax with ongoing air leakage, regardless of whether these cases are primary, secondary, spontaneous, or iatrogenic.
Traditional chest drainage water-seal collectors feature an outlet designed for connection to a negative pressure system. In the absence of suction, this outlet remains open to the atmosphere. As air is released into the chest drainage collector, it induces bubbling within the inner liquid. This bubbling effect can lead to aerosolization within the drain collector, facilitating the escape of potentially contaminated particles through the outlet. Consequently, this mechanism poses a significant risk for environmental contamination and potential viral transmission.
This proposal seeks to function as a supportive tool for surgeons dealing with conditions necessitating thoracic drainage amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. It draws upon a comprehensive review of existing literature, informed by experts in the field of thoracic surgery, rather than relying solely on evidence-based guidelines. Acknowledging the evolving nature of management strategies, it emphasizes the need for individualized approaches tailored to the resources and capabilities of each specific institution.
Ideally, hospitals should utilize closed digital drainage systems that are regulated in Brazil and available in the market. However, this is not the current standard in most healthcare facilities. Therefore, we suggest implementing a comprehensive and practical alternative that ensures safety and reduces environmental contamination and the risk of exposure for the healthcare team.
The primary method for preventing the spread of particles is through the utilization of High Efficiency Particulate Arrestance (HEPA) filters. Originating in 1940, these filters were specifically designed to impede the dissemination of cancer-causing contaminants in the air during the Manhattan Project, which was pivotal in the creation of the world's first atomic bombs.
Constructed from fiberglass, HEPA filters are engineered to capture significantly smaller particles and impurities compared to standard filters. Key factors influencing the efficiency of HEPA filters include the diameter of the fibers, the velocity of the particles, and the thickness of the filter. These filters operate through three primary mechanisms: interception, impact, and diffusion. As air flows through the filter, particles are intercepted and impacted by the fibers, causing them to adhere to the filter surface.
Common filters are ineffective at trapping viruses and bacteria, unlike HEPA filters which have the capability to capture 99.97% of air impurities. This high efficiency is attributed to the HEPA filter's ability to trap particles as small as 0.3 micrometers (µm), making it a crucial defense against aerosolization. Given that aerosol particles typically measure smaller than five micrometers, the HEPA filter serves as a significant barrier in preventing the dispersion of aerosols into the surrounding environment.

The HEPA filter, known for its high efficiency in capturing particles, is a crucial component in air purification systems. Its ability to trap particles as small as 0.3 microns makes it highly effective in removing allergens, dust, and other pollutants from the air. The HEPA filter operates by forcing air through a fine mesh that captures particles, preventing them from circulating back into the environment. This technology is widely used in various settings, including homes, hospitals, and industrial facilities, to improve indoor air quality and reduce the risk of respiratory issues. The HEPA filter's effectiveness in removing harmful particles has made it a popular choice for those seeking cleaner and healthier air.

One limitation to consider is that the HEPA filter can only intercept particles as small as 0.3 μm, while a droplet measures 0.5 µm and the virus size ranges between 0.07 and 0.09 µm. Despite this, since the virus typically requires a carrier for transmission, such as aerosolization, the HEPA filter could still prove effective. Nevertheless, the efficacy of this approach requires further investigation and validation through evidence-based medicine. In light of the ongoing pandemic, it is crucial to explore all potential methods for mitigating viral transmission.
