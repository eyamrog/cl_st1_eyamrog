Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the mortality rates among hospitalized COVID-19 cases in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, stratified by private and public healthcare services. Methods: Hospitalization data for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was extracted from the SIVEP-Gripe Database. The analysis included all adult patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or unspecified SARS between January and December 2020. Logistic regression models were utilized to assess the risk of mortality between the two cities, adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities. Results: A total of 388,657 hospital admissions were examined, with 91,532 from Rio de Janeiro and 297,125 from São Paulo. Notably, there was a higher prevalence of missing data in Rio de Janeiro at both the state and capital levels. After adjusting for confounding variables, the odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality in Rio de Janeiro compared to São Paulo was 2.51 in private hospitals and 2.29 in public hospitals. The disparity was even more pronounced in the capital cities, with Rio de Janeiro exhibiting at least double the mortality rate compared to São Paulo in both public and private healthcare settings. The odds ratios for mortality in the capitals were 2.74 and 3.46 for public and private services, respectively.
In conclusion, the excessive mortality rate among hospitalized Covid-19 patients in Rio de Janeiro can be primarily attributed to poor governance within the health sector rather than a lack of resources. The inadequacies in governance seem to play a more significant role in exacerbating the situation than the scarcity of resources. This suggests that addressing issues related to governance, such as decision-making processes, resource allocation, and overall management practices, could potentially lead to a significant improvement in patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates in the region.
By the end of June 2021, Brazil had reported over 504,000 deaths due to COVID-19, with the numbers continuing to rise rapidly. Notably, the state of Rio de Janeiro stands out with the second-highest COVID-19 mortality rate in the country, reaching 329 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. This statistic is particularly puzzling considering Rio de Janeiro's status as the second-largest economy in Brazil, trailing only behind São Paulo. The significantly elevated mortality rates observed in Rio de Janeiro, when compared to other states, raise questions that warrant further investigation.
Despite the higher proportion of elderly individuals in Rio de Janeiro compared to São Paulo (18.9% and 13.3%, respectively), age-standardized rates suggest that factors beyond age play a role in the disparities in mortality risk (195 per 100,000 inhabitants in Rio de Janeiro versus 125 per 100,000 in São Paulo).
By June 2021, the state of São Paulo had reported five times more cases of COVID-19 compared to the state of Rio de Janeiro, despite having a population that is only 2.6 times larger (approximately 44 million inhabitants in São Paulo versus 17 million in Rio de Janeiro). Therefore, a comparative analysis of the two states and their respective capitals regarding the characteristics and progression of hospitalized patients and COVID-19-related deaths could shed light on the significantly higher mortality rates observed in Rio de Janeiro.
This study seeks to analyze and compare the mortality rates among hospitalized COVID-19 cases in the states and capitals of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with a specific focus on distinguishing between patients receiving care in private and public healthcare facilities.
Hospitalization data for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was sourced from the SIVEP-Gripe Database, which is openly accessible at https://dados.gov.br/dataset/bd-srag-2020, and does not necessitate approval from the ethics committee. To determine whether the service was public or private, the CNES Database was utilized, which can be accessed at http://tabnet.fiocruz.br/dash/menu_dash.htm.
The analysis included all hospitalized adults (aged 18 years and older) diagnosed with COVID-19 or unspecified SARS between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. Cases of SARS attributed to other causes such as influenza, other respiratory viruses, or different etiologic agents, as well as individuals with Down Syndrome, pregnant women, and postpartum women, were excluded from the study.
Data on age, sex, race, educational background, and medical history including comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, neurologic disease, and kidney disease were gathered for analysis.
In the descriptive analysis, absolute and percentage values were utilized to present the patient's characteristics. The risk of death between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo was estimated through logistic regression models that were adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. These analyses were conducted at both the state and capital levels. In cases where information on comorbidities was missing, it was assumed that there was a lack of morbidity. Two sensitivity analyses were carried out. The first aimed to assess potential differences in the notification process rate by excluding data from November and December from the analysis. The second sensitivity analysis examined the impact of missing outcome data, with all missing data being assumed as a cure.
The analysis included a total of 388,657 registers from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo (91,532 and 297,125, respectively). The SIVEP-GRIPE Surveillance System encompasses numerous variables beyond diagnosis. However, apart from age, which had no missing data, and sex, which had very few missing entries, other variables such as race, years of education, and comorbidities exhibited significant percentages of non-response. Moreover, disparities in data quality were evident. For instance, the absence of race information was 13% in the public service of São Paulo's interior and 54% in Rio de Janeiro's capital private sector, consistently showing poorer reporting in private compared to public services. Regarding education, nearly 80% of data was missing across all comparisons, except for the public and private services in São Paulo's interior, where the rate, although still high, hovered around 50% (see Table 1).
The classification of service types, whether public or private, has revealed a higher percentage of unidentified services in Rio (both in the capital and interior) in comparison to São Paulo, with approximately 22% in Rio and 14% in São Paulo for both public and private services. The prevalence of missing data across all variables is notably higher in Rio when contrasted with São Paulo.
The crude death rate among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Rio de Janeiro was higher than in São Paulo across all age groups and in both private and public hospitals, as indicated in Table 2. Specifically, the crude risk of mortality for individuals aged 18 to 40 years was 2.9 in private hospitals and 2.1 in public hospitals when comparing Rio with São Paulo. In contrast, for those aged 90 years or older, the respective values were 1.6 and 1.4.
The overall adjusted odds ratio for all age groups is presented in Table 3, revealing a consistent pattern observed in both crude rates and age-sex adjusted analyses. Models that were further adjusted for all reported comorbidities indicated odds ratios of 2.51 for comparing the state of Rio de Janeiro with São Paulo in private hospitals, and 2.29 in public hospitals. The situation is notably more severe in the capitals, with Rio de Janeiro exhibiting triple the risk compared to São Paulo, and significant disparities between public and private services, with odds ratios of 2.74 and 3.46, respectively. Notably, mortality rates in public hospitals in both Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo are approximately twice as high as in the private sector, as detailed in Table 4.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted, as outlined in Table 5, which involved excluding the data from the two most recent months of notification to address the sluggish data management in Rio de Janeiro. Additionally, another analysis was performed where all missing cases for the variable evolution were considered as non-cases, aiming for a more conservative approach. Despite these adjustments, both scenarios revealed a consistent pattern of significant disparities in mortality rates in Rio de Janeiro.
One potential explanation for the disparity in mortality rates between Rio and São Paulo could be attributed to variations in the availability of Covid-related hospital beds. In terms of hospital beds per 100,000 population, São Paulo presents a more favorable scenario with 27.8 beds compared to Rio de Janeiro's 23.3 beds. Despite this difference, during the period under evaluation, both regions exhibited a similar lag time between diagnosis and hospitalization, approximately 5 days for Rio (5.8 days) and São Paulo (5.9 days) respectively.
Our research reveals a higher lethality rate for Covid-19 among hospitalized patients in Rio de Janeiro compared to São Paulo, encompassing both the capital and interior regions of the states. This aligns with the mortality findings per 100,000 inhabitants reported in the Epidemiological Monitor of the Ministry of Health. Furthermore, a recent study utilizing data from SIVEP-Gripe spanning from March 2020 to January 2021 highlighted that age-standardized mortality rates for Covid-19 were 56% higher in Rio de Janeiro when compared to São Paulo. The study underscored the reliability of SIVEP-Gripe as a source for Covid-19 mortality data and demonstrated that mortality coefficients across all age groups were notably elevated in Rio de Janeiro in contrast to those observed in São Paulo.
In our analysis, excluding the final two months of 2020 and incorporating all unavailable data for case definition into the denominator enabled us to investigate if data quality could account for the disparity in mortality rates between the two cities. However, even after implementing these adjustments, the discrepancy in mortality rates persisted at a significant level.
Having twice the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 when hospitalized in Rio de Janeiro compared to São Paulo is deemed unacceptable, particularly given Rio's status as the second-largest economy in the country and its nearly equivalent number of ICU beds in public hospitals.
In 2020, São Paulo exhibited a higher number of hospital beds per capita in comparison to Rio, along with a greater primary health care coverage (62.9% and 58.9%, respectively), yet these disparities do not sufficiently account for the discrepancy in Covid-related hospitalizations. The persistent disarray within Rio de Janeiro's health system, when contrasted with São Paulo, remains a prevailing issue. A significant event in July 2019 saw the Regional Labor Court of the 1st Region in Rio de Janeiro mandating the seizure of R$ 38 million from the municipality of Rio de Janeiro to compensate 1,500 health agents who were terminated by the Institute of Basic and Advanced Health Care (Iabas). This same entity was implicated in the mismanagement of field hospitals during the pandemic, and the well-documented corruption within Rio de Janeiro's health department ultimately led to the arrest of the state health secretary.
São Paulo ranks second in monthly household income per capita, with R$ 1,814, while Rio de Janeiro holds the fourth position at R$ 1,723. In the first quarter of 2021, 67.1% of the population over 16 years old in São Paulo was employed, compared to 63.6% in Rio de Janeiro. Despite these economic disparities, they are insufficient to account for the significant differences in mortality rates. The percentage of the population registered in the Cadastro Único, designed for families with monthly incomes equal to or less than half the minimum wage, was 12.2% in São Paulo and 8.9% in Rio de Janeiro. Although these figures do not fully capture the extent of vulnerability among families, it suggests that São Paulo may not be less vulnerable than Rio de Janeiro. Vulnerability has been linked to higher COVID-19 mortality rates, as evidenced in Belo Horizonte, a metropolitan city in Southeast Brazil. In this region, the mortality rate per 100,000 older adults (aged 60 and above) was 292, escalating from 179 to 354 and 476 in areas classified as low, intermediate, and high vulnerability, respectively.
The disparities in Covid-19 mortality rates between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo lack a clear explanation, highlighting the crucial role of political power in implementing effective public health measures. The ongoing crisis has underscored the importance of political will in combating the pandemic. The differences between the two cities can be attributed, at least in part, to the intense political conflicts within Brazil. The national government's denialist stance and lack of pandemic planning, coordination, and preparation across different levels of governance have exacerbated the situation. Until early 2021, both the municipal and state governments of Rio de Janeiro aligned with the federal government's approach, leading to a lack of readiness in responding to the pandemic. The impeachment of the governor further worsened the situation, potentially contributing to the higher mortality rates observed. In contrast, São Paulo's municipal and state governments collaborated to expedite the opening of hospital beds and improve hospital care, although preventive measures in both cities have been insufficient.
The management conflicts during the pandemic between the national government and state and local governments were influenced by their political affiliations, potentially contributing to the disparities in Covid-19 death rates in the two most developed states.
On the contrary, the increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 in public hospitals compared to private institutions underscores the urgent necessity for enhanced public healthcare services. As highlighted by Paim, a chronic issue plaguing Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS) is the persistent underfunding. Over the years, the Federal Government's contribution to public health expenditure has dwindled significantly, dropping from 63.8% in 1995 to approximately 42% in 2017. In an attempt to address financial constraints, the government established the Emergency Social Fund in 1994, which, by 2016, diverted 30% of the Social Security Budget towards other expenditures. Furthermore, the enactment of Constitutional Amendment No. 95 in 2016 imposed a strict spending cap on the Federal Government, effectively freezing public health resources for a period of 20 years.
Efforts were made to enhance financing through initiatives such as the Provisional Contribution on Financial Transactions, EC29/2000, and the Health +10 Movement; however, the proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) allocated to the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) continued to lag behind private expenditure levels. In 2017, Brazil allocated 9.2% of its GDP to healthcare, with 3.9% (42%) attributed to public expenditure and 5.4% (58%) to private expenditure.
The SUS faces challenges in sustaining its service network and adequately compensating its employees, thereby impeding the essential growth of public infrastructure. Paim asserts that a passive boycott is evident as a result of insufficient public funding, while an active boycott gains traction when the government incentivizes, acknowledges, and favors the private sector with subsidies, deregulation, and sub-regulation (Paim, 10).
In addition to the underfunding of the SUS, the Covid-19 epidemic has led to increased costs in health services. Specifically, the expenditure related to the average length of hospital stays for COVID-19 treatment was found to be highest in the South region of Brazil compared to other regions. However, in Rio de Janeiro, the cost was nearly half of the mean total amount spent in the South region. Interestingly, Rio de Janeiro also exhibited a higher lethality rate of 13%.
The Covid-19 pandemic presented significant challenges for Brazilian public institutions, exacerbated by fiscal austerity measures and stringent restrictions. The Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) suffered a substantial loss of nearly 22.5 billion reais between 2018 and 2020. Furthermore, the allocation and management of federal financial resources to states and municipalities, particularly in Rio de Janeiro, were found to be inadequately handled, as previously highlighted.
In order to address the disparities between public and private healthcare findings, it is essential to allocate resources towards enhancing governance, improving hiring practices, providing better training for health teams, acquiring necessary equipment, and adjusting services accordingly. These discrepancies may also stem from the higher morbidity rates among the public service clientele, a variable that was not entirely considered in the analysis of included morbidities. It is widely recognized that individuals of lower socioeconomic status exhibit a higher prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle habits. For instance, data on food consumption in Brazil indicate poorer dietary habits among those with the lowest incomes.
In conclusion, it is evident that poor governance within the health sector in Rio de Janeiro, rather than a mere lack of resources, is the primary factor contributing to the excessive mortality rates among hospitalized Covid-19 patients in the region.
