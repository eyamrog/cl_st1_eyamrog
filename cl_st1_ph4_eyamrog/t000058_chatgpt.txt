Biological collections play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the biodiversity within a particular ecosystem. This research article focuses on the organization, listing, and cataloging of adult specimens from the Culicidae family, housed within the Parasitology Collection of the Basic Pathology Department at the Federal University of Paraná in southern Brazil. A comprehensive databank was established to document the taxonomy and collection details of each sample. The culicids were gathered through various methodologies across 18 municipalities in Paraná state, spanning the years 1967 to 1999. Among the 5,739 cataloged specimens, 4,704 (81.96%) have been identified at a specific level, showcasing a diversity of 205 species. Notably, 18 of these species are newly recorded in Paraná, with 3 being new to Brazil. In recognition of three decades dedicated to studying culicids in Paraná, we propose the establishment of the Ana Leuch Lozovei Entomological Collection. This collection will focus on insect vectors or potential vectors of pathogens that affect human health.

In recognition of the extensive research conducted by the esteemed researcher over a span of more than three decades on the family Culicidae, this article introduces the establishment of the Ana Leuch Lozovei Entomological Collection as an essential component of ColPar/DPAT/BL/UFPR.
The collection comprises a total of 5,739 specimens, encompassing 2 subfamilies of Culicidae, 7 tribes, 23 genera, 37 subgenera, and 205 species. Notably, 943 individuals (16.43%) are identified only at the subgenus level, while 93 (1.62%) are identified at the genus level. Among the specimens identified at a specific taxonomic level, 4,704 (81.96%) individuals, representing 18 species, mark the first recorded samples for the state of Paraná. These species include Anopheles albimanus Wiedmann, 1820, Anopheles costai da Fonseca & da Silva Ramos, 1940, Anopheles rangeli Gabaldon, Cova-Garcia & Lopez, 1940, Culex aquarius Strickman, 1990, Culex bastagarius Dyar & Knab, 1906, Culex foliaceus Lane, 1945, Culex alinkios Sallum & Hutchings, 2003, Culex faurani Duret, 1968, Culex lucifugus Komp, 1936, Culex hedys Root, 1927, Culex ocossa Dyar & Knab, 1919, Culex oedipus Root, 1927, Culex lanei Oliveira Coutinho & Forattini, 1962, Aedes fulvithorax (Lutz, 1904), Culex theobaldi (Lutz, 1904), Culex pleuristriatus Theobald, 1903, Aedes eucephalaeus (Dyar, 1918), and Uranotaenia ditaenionota Prado, 1931. Noteworthy is the discovery of three species (Culex aquarius, Culex lucifugus, and Aedes eucephalaeus) as new recorded samples for Brazil, indicating an expansion in the geographical distribution of these species previously confined to specific locations or countries.
Capturing culicids was conducted in nature reserves across 18 municipalities in Paraná state between 1967 and 1999, as illustrated in Figure 1. The Dense Ombrophilous Forest phytogeographic region emerged as the primary sampling area, accounting for the majority of samples (n= 4,831), with Morretes municipality contributing 4,774 (98%) recorded samples. This region has consistently served as a collection site for culicids by various researchers, leveraging the presence of conservation areas. Over the 30-year study period, taxonomic identifications were meticulously performed and validated by experts within the group, including Dr. Ana Lozovei, Dr. Samira Chahad-Ehlers, Dr. Luiz Gonzaga dos Santos-Neto, and Dr. Adson Luís Sant’Ana, who are co-authors of this article. Some identifications were also corroborated by Dr. Maria Anice Mureb Sallum from the Public Health Faculty of the University of São Paulo. The Parasitology Collection housed in the Basic Pathology Department is integrated into the Information System on Brazilian Diversity (SiBBr) and is accessible at https://collectory.sibbr.gov.br/collectory/public/show/co446.
Biodiversity is a global heritage that holds significant value for the advancement of each nation. National scientific collections should be regarded as a testament to the country's diverse heritage, serving as temporary archives of the organisms found within a specific environment. These biological collections play a crucial role in scientific endeavors, providing essential data for strategic research within the country and aiding in the fulfillment of international obligations and agreements. Their utilization in research is indispensable for any scholar seeking accurate references to currently accepted taxonomic names and other pertinent information related to a particular taxon of interest.
Insects belonging to the family Culicidae (order Diptera), commonly referred to as mosquitoes, exhibit a broad geographic distribution. Presently, there are 3,591 described species categorized into two subfamilies (Anophelinae and Culicinae), spread across 113 genera. Approximately 31% of these species are located in the Neotropical region. Brazil, specifically, hosts 530 documented species across 23 genera, with six species endemic to the country. The state of Paraná alone houses 191 culicidae species, a number that is expected to rise as research efforts intensify due to the epidemiological significance of this insect group.
Recognizing the significance of culicids across various fields within natural and applied sciences, as well as the crucial role of biological collections in conserving biodiversity data, it is imperative that all information pertaining to these insects be published, shared, and accessible to both the general public and the scientific community. The data collection and cataloging efforts focused on the Ana Leuch Lozovei Entomological Collection at ColPar/DPAT/BL/UFPR have resulted in a repository of information concerning the culicid fauna in select phytogeographic regions within Paraná. This collection holds substantial potential for leveraging data and insights, such as understanding the entomofauna of previously undisturbed locations or identifying species that are presently challenging to collect within the state, thereby contributing to forthcoming studies on fauna and environmental conservation. Within the collection, the subfamily Culicinae predominates, with the genus Culex boasting the highest number of specimens, accounting for approximately 40% of the total and encompassing 52 species, making it the most diverse. Conversely, the genera Aedeomyia, Lutzia, Onirion, and Shannoniana are less represented, each with only one species. In the Anophelinae subfamily, two genera are recorded: Anopheles, with 30 species, and Chagasia, with a single species. The three-decade-long study period offers a temporal framework for comprehending population dynamics, identifying previously unrecorded species, and generating data on areas with epidemiological potential for culicid-related diseases.
These mosquitoes play a crucial role in the transmission chain of various neglected, emerging, and re-emerging diseases. The collection includes samples of diverse species with significant medical importance, such as Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse, 1895) and Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762), known as the primary vectors of Dengue (DENV), Zika Virus (ZIKV), and Chikungunya (CHIKV). Aedes aegypti also plays a key role in the urban transmission of Yellow Fever (YFV). Species like Haemagogus (Conopostegus) leucocelaenus (Dyar & Shannon, 1924) and Aedes (Ochlerotatus) fulvus (Wiedemann, 1828), belonging to the Aedini tribe, are associated with yellow fever transmission in forested environments. Recent laboratory studies by Lourenço-de-Oliveira and Failoux (29) have shown the vectorial competence of Hg. leucocelaenus and Aedes (Protomacleaya) terrens (Walker, 1856) for the Chikungunya virus, indicating their ability to transmit the virus. The Culex genus is significant in transmitting Wuchereria bancrofti (lymphatic filariasis), encephalitis, and severe haemorrhagic fevers like Oropouche fever, while the Anopheles genus is primarily responsible for transmitting Plasmodium spp., the causative agents of human malaria. Apart from their impact on public health, culicids also play a crucial role in transmitting various pathogens causing diseases of veterinary interest, some with zoonotic potential like Equine Infectious Anaemia (EIA), dirofilariasis, and West Nile fever, underscoring their importance in the epidemiological chain of vector-borne diseases.
Situated in the subtropical region of South America, southern Brazil, the state of Paraná spans between the coordinates 22°30’44” S – 26°43’08” S and 48°00’11” W – 54°36’32” W, covering a territorial area of 199,298 km². It comprises five distinct phytogeographic regions: Seasonal Semideciduous Forest, Mixed Ombrophilous Forest, Dense Ombrophilous Forest, Steppe, and Savanna. According to the Köppen classification, Paraná's climate is categorized as subtropical and tropical, with an average annual temperature of 19°C, fluctuating between 25.9 and 12°C, and an average annual precipitation of 1,300 mm.
The geographical coordinates of the 18 sample municipalities were obtained from the Global Gazetteer Version 2.3 platform (http://www.fallingrain.com/world/). These coordinates served as the foundation for creating a map that delineated the phytogeographic areas, using QGis software (Version 3.22.3-Białowieża). The collection of culicids was conducted through various methods including entomological nets, aspiration, light traps (CDC), and Shannon traps equipped with a fluorescent bulb as bait (references 1, 2, 17).
The cataloguing was conducted at the Parasitology Collection within the Basic Pathology Department situated in the Biological Sciences Sector of the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR). This collection houses Culicidae specimens gathered by Dr. Ana Leuch Lozovei, her students, and collaborators. The classification system employed for Culicidae adheres to the framework established by Harbach [12] and Wilkerson et al. [13] for the tribe Aedini, with abbreviations in line with Reinert [48].
The DataSet exclusively utilized data pertaining to dry preserved male and female culicids that had been mounted with entomological pins. Information on each individual was meticulously tabulated on a spreadsheet utilizing Microsoft Office® version 2016 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and subsequently migrated to a Darwin Core spreadsheet [49].
Over the years, Dr. Ana Leuch Lozovei and her research group have published numerous works [2,3,17,34,50–52] focused on studying culicid fauna in Paraná. These publications have underscored the significant role of culicids in disease transmission and environmental quality. The data obtained from these studies have been instrumental in facilitating their research efforts.
Climate change, with its ongoing alterations in the environment, plays a crucial role in driving significant shifts in biodiversity, particularly within the insect population. This phenomenon leads to a notable dispersion of species, especially those of medical or epidemiological significance. The data presented in this study holds the potential to serve as a cornerstone for future research endeavors focusing on ecological, environmental, and biodiversity-related aspects, particularly concerning medically important species through the lens of "One Health." Notably, the current collection showcases 18 newly recorded species in Paraná, underscoring its value as a vital resource for mosquito biodiversity research. This underscores the critical importance of preserving and regularly updating biological collections.
