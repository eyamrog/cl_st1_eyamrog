Countries that have excelled in combating the COVID-19 pandemic globally are those that have prioritized social isolation, ensured access to healthcare for their populations during this sanitary crisis, expanded hospital bed capacity and intensive care units, conducted widespread testing, and implemented measures to sustain income levels and stimulate economic activity. It is crucial to emphasize that there is no inherent conflict between saving lives and sustaining economic functions.
Against the backdrop of the civilized world, the federal government's core opted to heed solely to prominent businessmen. However, displaying arrogance, it began advocating for vertical isolation exclusively targeting the elderly population with comorbidities as a viable strategy to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
The movement of large groups of individuals in settings conducive to the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus contradicts Law 13,979/2020, enacted by the president to address the public health crisis posed by COVID-19 on both international and national levels. This legislation is designed to safeguard the community and mitigate the rapid spread of the virus, ensuring that healthcare facilities can adequately attend to individuals experiencing severe symptoms of the disease.
The President of Brazil's speech presents a misleading dilemma to the public, framing the situation as a choice between addressing the health crisis or the economic crisis. This rhetoric serves to justify his prioritization of strictly economic interests, a stance that could exacerbate social exclusion by deeming certain individuals as expendable under the guise of "sanitary hygiene." Specifically, those below the poverty line, facing high risks, and experiencing social vulnerability are at significant risk of being marginalized in this approach. This group is particularly susceptible to being included in the escalating statistics of COVID-19 cases and fatalities in Brazil, especially during the month of April. By adhering to measures that break the chain of virus transmission, such as staying at home, we have the potential to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
The genocidal plan, denounced by ABEn, poses a grave threat to health professionals on the front lines, placing them at risk of falling ill and potentially dying due to the irresponsible discourse it propagates. Statistics indicate an alarming 8% rate of infection among these professionals, but the repercussions extend beyond mere numbers. This approach prioritizes hastening the curve of human infection with the Coronavirus, sacrificing public health for economic interests, leading to a surge in cases and a dire shortage of medical assistance. It reflects a profound lack of governmental accountability, promoting a survival-of-the-fittest mentality that undermines collective well-being.
How many individuals will enter the workforce with the misguided notion of equating COVID-19 to a mere "flu" or "cold"? How many will find themselves lacking proper treatment under the SUS, thereby further exposing healthcare workers? And what about the broader population? This isn't just a matter of necropolitics; it's about the deliberate endangerment of frontline healthcare workers, such as nurses, who are valiantly defending the public against the pandemic. Approximately 2 million healthcare professionals, including nurses, aides, and nursing technicians, are directly confronting the coronavirus in the battle against COVID-19. This issue holds significant social importance within the realm of healthcare. The rhetoric employed by the President of the Republic threatens the lives of these professionals who are striving to safeguard others, a truly terrifying prospect. It is imperative that we mobilize our networks, the media, and the general populace to ensure the protection of healthcare workers.
The ABEn Network, comprising National, State, and Federal District Sections, is positioned alongside nursing professionals and the general population to ensure they receive labor and social security protection from the State. This includes guaranteeing appropriate working conditions such as adequate staffing levels, access to necessary resources, a suitable resting area, and sufficient quality personal protective equipment. These measures are essential for enabling nursing professionals to perform their duties safely and effectively in their efforts to promote public health and uphold the fundamental right to life.
