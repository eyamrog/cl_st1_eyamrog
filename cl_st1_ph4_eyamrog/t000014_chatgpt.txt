The documentation of endangered languages is increasingly crucial for linguists and communities, with digital archives serving as vital tools for the preservation, conservation, and accessibility of linguistic outcomes. This article delves into the advantages and obstacles linked to archiving in language documentation, encompassing concerns such as preservation, conservation, access, ownership, and material utilization. Leveraging our extensive expertise as scholars deeply engaged in managing, contributing to, and utilizing language archives, particularly concerning indigenous languages in Latin America, we spotlight the importance of language archiving in Brazil for academics, community members, and various stakeholders. Our analysis underscores the necessary measures for ensuring resource quality and longevity, the principles and tactics for facilitating access to archived materials, and the ways in which language archives can enrich ongoing efforts with indigenous languages. As elucidated, language archives serve as invaluable resources for scholars and communities seeking to revive, uphold, or simply commemorate their linguistic and cultural heritage.
The documentation of endangered languages is increasingly crucial, serving as a vital resource for both scholars and communities. These documentary materials not only offer an empirical foundation for expanding our understanding of human language capabilities but also serve as a repository of diverse cultural and discursive traditions, preserving community heritage for future generations. However, the fragility of these materials is a pressing concern. Physical formats such as audio and video cassettes deteriorate over time, notebooks succumb to mildew and fading, and even digital storage mediums like SD cards and hard drives are vulnerable to disasters like fire, flood, and technological obsolescence, as tragically exemplified by the 2018 fire at Brazil's Museu Nacional. Consequently, there is a growing reliance on digital archives as a critical tool in safeguarding and facilitating access to the fruits of language documentation efforts.
In this article, we explore the advantages and obstacles linked to archiving in language documentation. Our analysis is informed by our extensive experience as academics actively engaged in managing, contributing to, and utilizing language archives, with a specific focus on the indigenous languages of Latin America. We specifically highlight the importance of language archiving in Brazil and its implications for researchers, community members, and various stakeholders.
The discussion commences by outlining the fundamental principles of archiving within language documentation initiatives, emphasizing the importance, benefits, and procedures involved (§2). In pursuit of ensuring resource quality, longevity, and accessibility, contemporary digital curation best practices are examined, distinguishing between established language archives and other online platforms, and deliberating on what content to archive and when. The deliberation extends to the selection of appropriate archives, considering their availability, structure, and maintenance, with a specific focus on Brazilian indigenous languages and associated documentation projects, exemplified by the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi archive (§3). Subsequently, the discourse delves into the intersection of archives and communities, delving into ethical considerations such as informed consent and community access to documentation, informed by a case study involving Mako speakers in Venezuela by Jorge Emilio Rosés Labrada (§4). The importance of preserving legacy materials, originating from pre-digital era documentation and often stored in fragile media with a limited lifespan, is addressed in §5. The narrative then circles back to the Brazilian landscape, presenting a detailed case study of documentation and archiving initiatives concerning Paresi-Haliti and Enewane Nawe, conducted by Ana Paula Brandão, which encapsulates the key themes discussed earlier. Concluding insights are provided in §7.
This section delineates key considerations regarding the significance and process of archiving language documentation data. We present a broad evaluation of the importance of this endeavor (§2.1), followed by an outline of the various digital repositories available (§2.2) and the advantages of archiving for language documentation (§2.3). We elucidate the distinctions between digital language archives and other online platforms (§2.4), and provide guidance on the methods and timing for archiving language documentation data (§2.5). Throughout this article, the term "data" refers to language documentation materials, encompassing recorded instances and/or observations of spoken or signed language that are amenable to processing, annotation, and analysis (see e.g. GOOD, 2022). Primary data consist of unprocessed audio or video recordings or written language observations, such as narratives, oral histories, elicitation, conversations, interviews, and experimental protocols; secondary data include transcriptions, translations, morphological segmentations, glosses, and other forms of annotation that necessitate some preliminary analysis for creation (KUNG, et al., 2020; HIMMELMANN, 2012; THIEBERGER and BEREZ, 2012). For comprehensive insights into language archiving and its evolution, refer to Henke and Berez-Kroeker (2016), Berez-Kroeker and Henke (2018), Kaplan and Lemov (2019), and Kung (2020).
In his seminal work that established the field of language documentation, Himmelmann (1998) identifies archiving as one of the fundamental steps in creating what he terms "a language documentation" (p. 171)—a compilation of transcribed and annotated audiovisual recordings along with their corresponding metadata. Metadata encompass the contextual, technical, and administrative details that provide a framework for understanding the data, including any necessary keys (such as codes or orthographies) for interpretation, analysis, and future use (KUNG et al., 2020). Woodbury (2003) refers to this amalgamation of primary data and accompanying metadata as a "corpus," with archiving being one of the six criteria crucial for determining the overall quality of a documentary corpus.
Key reasons for archiving language data include ensuring their longevity and accessibility. As elaborated upon below, digital repositories provide opportunities for replicability and safeguard against risks like fire, flood, loss, mold, insects, and other threats that jeopardize the preservation of physical materials, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Himmelmann (2006) emphasizes the significance of archiving primary data alongside publishing analytical results, following the Boasian trilogy model of a grammar (sketch), dictionary, and set of texts (Woodbury, 2003). By preserving primary data, researchers enable their reuse for language documentation and various linguistic analyses. Moreover, archiving both primary and secondary data ensures the verifiability and reproducibility of analytical outcomes (Himmelmann, 2006; Berez-Kroeker et al., 2018). The digital repository's accessibility for primary and secondary data fosters data reuse and offers a reliable method for data citation through persistent identifiers like Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), Handles, and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) (Berez-Kroeker et al., 2018). These identifiers guarantee proper attribution to data creators, as outlined in recent guidelines by Conzett and De Smedt (2022).
Language documentation materials are painstakingly collected, often requiring significant time and financial resources; however, to the speakers, they signify much more - encompassing their culture, identity, and self-determination (UNDRIP, 2007; CARROLL et al., 2020). Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that speakers have access to these materials. Ideally, copies of the documentation should be retained within the community from the outset; alternatively, a copy should be repatriated or returned to the community (KUNG 2020; VAPNARSKY, 2020; R. MILLER, 2021; see §4.3). Placing the data into a digital archive constitutes a form of digital repatriation (KUNG, 2020), assuming communities have relatively unimpeded access to the data. While digital archiving is not the sole method for repatriating data to the community of origin, it serves as a means to share these materials with the community while safeguarding them for future generations of speakers. Nonetheless, numerous indigenous peoples and communities worldwide lack adequate internet access. In such instances, it is imperative to identify a local, regional, or national archive, library, museum, school, governmental office, or another accessible location for the speaker community to deposit a copy of the data (WILBUR, 2014), in addition to depositing it in a more widely accessible digital repository for long-term preservation (as discussed below). Regardless of the specific archival location, sharing and repatriating the primary and secondary data, along with resulting publications, bolsters language maintenance, reclamation, and revitalization endeavors by providing materials to speakers and their descendants. While the aspiration is for the data to support language education, maintenance, or revitalization initiatives, the actual or precise uses that speakers and their descendants will make of the data are unpredictable (for recent examples see LUKANIEC, 2022; SPENCE, 2018; and VAPNARSKY, 2020). Nevertheless, the data encapsulate the languages and cultural heritage of these speakers, granting them the right to determine how and when to utilize them (HOLTON et al., 2022).
In this article, the term archive is used to denote a repository where materials are stored and safeguarded by an organization or institution for present and future reuse. Archives can encompass analog and digital materials, including born-digital and digitized content. A digital repository specifically houses digital materials or records, while a (digital) language archive focuses on linguistic cultural heritage and language data. In the realm of language documentation, Johnson's definition (2004, p. 142) is often cited, stating that an archive is a trusted repository established and maintained by an institution committed to the enduring preservation of resources. To address the absence of the digital aspect in Johnson's definition, an updated perspective is provided by Trevor Owens, Head of Digital Content Management at the US Library of Congress. Owens (2018, p. 4) clarifies that a repository is not merely software but encompasses financial resources, hardware, staff dedication, and policy implementation for sustained content access. The interchangeable use of archive and repository is adopted henceforth. Both definitions underscore key concepts such as institution, commitment, ongoing maintenance, long-term perspective, and preservation. It is emphasized that creating a digital archive necessitates ongoing dedication from the institution or organization involved, as preservation is a continuous endeavor that cannot be neglected.
Numerous institutions worldwide have demonstrated their dedication to maintaining digital archives, with the Digital Endangered Languages and Musics Archives Network (DELAMAN) standing out as a network of member archives specializing in language documentation data. These archives vary in nature, with some being solely digital while others also possess physical holdings. Some focus on specific regions like the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA), while others like the California Language Archive (CLA) accept materials from across the globe. Certain archives, such as the Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR), restrict their intake to data associated with particular grants, while others like the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Language and Culture Institute prioritize materials related to specific languages. The growing awareness of the endangered status of many languages has prompted Latin American institutions, including those in Brazil, to establish local language archives, as discussed by Seifart et al. (2008). Despite the challenges faced by many archives over time, two repositories in Brazil have persevered and are detailed in §3. Additionally, newer archives like the Archivo de Lenguas, Culturas y Memorias Históricas del Ecuador, supported by FLACSO Ecuador, have emerged to further contribute to this vital preservation effort.
While the aforementioned archives encompass a broad spectrum of geographic locations and collection criteria, they may not always align with the needs of every language documentation project. Other viable options include various digital data repositories managed by numerous universities. Linguistic datasets, excluding primary data from language documentation, can be submitted to the Tromsø Repository of Language and Linguistics (TROLLing, https://site.uit.no/trolling/about/). Both primary and secondary data, along with datasets, can find a home in general data repositories like Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/) and the Harvard DataVerse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/). Further alternatives can be explored through the Registry of Research Data Repositories (https://www.re3data.org/).
For researchers involved in documentation projects, archiving language documentation materials offers numerous benefits. These advantages encompass simplified format migration, personal organization, enhanced accessibility, improved discoverability, graded access, efficient rights management, facilitated collaboration, enhanced citability, and long-term digital preservation.
Individuals who have encountered the task of transferring field recordings from outdated mediums like cassette tapes to a more current format, attempted to access an old file using a newer version of a program, or sought out a compatible program to open an antiquated file, are well aware of the challenges associated with format migration. Nonetheless, for researchers engaged in archiving language documentation materials within a digital repository, the concern of format migration becomes a non-issue as it is seamlessly integrated into the archival workflows managed by the repository's staff.
Archiving not only serves as a means of preservation but also aids in personal organization. Initially, researchers may vividly recall the locations and organization of their files upon returning from the field. However, over time, recollection diminishes, making it challenging to remember the file locations, their organization, interrelations, and pertinent metadata crucial for future utilization by either the creator or others. This challenge is exacerbated for digital files, which lack distinct physical attributes, necessitating viewing or opening for identification. The remedy lies in promptly archiving language documentation data and its associated metadata post-creation. Once stored in a reliable repository, the data and metadata remain easily retrievable. Researchers are relieved from the burden of tracking file storage locations across various devices and managing multiple copies and backups. Archiving safeguards against data and metadata loss, disposal, or neglect, ensuring their perpetual accessibility and usability.
Once the materials and metadata are archived, they become accessible to their creators, collaborators, other researchers, members of the language community, and individuals requiring access to the data. Additionally, digital language archives are designed to enhance the discoverability of materials, enabling users to easily locate the specific resources they seek. This discoverability is crucial for searches conducted within the archive through various methods like facet or targeted searching, advanced searches, among others, as well as for searches performed on broader internet platforms such as Google indexing and metadata harvesting by the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC).
While there are digital repositories that claim to be purely open access, all digital language archives have rules governing user interactions with their holdings, often implementing graded access systems where certain materials may be restricted based on user privileges or specific conditions (refer to §2.5). In terms of usage regulations, digital language archives typically require online visitors to agree to terms or conditions before accessing media files, with many archives mandating the creation of a free account for login purposes. Despite this, catalog information, or metadata, is generally publicly available for viewing by anyone visiting the archive's webpage. Graded access to media files is a common practice among language archives, with varying methods of implementation across different platforms. For instance, AILLA employs numbered access levels to denote varying degrees of access, while other archives utilize specialized user roles or color-coded systems to indicate permissions for specific materials.
Most digital archives specializing in language documentation data typically manage rights in a similar manner, with variations in specific details across different archives. Generally, the original rights holders maintain all intellectual and cultural property rights, granting non-exclusive licenses to both the archive and its users. The specifics of these licenses differ among archives and are contingent upon the copyright laws of the country where each archive is situated. Notably, commercial utilization of the data is strictly prohibited in all cases.
Data archiving plays a pivotal role in fostering collaboration across various levels. For researchers engaged in remote collaboration with speech communities or peers, archiving data in real-time or upon completion of analyses aids in maintaining project organization. Furthermore, organized and archived data can be accessed by other researchers, opening avenues for potential collaborations. Additionally, archiving data facilitates the reuse of primary data for diverse research purposes, particularly in fields like natural language processing and linguistic typology. The ability to cite archived data is essential for ensuring reproducibility in research, as emphasized by Berez-Kroeker et al. (2018). Certain journals, such as Language Documentation & Conservation, mandate the archiving and proper citation of data sets associated with articles. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to cite their own archived data, while those utilizing archived data are also expected to cite them accordingly.
A reliable digital repository must have a robust strategy in place for the enduring digital preservation of digital media files and their associated metadata. As outlined by the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC), digital preservation encompasses a set of managed activities aimed at ensuring sustained access to digital materials for as long as necessary, extending beyond potential media failures or shifts in technology and organizational structures. Long-term preservation, as defined by the DPC (2015), involves the perpetual access to digital materials or, at the very least, the information they contain. This underscores that digital preservation goes beyond mere file backups, encompassing tasks such as data and metadata migration between formats and software systems to adapt to technological advancements. It also involves maintaining accurate redundancy of data through duplicate copies stored across various media types and locations, alongside regular monitoring of file integrity. As highlighted by Owens (2018, p. 5), preservation is an ongoing process requiring continuous human effort and resource allocation, emphasizing that it is not a one-time expense but a sustained commitment.
Having elucidated the benefits of archiving language documentation data, it is imperative to differentiate digital archives from other online platforms often mistaken for them, including social media sharing platforms, websites, and cloud-based file storage services.
Social media sharing platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo, and SoundCloud (refer to Figure 2) enable the sharing of video and audio files with various communities and individuals, as their content is readily discoverable through online search engines. These platforms also aid in rights management by providing uploaders the option to select between traditional copyright protection or the utilization of a Creative Commons license. Nevertheless, a significant portion of users lack a comprehensive understanding of both traditional copyright laws and the implications of Creative Commons licenses, which hinders their ability to make informed decisions. Additionally, these platforms offer varying levels of access control, allowing users to keep their content private or make it accessible to the public.
Websites play a crucial role in enabling content sharing, with the ability to incorporate code that enhances discoverability by search engines. However, restricting access to content poses technical challenges. Although websites are automatically protected by traditional copyright laws, developers have the option to implement Rights Statements or open licenses, like those offered by Creative Commons, to govern the content on webpages and associated files.
File storage systems such as DropBox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and Box serve as effective tools for sharing files with collaborators during active collaboration and for managing access to these files. However, these platforms lack built-in rights management features and are not discoverable through web searches.
While these data-sharing options are effective, none of them prioritize the enduring digital preservation of files or data. Although they may provide some level of content backup, they do not guarantee long-term preservation. The terms of service for these platforms typically grant them the authority to terminate services, erase accounts, and their associated content. Additionally, certain platforms like YouTube maintain duplicates of materials even after deletion by users, or they could be susceptible to automated downloads by external websites, posing a significant risk when handling sensitive data (RICE, 2021).
Before the 21st century, language documentation outcomes were usually stored at the conclusion of a researcher's career or posthumously. Nevertheless, due to the emergence of born-digital recording devices, language archives, and data archiving mandates, contemporary researchers do not delay as long as their predecessors did.
Today's mantra, often echoed by archivists, emphasizes the importance of "Archive early and archive often!" Many language archives advocate for a progressive or incremental archiving approach. In this framework, researchers or research teams promptly submit primary data, such as audio and video recordings and photographs, along with relevant metadata (including participant names, dates, locations, languages used, and contextual descriptive information for the media files) to a digital repository immediately after their creation (refer to step 1 in Figure 3). Secondary data, like annotations, transcriptions, and interlinear glossed texts, as well as academic analyses or outputs (steps 2 and 3 in Figure 3), are subsequently added once finalized (ROBINSON, 2006; NATHAN, 2013; KUNG et al., 2020). The steps depicted in Figure 3 symbolize waves of archiving. Step 1, involving the archiving of primary data and relevant metadata, should ideally occur post the completion of fieldwork or data collection, or even concurrently with ongoing data collection. Step 2, which entails archiving secondary data and relevant metadata, can be carried out iteratively as transcriptions and translations are completed. Step 3, the archiving of finalized analyses and academic output with relevant metadata, can also be an iterative process extending into the future. This methodology acknowledges that there is never a truly convenient time for researchers or others to archive language documentation data. The longer the delay between data collection and archiving, and the more digital files and physical materials accumulate, the more challenging and time-consuming the archiving process becomes. Additionally, immediately after a period of fieldwork or data collection, when everything is fresh in a researcher's mind, organizing materials accurately and ensuring thorough metadata is much more manageable.
Archiving plays a crucial role in the long-term preservation, accessibility, and discoverability of language documentation data. However, not all data are suitable for archiving in the same manner. Some materials may be culturally or personally sensitive to the extent that they should not be archived at all. Other materials might necessitate restricted access, as discussed in §2.3, limiting engagement to specific individuals. These restrictions can vary across different formats such as audio, video, or written transcriptions of the same content. Examples of sensitive material include esoteric or confidential knowledge intended for specific audiences, potentially harmful speech, and information that could jeopardize individuals or communities. Effective language documentation and archiving require continuous and transparent communication among documenters, speakers/signers, and community members to ensure an ethical and well-informed process, as detailed in §4.
In conclusion, it is crucial to carefully select a repository for language documentation materials that guarantees their long-term preservation and accessibility. Numerous archives, such as those within the DELAMAN consortium, possess the required infrastructure and cater to an international audience, emphasizing their non-proprietary nature regardless of their hosting country. Despite this, archiving efforts hold significance at various scales - local, regional, national, and international. At times, it might be prudent to store materials in multiple locations to address local needs while benefiting from superior infrastructure that ensures optimal preservation and access, as discussed in sections 3.2 and 6 below.
This section delves into archiving initiatives in Brazil and their significance for the documentation of indigenous languages in the country. Given the multitude of indigenous languages in Brazil and their vulnerable status (Moore, Galucio, & Gabas, 2008), urgent attention is needed for language documentation, a cause widely endorsed by indigenous communities. According to the National Inventory of Linguistic Diversity's survey of languages in Rondônia, indigenous peoples prioritize documentation as the second most crucial aspect after rectifying flawed orthographies and generating accurate written materials (Galucio, Moore, & Van der Voort, 2018, p. 217). Many indigenous groups have youth proficient in computer skills, facilitating digital documentation and potentially leading to a substantial number of recordings. However, the permanent preservation and accessibility of these recordings necessitate extensive digital storage capacity.
In the subsequent sections, we delineate the indigenous language materials collection housed at the Goeldi Museum in Belém, Brazil, serving as a tangible representation of a language archive within the Brazilian context, detailing its inception, establishment, and contents (§3.1). Subsequently, we offer a concise overview of additional digital language archiving endeavors in Brazil (§3.2), with the Museu do Índio emerging as the primary exemplar in this domain. Furthermore, we present various language documentation projects and their resultant impacts to underscore the overarching necessity for documentation and archiving practices within the nation, while also exploring the potential of regional archives.
The Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, a research institute affiliated with the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MCTI), is situated in Belém, within the state of Pará, and is primarily dedicated to Amazonian research. Within its Human Sciences Division, the Linguistics Area has faced a tumultuous past. Back in 1986, the Area lacked essential tools such as a recorder, computer, and had only a limited collection of books. This scarcity of resources was a common issue in the region, with minimal investment in infrastructure. Despite these challenges, the Goeldi boasted a strong tradition of scientific collections, making it a fitting environment for language documentation endeavors. Over time, the involvement of interns, fellows, and visiting researchers has significantly bolstered the activities within the Linguistics Area, particularly in the realm of documentation.
The infrastructure saw significant improvements with the acquisition of high-quality cassette tape recorders, microphones, laptops, and solar equipment through research projects. In 1996, the World Bank's Centers of Excellence program introduced Digital Audio Tape (DAT) players, Hi-8 video recorders, a Hi-8 editing island, and professional storage cabinets. Drawing from their accumulated experience, Goeldi linguists, including fellows and affiliates, successfully participated in international documentation programs beneficial to projects in developing countries. The early 2000s witnessed additional support from projects like the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme (ELDP) and the Dokumentation Bedrohter Sprachen program (DOBES), providing more equipment and expertise. Throughout the latter half of the decade, documentation and equipment procurement, such as solid-state recorders with flash memory, continued with backing from USAID, UNESCO, and the Ambassador's Fund (US Embassy). MCTI contributed equipment in 2007, including a server for a digital repository foundation. Projects in documentation and research persisted in the latter part of the 2000s, supported by CNPq, DOBES, and ELDP. Progress faced a setback in 2007 due to vehement opposition from a small group of linguists against the ProDocLin Museum's linguistic documentation program, international documentation initiatives, and digital archives (MOORE and GALUCIO, 2016, p. 40). Fortunately, this opposition failed to garner support among Brazilian linguists, allowing progress to continue both at the Goeldi Museum and across Brazil.
Up until 2009, linguists at the Goeldi Institute had amassed a wide array of recording media, including cassette tapes, DAT tapes, mini-disks, Hi-8 tapes, and mini-DV tapes. However, due to limitations in time and budget, this collection was haphazardly stored in drawers without any systematic organization. From 2009 to 2014, linguist Ana Vilacy Galucio spearheaded a project, backed by the CFDD/Ministry of Justice, aimed at digitizing and cataloging this collection in alignment with global archival standards. To enhance the efficiency of cataloging and storing recordings along with their metadata, scripts were developed by Sebastian Drude and Rose Costa, resulting in a 70% reduction in the time required for these tasks. Consequently, the Goeldi Institute's digital linguistic archive was successfully established.
In subsequent years, there was an increase in equipment acquisition and the undertaking of more documentation projects. The evolution of the Goeldi Linguistics Area archive has been marked by technological advancements, leading to changes in formats and physical media. Nevertheless, the conversion of all recordings into standardized digital formats has effectively addressed issues related to longevity and compatibility. Certain devices like microphones retain their relevance over time, while various types of recorders (such as DAT and mini-DV) that are no longer in active use for documentation purposes are still maintained for accessing legacy recordings and generating digitizable signals. Original recordings are securely stored on their initial media within professional storage cabinets.
Currently, digital recordings are stored on a 32TB Network Attached Storage (NAS) system. To ensure security and data integrity, RAID-6 redundancy is employed in case of a NAS hard drive failure, resulting in a reduced storage capacity of 22TB. The contents of this NAS are then duplicated onto a new 96TB NAS, which, due to redundancy measures, operates at a reduced capacity of 72TB (refer to Figure 4). To mitigate risks such as fire or lightning, it is imperative that these two NAS systems are housed in separate buildings. Audio recordings are preserved in their original .wav format, while video recordings are stored in both their highest definition and compressed (.mpg) formats to optimize space utilization. These compressed video and audio files are meticulously organized and stored using Language Archiving Technology (LAT) software. The majority of these files are additionally backed up on the server managed by the Information and Communication Technology Sector of the Goeldi Museum.
The Linguistics Area digital archive currently houses records of 80 indigenous languages, with 73 of them fully digitized, catalogued, and stored in the LAT software. These LAT files collectively occupy 2.49 TB of space, encompassing 1,561 hours of audio and 474 hours of video content. Additionally, the archive includes 9TB of raw recordings, notably High Definition videos, which significantly contribute to the storage requirements. Edited works, primarily intended for community utilization, account for an additional 1.5 TB of space. Moreover, 6 TB is allocated for photographs and miscellaneous files related to the researchers. The metadata for the LAT files can be accessed on the server at http://arqling.museu-goeldi.br. Presently, the recordings are not available for download as the archive undergoes reorganization and addresses access-related challenges.
To enhance the documentation of indigenous languages in Brazil, linguists at the Goeldi Institute disseminate knowledge of technology and methodology through intensive training, along with equipment recommendations. This training extends to indigenous communities, while the institute also provides digitization and storage services for preserving legacy recordings. An ongoing project involves collaborating with an anthropologist to digitize a collection of 115 cassette tapes containing recordings of two Nambikwara dialects, some dating back to the 1970s. These recordings encompass music, a dictionary, conversations, and minimal tone pairs, all of which are being digitized and will soon be catalogued and archived digitally. The anthropologist will receive copies in .mp3 format, which are space-efficient and can be shared with Nambikwara communities. Researchers can choose to deposit their cassette tapes in the archive or have them returned. Those interested in this service are encouraged to reach out to the Goeldi Linguistics Area at linguistica@museu-goeldi.br.
Few Brazilian institutions are as actively engaged in archiving initiatives as the Museu do Índio in Rio de Janeiro, a key component of the Fundação Nacional do Índio. Over time, this museum has significantly expanded its infrastructure and established robust digital storage and backup capabilities. It has been at the forefront of documenting indigenous languages and cultures, adhering to global best practices. The museum's digital archive currently houses around 10 TB of linguistic documentation, encompassing the languages of 25 indigenous groups, and 9 TB of cultural documentation from 27 indigenous groups, including linguistically significant recordings. Notably, the 'Indigenous Sonorities' project, which focuses on cultural preservation through audio documentation, has generated 1.69 TB of content for five indigenous groups. In total, the archive comprises approximately 50 TB of data. While copies of all recordings are returned to the respective communities, challenges related to Internet access are still being addressed.
Several well-organized linguistic documentation projects, spearheaded by Brazilian linguists, are currently underway, generating substantial volumes of recordings and consequently heightening the demand for professional archiving services. Notably, the Documentation Center at the Federal University of Amapá in Oiapoque is actively engaged in documentation initiatives with the Karipuna and Galibi-Marworno communities (led by Gelsama Mara Ferreira do Santos) as well as the Palikur community (led by Elissandra Barros da Silva). Presently, data is being housed on microcomputers and external hard drives. The Galibi-Marworno project, for instance, encompasses 13.5 GB of audio files in .wav format, 403 GB of video files in .mov and .mp4 formats, along with 51 GB of photos and 15 GB of edited video content. In comparison, the Palikur project comprises 20 GB of audio recordings, 6 TB of video files in .mp4 format, and an extensive collection of over 100,000 photographs in RAW format, totaling 10 TB of data.
The demand for language documentation archives in Brazil, as well as globally, is on the rise and currently surpasses the existing capacity. One potential solution to address this capacity gap is the establishment of regional digital archives. These archives not only enhance the current capacity but also offer the advantage of being in close proximity to and visible for the indigenous communities in the area. This proximity could facilitate further recordings and improve the access of indigenous groups to these recordings. Indigenous training programs at universities, such as the Universidade de Amazonas, the Universidade Federal de Goiás, or the Universidade Federal do Amapá in Oiapoque, serve as natural locations for such archives. In these programs, indigenous students receive training in computer literacy while maintaining connections with their respective communities, fostering a productive collaboration between the archive and the involved groups. The infrastructure for such an archive can be acquired all at once or gradually built up, as seen in the case of the Goeldi, in conjunction with research or documentation projects. The cost of a 48TB NAS (Network Attached Storage) was around R$20,000 in mid-2021 (with the dollar at R$5.80). For digital language documentation, a comprehensive set of high-quality portable semi-professional equipment (including a camcorder, tripod, digital audio recorder, laptop, various microphones, lamp, carrying case, batteries, cords, and adapters) also amounted to approximately R$20,000. At least two sets would be necessary to equip a regional documentation center and archive. Alongside infrastructure, training in documentation technology and methodology is crucial to ensure quality, which remains a persistent challenge. One unresolved issue is the necessity for archiving software that is user-friendly and straightforward.
The archiving options discussed in this section vary in their capacity to achieve the primary objectives of preservation, conservation, and accessibility, aligning with the insights shared in the preceding section. While smaller-scale archiving endeavors, like those outlined here, may not fully adhere to DELAMAN standards across all facets, they do signify progress and, in certain instances, may enhance accessibility even if their long-term preservation capabilities are less robust. Additionally, researchers should consider the potential for archiving at local or regional levels as well as within higher-infrastructure archives, as exemplified by the Paresi and Enawene Nawe case studies detailed in the subsequent section.
This section delves into the various methods through which individuals within a language community can actively participate in archival initiatives, while also addressing the ethical dilemmas surrounding informed consent and accessibility that arise from their engagement.
Community members may engage with an archive in varying degrees of directness. A prime illustration of a highly direct interaction is exemplified in the "Verdena Parker Collection of Hupa Sound Recordings and Films" (PARKER, n.d., housed at the California Language Archive). Verdena Parker, a proficient Hupa speaker (Dene, also known as Athabaskan; California), dedicated numerous decades to creating sound recordings and films, ultimately collaborating with linguists from the University of California, Berkeley on a documentation endeavor that commenced in 2005 (refer to PARKER et al., 2005+). These recordings, archived in 2010, encompass a range of materials such as texts, vocabulary, translations, and insights into life in Hoopa Valley, intended for utilization in language revitalization initiatives.
The majority of archival projects typically involve individuals who do not directly engage with the archive and may lack prior knowledge of archiving practices. An illustration of this is the "Kawahiva Language Documentation Archive" (DOS SANTOS, 2017+), an ongoing collection comprising audio and video recordings of various linguistic elements such as stories, conversations, songs, elicitation, meetings, field notes, and photographs. Two speakers are responsible for recording, transcribing, and submitting files on a monthly basis for archiving, fostering a sense of ownership over the archive. Depositor Wesley dos Santos has further produced a video tutorial to guide community members on accessing these materials through the California Language Archive.
The individuals spearheading a documentation and archiving project, regardless of their organizational ties, are bound by an ethical obligation to effectively convey, elucidate, and secure consent for their undertakings from the participants and other stakeholders within the community. In the subsequent sections, we delve into these ethical obligations and propose various approaches to fulfill them (§4.1), exemplified through a case study drawn from the collaborative efforts of co-author Rosés Labrada with the Mako community in Venezuela (§4.2). Towards the conclusion of this segment (§4.3), we deliberate on methods to facilitate community access to the archived materials.
Discussions on ethics and ethical best practices have been prominently featured in the language documentation literature. These discussions have emphasized collaboration (GLENN, 2009; LEONARD and HAYNES, 2010), community involvement and engagement (YAMADA, 2007; CZAYKOWSKA-HIGGINS, 2009; SAPIÉN, 2018; BISCHOFF and JANY, 2018), and the adaptability of ethical models across different regions (DOBRIN, 2008; HOLTON, 2009; PÉREZ BÁEZ, ROGERS and ROSÉS LABRADA, 2016). The intersection of archiving and ethics has also garnered significant attention, with Macri and Sarmento (2010) and Innes (2010) delving into ethical concerns related to archives. Informed consent has been a focal point in these discussions, prompting researchers to question the level of 'informed' consent obtained (GRINEVALD, 2006; ROBINSON, 2010). Dwyer (2006, p. 43-48) provides an overview of some of the issues surrounding informed consent.
In many jurisdictions, including Brazil, informed consent is both a legal and moral imperative. It is crucial for participants to comprehend the implications of their involvement and, significantly, the ramifications of digital archiving. A potential obstacle to informed consent in archiving lies in the familiarity of the community or speakers with archives, the Internet, and sometimes even computers. Robinson (2010, p. 189) raises a pertinent question: can true informed consent be obtained for archiving if the individuals involved have no exposure to computers, archives, or the Internet? There are two additional complexities to consider. Firstly, research is inherently open-ended, with initial research questions potentially leading to new inquiries. Consequently, if project objectives shift or new questions emerge, does the original consent remain valid? This unpredictability is particularly challenging with archived data, which may be repurposed by others. Secondly, future generations and communities might require these materials for revitalization efforts, as discussed in Bomfim (2017). In the subsequent discussion, we illustrate these challenges and propose one potential approach, among various alternatives, to mitigate these issues.
This case study discusses co-author Rosés Labrada's experience in educating members of the Mako communities along the Ventuari River in Venezuela about archiving during his doctoral project (2012-2015), which concentrated on documenting and describing Mako, a Jodï-Sáliban language (Rosés Labrada, 2015).
In 2011, Rosés Labrada embarked on a journey to various Mako communities situated along the Ventuari River and its tributaries with the objective of securing community consent for the overarching project. Adhering to local customs, village meetings were convened in multiple communities, leading to an invitation to return and collaborate in two specific communities: Arena Blanca and San José de Yureva. However, no data was gathered during this initial visit. Consequently, the documentation project officially commenced in July 2012, with Arena Blanca being chosen as the inaugural field site due to its predominantly homogenous Mako-speaking population.
The initial groundwork for a community-wide dialogue on ethics and informed consent commenced on July 14, 2012, during a session involving two community members who concurrently served as school teachers in Arena Blanca. These individuals had graciously agreed to facilitate translation during the meeting. A pivotal realization emerged from the discussion with the schoolteachers, highlighting the anticipated challenge in elucidating the intricacies of archiving to an external linguist. The complexity inherent in certain concepts and technical aspects posed a barrier to clear comprehension. Notably, the absence of internet connectivity and telecommunication services, coupled with the dearth of computers within the community, compounded the issue. Furthermore, the teachers' limited exposure to such technologies added another layer of complexity to the situation.
The community-wide meeting held on July 15 saw a substantial turnout of community adults actively participating in discussions regarding the project and the ethical considerations surrounding the recording and archiving of audiovisual materials. As the primary purpose of this meeting was to obtain consent for recording, no actual recording took place during the event. Nevertheless, significant progress was made in the process of seeking permission throughout the course of the meeting.
The utilization of both video and audio recording was deemed appropriate and widely accepted in the study.
Taking photographs was deemed permissible, albeit with the stipulation that images of naked children or women without tops should be refrained from, as the community had moved away from these customary customs.
Retaining the data beyond the project's timeline and disseminating it beyond the immediate community were also deemed permissible.
However, Rosés Labrada identified a lack of clarity surrounding the concept of archiving, specifically in relation to two key areas: (1) the potential consequences of sharing online materials that could reveal the identities of specific individuals, and (2) the available choices for either sharing or limiting access to such materials or the associated personal information. In response, the linguist endeavored to ensure that the community comprehended the intricacies of the archiving procedure. His objective was to provide a visual representation of what the archive's collection would entail, yet he encountered difficulties due to the community's limited access to the Internet.
The approach employed involved capturing screenshots of an initial archival deposit to visually represent the appearance of the archive's website and the navigation process. To prepare for this, Rosés Labrada and a schoolteacher visited the AILLA and ELAR websites in Puerto Ayacucho, the capital of Amazonas state. Subsequently, the schoolteacher consented to deposit one of his recorded stories, initiating a collection that would be archived in both repositories. Following the deposit of a folder containing all items related to a single story, both archives provided screenshots illustrating the appearance of the collection and the deposit process.
A second community-wide meeting took place on November 4, 2012 in Arena Blanca following Rosés Labrada's return with the aforementioned screenshots. The ensuing discussion demonstrated a higher level of understanding on various fronts. Initially, a request was made for the originals to remain within the community. This request enabled the linguist to delve deeper into the context of digital documentation, explaining that certain recordings were originally created in digital format, highlighting that originals and duplicates could be indistinguishable, and emphasizing the ease with which duplicates could be produced—contrasting this with the more familiar recording methods involving cassettes or CDs/DVDs within the community.
A second issue that arose pertained to the accessibility of archived materials for community members, highlighting a distinction between those "who know" - individuals proficient in using computers and the Internet - and those "who don't know." It was generally agreed upon that those with knowledge could access the materials online, while those lacking such skills would require copies on DVDs and CDs. Another concern raised was the content of the recordings, with one community member expressing worry about recordings containing inappropriate humor or profanity and the potential audience for such content. The focus was not on global access but rather on how neighboring Mako people might perceive and react to such recordings, particularly if they misunderstood the context of jokes. Additionally, the discussion touched upon the perceived harmlessness of videos showcasing traditional activities in contrast to more violent content. It was emphasized that individual speakers had the authority to control access during and after recording, with the flexibility to adjust access permissions as needed. This dialogue indicated a heightened awareness among Arena Blanca community members, compared to a previous meeting in July 2012, regarding the ethical considerations surrounding informed consent, archiving, and access.
This small case study highlights three key points: firstly, the importance of explaining archiving in ways that are accessible to communities and individual participants; secondly, the necessity for communities and participants to have the ability to review and reconsider their decisions; and thirdly, the significance of anticipating future uses of materials and making appropriate provisions, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty of the future. Ethical considerations are often nuanced and context-dependent, with solutions that may not be universally applicable (HOLTON, 2009; GASSER, 2017). Nevertheless, by prioritizing principles such as respect, reciprocity, responsibility, and relationships, as proposed by Rice (2006), it is possible to navigate potential ethical challenges that may arise during the archiving process.
The Mako case exemplifies the significance of possessing and preserving language documentation materials as a primary concern for communities, not only for those directly engaged in documentation but also, at times, even more so for their descendants (e.g., DWYER, 2006, p. 59; VAPNARSKY, 2020; R. MILLER, 2021). However, effectively returning these materials to communities entails a complex and multi-stage process that must consider the varying capacities community members possess to access such resources. These capacities may be limited not only by a lack of internet access, which is essential for viewing and downloading archived materials from digital repositories, but also by the skills needed to navigate online interfaces (often presented in languages like English) and by basic computer literacy. Some communities may face challenges in accessing even static technologies like CD and DVD players, as well as in reading printed materials in their community language or other languages.
Enabling access to language documentation materials may necessitate innovative approaches. One successful model that has garnered significant attention is the concept of a "distributed digital audiovisual archive" or "jukebox archive" (BARWICK, 2004; BARWICK et al., 2005; O’MEARA and GONZÁLEZ GUADARRAMA, 2016). Initially trialed in Australia, this initiative involves the installation of a computer in a community center or similar neutral venue for easy community access, independent of an internet connection. The jukebox computer houses language documentation resources like audio and video recordings, potential transcriptions, photographs, in easily transferable file formats like .mp3. Additionally, it is equipped to burn CDs/DVDs, download files onto portable devices like flash drives, phones, or .mp3 players. This setup allows community members to take copies of materials home and contribute their own content to the jukebox. Another effective approach involves utilizing a local wifi transmitter known as a 'Raspberry Pi', particularly beneficial in environments where individuals possess smartphones and related skills but lack computer literacy (e.g. THIEBERGER, 2019).
Ethical considerations are integral to various initiatives, not only in facilitating and preserving access to documentary materials but also in determining whether and how community members may choose to restrict their access and utilization (refer to the aforementioned sections; also consult MACRI and SARMENTO, 2010; DEBENPORT, 2010). Certain recorded content might be perceived as potentially harmful, risky, offensive, or inherently private, and the delineation of who should or should not be granted access to specific materials can involve intricate and overlapping categories, linked to distinct notions of outsider/insider, gender, clan, neighbor, relative, and more – complexities that surpass the generic term 'community'. As emphasized earlier, decisions regarding access, akin to other aspects of documentation and archiving, must be consistently guided by ethical principles.
Archives have traditionally expanded their collections through donations from living individuals, often academic researchers, or through bequeathments from deceased individuals. However, there are various ways to enhance and diversify the scope of archives beyond this conventional approach. Increasingly, speakers and indigenous collaborators are actively contributing to the archival process, both directly and indirectly, as discussed in §4. Additionally, researchers, community members, and archive personnel can play a proactive role in identifying and safeguarding legacy materials, a collaborative effort involving multiple stakeholders. This section delves into practical considerations related to locating and archiving legacy materials, which typically consist of written or audiovisual content gathered in the pre-digital era (§5.1), and utilizing them effectively (§5.2).
Researchers who have experience working with speakers of indigenous languages often possess valuable documentary collections, including field notes, sound recordings, photographs, and film, which may be stored in less than ideal conditions in their offices or homes, risking damage from factors like humidity, insects, or flooding. These legacy materials, despite not always being numerous, hold significant linguistic, cultural, historical, and personal importance for individuals and communities. Particularly for less documented languages, these materials may serve as the sole early records of language usage, along with capturing various aspects of life. Unlike widely spoken languages like Portuguese, which have easily accessible historical records, many indigenous languages rely on diligent archiving efforts to preserve their historical records through legacy materials. As emphasized by Austin (2017), these existing materials, whether digital or analog, such as tape recordings or written documents from earlier periods, can be crucial sources of information, sometimes being the only available data. Linguists have a duty to recognize and preserve these legacy materials, collaborating with communities to ensure their conservation for the benefit of linguistics, related disciplines, and future generations. This preservation enables subsequent philological analysis of the documentary record, acknowledging the lineage of linguistic data as they are recorded, interpreted, and analyzed over time. Simultaneously, linguists must approach their engagement with legacy materials ethically, as highlighted by O'Meara and Good (2010), ensuring responsible practices in their preservation and utilization.
Preserving legacy materials involves several crucial steps: locating the materials, appraising their physical condition, organizing them in a basic manner, transporting them to an archive or another safe location, conducting any necessary conservation remediation, cataloging them, and ideally digitizing them (not necessarily in this order). Locating legacy materials can be challenging, often requiring accidental discovery of their existence and whereabouts or significant investigative efforts. A deep understanding of the histories of research and exploration in specific regions across various disciplines can facilitate the process of locating these materials. It is essential to carefully examine descriptions, typically found in the methodology or similar sections, of early publications (including unpublished works, when accessible) to aid in this endeavor.
For instance, the late anthropologist Gerald Weiss (refer to O’HAGAN, 2021 for context) discussed the outcomes of his fieldwork in Ashaninka communities along the Tambo River of Peru from 1961 to 1964 in a section of his PhD dissertation titled "Design and Method" (WEISS, 1969, p. 6).
The techniques utilized in the field to gather information adhered to standard practices, tailored to the specific demands of the data being collected. A journal was diligently maintained, documenting daily temperature, humidity, and precipitation measurements at the campsite. Information gathered through observation and interviews was meticulously recorded on four-by-six slips or other suitable forms, duplicated for accuracy, with each slip noting the date, location, and informant's identity. Additionally, specimens, photographs, and tape recordings were meticulously collected whenever feasible.
Author O’Hagan was acquainted with Weiss’s work through his own fieldwork with speakers of the related Caquinte language, although he had previously overlooked the "Design and Method" section in his dissertation. This section revealed the existence, at least at a certain point in time, of field notes, index cards (resembling slips), biological specimens, photographs, and sound recordings. Gerald Weiss later assumed a professorship in anthropology at Florida Atlantic University, as confirmed by a Google search in March 2021 indicating his continued affiliation with the institution as an emeritus professor. Subsequent inquiries via phone call during the same period confirmed that all the aforementioned materials, along with additional items from postdoctoral research, were housed at his residence in Florida (refer to ANWAR, 2021 for further elaboration).
The organization of legacy materials can pose challenges when the items, such as field notes or tapes, lack associated metadata and when specialists proficient in a particular language are unavailable. Moreover, some materials may be stored in formats that are not easily accessible, like analog reel-to-reel tapes prevalent from the 1950s to the 1970s, a crucial era for documenting various languages. In such cases, it may be advantageous to engage with community members for interpretation or to digitize the materials, either through an external audio technician or an archive as part of a donation. The primary objective at this stage is to create a basic inventory of the items (notebooks, tapes, etc.) before their transfer, ensuring a documented record for verification that all materials reach their intended destination. In instances where metadata is lacking, alternative physical descriptions of the objects can be provided (e.g., "two tapes with red design on cover").
The objective when transporting legacy materials is to ensure they are sent to a location with better storage conditions temporarily or to facilitate their transfer to an archive. The transportation phase poses significant risks to archival materials. Ideally, highly delicate items like tapes should be personally transported, such as in carry-on luggage. For other materials, it is crucial to keep them dry, using plastic coverings and keeping them separate from potentially damaging items. When shipping materials, it is advisable to use high-quality cardboard boxes with ample tape and bubble wrap. Opting for airmail over ground transportation, if feasible, is preferred as it involves less handling of boxes. It is essential to maintain communication with an archive at this stage for additional guidance. Archives are well-equipped to advise on cataloging and digitization processes. It is emphasized that digitizing analog sound recordings and films is often urgent due to tape degradation over time and inadequate prior storage conditions not meeting archival standards, with common issues being humidity and water damage.
Legacy materials play a crucial role in preserving the voices and knowledge of individuals who predate other documentation initiatives by several decades, often serving as the final repositories of first-language speakers or semi-speakers. These materials are invaluable resources for community endeavors in language revitalization, cultural heritage preservation, and for scholars seeking to delve into the extensive spectrum of human expression.
Once materials have been archived, there may be a significant lapse of time before they are accessed and utilized by others. For instance, linguist Catherine Callaghan (1931-2019) recorded Sarah Ballard speaking Bodega Miwok in 1960 while pursuing her graduate studies in linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley (PhD, 1963). These recordings, along with others, were contributed to the California Language Archive in 1979 (BALLARD and CALLAGHAN, n.d.). Decades later, in 2019, linguist Andrew Cowell (Berkeley PhD in 1993) transcribed these recordings in ELAN, aligning them with time, and subsequently deposited them in the same repository (COWELL, 2019+). These two collections are interconnected in the archive's digital catalog, facilitating easy cross-referencing. Similarly, linguist Gladwyn Kingsley Noble, Jr. (1923-1994) captured speakers of Wapishana and Atorai during a research trip to Guyana in 1965. After passing through various academic hands, the 13 tapes were eventually donated to the California Language Archive around 2006 by Manjari Ohala (see GEORGE et al., 1965). The Atorai recordings, previously believed to lack any remaining native speakers, were utilized by O'Hagan (2018) for an initial phonological analysis, further expanded upon by E. Miller (2021) in an undergraduate honors thesis. In 2021, the texts from these recordings were translated by current Wapishana community members, potentially laying the groundwork for a forthcoming workshop dedicated to the Atorai language in 2022 (K. RYBKA, p.c.).
Legacy materials are emphasized as valuable resources that can be continuously utilized, with their usage requiring interpretation involving a creative process of understanding the original intentions of the creators, potential new meanings in current contexts, and the roles contemporary individuals may assume in the materials' circulation and reception (DOBRIN and SCHWARTZ, 2021, p. 23). An exemplary instance of ongoing engagement with legacy materials is the biennial Breath of Life Archival Institute for Indigenous California Languages (GEHR, 2013) hosted at the University of California, Berkeley. This initiative, organized by the Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival (AICLS) in collaboration with the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages, which oversees the California Language Archive, brings indigenous individuals to the Berkeley campus to collaborate with volunteer linguists in interpreting archival materials, some dating back to the early 20th century. This successful model has been replicated in various locations (BALDWIN, PÉREZ BÁEZ and HINTON, 2018), prompting consideration of a similar endeavor in Brazil to enhance the accessibility of existing language materials.
This section presents two case studies that exemplify language documentation and archiving practices in Brazil, showcasing projects conducted in partnership with the Paresi-Haliti and Enawene Nawe communities under the guidance of Ana Paula Brandão. Following a concise overview of these indigenous languages, we delve into the specifics of the documentation initiatives (§6.1) and the subsequent creation of archival resources (§6.2).
Paresi (Glottocode pare1272, latitude -14.59 and longitude -57.41) is an indigenous language spoken by a people of the same name, with a population of around 3000 individuals residing in various communities in the State of Mato Grosso, close to Cuiabá, along the tributaries of the Juruena River. The Enawene Nawe language (Glottolog code enaw1238, latitude -12.43 and longitude -58.98) is spoken by a smaller group of about 1000 individuals, who inhabit two communities (Halataikwa and Kolinakwa) within an Indigenous Territory situated near Juína in Mato Grosso and Vilhena in Rondônia.
Both languages, Enawene Nawe (EN) and Paresi, are part of the Arawakan family, as noted by Payne (1991), Aikhenvald (1999), and Ramirez (2001). Brandão, Carvalho, and Pereira (2018) along with Pereira (2018) provide evidence suggesting a close relationship between EN and Paresi, proposing that they, along with the Saraveka language, form a subgroup termed Juruena. While previous classifications of the Arawak family varied, Fabre (2005) was the only one to suggest a proximity between Paresi and Enenawe Nawe. Payne (1991) grouped Paresi with Waurá in a Central group, and Aikhenvald (1999) classified Paresi with the Xingu languages in a 'Paresi-Xingu' branch.
Considerable documentation and description of the Paresi language have been extensively carried out. Ana Paula Brandão and Glauber Silva independently undertook the documentation of the language over a span of several years. Noteworthy descriptive works on Paresi include Silva (2009, 2013) and Brandão (2010, 2014). In contrast, the documentation of EN is relatively recent; the known descriptive works include Rezende (2003, 2013), Brandão and Reis (2020), and Reis (2020). In 2005, the project 'Sketch grammar, texts, and dictionary of Enawene Nawe (Arawak, Brazil)' received funding from the Endangered Languages Documentation Program (ELDP), but regrettably, the project remained incomplete. Subsequently, in 2019, Brandão secured funding from the ELDP, facilitated through the Federal University of Pará, for the project 'Documentation of the Enawene Nawe language'.
The Paresi language documentation project commenced in 2006 and evolved through Brandão's doctoral and postdoctoral research on the language. Similarly, the EN language documentation project was initiated in May 2019, with a projected completion date set for the end of 2022. The primary objectives of both endeavors were to curate an extensive collection of audio and video recordings encompassing diverse linguistic genres. These recordings were transcribed in the respective indigenous language and subsequently translated into Portuguese.
The documentation of Paresi began at the behest of the Rio Formoso community, who expressed a keen interest in preserving their traditional culture. In the EN Halataikwa community, we established contact with a fluent speaker of the language who extended an invitation for us to visit and present our project proposal. With the communities' approval, we were granted permission to record materials under a non-profit framework. The communities reaped benefits from the creation of DVDs, CDs, and USB drives containing traditional stories and songs, as well as from the training of indigenous educators in linguistic documentation. The Paresi materials also formed the foundation for the development of a reference grammar of the language, which was subsequently defended as a doctoral thesis by BRANDÃO in 2014.
The project participants comprised indigenous teachers and elders well-versed in traditional culture. While some teachers focused on recording, others undertook tasks such as transcription, translation, and metadata organization. Additionally, a Paresi participant was involved in video editing. A crucial collaborator from the Paresi community, Jurandir Zezokiware, played a significant role in the documentation project with the EN community, fostering a relationship of trust with the EN. He actively contributed during training sessions and gathered linguistic data. Furthermore, UFPA undergraduate students were engaged in the project, visiting the Paresi and Enawene Nawe communities to gain hands-on experience in fieldwork.
Both projects facilitated the acquisition of high-quality equipment for the Paresi and Enawene Nawe communities through financial backing from the ELDP/SOAS. This equipment encompassed a Zoom digital recorder, Shure head microphones, a digital video camera, an external microphone for the camcorder, a tripod, and supplementary materials. The documentation efforts during the projects captured various cultural and speech events. The Paresi communities opted to document traditional narratives, songs, blessings, customary celebrations, indigenous pastimes, and diverse dialects or variations of the Paresi language. Conversely, the Enawene Nawe community focused on recording traditional stories such as their origin tale, the narrative of cassava's inception, stories about spirits, and others. Further details regarding these projects can be found in Brandão and Zezokiware (2018).
The primary data, consisting of audio and video recordings, were captured in .WAV and .MTS formats, respectively. Each session was meticulously recorded in both audio and video formats. Subsequently, the .MTS files underwent conversion to .MP4 to facilitate archiving, resulting in a more space-efficient storage format. The file names are structured to commence with the ISO code representing the language (PAB for Paresi and UNK for EN), followed by the recording date in YYYY/MM/DD format, the initials of the individuals who conducted the recording and the primary speaker, and the session's keyword in which the file is embedded. For instance, a file name could appear as UNK-20200114-WE-YI-Kolito.MTS. These documentation initiatives led to the creation of digital collections encompassing over 150 hours of Paresi recordings and 37 hours of Enawene Nawe recordings, which have been categorized into seven distinct groups, as delineated in Table 1.
The secondary data generated in these projects encompass annotations and metadata linked to the recordings. Annotations, which include transcriptions and translations into Portuguese, were executed utilizing the ELAN program (EUDICO Linguistic Annotator 2020) and Word. Lexicons for both languages were crafted, and numerous Paresi texts were interlinearized using the FLEx program (FieldWorks Language Explorer 2019) in accordance with the analysis outlined in the reference grammar. The transcriptions and translations of the texts were carried out by the native speakers. The majority of the transcriptions were completed during the lead researcher's absence from the communities, and in the case of Paresi, they were subsequently reviewed with the speakers. Paresi speakers underwent training in the utilization of ELAN, while EN speakers had limited exposure to this program and opted to transcribe in Word using a computer or cell phone. Efforts are currently underway to organize the notes from the EN recordings, with the aim of transferring all materials to ELAN for potential inclusion in a digital collection at a later stage.
In ELAN, files contain a minimum of three lines of annotations: the transcription, translation, and notes. More intricate details regarding the glosses of Paresi or EN morphemes, known as interlinearization, are structured within the FLEx program due to its capability for automatic gloss insertion (once entered in the database), a feature lacking in ELAN. Neither language adheres to a standardized orthography consistently utilized in indigenous educational settings. Consequently, transcriptions were conducted in the orthographies familiar to the speakers, with Paresi transcriptions following the orthographic conventions proposed by Brandão for the language.
The metadata were initially structured within an Excel spreadsheet and subsequently inputted into the Lameta program (HALTON et al., 2021). Each session comprises an audio file, video file, and annotation in ELAN (.EAF format) or elicitations in PDF. Additionally, IMDI files (ISLE Metadata Initiative) were generated for every session, containing details about the recordings, including the 'actors' (individuals involved), subject matter, content description, and keywords. Furthermore, there exist collections of photographs categorized under community, craft, school, daily life, researchers, training, people, and work.
All data from the Paresi project are currently housed in the archive of the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, although they are not yet accessible to the public. Additionally, twenty hours of material gathered during the period of financial backing from ELDP (2011-2012) have been preserved in the archive affiliated with this institution, known as the Endangered Language Archive (ELAR). Furthermore, another thirty hours of data are stored at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas (AILLA), located at the University of Texas at Austin, with certain materials already accessible online. A portion of the data collected in the Enawene Nawe project has been organized within ELAR and is set to be released in the Goeldi archive in due course.
The referenced archives utilize a system of graded access codes to delineate varying levels of accessibility for different files. ELAR employs the codes O for unrestricted access, U for materials accessible through account creation, and S for restricted materials necessitating the depositor's authorization for access. Files labeled with the S code may encompass personal or sensitive data regarding speakers, including conversations, life narratives, or ongoing analysis by the depositor. AILLA's collection also features analogous access levels denoted by numerical values instead of alphabetic characters. Certain archives mandate users to undergo a free registration process on the website before gaining access to any materials.
The archives, currently accessible in English (ELAR) or in English and Spanish (AILLA), lack access information in Portuguese, posing challenges for the Paresi and Enenawe Nawe communities in accessing them. To address this issue, future plans involve making these collections available in regional digital archives situated closer to the communities, potentially within institutions such as the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT), intercultural colleges, or indigenous schools. This approach would enable speakers to physically access the server housing the materials and facilitate easier online access.
In conclusion, the documentation projects discussed in this section have facilitated the establishment of Paresi and Enenawe Nawe archival collections, now accessible to both the academic and indigenous communities. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, these archives have proven invaluable for researchers unable to physically engage with indigenous groups. Notably, these collections serve as a means of preserving traditional knowledge, a task made more pressing by the unfortunate loss of numerous indigenous elders during the pandemic. It is imperative that language documentation materials not yet archived be preserved for posterity. A critical next step involves enhancing accessibility of these collections to indigenous populations in Brazil, enabling indigenous educators to utilize the materials in community classrooms and academic settings within indigenous institutions.
Brazil and its neighboring regions boast some of the highest levels of linguistic diversity globally, with approximately 300 indigenous languages spoken in South America, over half of which are found within Brazil (Moore, 2007; Galucio, Moore, & Van der Voort, 2018, p. 195). This linguistic richness is acknowledged by UNESCO's International Decade of Indigenous Languages, coinciding with the current article's composition. However, this multitude of languages only represents a fraction of those that likely existed in South America before European contact, with ongoing processes of language shift and loss. Alarmingly, nearly 80 of the remaining 300 languages are now critically endangered (Moore, 2007). Despite efforts like the 2010 Decreto n. 7.387, which established the National Inventory of Linguistic Diversity (INDL) in Brazil to recognize languages as cultural heritage, the loss of indigenous languages persists. Regrettably, the vast majority of Brazilian and other South American indigenous languages lack comprehensive documentation, with perhaps only half having minimal archival records available.
This article has delved into the significance of archiving in language documentation, emphasizing its crucial role in preserving and providing long-term access to documentary materials. The reliability of preservation and accessibility hinges on well-maintained digital repositories with sufficient infrastructure and institutional dedication. Encouragingly, the proliferation of robust documentation projects and archival collections has been notable in recent decades, as evidenced by projects like Paresi and Enawene Nawe (refer to MOORE and GALUCIO, 2016). However, sustaining the outcomes of such documentary efforts necessitates increased participation and investment in archiving. This entails active involvement in and bolstering of archiving initiatives at various levels, including regional and national endeavors like the Museu Goeldi in Brazil, as well as internationally-focused archives like AILLA. Moreover, it involves enhancing access for speaker and heritage communities to these materials, in collaboration with archives. Linguists bear a dual responsibility, both social and academic, to archive the materials they generate, support archiving of legacy materials, maximize accessibility, and engage closely with communities to ensure ethical practices.
The urgency of these endeavors has been underscored by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in the loss of elders within communities and the subsequent decline in language speakers. Documentary archives play a crucial role in preserving the knowledge of these individuals for future generations, ensuring accessibility for community members, scholars, and other interested parties. In situations where fieldwork is not feasible, archives offer valuable alternative sources of data and analysis, opening up new avenues for research. Furthermore, archives serve as essential resources for communities seeking to revitalize, maintain, or simply remember their linguistic and cultural heritage.
We express our gratitude to the organizers of Abralin ao Vivo for providing us with the opportunity to participate in their online forum on July 11, 2020. Additionally, we extend our thanks to the indigenous community members who have been involved in the various projects referenced in this study. Although this research serves as an overview and did not receive project-specific funding, we acknowledge and appreciate the support from the entities that have generously contributed to the work reflected in the archival collections discussed. Rosés Labrada's doctoral project, as detailed in Section 4, was financially supported by Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) through a Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship [Award No. 770-2012-0151]. Ana Paula Brandão's research on Paresi-Haliti and Enenawe-Nawe, as outlined in Section 6, received funding from the National Science Foundation (BCS 1123943) and the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme (IGS0160, IPF0280).
