The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of modifications in Primary Care policies on the trajectory of hospitalization rates for Ambulatory Conditions Sensitive to Primary Care within the urban setting of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Study design: This research employs an ecological study design utilizing data sourced from the Brazilian National Health Information System.
Methods: Interrupted time series analysis was conducted to compare three distinct periods corresponding to primary care policies in Brazil: 2008-2009, 2010-2017, and 2018-2019. The dataset encompassed total Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) and rates for 19 groups of conditions.
Results: Initially, there was a non-significant increasing trend in baseline admissions. The implementation of reform, specifically (policy #1), significantly altered this trend, leading to a notable reduction in admissions during the specified period. Conversely, the introduction of the PNAB (policy #2) did not have a significant impact on altering the trend but did contribute to a decrease in the rate of decline. It is important to note that variations in trends and outcomes across different periods were influenced by the specific characteristics of the ACSC group under consideration.
In conclusion, primary care demonstrates a responsiveness to shifts in public health policies. The hospitalization rate for ambulatory care sensitive conditions serves as a valuable indicator, showcasing the organization's ability to adapt within the health service network. This adaptability is crucial in ensuring universal coverage and meeting the healthcare needs of the population.
Primary Health Care (PHC) serves as the World Health Organization's strategy to enhance access and quality of care for populations. It has been widely implemented to fortify health systems in numerous countries, representing a fitting response to the epidemiological and demographic transitions observed in these regions. In 2006, Brazil introduced the initial version of the National Primary Care Policy (PNAB), marking a significant advancement by elevating primary care from a mere health program to a comprehensive strategy known as the Family Health Strategy (FHS). The key components of this strategy include team and territory-based continuous care, a strong emphasis on family and community involvement, and the formal inclusion of community members in the teams through Health Community Agents.
Despite the publication of the policy, Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in Brazil, initially did not adopt it universally, instead focusing on implementing it in areas of extreme poverty and lacking in assistance. By 2009, only 7% of the population had access to Family Health Strategy (FHS) services. In response to this disparity, the city government launched the Primary Health Care Reform (RCAPS) in 2009. Over the period from late 2009 to 2016, significant investments in primary health care resulted in the expansion of services and an increase in population coverage to 60%. However, in 2017, the Brazilian Ministry of Health introduced a new version of the National Primary Health Care Policy, which brought about numerous conceptual and operational changes, many of which were viewed as detrimental to the sustainability of the Family Health Strategy.
Recent studies have highlighted the positive impacts of Primary Health Care (PHC) coverage, particularly in relation to mortality rates in specific demographics such as children and those with chronic diseases. Additionally, the rate of hospitalizations due to Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) is commonly utilized as an indicator to gauge the quality of PHC services. ACSC represents health issues where effective PHC intervention could potentially reduce the need for hospitalization. However, Macinko et al point out that this indicator is not frequently employed in evaluating services in low- and middle-income countries. High rates of ACSC hospitalizations may signal issues with access, coverage, or efficiency within the PHC system. The reliability and accessibility of data in public databases make the ACSC hospitalization rate a valuable tool for assessing PHC services, with a focus on implementation and coverage effects, as demonstrated in recent research by various authors.
Santos et al. (21) reported on the impact of Rio de Janeiro's FHS expansion on ACSC hospitalization rates, comparing results pre and post RCAPS, revealing a correlation between increased FHS coverage and a decrease in hospitalization rates. Similarly, a comparative study on ACSC hospitalization rates in national capitals highlighted Rio de Janeiro's municipality as having experienced a more substantial reduction over the past decade, amounting to approximately 13.4% (3).
Rio de Janeiro stands out as a prime illustration of rapid urban expansion in Latin America. This study seeks to evaluate the impact of the Primary Health Care Reform and recent National Policy modifications on the trajectory of hospitalization rates for Ambulatory Conditions Sensitive to Primary Care within the city of Rio de Janeiro.
This time-series study was conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a city known for its successful expansion of primary care coverage, making it a compelling case for examining primary care in Brazil and the Americas. Data sourced from the Department of Health, encompassing monthly hospitalization figures within the public health system from 2008 to 2019, were utilized to analyze hospitalization trends during three significant periods for primary care in the municipality. These periods include the time frame prior to the Primary Health Care Reform (RCAPS) from January 2008 to December 2009, the period of reorganization from January 2010 to December 2017, and the initial phase of changes under the new National Primary Care Policy (PNAB) from January 2018 to December 2019.
We limited the hospitalizations to 74 causes based on the two-digit classification of the International Classification of Diseases. Our focus was on the causes outlined in National Ordinance No. 221 of 2008, which specifies the list of admissions for conditions sensitive to primary care (Supplementary Material #1).
We computed the hospitalization rate using the following method: <>.
Rates are typically reported per 10,000 inhabitants, but due to the analysis being conducted by cause groups, some of which are rare, the decision was made to adjust the base to 100,000 inhabitants. Notably, groups 17 and 19 exclusively represent causes related to females, resulting in the denominator for these rates being solely the female population. Consequently, the total rate is calculated by summing the rates of the respective groups, as per the formula: <>
We conducted an analysis of the data across the 19 groups of causes within the three distinct periods. To achieve this, we computed the means, standard deviations, and quartiles for each pair across the three periods. Subsequently, we visually examined these metrics by employing box plots for each group within the three periods. By comparing the groups against the average and standard deviation values, we aimed to validate the comparison of means. To ensure the validity of this comparison, we assessed the normality of the distribution data through the Shapiro-Wilk adherence test. Additionally, we utilized the Levene test, an inferential statistic, to confirm the homoscedasticity of the data distribution. Our interest extended beyond merely identifying statistically significant differences between groups; we also sought to comprehend the distinctions between pairs of groups (period one vs. period 2; period one vs. period three; and period two vs. period 3). Consequently, we opted not only for the ANOVA test but also incorporated a Post-Hoc analysis using the Tukey test.
Upon completion of the initial stage, a visual inspection of the time series was conducted to identify alterations in the pattern of total hospitalizations and groups within the three specified periods, taking into account the sequential data from the aforementioned periods. Segmented linear regression models of interrupted time series (ITS) were then employed to ascertain the impact of changes in primary care policy across all Ambulatory Care Sensitive Condition (ACSC) groups. These ITS models are adept at accounting for pre-existing trends prior to the policy modification and are capable of detecting shifts in both the pattern and level of the trend. The segmented linear regression models were constructed utilizing the Prais method, encompassing three distinct segments corresponding to the previously delineated periods. The baseline segment (January 2008 to December 2009) was adjusted with an intercept and a trend estimate variable for accurate analysis.
It is posited that the causes listed may have varying impacts, with some potentially leading to immediate effects through alterations in primary care policy, while others may result in more gradual changes. To explore these dynamics, we conducted an analysis examining two distinct effects within the trends. Firstly, we assessed disparities in the rate of hospitalizations through an interrupted time series analysis of two distinct groups, known as the ramp effect. Additionally, we examined the shift in trend levels between the groups, referred to as the step effect.
Hospitalizations are typically a consequence of acute illness or the exacerbation of chronic conditions, often manifesting rapidly. In our study, we opted not to incorporate a time lag between policy modifications and the observation of outcomes. Emphasizing results with statistical significance at a 5% level, we also examined logarithmic trend terms to evaluate potential non-linear trends identified by the Prais model. The selection of models was guided by the BIC and AIC aptitude criteria. Subsequently, we assessed the suitability of each model for residual analysis. To identify autocorrelation within the residual lag (forecast errors), we utilized the Durbin-Watson statistic. All analyses were conducted using the R program, version 3.6.1.
Initially, a visual inspection of the measures and dispersion measures was conducted (Figure 1). Six distinct behaviors were identified through comparisons between the baseline (Period #1) and the RCAPS period (Period #2), and between the RCAPS period (Period #2) and the PNA period (Period #3). The first pattern observed involved an initial drop in average rates followed by a maintenance of levels, evident in total rates and groups such as hypertension, angina, epilepsy, and female pelvic inflammatory diseases. The second pattern showed a decline in vaccine-preventable diseases, infectious gastroenteritis, bacterial pneumonia, and diabetes across both comparisons. The third pattern displayed an initial increase followed by a reduction in nutritional deficiencies, gastrointestinal ulcers, and diseases related to prenatal and puerperium. The fourth pattern indicated groups with an initial reduction and subsequent increase, exemplified by asthma and lung diseases. The fifth pattern revealed an increase in cerebrovascular diseases, kidney infection, urinary tract infections, and skin conditions in both comparisons. Lastly, the final pattern demonstrated groups where no apparent change was observed, including anemia, ear, nose, and throat infections, and heart failure.
Visual inspection alone does not suffice as a determining factor for assessing consistency between periods. Subsequently, we proceeded to evaluate the significance of differences in means (refer to Table 1). The average rates of hospitalization for conditions sensitive to primary care exhibited a notable decrease between the previous period and the primary care reform in Rio de Janeiro, with a statistically significant difference (Post-Hoc p-value <0.001). This downward trend persisted in the period subsequent to the implementation of the new national primary care policy, although the reduction was not statistically significant compared to the reform phase (Post-Hoc p-value = 0.504). Notably, this consistent pattern was observed across specific hospitalizations for bacterial pneumonia, hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and gastrointestinal ulcer.
The presented measures pertain to point estimates, offering initial insights into trend descriptions. Subsequently, a visual examination of temporal trends across the three study periods was conducted (see Figure 2). The time-series illustration indicates a slight upward trend in the initial period, followed by a downward trend during the RCAPS period, and a sustained decrease during PNAB. Notably, these changes are accompanied by alterations in rate levels. It is worth highlighting that RCAPS demonstrated reduced rates across most groups. In contrast, PNAB exhibited a shift in the previous trend, suggesting that, for certain causes, the implementation of PNAB influenced the detection and treatment pathways.
The analysis of changes in trends was conducted, with a particular focus on the RCAPS period, revealing significant shifts (Table 2). While baseline admissions saw a non-significant increase in the total rate, the reform notably influenced a reduction in the trend during this period. Although the PNAB did not alter the trend, it did mitigate the rate of decline. Furthermore, the coefficient lost significance, indicating that prolonged monitoring of historical data could potentially reveal a reversal of downward trends in certain months. Certain groups mirrored the overall rate pattern, notably vaccine-preventable diseases, nutritional deficiencies, diabetes, and gastrointestinal ulcers. Diseases exhibiting consistent reductions across all periods, with a more gradual adjustment to changes, included hypertension, which initially slowed its decline during RCAPS but accelerated post-PNAB implementation. Conversely, diseases related to childbirth and the puerperium initially showed an increasing trend, which was tempered during RCAPS and ultimately reversed to a decreasing trend under the new PNAB.
Finally, an assessment was conducted to determine the significance of the observed changes, taking into account the impact of step (the immediate change in result level following the policy) and ramp (the shift in trend post-policy) effects as outlined in Table 3. The data analysis revealed a notable and consistent alteration in trend between the baseline and the RCAPS period. Specifically, the overall rate exhibited a change in slope, affecting nearly all groups except for specific conditions such as nose, ear and throat infections, lung diseases, epilepsy, kidney and urinary tract infections, skin infections, and female pelvic inflammatory disease. Notably, diseases related to childbirth and the puerperium experienced an increase in hospitalization rates, contrasting with the reduction observed in other conditions. Immediate changes were evident for nutritional deficiencies, asthma, angina, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal ulcers, reflecting the step effect. The transition from RCAPS to PNAB showed less pronounced impacts, with significance observed primarily for asthma, hypertension, epilepsy, and skin infections in terms of level changes, and for angina, epilepsy, diseases related to childbirth and the puerperium in terms of slope alterations. The residual analysis indicated well-fitted models, supported by goodness-of-fit and Durbin-Watson Statistics.
The definition of Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSCs) typically involves systematic reviews of literature and expert consensus. The Brazilian ACSC list stands out as one of the most comprehensive globally, exerting significant pressure on the healthcare system. The decrease in ACSC rates linked to the implementation of the Rede de Cuidados à Pessoa com Deficiência (RCAPS) in the city aligns with previous research conducted in Rio de Janeiro and other regions of Brazil. Certain demographic groups may exhibit more prompt responses to Primary Health Care (PHC) services. In the short term, enhanced access to healthcare services plays a crucial role in preventing hospitalizations for conditions influenced by social determinants, such as nutritional deficiencies, as well as managing health issues like urinary tract infections within PHC facilities. Additionally, it aids in stabilizing chronic diseases such as asthma and hypertension.
The marginal decrease observed in specific groups indicates a lesser immediate impact, likely attributed to conditions necessitating specialized care like epilepsy and lung diseases. An exception to this trend is seen in conditions already extensively addressed at this level of care, such as asthma, which has a well-established network. Conversely, the persistence of chronic hospitalizations like diabetes underscores their significance as a critical factor in the delivery of structured Primary Health Care (PHC) services. It is our belief that the impact on these chronic conditions is likely to become more apparent over an extended period.
The trend in hospitalizations for obstetric causes in 2017 indicates a rise in hospitalizations for such reasons as care coverage expands at this level of attention. This trend may be linked to improved access to health services, resulting in the enhanced detection of issues necessitating hospitalization. The lack of significant changes for conditions like anemia and infections of the nose, ear, and throat supports findings from earlier research. It is our belief that these particular causes may not be particularly responsive to care at this level.
The decline in the overall rate of ICSAP exhibited a slight deceleration, aligning with the revision of PNAB in 2017. While the trend persists, its significance has diminished. This observation implies that the stagnation or rise in hospitalizations for these conditions could be influenced directly or indirectly by the anticipated modifications in PNAB, as noted in prior research. Since the inception of the current municipal administration in Rio de Janeiro, doubts have been raised by a less experienced technical team regarding the cost-effectiveness and actual impact of the PHC coverage established in the decade preceding its tenure. This situation has led to the reassessment of management contracts, professional attrition, challenges in maintaining service continuity, and a reduction in population coverage. The repercussions of this financial and political turmoil have been well-documented in existing literature. PHC has played a pivotal role in enhancing the ACSC indicator, contributing to improved access, equity, and outcomes that nearly rival those seen in OECD countries. While there is still ample room for enhancement, the evidence unequivocally supports the notion that PHC represents a potent model for healthcare organization in Brazil.
The study acknowledges certain limitations. Conducting impact analysis on public policies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, presents challenges due to two key phenomena. Firstly, policies aimed at reducing inequities may inadvertently widen disparities between social classes. This occurs as newly introduced health interventions are initially embraced by the wealthier segments of the population, who may have lesser need for them. Consequently, absolute health inequalities tend to rise in the short term, only diminishing as the intervention gradually reaches the most economically disadvantaged sectors, a phenomenon termed reverse equity. However, Guimarães' study noted that this effect is not evident in primary care. Additionally, a notable gap exists in the availability of longitudinal data for facilitating comparisons over time, as the quality of data is compromised with each alteration in health management systems.
It is crucial to acknowledge that the most recent alteration in the PNAB is a recent development. Consequently, results lacking statistical significance for the period post-2017 should be approached with caution. As per numerous authors, the updated document has endangered the consolidation of the country's model, particularly due to the relaxation of parameters concerning the quantity of families served by each team and their composition. Furthermore, it has granted autonomy to municipal governments to determine compliance with the FHS, enabling them to adopt alternative models of primary healthcare.
The decline in the ACSC rate in Rio de Janeiro city may indicate a potential impact of the changes brought about by the new PNAB. The flexibility granted by federal public policies could potentially lead to ill-informed decision-making lacking sufficient evidence for the effective management of local resources, directly affecting the health of the population and escalating the likelihood of hospitalizations for preventable conditions in primary healthcare. Further research on this indicator is warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of primary healthcare, enabling the identification of specific groups that may benefit from sensitive care at this level, such as individuals with anemias and upper respiratory infections. Ultimately, the Brazilian experience offers valuable insights for global healthcare systems, emphasizing that community-based primary care can be successful if implemented correctly.
