The objective of this study was to examine the temporal pattern of leptospirosis incidence in relation to varying levels of rainfall in Santa Catarina State from 2005 to 2015. This ecological time-series investigation incorporated data on leptospirosis incidence and rainfall metrics within the Health Regions of Santa Catarina State. The analysis encompassed the distribution of leptospirosis cases, rainfall metrics, and case-to-rainfall ratios, considering seasonal variations and stratification by Health Regions. A total of 5,274 cases were identified, with an average incidence rate of 7.03 cases per 100,000 inhabitants annually, with figures ranging from 24 to 1,458 cases in the Serra Catarinense and Northeast regions, respectively. Notably, there was an escalation in rates of 0.70 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Serra Catarinense and 13.99 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the Northeast. Four regions (Foz do Rio Itajaí, Médio Vale do Itajaí, Grande Florianópolis, and Northeast) accounted for 71.8% of the cases, with the Northeast region alone contributing 38.5%. The regions with the highest incidence rates exhibited a heightened risk of leptospirosis (RR > 1), indicating between 10.9 to 19.9 additional cases of the disease. The average rainfall volume for Santa Catarina State stood at 158.69 mm, varying from 136.44 mm in Laguna to 186.81 mm in the Northeast. These five regions collectively represented 32.8% of the total rainfall recorded during the period. In summary, leptospirosis manifested across Santa Catarina State, with distinct temporal trends observed across the Health Regions.
Leptospirosis, a prevalent seasonal zoonotic disease, is caused by pathogenic spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. The World Health Organization reports a higher incidence of this disease in countries with tropical climates. It ranks among the most common diseases transmitted to humans by animals, primarily rodents, but also by cattle, swine, dogs, horses, sheep, and goats. The disease is widespread and often goes undiagnosed. Infected animals can excrete the organisms in their urine, contaminating the environment, particularly water sources. Human transmission occurs through contact with contaminated animal urine, water, soil, or infected animal tissue via cuts, abrasions, mucous membranes, or the conjunctiva. Leptospirosis is recognized as an occupational hazard for various groups such as rice farmers, abattoir and sewer workers, pet traders, veterinarians, laboratory personnel, and military personnel, prevalent in both developed and developing countries, particularly in urban areas with inadequate sanitary conditions.
Leptospirosis is an endemic disease in Brazil, with the potential to become epidemic during rainy periods or major climatic events such as flooding. This disease predominantly affects low-income populations residing in rodent-infested, flood-prone slums, which are primarily concentrated in capital cities and metropolitan areas. The extent of risk associated with leptospirosis is contingent upon the local prevalence of the disease and the level of exposure experienced by individuals in these communities.
The incidence of leptospirosis follows a seasonal pattern, typically peaking during the summer and fall in temperate climate countries, and during the rainy seasons in tropical regions. This disease is classified as an emerging infectious disease due to the anticipated increase in its burden in both developed and developing nations. This escalation is attributed to global climate changes leading to more frequent and severe weather events like floods, which in turn facilitate outbreaks of leptospirosis.
Leptospirosis is often associated with disordered occupation practices, particularly evident in the construction of residences in floodplain regions and the absence of essential infrastructure. This alteration of the environment, characterized by the evident degradation of the surroundings, can create an unhealthy setting that becomes a high-risk zone for a range of diseases, including leptospirosis.
Between 2010 and 2014, Brazil reported a total of 20,810 confirmed cases of leptospirosis, averaging 4,160 cases annually. The Southeast and South regions of Brazil exhibited the highest numbers of cases, with 7,457 and 6,030 cases respectively. Notably, São Paulo accounted for 20.9% of the confirmed cases, followed by Santa Catarina (10.7%), Rio Grande do Sul (10.6%), and Acre (10.5%). During this period, the country experienced an average incidence rate of 2.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
Hence, it is pertinent to conduct temporal trend studies to examine the correlation between leptospirosis and rainfall indexes in Santa Catarina State and its Health Regions. This is crucial due to the limited research available on leptospirosis and its connection to rainfall levels, highlighting the significance of epidemiological surveillance in risk assessment and management.

The data collected comprises information on leptospirosis and rainfall rates in Santa Catarina State from 2005 to 2015. The sample, spanning 11 years, ensures the representativeness of the data. The information on confirmed cases of leptospirosis was obtained from the restricted access database of the Board of Epidemiological Surveillance (Diretoria de Vigilância Epidemiológica — DIVE) of Santa Catarina. Rainfall data, measured in millimeters, for each municipality within the Health Regions of Santa Catarina were sourced from the National Water Agency (Agência Nacional de Águas — ANA) and the Company of Agricultural Research and Rural Extension of Santa Catarina (Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuária e Extensão Rural de Santa Catarina/Centro de Informações de Recursos Ambientais e de Hidrometereologia de Santa Catarina — EPAGRI/CIRAM). Daily precipitation data were collected from 155 rainfall stations across Santa Catarina from 2005 to 2015. Using this data, average monthly precipitation figures were calculated for each municipality, Health Region, and Santa Catarina as a whole. Population data for Santa Catarina and its Health Regions were sourced from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística — IBGE) website.
The outcome variable, the number of monthly cases of leptospirosis, was analyzed by calculating the monthly rates of incidence for each group of months within the specified period. To account for potential variations in age structure and gender across different periods, direct rates standardization was employed, using the population of Santa Catarina in 2010 as a reference. The data presented includes the number of leptospirosis cases, their monthly averages, and the disease rate for the studied period. Non-standardized rates were preferred in cases where a significant correlation (r > 0.90) was observed between raw and standardized rates, as this preserved the original values of the rates, deemed more representative and easily interpretable.
The distribution of leptospirosis cases and rainfall indexes was initially analyzed across the Health Regions. Data for each of the 16 regions included the number of cases, average disease rates, rainfall indexes, proportional contributions of cases and rainfall indexes, and case-to-rainfall ratios. To assess the relative excess in diagnosis incidence among regions, monthly leptospirosis rate ratios were calculated by comparing each region to the one with the lowest rate (Serrana). The relative risk (RR) was then used to represent the probability of leptospirosis occurrence in each region compared to the reference region.
The exploratory analysis of monthly trends revealed a discernible pattern characterized by two distinct seasonal periods. The first period, spanning from April to September, exhibited low levels of rainfall, while the second period, from October to March, experienced higher levels of precipitation. Consequently, the investigation into temporal associations between exposure to rainfall and the outcome of leptospirosis in this study concentrated on these two clearly defined seasonal periods, in addition to examining the overall monthly evolution throughout the period under scrutiny.
Linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between leptospirosis cases and fluctuations in rainfall levels over a specified period and the entire population within the Health Region. The investigation focused on the temporal progression of monthly leptospirosis occurrences, with monthly disease incidence rates serving as the dependent variable (y) and the months within the study period as the independent variable (x). The proposed model utilized the angular coefficient (beta) derived from the linear regression adjustment to account for monthly variations in leptospirosis cases, with the months in the calendar year acting as the dependent variable. Trend analysis was performed using the Prais-Winsten generalized linear regression method, as outlined by Gaynor and Kirkpatrick, to correct regression parameters for first-order autocorrelation.
For each region, alongside the leptospirosis rates, the strength of the relationships between the months of occurrence and the leptospirosis rate is illustrated through the correlation coefficient (r) and the proportion of disease occurrence variation explained by the independent variable (R2). To enhance trend interpretation, the beta coefficient (b) was calculated, and the Monthly Percentage Variation (MPV) was also determined. The MPV adjusts temporal series points by logarithmically transforming the Y values, offering the added advantage of reducing the heterogeneity of variance of residues from regression, as per the formula: MPV = [-1+10b1]*100%. The trends indicating increase, decrease, or stability, along with their respective p-values, are then presented for analysis.
Associations were investigated graphically between variations in leptospirosis rates across seasonal periods, stratified by the eight regions with the highest and lowest rates of the disease, as well as the lowest and highest ratios of cases relative to rainfall. This analysis aimed to identify a potential cumulative impact of rainfall on the disease's incidence.
This study adhered to the ethical principles outlined in Resolution 466/12 of the National Health Council and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee under CAAE No. 60174117.0.0000.5369.
From 2005 to 2015, Santa Catarina reported a total of 5,274 cases of leptospirosis, averaging 479 cases annually. The number of cases varied significantly during this period, with the lowest count recorded in 2013 at 341 cases and the highest in 2008 with 982 cases.
Figure 2 illustrates the average monthly variation of cases categorized by seasonal periods. A noticeable rise in leptospirosis cases is observed from October to March, succeeded by a decline starting in April, leading to a period of decrease until early August.
Table 1 illustrates the seasonal fluctuation of cases and rainfall indexes in Santa Catarina (2005–2015) across the 16 Health Regions. During this period, an average of 329 cases of leptospirosis per Health Region was observed, with minimal variability of 24 cases in Serra Catarinense and a peak of 1,458 cases in the Northeast. Notably, four regions (Foz do Rio Itajaí, Médio Vale do Itajaí, Grande Florianópolis, and Northeast) accounted for 3,789 (71.8%) cases of leptospirosis, with the Northeast alone contributing 1,458 cases (38.5%). When adjusting for population size, the rates varied from 0.70 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Serra Catarinense to 13.99 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the Northeast. The Far West, with the second-highest rate (11.18 cases of leptospirosis per 100,000 inhabitants), alongside the aforementioned four regions, exhibited the highest incidence of leptospirosis. These five regions, characterized by elevated rates, demonstrated a heightened risk of leptospirosis incidence (RR > 1), with the risk ranging from approximately 11 to 20 times more new cases (RR = 10.9–19.9) compared to Serra Catarinense, the region with the lowest rate. The average rainfall for Santa Catarina stood at 158.69 mm, with extremes of 136.44 mm in Laguna to 186.81 mm in the Northeast. Notably, the five regions with the highest leptospirosis rates contributed 32.8% of the total rainfall in the period, with the Far West and Northeast regions displaying both the highest rates of leptospirosis and average rainfall levels.
The average number of leptospirosis cases per millimeter of rain in Santa Catarina was 2.02 cases. This figure ranged from 0.16 cases per PI in Serra Catarinense to 7.8 cases per PI in the Northeast region. Among the five regions previously identified with the highest leptospirosis rates, four of them (Foz do Rio Itajaí, Médio Vale do Itajaí, Grande Florianópolis, and the Northeast region) exhibited the highest case numbers per unit of PI, accounting for 71.8% of all leptospirosis cases in Santa Catarina during the study period.
The results of the linear regression analysis for Santa Catarina, stratified by Health Regions and seasons, are detailed in Table 2. In this phase of the study, an examination of the temporal trend in leptospirosis incidence was undertaken, focusing on the months within two distinct seasons: October to March (characterized by higher rainfall levels) and April to September (marked by lower rainfall levels). Upon scrutinizing the outcomes for Santa Catarina, it becomes evident that the average rates of leptospirosis align closely with those of regions exhibiting a higher prevalence of the disease during the specified time frame, as well as with the individual seasonal periods characterized by both elevated and reduced rainfall rates. Furthermore, according to the Mean Percentage Variation (MPV), Santa Catarina displayed a temporal pattern of monthly escalation in leptospirosis rates during the period of increased rainfall, while showing a decline during the period with lower rainfall levels.
The results of the linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between rates of leptospirosis and rainfall during the period characterized by the highest volume of rainfall (r = 0.83). Additionally, the coefficient of determination (R2) for this specific period indicated that 69% of the variability in disease rates could be explained by the variation in rainfall.
However, the MPV also indicates an average monthly increase of around 25% in the cases of leptospirosis. During the period from April to September, a positive correlation (r = 0.60) was observed, suggesting a relationship between the rates of leptospirosis and the rainfall volumes in Santa Catarina (R2 = 0.36). Additionally, there was an average decrease of 3.05% in the interpretation of the monthly trend.
Results from the linear regression analysis, stratified by Health Region, revealed a consistent pattern of escalating disease rates in correlation with increased rainfall volumes during the period of higher precipitation levels (October to March) across all regions, irrespective of the baseline rates of leptospirosis. Over the span of 2005 to 2015, the incidence of the disease varied from 0.93 cases per 100,000 individuals in Serra Catarinense to 19.82 cases per 100,000 in the Northeast region. Strong correlations (r > 0.80) between leptospirosis rates and rainfall volumes, coupled with high explanatory powers (R2), were observed during this timeframe in the Northeast, Far West, Grande Florianópolis, Laguna, Alto Uruguai, Carbonífera, Midwest, and Serra Catarinense regions.
Upon examining the eight Health Regions exhibiting the highest incidences of leptospirosis and the most significant case-to-precipitation ratios, it was noted that the average rate of leptospirosis varied from 12.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in areas with higher levels of rainfall to 5.73 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in regions with lower precipitation levels, indicating a decrease of 52.7%. Conversely, in the eight Health Regions with the lowest rates and minimal rainfall indexes, the range shifted from 2.75 to 1.56 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, reflecting a decrease of 43.3%.
Among the eight Health Regions exhibiting the highest rates, the prevalence of MPV decreased significantly from 42.1% to 1.7%, marking a substantial 96% reduction. This comparison was drawn between the periods characterized by elevated rates and increased rainfall (October to March) and those with lower rates and decreased rainfall (April to September). Conversely, in the eight regions with comparatively lower rates and rainfall levels, MPV decreased from 51.6% during the October to March period to 13.2% in the April to September period, reflecting a notable 74.4% decline.
The current study, which examined the seasonal variability of leptospirosis, has substantiated the claim that rainy periods are correlated with a rise in the incidence of the disease.
The investigation into the association between leptospirosis rates and regional dimensions, although varied, revealed a correlation between disease incidence and fluctuations in rainfall. This study underscores that the distribution of cases in Santa Catarina during the period under review (2005–2015) was linked to regions experiencing higher volumes of rainfall and subsequent floods. The annual precipitation records corroborate these findings. Notably, the floods in 2008 and 2011 coincided with peak disease incidence rates during that period. Costa et al. found a heightened disease incidence in flood-prone areas, with tropical countries accounting for 73% of estimated global leptospirosis cases. Additionally, Pelissari et al., in a systematic review, identified seven Brazilian studies linking leptospirosis occurrence to rain and/or flooding.
The research conducted by Coelho and Massad (17) in São Paulo revealed a significant correlation between climatic parameters and the incidence of leptospirosis. Additionally, Oliveira et al. (18) and Pereira et al. (19) found that the incidence of the disease was closely linked to rainfall. These studies also highlighted the occurrence of the disease in various seasons, emphasizing the importance of conducting active surveillance during different periods to identify additional factors associated with leptospirosis beyond just rainfall.
The present study, stratified by Health Regions, considers the heterogeneity in rainfall distribution in Santa Catarina, providing significant insights into the geography of leptospirosis within the state. The Northeast, Far West, Médio Vale do Itajaí, Grande Florianópolis, and Foz do Rio Itajaí collectively represented over three-quarters of the reported cases, with the Northeast region contributing nearly 30% of the total cases.
A study by Coan et al.13 reported variations in rainfall rates per month in Santa Catarina, noting that the highest values were observed in the north coast between October and March, while the lowest values were recorded in the south coast from April to September, with increased precipitation in the vale do Rio Itajaí and the western part of the State. These findings align with the results of the current study, which also identified higher rates of leptospirosis incidence in these regions during the same periods.
A study conducted by Mottola in Portugal, specifically in the Autonomous Region of the Azores on the islands of São Miguel and Terceira, revealed a significantly higher incidence rate of leptospirosis compared to the mainland. This disparity was attributed to the prevailing conditions of moisture and average temperatures characteristic of the subtropical climate in the island region, which facilitated the transmission of the disease. Notably, a peak in cases was observed between September and January, indicating a seasonal pattern in the spread of leptospirosis in this area.
In Brazil, Paula21, while detailing the prevalence of leptospirosis and its spatial distribution, noted that the peak incidence of the disease typically occurred between October and March. Furthermore, certain regions exhibited varying rainfall patterns, with areas like the Northeastern coast experiencing rainy seasons during the fall.
Similarly, Guimarães et al. (7), Oliveira et al. (18), and Dutra et al. (22) have all observed the presence of leptospirosis at various times throughout the year, noting a peak in disease incidence that correlates with precipitation levels and, importantly, aligns with regional peculiarities.
The association between rainfall levels and the incidence of cases was notably observed during periods of increased precipitation across Health Regions, particularly from October to March.
The Northeast and Far West regions exhibited the highest rates, while Serra Catarinense and Xanxerê had the lowest rates of leptospirosis. Results from the linear regression analysis based on Health Region and seasonal period during periods of increased rainfall indicated a monthly rise in leptospirosis rates across all regions, ranging from 20 to 100%. Conversely, regions like the Midwest and Serra Catarinense displayed lower rates alongside significant variations in correlation averages, implying sudden spikes in rainfall leading to a notable surge in leptospirosis cases within shorter time frames. These findings starkly contrast with the outcomes during periods of minimal rainfall, where disease rates were lower and numerous regions exhibited negative monthly percentage variations, indicating irregular occurrences.
The stratification of results based on the eight regions, highlighting the highest rates of leptospirosis and cases-rainfall ratio, not only underscores the impact of rainfall levels on leptospirosis rates during two distinct seasonal periods but also emphasizes the cumulative effect of rainfall on disease incidence. This is evident when comparing the ratio of new cases to rainfall, which consistently increases in regions with higher rainfall and leptospirosis rates (r = 0.91; p = 0.013). In contrast, regions with lower rainfall and leptospirosis rates do not exhibit the same relationship (r = 0.24; p = 0.644). This analysis underscores the significant influence of rainfall on the occurrence of leptospirosis, particularly in regions with higher rainfall levels.
Several studies (Guimarães et al., 2007; references 7, 22-24) examining the temporal trend of leptospirosis and rainfall rates support the findings of this current research. Guimarães et al. (2007) not only validate the link between rainfall and disease but also highlight that the relative risk for leptospirosis occurrence, when comparing high rainfall months (November to March) to the lowest rainfall month (August), exceeds a twofold increase (RR > 2.0; p < 0.01), suggesting a causal relationship between rainfall and disease incidence. These results align with our study, which reveals a more than threefold increase in leptospirosis incidence (RR > 3.0; p < 0.01) during the period from December to March compared to August.
Dutra et al. (22) conducted a study in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, from 1998 to 2012, examining the incidence of leptospirosis. They noted a rising trend in leptospirosis rates during the rainy months. In contrast, Pereira et al. (19) investigated the trend and seasonality of leptospirosis in Brazil from 2008 to 2012. Although they did not observe an overall increase in the disease during this period, their analysis of seasonally adjusted data suggested a strong temporal relationship with a seasonal component, indicating heightened disease activity during rainy periods. Additionally, Buzzar (23) analyzed the epidemiological profile of leptospirosis in São Paulo from 2007 to 2011. Their findings aligned with the present study, showing that the disease was prevalent throughout the year with distinct seasonality across all 28 epidemiological surveillance groups.
It is emphasized that the control of leptospirosis relies on interventions targeting one or more links within the epidemiological chain, with the potential to disrupt its transmission. The analyses conducted in this study for Santa Catarina suggest that preventive measures and efforts to combat leptospirosis should be implemented at the municipal level. This strategy can offer the specific information needed to pinpoint critical areas and populations at higher risk of contracting the disease.
It is important to acknowledge that the morbidity data concerning leptospirosis in this analysis may be underestimated, primarily because this disease can often be mistaken for other febrile conditions. Furthermore, the majority of notifications stem from hospital records, thereby representing cases that typically manifest more severe manifestations of the illness.
It is important to highlight that a contributing factor to the spread of leptospirosis is the occurrence of heavy seasonal rains leading to floods, even with lower rainfall volumes, as soil waterproofing hinders water absorption and promotes increased flooding. Moreover, it is theorized that during periods of increased rainfall and subsequent flooding, the dissemination of leptospirosis is more extensive among both the general population and healthcare workers, resulting in a heightened demand for healthcare services. This necessitates prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment to effectively manage the disease.
In conclusion, leptospirosis was prevalent across all 16 Health Regions studied. Of particular note were four regions - Northeast, Grande Florianópolis, Médio Vale do Itajaí, and Foz do Rio Itajaí - which collectively accounted for 71.8% of the cases in Santa Catarina. These regions, along with the Far West region, exhibited elevated risks of leptospirosis incidence.
