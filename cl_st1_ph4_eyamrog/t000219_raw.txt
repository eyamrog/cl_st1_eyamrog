COVID-19 pandemics and mental health: In 
times like these, we learn to live again
DOI: 10.1590/0047-2085000000273
The scenario of pandemics is one of the most dreaded and alarming by mankind. 
Unfortunately, this is the scenario we are facing now. During a period of pandemics, many 
situations can be overwhelming, not only related directly to the primary disease, but also 
related to the measures needed to be taken to combat it, and also its aftermath. 
Pandemic-related stressors may come in many ways. Uncertainty and anticipated fear, 
excessive (and possibly fake or misguided) information, psychological and social distress, fear 
of death or serious illness, loss of close ones, economical societal burden and personal financial 
difficulties are only a few examples of stressful situations that come along with the pandemics1,2. 
Considering the prolonged and sustained nature of a pandemic, encompassing exposure to 
multiple potentially traumatic events during a significant period, it could be considered a type 
of complex trauma3-5. 
History has already shown that psychiatric morbidity is another dreadful outcome from an 
epidemic. The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2003 victimized more 
than 700 individuals, mostly in Asian countries. Up to 45% of SARS survivors that needed 
hospitalization had at least one psychiatric diagnosis in the immediate discharge from the 
hospital, including depression, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
symptoms. Even long term pos-discharge evaluations (e.g. 30 months after discharge) showed 
persistent psychiatric morbidity among SARS patients, mainly PTSD, depressive disorders 
and anxiety-spectrum disorders6,7. After the 2014/2015 Ebola virus outbreak in Africa, many 
psychiatric and Psychosocial problems arose, such as stigma and isolation, and also psychiatric 
disorders in the general population and among health care workers, including PTSD, depression 
and anxiety disorders8,9. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015, which had a 
high mortality rate (about 20%) caused hundreds of people – and entire villages and cities 
– to be intensively isolated. During the period of isolation due to the MERS epidemic, more 
than 40% of the general population reported emotional distress. Among patients, almost 50% 
reported significant symptoms of anxiety10. It is to be expected that the COVID-19 pandemics 
will have several psychiatric short- and long-term consequences as well. 
COVID-19 pandemics is triggering psychological distress and psychiatric problems. 
Individual characteristics such as culture, economic status, coping mechanisms, previous 
psychiatric or psychological issues, personal degree of exposure to the risk of contamination, 
actual development of the disease and/or loss of close persons are some of the factors that 
influence psychological response to such unusual and uncertain times. In a societal level, 
access to accurate and legitimate information, availability of medical services, governmental 
and medical measures to contain the spread of infection (e.g. quarantine and social isolation) 
and general psychosocial condition of the community may influence the collective response 
to the outbreak9,11-13.
But not all is bad. Human resilience is a powerful force, and it sometimes can overcome 
the hardest of problems. The majority of the population will present healthy mental health 
responses to the traumatic events experienced during the pandemic. Peoples’ ability to

cope, to endure, to recover and to rebuild can even be 
strengthened in such difficult times. Some individuals may 
report increased feelings of gratitude, greater appreciation 
for friends and family, increased care for mental and physical 
health, stronger beliefs and faith, and even a sense of 
personal growth1,14,15.
Recommendations for a better mental health outcome 
include strategies to enhance individual and collective 
resilience, intense psychiatric surveillance in individual 
and community levels, and identification and referral 
of individuals ate greater risk for development and 
intensification of psychiatric disorders. Providing accurate 
and reliable information to the population about the disease 
and the measures taken to combat it, promoting access to 
quality health care services, and implementing social and 
financial aid to the most needed are key features to prevent 
psychiatric morbidity.  Also, combating stigmatization 
and social isolation of those who had the disease or lost 
someone close to it, stimulation of initiating and maintaining 
adequate psychiatric and psychological treatments, and 
implementing strong psychosocial interventions are key 
factors for enhancing the chances of a healthy psychiatric 
response from the COVID-19 pandemic1,4,16,17. Finally, quoting 
Ali Ibn Abi Talib, the supposed cousin and son-in-law of 
Muhammad, “Do not let your difficulties fill you with anxiety, 
after all it is only in the darkest nights that stars shine more 
brightly”18.
