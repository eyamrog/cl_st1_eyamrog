Originating as a defiant and violently suppressed fusion of music, dance, and martial arts from the African diaspora in Brazil, capoeira has evolved into a global phenomenon, with groups and networks established in various locations worldwide, including London, Cape Town, Hong Kong, and notably Leeds, where this study was conducted. Our research delves into the linguistic, cultural, and physical components of capoeira, focusing on a diverse group led by Sandro, a Brazilian contramestre, which serves as a dynamic setting for immersive language learning experiences. This group offers a unique platform for exploring Afro-Brazilian linguistic and cultural traditions, encompassing music, movement, lyrics, and vocal expressions that are integral to the capoeira experience. These practices intricately blend the distinctive dance and martial arts movements of capoeira, the rhythmic coordination, and the physical embodiment of its rhythm and motion during rehearsals and performances. Viewed through the lens of informal language acquisition, the capoeira group emerges as an ideal environment for learning. Our investigation will delve into the educational opportunities provided by the capoeira group for linguistic, cultural, and embodied learning of Afro-Brazilian Portuguese, drawing upon the comprehensive translanguaging framework, which we expand to include the significant musical dimension of capoeira. These insights will be linked to contemporary theories on language learning, particularly informal and immersive language learning experiences.
The relationship between actual language teaching and learning (LTL) and theories of language learning has always been intriguing. Structural approaches, influenced by Bloomfieldian structural linguistics and behavioral theory, were dominant until Chomsky's mentalism emerged, shifting the focus to the learner's mind and dominating LTL research for decades. In recent years, a sociolinguistically informed perspective has gained prominence, viewing language learning as contextual. Key contributions include works like "The Classroom and Beyond" (WAGNER, 2004) and "The Social Turn in SLA" (BLOCK, 2003). These approaches not only contextualize the language learning process but also provide a more comprehensive understanding of the learner by incorporating pragmatic and discourse analysis, as well as considerations of language and culture learning. The quest to define "authentic language" for classroom use is a direct result of these contextual considerations. More recently, there have been calls to integrate external contexts into classroom learning (ROBERTS; BAYNHAM, 2006) and even to take language learning beyond the classroom and into real-world settings (ESKILDSEN; THEODÓRSDOTTIR, 2015).
In this study, we explore the potential of a diasporic capoeira group based in Leeds, UK as a platform for Portuguese language acquisition. Capoeira, a practice with a complex and debated history, serves as the focal point of our investigation. Initially, we delve into the historical and practical aspects of capoeira, subsequently delving into its capacity for informal language learning. We examine the opportunities and affordances it presents, along with the observed instances of capoeiristas acquiring elements of Portuguese, which we term as Portuguese for Capoeira Purposes. The study of Languages for Specific Purposes relies on the linguistic concept of register. Our inquiry began by questioning the potential for Afro-Brazilian Portuguese language and culture acquisition through capoeira, as well as the essential knowledge of Afro-Brazilian Portuguese language and culture required for effective participation in capoeira by apprentice capoeiristas. However, as our analysis progressed, we observed a significant expansion in the scope of our study.
In the capoeira sessions we observed, communication encompassed a diverse array of modalities, including nameable languages like English and Portuguese, distinct varieties of Portuguese such as Afro-Brazilian Portuguese, gestures, and bodily expressions. These modalities were intricately intertwined with and governed by the modality of music, whose rhythms dictated the tempo of each aspect of the capoeira session. In our research, we utilize the concept of translanguaging to elucidate these interactions, viewing the entirety through the lens of Deleuze and Guattari's notion of agencement or assemblage (DELEUZE; GUATTARI, 2013). By employing the assemblage construct, as highlighted by Canagarajah, we are able to better comprehend the amalgamation of diverse semiotic elements in activities like capoeira.
The concept of assemblage offers a framework to understand the collaborative role of various semiotic resources as a spatial repertoire in explaining the success of an activity, without privileging language as the exclusive or superior medium. Assemblage challenges the traditional focus on verbal elements in scholarly discussions of 'multimodality', emphasizing the interconnected nature of semiotic resources rather than categorizing them into distinct modes (Canagarajah, 2018, p. 39).
The contramestre, jogadores, songs, and sayings, along with the lexical framing of the event, which includes shared terminology for the various elements of the capoeira assembly derived from Afro-Brazilian Portuguese, such as the roda, the berimbau, and other instruments, converge in a performance that echoes profound cultural memory. Through this convergence, they construct an agencement/assemblage, combining repetition and novelty in the form of regulated improvisations during practice.
Each phase of the capoeira session showcases distinct combinations of modalities. In our ethnographic investigation, during the initial expository phase, a blend of English explanations and Portuguese dialogue intertwines with music, enabling contramestre Sandro to delve into the profound cultural memory encapsulated in seemingly straightforward lyrics and link them to the contemporary context. Subsequently, in the practice phase, as participants engage in individual or paired movements, Sandro moves around, employing an instructional tone that incorporates English, Portuguese, gestures, and physical demonstrations. During the roda phase, the instructional framework dissipates, allowing the jogadores to experiment with their techniques and malandragem alongside their peers and the contramestre. In this phase, the body communicates through gestures and motions, articulating itself through the subtleties of the movements that constitute the structured improvisation of the capoeira habitus.
The Leeds capoeira school Guardiões Brasileiros is a branch of a larger capoeira group located in the São Paulo state of Brazil. The school boasts a diverse membership, including players from Lusophone countries like Portugal, Brazil, and Mozambique, various European nations such as France and the UK, and non-Lusophone African countries. Jolana, a co-author of this study and a researcher, hails from the Czech Republic and is proficient in Portuguese, being an apprentice capoeirista herself. This research centers on the contramestre, Sandro, and Sophie, originally from France but a long-time resident in the UK. Sophie is not only a dedicated student of Portuguese, particularly Brazilian Portuguese, but also a committed practitioner of capoeira. Our investigation delves into the dynamics involving these individuals, aiming to address the following inquiries:
What opportunities and affordances does the capoeira group provide for the acquisition of Portuguese language skills?
How do various group members interact with these opportunities and affordances?
Can capoeira alone lead to fluency in Portuguese?
How can we comprehend learning through capoeira as a verbal, embodied, and musical assemblage?
Sandro serves as the mediator for the group, facilitating Portuguese and capoeira practice while placing a significant focus on capoeira's history and culture. His journey into capoeira is quite intriguing, stemming from his experiences in a challenging school environment. This initiation occurred during his formative years in Paraná, where he faced bullying as the sole overweight black student. Recounting his past to Jolana, Sandro recalls observing a casual gathering of young individuals practicing capoeira movements while he was selling ice cream on the streets. Intrigued, he approached the group and was graciously welcomed to join their training sessions.
Sandro recounted a period in his life where he faced frequent bullying at school. One day, while selling ice cream from a trolley on the streets, he observed a group of individuals in the neighborhood engaging in capoeira, a form of martial art. Intrigued, he inquired about the activity and was informed that there was no formal teacher; rather, the group gathered to share knowledge and skills with each other. This community became a source of support for Sandro, as they were the only people who offered assistance without passing judgment on his identity. (Interview with Sandro - audio transcription)
A few years later, he becomes a member of the organized group Guardiões Brasileiros. His initial focus lies in self-defense and street fighting, and he purposefully infuses elements of capoeira de rua into his practice as a contramestre.
Sandro expressed that Capoeira is inclusive and adaptable to individual preferences. He transitioned from being a fighter to a Capoeira player a few years ago, citing his history of constant fighting in Brazil. Sandro recounted enduring injuries such as being stabbed, shot, hit with bottles, and cut during fights, which influenced his unique style in Capoeira.
Upon relocating to the countryside, the protagonist finds himself under the tutelage of his new elderly mestre, who not only instructs him in the art of street fighting within capoeira but also delves into the rich history and cultural nuances of the practice. This immersive experience includes an exploration of the songs, narratives, characters, and African roots that shape capoeira. Such insights prove pivotal in his role as a contramestre. During his initial sessions in Leeds, the mestre meticulously elucidates, in English, the profound meanings and historical contexts of traditional songs and tales, exemplified by the "snake story" discussed later. Notably, he does not simply advocate for a straightforward association of Portuguese with capoeira or vice versa; rather, he views capoeira as a multilingual entity, drawing from Yoruba, Crioulo, and other influences beyond Portuguese. In this regard, he aligns with the translanguaging perspective embraced in this study.
Sophie, a French national residing in Leeds for an extended period, harbors a deep-seated interest in Brazilian culture and the Portuguese language, extending beyond her dedication to capoeira. Within her capoeira class, she stands out as one of the more skilled practitioners, often chosen by Sandro or Tiago, a seasoned capoeirista from Mozambique, to demonstrate techniques to the group. Her pursuit of learning the non-standard Brazilian Portuguese dialect through capoeira practice was once questioned by a former Brazilian boyfriend, prompting reflection on her motivations for delving into this unique linguistic avenue.
Sandro's framing of capoeira practice within the historical context of black Brazilians underscores the significance of understanding the origins and evolution of this art form. To comprehend the roots of capoeira, one must delve into the colonial period, initiated by the Portuguese arrival in 1500, marked by the utilization of slave labor and subsequent resistance. This historical backdrop is crucial for grasping the complexities of capoeira's development. The Portuguese colonization primarily focused on the North-Eastern coast, establishing cities and ports conducive to sugarcane plantations, necessitating substantial manual labor in a region with limited resources, as noted by SKIDMORE and GREEN (2021).
Europeans were initially reluctant to traverse the Atlantic in significant numbers to serve as cheap labor, prompting the Portuguese to turn to the local indigenous population and subsequently import slaves from West Central Africa, primarily from regions such as West Central Africa (SLAVE VOYAGES, 2021). The African slaves gradually supplanted the indigenous workforce, which had also been subjected to enslavement, following a significant decline in their numbers due to epidemics (MARQUESE, 2006). Pinpointing the exact number of Africans transported to Brazil over the three centuries of the slave trade until its abolition in 1888 remains challenging, yet estimates suggest approximately 6 million individuals were forcibly brought to the country (SLAVE VOYAGES, 2021).
The conditions aboard the ships were exceedingly severe, resulting in approximately 10% of the African individuals on voyages from Africa to Brazil perishing (COHN, 1985; ALENCASTRO, 2018). Upon arrival, the enslaved individuals were deliberately segregated from their linguistic communities to prevent communication among them. They were primarily utilized as laborers on sugarcane and cotton plantations initially, later extending to work in mines and on coffee plantations.
Not all slaves passively accepted their conditions; rebellions occurred even on some slave ships, with Africans seizing control and steering the vessels back to African shores. In Brazil, escapes, revolts, and resistance were prevalent throughout the era of slavery. Fugitive slaves sought refuge in quilombos, settlements of varying sizes, durations, and distances from established civilizations, where they established political, social, and cultural orders reminiscent of those in Africa (GOMES, 2015). The most renowned of these was the Quilombo of Palmares, housing between 6,000 and 30,000 individuals (MARQUESE, 2006), which successfully resisted conquest attempts for an extended period. On agricultural estates, slaves were roused by a bell and led by the landowner to toil in the fields until dusk, enduring harsh corporal punishments for even minor infractions. These punishments ranged from lashing and branding with hot irons to mutilations, rape, and other intricate forms of torture (AIDOO, 2018).
Capoeira is believed to have originated in the North-eastern state of Bahia, which was the hub of the sugar-based economy and home to the capital city, Salvador da Bahia. The exact time and circumstances of its emergence are highly debated. The earliest references to capoeira can be traced back to the 19th century through various sources such as chronicle articles, accounts from foreign visitors to Brazil, newspaper articles, and a potentially illustrative engraving depicting the practice of capoeira (DE ABREU, 2005).
The origin of the word capoeira is shrouded in uncertainties. It is commonly believed to have derived from the indigenous Tupi word caa-apuamera, which referred to a young forest growing in an area that had been cleared before. This location was purportedly used by runaway slaves to hone their combat abilities and to stage ambushes against individuals sent by their masters to apprehend them. Despite this prevalent theory, there is a lack of concrete evidence to definitively validate its accuracy (DE ABREU, 2005).
After a period of illegality in the first half of the 20th century due to capoeira's association with street gang fighting, known as maltas (PORTAL CAPOEIRA, 2022a), the art form has evolved into a symbol of Brazilian identity. Presently, capoeira has garnered widespread popularity both within Brazil and on a global scale, with capoeira schools now prevalent in major European cities.
While a game of capoeira may initially appear as an impromptu activity, it is, in reality, a meticulously structured event where every participant assumes specific roles. These roles are rooted in the traditions of individual schools and may exhibit slight variations, yet the fundamental framework remains consistent across different schools and styles.
Capoeira, known as a game (jogo in Portuguese), is characterized by its playful nature, emphasizing that it is played rather than fought. Participants engage in this activity within a circle, referred to as a roda in Portuguese, which also signifies the social gathering where capoeira takes place. Music plays a central role in capoeira, with an orchestra, or bateria in Portuguese, providing the rhythmic accompaniment. Positioned at the outer edge of the circle, the orchestra members typically sit on chairs or a bench while playing.
The orchestra performs with instruments traditionally associated with capoeira, although the specific number and types of instruments utilized can differ from one performance to another. Among these instruments, the berimbau holds particular significance, tracing its roots back to Africa. Additional instruments commonly employed in capoeira include the atabaque (drum), pandeiro (tambourine), reco-reco (a serrated wooden instrument played with a stick), and agogô (cowbells). Individuals without instruments contribute to the rhythm by clapping their hands.
In the realm of capoeira, each game commences and concludes in front of the orchestra, ao pé do berimbau. Typically, two capoeiristas, often those closest to the orchestra, approach each other and crouch before the gunga, a berimbau played by the roda's leader. They await the signal to initiate the game, characterized by an attack-dodge interplay featuring non-contact kicks as primary offensive maneuvers. Head-butts hold a revered status, while hand strikes are infrequently employed. The delineation between offense and defense can be nebulous; a player might execute a rasteira (sweep) while evading an attack, embodying malandragem, or trickery, aimed at confounding the opponent through feints and unexpected actions. Players strategically select techniques to gain a positional advantage or exploit vulnerabilities in their opponent's defense. The game's dynamic may be punctuated by ritualistic displays like chamada or volta ao mundo, as well as impromptu dances or comedic performances, injecting moments of levity amidst the intensity of the gameplay.
During the game, the pace is dictated by the music played by the orchestra. Those positioned at the periphery of the roda are responsible for sustaining the energy through their singing and hand-clapping. In a particular instance, we witnessed the mestre reprimanding individuals for their lack of enthusiasm in these activities.
The duration of individual games and the roda can vary significantly. While small rodas typically held at the conclusion of a capoeira class may only endure for approximately 15 minutes, larger rodas organized as standalone events can extend for more than 3 hours.
Capoeira, originating in Bahia, has expanded beyond Brazil to various parts of the world. Delamont and Stephens (2008) delve into the global and local aspects of diasporic capoeira, viewing it as an 'embodied habitus'. Within the context of discussions on 'globalisation' and 'diaspora', the authors highlight two significant points that are relevant to our own research.
A capoeira disciple undergoes a process of mental and physical transformation. The manner in which they engage in capoeira is influenced by the collective identity of the group to which they belong, as well as their unique biological and personal history (2008, p. 70).
 Delamont and Stephens' theoretical framework, situated within Bourdieu's concept of habitus, provides valuable insights into the dynamics of teaching and learning. By delving into the intricate relationship between what is imparted and what is internalized, the authors shed light on the complexities of educational practices. They elucidate how individuals navigate the process of acquiring knowledge and skills within the broader context of social structures and cultural norms. This theoretical lens offers a nuanced understanding of how educational experiences shape individuals' perceptions, behaviors, and identities.
Capoeira is also an embodied social practice that its practitioners adopt as they develop the habitus, referred to by Achilles as 'the way de capoeira,' through formal pedagogic instruction (2008, p. 70).
In our examination of the capoeira sessions we observed, we have utilized the concept of translanguaging (Baynham & Lee, 2018) to elucidate the various modes of communication present within the capoeira environment: verbal, gestural, embodied, and musical. We have delved into how these modalities interact and complement each other throughout the different phases of the session. Expanding upon the framework proposed by Baynham and Lee, we have incorporated the significance of music in our analysis, recognizing its fundamental role in capoeira practice. Thus, the inherent rhythmic synchronization of the capoeira movements with music can be interpreted as a form of translanguaging, with music serving as a vital component in the spatial repertoire of capoeira (Rymes, 2014; Pennycook & Otsuji, 2015; Canagarajah, 2018).
During our fieldwork, we documented six capoeira classes held weekly at a community center, often concluding with socializing at a nearby club. Additionally, we attended two capoeira workshops facilitated by visiting mestres at the invitation of Sandro. One workshop occurred at a community center in Leeds, while the other was hosted in a church hall in York, both spanning the entire afternoon from approximately 2 pm to 6 pm. Post-workshop activities included a gathering at a pub after one session and a student-hosted party featuring Brazilian cuisine after the other. Furthermore, we observed a weekend roda organized primarily for Sandro's students from Leeds and York, which unfolded in an Afro-Cuban drumming studio.
Music plays a central role in the practice of capoeira, as it helps coordinate and regulate bodily movements rhythmically. Whether in capoeira rodas or during isolated movement practice in Sandro's classes, music is always present. Live music accompanies capoeira rodas, while recorded music serves as a backdrop during training sessions.
Music plays a crucial role in determining not just the pace but also the nature of the game being played in capoeira. Each rhythm is associated with a specific style of capoeira gameplay. For instance, the rhythm known as 'Angola' is typically employed for a slow, intimate game where one hand remains in contact with the ground, providing capoeiristas with a platform to showcase their abilities (ESPETO CAPOEIRA, 2022b). Sandro, as an instructor, emphasizes the importance of his students being able to identify different rhythms and understand the corresponding gameplay styles that align with them.
Sandro elucidated that the upcoming rhythm would be 'iuna'. Striving to commit the name to memory for the sake of the fieldnotes, I resorted to verifying it online later. According to Sandro, the tune is typically reserved for seasoned fighters. It is not intended for intense combat but rather for a friendly match where individuals are encouraged to establish connections and demonstrate mutual respect. (Fieldnotes)
The pace and intensity of the game can also be influenced by the lyrics of the song. For instance, Sophie shared an experience where she felt frustrated and played aggressively in front of others. In response, the teacher or master would call her to the pé do berimbau, the instrument's base, and sing a song like "devagar, devagarinho," which translates to "slow down, slow down." This act served as a cue for Sophie to calm down and adjust her approach. Alternatively, the teacher could encourage her to continue by singing a different song, such as "quebra gereba, quebra," which conveys a message of aggression and confrontation. This interaction highlights how the music and lyrics in capoeira can shape the dynamics of the game, guiding players to either ease off or intensify their movements based on the context. (Interview with Sophie - audio transcription)
The tempo and style of the game are thus under the control of the roda's leader. In instances where a student, such as Sophie in the aforementioned case, is not aligning with the expected game style, the leader can prompt them to adapt their pace through a song. Furthermore, they have the ability to elevate the game's intensity by selecting a song with a quicker tempo and lyrics that encourage a more aggressive gameplay.
Capoeira may initially appear as a dance to an external observer, given the synchronized movements of two players in response to music. However, the question arises: can capoeira truly be classified as a dance? Its origins are traced back to African war dances, notably the Zebra dance, which incorporated fighting elements like kicks (COBRA MANSA; ASSUNÇÃO, 2008). This historical connection blurs the distinction between dance and combat. Notably, elements of combat persist in certain styles of samba, another art form with African roots.
Sandro elucidated that according to Mestre João Grande and reiterated by Mestre Ananias, capoeira, samba, and candomblé are interconnected practices originating from Africa. Candomblé served as a religious expression, while samba provided a form of entertainment, yet it also functioned as a means of self-defense. Variants such as samba-de-coco and samba duro were prevalent, with pernada being a male-specific style. These practices were observed in street settings, where individuals were often brought down using rasteiras. (Interview with Sandro - audio transcription)
According to one theory, during the colonial period in Brazil, enslaved individuals from Africa concealed martial arts techniques as dance movements to avoid detection by their masters.
In the context of capoeira, there arises a question regarding its classification: is it primarily a dance, a martial art masquerading as a dance, or a dance camouflaged within another dance form? When prompted to describe capoeira, Sandro characterizes it as an embodiment of Brazilian culture, emphasizing its dual nature of incorporating both dance and combat elements. He elucidates that within capoeira, participants engage in a simulated combat scenario that seamlessly transitions into a choreographed dance performance, blurring the lines between the two disciplines. This observation, captured in fieldnotes, underscores the intricate fusion of movement, tradition, and cultural expression that defines capoeira as a unique and multifaceted art form.
The concept of utilizing dance as a form of disguise is also evident in contemporary capoeira. Sandro contested the notion that capoeira is merely a dance by provocatively stating, "if capoeira is a dance, then dance with me!" The distinguishing factor between capoeira and traditional dance lies in its combat element: practitioners of capoeira remain vigilant and prepared for potential attacks, recognizing that confrontation could arise unexpectedly.
One of the dance-like movements in capoeira is the three-step ginga, executed in sync with the music while mirroring the movements of the opponent. The continuous motion of the ginga serves a strategic purpose, intended to disorient the adversary and create openings for offensive maneuvers. While participants move in harmony, a robotic adherence to the routine is discouraged in capoeira as it renders one predictable. Seasoned practitioners will occasionally deviate from the ginga pattern, yet they do so in a rhythmic manner that complements the musical cadence, maintaining the fluidity and unpredictability essential to the art form.
The chamada is a synchronized move executed by two players coordinating their bodies. Translating to 'a call', it serves as a strategic and ritualistic sub-game where one player initiates by raising their hands to beckon the other. Upon joining, they move in close proximity, alternating between forward and backward steps, a situation that carries inherent risk. Despite its seemingly amicable nature, the chamada is designed to assess the opponent's vigilance, with either player potentially aiming to subdue their counterpart.
During our study, we observed a total of six classes and two workshops, each comprising distinct phases. In Sandro's classes, although variations existed, the phases could be succinctly summarized as:
Engaging in stretching exercises and casual conversation prior to the commencement of the class.
In the theoretical section of this research article, the focus is on the pedagogy of teaching music, singing, and providing explanations within an educational context. This segment delves into the theoretical frameworks that underpin effective music education, including the importance of incorporating both practical and theoretical components in teaching music. Furthermore, it explores the nuances of teaching singing, emphasizing the significance of vocal technique, interpretation, and expression. Additionally, the theoretical part discusses the role of explanations in music education, highlighting the need for clear and concise communication to facilitate understanding and learning. By examining these aspects within the theoretical framework, this research aims to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on music pedagogy and instructional practices.
In the practical component of the study, participants engaged in individual practice sessions to refine and master specific movement techniques. This segment focused on honing the execution of various moves in isolation, allowing participants to concentrate on the intricacies of each action without the distractions of group dynamics or external factors. By practicing moves individually, participants were able to enhance their understanding of the mechanics and nuances of each movement, ultimately improving their overall performance and skill level. This approach provided a structured and focused environment for participants to fine-tune their techniques and develop a deeper proficiency in executing the required movements with precision and accuracy.
In the practical component of the study, participants engaged in paired practice sessions.
Certainly! Please provide the passage you would like me to improve.
Socializing, while not mandatory, can significantly enhance the overall experience and outcomes of individuals in various settings. Engaging in social activities allows for the development of interpersonal skills, the establishment of meaningful connections, and the cultivation of a supportive network. Research has shown that socializing can positively impact mental health by reducing feelings of isolation and promoting a sense of belonging. Furthermore, social interactions can lead to increased collaboration, creativity, and productivity in both personal and professional contexts. Therefore, while socializing may be considered optional, its benefits should not be overlooked as it plays a crucial role in fostering well-being and success.
In the subsequent sections, we will delve into each of these phases and examine the linguistic opportunities they offer in greater detail.
Individuals arrived at varying times for Sandro's classes, with Sandro frequently being tardy due to his commute from York. Consequently, a significant period often elapsed before the class officially commenced. Prior to the start of the class, students would gather and warmly greet each other, typically exchanging hugs and cheek kisses. This gesture underscored the longstanding relationships some students had cultivated over the years, although newcomers were also embraced with warmth. A similar atmosphere prevailed during workshops, where greetings tended to be even more effusive, especially when students reunited after extended periods of separation.
The students typically spend their time before class begins engaging in individual stretching exercises, while some engage in conversations, often catching up on what has been happening since their last meeting. These conversations predominantly take place in English; however, those who are native Portuguese speakers converse in Portuguese among themselves and with students who are proficient in the language. For instance, Tiago communicates in Portuguese with Mariana and Sandro, who are Brazilians, as well as with Sophie and Carolina, who are fluent in Portuguese.
Upon Sandro's arrival, he typically proceeds to prepare the instruments, a task that includes the laborious process of stringing the berimbau, before commencing the classes shortly thereafter. As a customary ritual to signify the commencement of the class, Sandro instructs the students to fetch a chair and gather in a circle, setting the stage for the theoretical segment of the session.
At this juncture, communication among class participants primarily occurs verbally and through gestures, mirroring informal everyday interactions. This includes translanguaging practices involving Portuguese, English, and potentially other shared languages, given the multilingual composition of the group.
The class commences with Sandro assembling the students in a circle to delve into the history and culture of capoeira. The discussion often centers around the significance of the songs, which serve as a rich starting point due to their centuries-long evolution and numerous historical and cultural references. Given that the songs are in Portuguese and incorporate African content, they also prompt a discourse on language. In this context, Sandro elucidates the intricate meanings behind references to snakes in a particular song.
In his elucidation, Sandro clarifies that the primary objective of the study is to investigate the impact of social media usage on mental health outcomes among adolescents. He emphasizes the need to understand the potential correlations between excessive social media engagement and psychological well-being, highlighting the importance of addressing this issue in contemporary society. Sandro's research aims to contribute valuable insights to the existing literature on the subject, shedding light on the complex relationship between social media usage and mental health. Through a comprehensive analysis of data collected from a diverse sample of adolescents, the study seeks to provide evidence-based recommendations for promoting healthy social media habits and enhancing overall well-being in this vulnerable population.
When singing a song, it is essential to imbue it with a foundation and meaning, effectively conveying a message to the audience. In contemporary times, many individuals are perplexed by the intentions of singers. For instance, if I were to sing a song to you and you disregarded its message, only to later find yourself on the receiving end of a physical altercation, the fault lies in your lack of attentiveness. Consider the lyrics of a particular song: "valha me Deus, Senhor São Bento, buraco velho tem cobra dentro." This verse serves as a cautionary tale, invoking divine protection from harm and warning of potential dangers, such as encountering a skilled opponent in a capoeira circle. By understanding the significance of such songs, one can navigate social interactions within the capoeira community with greater awareness and respect for experienced practitioners. (Interview with Sandro - audio transcription)
In this passage, Sandro elucidates the concept of Fundamento, a pivotal aspect of capoeira. Fundamento, when capitalized, pertains to how capoeira instills in individuals a way of life aligned with its ethical principles (PORTAL CAPOEIRA, 2022b). This process notably incorporates translanguaging between English and Portuguese during Sandro's sessions, always intertwined with music: students not only grasp the melody but also learn to sing the lyrics in Portuguese. Sandro typically recites a line of the song in Portuguese multiple times, prompting the students to echo it. Furthermore, he offers a translation and delves into the song's significance. This translation proves beneficial even for proficient Portuguese speakers, given that certain songs feature archaic language, slang, or regional expressions.
Sandro discusses the significance of old songs, noting that they often go unnoticed despite their rich linguistic content. He highlights the distinct language found in these songs, exemplified by the confusion Mariana, a Brazilian, experiences when confronted with their lyrics. Sandro suggests that these songs reflect the vernacular of marginalized communities, citing recurring themes such as Pedro Mineiro. He emphasizes the prevalence of dialects and words with shifting meanings, like "vapor," which originally referred to a steamboat but is now commonly associated with steam alone. Sandro laments the loss of traditional language usage, noting that contemporary audiences may struggle to grasp the nuances of these songs without proper study. He illustrates this point by referencing terms like "tabibeira" and "Piauí," which evoke a sense of linguistic estrangement for modern listeners but were once commonplace in describing a boat and a state in Northeast Brazil, respectively.
The students proceed to practice singing the song, occasionally with instrumental accompaniment. Performing a recently learned song in an unfamiliar language while simultaneously playing an instrument can present a significant challenge. Sandro employs a strong instructional approach and occasionally provides commentary in Portuguese regarding the learning process of singing and playing.
During the musical session, Sandro initiated the performance by playing and singing, prompting our participation during the chorus segments. At times, we encountered challenges with both the vocalization and the melody, leading to moments of amusement. Sandro's vocalizations included exclamations such as "Tá desafinado!" (it's out of tune!) or "Tá ruim demais mas assim é que se aprende!" (it's horrendous but that is the way to learn!), emphasizing the learning process through practice. These interactions were documented in the fieldnotes.
The aforementioned excerpt illustrates a verbal comment occurring concurrently with singing, a phenomenon rarely observed in the capoeira class where speaking and singing typically do not coexist. As Sandro initiates the class by playing the berimbau, it acts as a cue for the students to cease their conversations. Subsequently, he commences singing the introductory lines of the Ladainha, a traditional song in capoeira Angola performed at the onset of the roda. This song holds ritualistic significance, invoking references to God and esteemed mestres, requiring attentive listening from the students to grasp its profound message (PINHEIRO, 2022). The students then join in, harmonizing with Sandro in singing the chorus, seamlessly transitioning to the next song without interruption.
Prior to commencing the practical segment, either Sandro or one of the students initiates the playing of recorded capoeira music. The practical session often commences with a warm-up, where the ginga movements are executed individually, with the students mirroring Sandro and facing the same direction. A significant portion of the practical component involves pair practice. Notably, in Sandro's practical classes, there is a noticeable transition from predominantly verbal communication in the theoretical segment to a heightened reliance on physical movement for communication, always synchronized with the music's rhythm. Verbal communication, when utilized, primarily serves instructional purposes, typically accompanied by physical demonstrations (language/body translanguaging) to enhance comprehension. Exercises are systematically broken down into segments for easier comprehension, with verbal instructions following the corresponding movements. Sandro's initial verbal cue, "troca - change," is succeeded by a brief pause, during which he assumes a position for students to replicate. Subsequent verbal cues, such as "rolê - roll, troca - change," are promptly followed by the associated movements, being deictic and requiring simultaneous action for accurate interpretation. Although the instructions are delivered in Portuguese, comprehension is facilitated by the accompanying physical demonstrations.
Spoken language can be effectively replaced by the demonstration of movement alone. For instance, Sandro gathers his students on one side of the room and silently performs a movement, leading them to the opposite side, with the students following suit. In this scenario, Sandro doesn't need to verbally articulate his instructions as the activity is already familiar to the students.
Verbal communication primarily serves as instructional guidance during the practical component, with occasional interjections of historical context related to capoeira to elucidate specific movements. This historical information not only provides students with a visual reference for executing the movements accurately but also offers insights into the malandragem, or cunning, of the past masters.
Sandro elucidated that the movements ought to be fluid, akin to the motions of someone inebriated. He recounted how the old mestres would occasionally feign drunkenness and harmlessness, luring unsuspecting individuals to challenge them. Upon being enticed with offers of money, the mestres would swiftly and decisively defeat their opponents. Demonstrating this concept, Sandro proceeded to stagger around the room before executing a series of meticulously precise attacks, showcasing the deceptive nature of the martial art. (Fieldnotes)
Practicing in pairs typically follows individual movement drills and serves as a transitional step between solo exercises and actual gameplay in the roda. Unlike the dynamic environment of a real roda game, pair practice offers a focused opportunity for students to learn and refine their techniques, fostering discussion and feedback between partners. Synchronized movements at close proximity necessitate strong coordination and communication skills for the seamless execution of sequences. This form of practice involves a blend of verbal and non-verbal communication, known as language/body translanguaging, where students convey information through both speech and physical gestures. Verbal communication holds particular importance, especially for novice practitioners, while advanced students like Tiago may engage in silent training sessions with their partners.
Given the limited English proficiency of both mestres, Portuguese emerged as the dominant language in the workshops. Sandro usually served as the interpreter, yet instances arose where translation was unavailable, necessitating students to deduce meaning from the mestre's Portuguese instructions, supplemented by gestures and body language. An illustrative example is Mestre João showcasing a technique alongside capoeirista Marianne.
Interestingly, Marianne, despite not being a native speaker of Portuguese, demonstrates the ability to appropriately respond to the Mestre's apology in Portuguese. Throughout the demonstration, Mestre João exclusively communicates in Portuguese, employing gestures and demonstrations to enhance his verbal instructions, a practice known as verbal/gestural/embodied translanguaging. While the verbal component may not be comprehensible to every student in the class, it is evident that all students are able to grasp the instructions either through the visual demonstrations or by observing and imitating their peers within the group.
The roda typically lasted only about the last 15 minutes of Sandro's class and was not always feasible due to time constraints or low attendance. Nevertheless, it held a significant role in the workshops, occurring at the conclusion. The roda serves as a platform for a spontaneous capoeira game, emphasizing the application of skills and the enjoyment and expression of oneself through singing, playing instruments, or engaging in capoeira movements.
Socializing is an integral component of capoeira practice, with Brazilian capoeira rodas frequently concluding with the traditional dance of samba de roda. Similarly, our observations revealed that both capoeira workshops and select classes culminated in social gatherings, typically held at a local bar or a student's residence. During these interactions, discussions often revolved around capoeira, African/Brazilian culture, and the Portuguese language, providing students with additional opportunities to broaden their understanding. Furthermore, these gatherings fostered stronger interpersonal connections among students, contributing to the overall cohesion and amicable ambiance within the capoeira school.
In this segment of the analysis, our attention is directed towards the roda phase, delving into a more detailed analysis. The term "roda," signifying a circle, encompasses the social gathering where capoeira is performed, typically concluding a class or workshop, or organized as a standalone event, as well as the individuals comprising the circle.
Within the roda, a game frequently unfolds with a structured sequence of alternating attacks and escapes. When one participant initiates an attack, it is common for the other to respond with an attack in the subsequent turn, akin to a dialogue between bodies. This dynamic allows both individuals to express themselves within the context of the game. Occasionally, a series of gingas are interjected into the pattern, which typically follows a predictable sequence.
Person 1: aggression
Person 2 should focus on the strategy of escaping, with the optional addition of incorporating the ginga technique. This approach allows for a more dynamic and fluid movement during an attack. By emphasizing escape as the primary tactic, Person 2 can effectively evade potential threats and create openings for counterattacks. Additionally, integrating the ginga technique adds an element of unpredictability and agility to their offensive maneuvers, making their attacks more versatile and difficult for opponents to anticipate or defend against. By combining these two elements, Person 2 can enhance their overall combat effectiveness and strategic prowess in various combat scenarios.
In the context of Brazilian martial arts, the term "escape" refers to a movement technique that allows a practitioner to evade an opponent's attack or control. This maneuver, often accompanied by the optional use of "ginga," involves fluid and agile movements that enable the individual to swiftly change positions and avoid being trapped or struck. The incorporation of ginga, a fundamental element in various Brazilian martial arts styles such as capoeira, enhances the practitioner's ability to maintain balance, rhythm, and unpredictability in their movements. By mastering the art of escape, individuals can effectively defend themselves while also creating opportunities to counterattack or reposition themselves strategically during combat scenarios.
The turn-taking dynamics are clearly evident in the interaction between Tiago and the visiting Mestre, Mestre João during the game.
In the final segment of the extract, Tiago executes a series of consecutive attacks, revealing a discernible pattern. It is important to note, however, that this pattern is somewhat simplified, as it does not account for potential counter-attacks like a rasteira (sweep) executed while evading the opponent.
The ginga signifies a moment of relative peace, during which capoeiristas assess their opponent's vulnerabilities and prepare for an attack, alternating between action - either attacking or evading. In their practice outside the roda, both Sandro and Mestre João prefer to visually signal the shift from ginga to action with a clap of their hands. Additionally, Mestre João uses a clap to signify the transition from the theoretical segment to the practical aspect of the class. The flow of action is synchronized with the music, particularly during intervals between attacks, such as when executing the ginga.
At the onset of every capoeira match, the participants gather in front of the leader, positioned at the base of the berimbau. This traditional practice marks the commencement of the game, symbolizing the essential role of the berimbau in guiding and setting the rhythm for the capoeira performance.
The roda serves as the space where two players come together, exchanging greetings and sometimes embracing before the commencement of a game. For some capoeiristas, this is a moment of prayer. It embodies the essence of the game, serving as a central hub where players may also revisit during the match to initiate a fresh start.
At the commencement of the game, the two players advance towards the center of the roda.
In the context of capoeira, the space within the roda is strategically significant, as being confined to the perimeters defined by the seated participants can place a capoeirista at a distinct disadvantage, limiting the range of movements they can execute. When forced towards the edges of the roda, a capoeirista typically seeks to maneuver out of this constrained space in order to secure a more advantageous position for themselves.
During the actual game, which is predominantly non-verbal, participants aim to identify vulnerable or unprotected areas on their opponent's body. This strategic approach may involve targeting an exposed region, such as the opponent's abdomen during a cartwheel (aú) with a cabeçada, or attempting to destabilize the opponent by sweeping their leg while they execute a kick. Unlike many other martial arts, the emphasis in capoeira is on evasion rather than direct blocking of attacks. Skilled capoeiristas are adept at maneuvering in a manner that minimizes exposure of vital points on their own body, forcing their adversary to execute multiple movements before identifying a potential opening for an offensive maneuver.
While there may exist variations in styles, capoeira is typically characterized by close proximity between the two players, despite minimal physical contact. Rather than engaging in direct contact, practitioners focus on evading each other's attacks while strategically positioning themselves for potential counterattacks. It is common for these exchanges to involve intentionally incomplete movements, adding a layer of unpredictability and skillful maneuvering to the practice.
At times, verbal communication can disrupt the fluidity of movement, often serving as a means of repair. In a specific instance, Sophie executes a kick that she perceives as making contact with Mestre João. Following this, she verbally apologizes and accompanies it with a gesture, a gesture that is commonplace rather than one unique to capoeira. Subsequently, she extends her hand to him, inviting him to engage in a volta ao mundo, after which they both crouch at the pé do berimbau to initiate a new game.
Although physical contact is generally avoided during the capoeira game, it is notably present in the initial and concluding greetings, where capoeiristas frequently embrace each other. Additionally, physical interaction is a key component in ritualistic movements like volta ao mundo and chamada.
The roda, despite being filled with a culturally diverse vocabulary, primarily serves as a platform for bodily communication, predominantly non-verbal in nature. Gestural components, like the initial invitation and final submission stages, are integral, requiring capoeiristas to grasp culturally significant gestures. Sophie's verbal and gestural apology to Mestre João stands out as an uncommon occurrence within this context. Another consistent aspect of the roda and capoeira practice, in a broader sense, involves the interplay between bodies and music, with the music dictating the tempo and flow of the physical engagement.
Capoeira, a cultural practice that has proliferated globally due to the Brazilian diaspora, shares similarities with disciplines like karate. In keeping with tradition, the techniques in capoeira retain their original Brazilian and Afro-Brazilian Portuguese names. Moreover, expressions in these languages are employed to designate various other concepts associated with capoeira.
The research article discusses various techniques used in capoeira, a Brazilian martial art. These techniques include ginga, which is the basic position; negativa, a defensive stance; meia-lua, a kick known as 'half-moon'; rabo de arraia, a kick referred to as 'tail of the ray fish'; cabeçada, a head strike; aú, a handstand; tesoura, a kick known as 'scissor'; and chamada, a ritualistic sub-game called 'the call'.
The instruments used in this study include the berimbau, pandeiro (tambourine), atabaque (drum), agogô (cowbells), and reco-reco.
The terminology used in capoeira events includes the following: roda, which signifies a social gathering where capoeira is performed; batizado, which translates to 'baptism' and refers to a grading ceremony within the capoeira community; and formatura, denoting a graduation ceremony where practitioners advance in their capoeira skills and status.
Position within the capoeira hierarchy is crucial, with individuals progressing through various stages such as mestre (master) and contramestre (the stage before becoming a mestre) (PORTAL CAPOEIRA, 2022).
Cultural concepts associated with capoeira that resist direct translation into English pose a unique challenge. These concepts, deeply rooted in the history and traditions of the Afro-Brazilian martial art, encompass intricate layers of meaning that may not readily convey their full significance in a different language. Examples include "ginga," a fundamental movement in capoeira that combines rhythm, balance, and improvisation, embodying a sense of fluidity and adaptability essential to the art form. Similarly, "malandragem" encompasses a complex set of attitudes and behaviors that reflect a blend of cunning, street smarts, and resilience, all crucial elements in the practice of capoeira. These cultural nuances not only enrich the understanding of capoeira but also highlight the importance of cultural sensitivity and linguistic flexibility in cross-cultural communication and research.
The Brazilian cultural concepts of malandragem, which refers to trickery, and mandinga, which encompasses knowledge and witchcraft, are deeply rooted in the country's history and folklore. These terms hold significant meaning within Brazilian society, reflecting a complex interplay of cunning, resourcefulness, and spiritual beliefs. Malandragem is often associated with a street-smart attitude, where individuals use their wits and charm to navigate challenging situations. On the other hand, mandinga carries a more mystical connotation, drawing upon ancient traditions and practices that blend elements of African spirituality with indigenous beliefs. Together, these concepts offer a unique insight into the cultural fabric of Brazil, highlighting the diverse influences that have shaped its identity over the centuries.
Nicknames are commonly bestowed upon students in certain capoeira schools, typically in Portuguese, although this practice is not universal across all institutions. Additionally, many mestres also adopt nicknames. The tradition of using nicknames dates back to a period when capoeira was outlawed, and disclosing a practitioner's true identity could result in their apprehension by authorities.
Capoeira songs constitute a significant domain for the utilization of the Portuguese language within the realm of capoeira. It is noteworthy that while the majority of these songs are in Portuguese, there exists a notable subset, as highlighted by Sandro, that includes songs in languages like Yoruba or incorporates lexical components from other linguistic sources. Students are expected to sing these songs during their classes, necessitating the memorization of lyrics for active recitation. Moreover, these songs are replete with allusions to the historical and cultural aspects of capoeira and Brazil, a subject matter that Sandro typically elucidates in English.
In the context of instructional language, English predominated in the capoeira classes we observed during the practical phase. However, some brief instructions were given in Portuguese, such as "rolê" for roll, "troca" for change, and "desce" for go down. Additionally, Sandro utilized Portuguese to interact with proficient Portuguese speakers and occasionally addressed the entire group in Portuguese.
In addition to regular training sessions, capoeira workshops are conducted by visiting mestres, typically hailing directly from Brazil or having relocated from Brazil to another country with the specific aim of teaching capoeira. In such instances, these mestres may not be fluent in English or may have limited proficiency, making Portuguese the predominant language of communication. During the two workshops we monitored, the mestres primarily interacted with students in Portuguese, with Sandro occasionally providing English interpretations. Following the workshops, a significant amount of socializing occurs, often facilitated in Portuguese for informal conversations.
Gesture and ritual are integral components of the communication framework within capoeira. Within the roda, gestures assume a pivotal role in facilitating communication. They are utilized to signify transitions, such as the commencement or conclusion of a game, as well as to demonstrate reverence towards the leader and other participants of the roda. Certain gestures adhere to a prescribed sequence, resembling a ritualistic practice believed to have roots in the Afro-Brazilian religion of candomblé. This religious connection is further evidenced in specific terminologies used within capoeira, such as "bênção" (meaning blessing, denoting a particular kick) and "batizado" (meaning baptism, signifying a grading ceremony).
In a capoeira roda, actions unfold in a predetermined sequence. The initial song, known as ladainha or litany, serves as a tribute to capoeira, venerating the ancient mestres and God. Typically, the roda's leader performs this song, while other participants patiently await, listening attentively before joining in the chorus. Meanwhile, two capoeiristas stand ao pé do berimbau, often interlocking hands, awaiting the leader's blessing to commence the game. This blessing is symbolized by a slight tilt of the berimbau over their heads. Exiting the roda is marked by capoeiristas extending an arm towards each other, with players commonly sharing a hug before departing through the same entrance they used to join the roda.
These rituals can be viewed in relation to candomblé, yet numerous capoeiristas interpret them more expansively as a means of recognizing the authority of the roda's leader and demonstrating respect towards one another. Tiago perceives these gestures as embodying the essence of respect and non-competitiveness within capoeira.
Tiago emphasizes the importance of shaking hands before and after playing capoeira as a sign of respect towards others. He highlights that this practice distinguishes capoeira from competitive martial arts like tae-kwondo, where points are awarded. In capoeira, the focus is on enjoyment rather than competition. Tiago also mentions the necessity of seeking permission before engaging in the game.
There are additional instances of communication through gestures that serve to signify a transition. In addition to entering the roda through the space in front of the roda leader, as previously described, a capoeirista has the option to 'buy' into the game. To initiate this process, any individual positioned within the roda can substitute one of the players by expressing their desire to participate in the game. This is achieved by extending their hand towards the center of the roda, with the palm facing the individual they wish to engage with. This method of joining the game is typically employed in more dynamic rodas. Gestures play a crucial role in establishing the sequence of actions within the roda, demonstrating mutual respect, and form an integral part of the linguistic and cultural education inherent in capoeira practice.
In the game of capoeira, the two adversaries engage in a close observation of each other, aiming to anticipate and interpret their opponent's movements in order to swiftly react with either an offensive or defensive maneuver drawn from their arsenal of techniques. Additionally, they may opt to execute synchronized ginga movements, where their actions mirror one another. Nevertheless, even within this synchronized moment, there remains a palpable anticipation of a potential attack looming from either capoeirista at any given moment.
At times, players disrupt the attack-escape dynamic by incorporating ritualistic sub-games like chamada or volta ao mundo, or by integrating dance or brief dramatic performances. These instances prioritize playfulness and self-expression, yet even seemingly innocuous and amicable actions can mask aggressive intentions. The skill of misleading opponents through pretense, known as malandragem, holds significant value in capoeira, allowing practitioners to confound adversaries effectively.
Similar to spoken conversation, a game of capoeira also possesses a distinct tone. The manner in which the game unfolds is influenced by various factors, including the context or the individual characteristics of the players involved. For instance, a casual game following a class will differ from a more competitive game played in a roda where participants may seek to showcase their skills to impress students from other schools. Public performances typically emphasize non-confrontational playfulness and acrobatics. It is important to note that the tone and tempo of the game are consistently guided by the accompanying music.
In capoeira, the intersection of dialect and register is evident as the Portuguese language utilized is infused with Afro-Brazilian linguistic and cultural elements. This unique register, which may draw disapproval from mainstream ideologies as seen in Sophie's Brazilian ex's comments, plays a crucial role in attracting participants. The process of learning this register can be viewed through Agha's concept of enregisterment, where various elements such as visual, verbal, musical, and embodied aspects are coordinated within an assemblage. Sophie's experience highlights the varying levels of proficiency in Portuguese language and culture required for beginners versus accomplished capoeiristas, with the demands increasing as practitioners progress. This distinction is also emphasized in materials from the Ministério das Relações Exteriores, which promote teaching Portuguese through capoeira. While new students are not expected to have prior knowledge of Portuguese, their language learning primarily occurs through song choruses and simple instructions accompanied by movement. In contrast, advanced capoeiristas are expected to take on roles such as lead singers, requiring a deep understanding of song meanings, including cultural and historical contexts. They must also be proficient in using Portuguese for communication, especially as visiting mestres at workshops may have limited English proficiency or prefer Portuguese during informal social gatherings integral to capoeira events.
Transitioning from the initial stage of language learning, characterized by rote repetition and passive vocabulary acquisition, to a more active phase demanding language production poses a significant challenge, often necessitating supplementary language learning beyond the confines of the capoeira environment. Sophie serves as a prime example of a proficient learner who mastered the language by engaging with songs (including capoeira and Brazilian music), immersing herself in conversations with native Brazilian Portuguese speakers, employing formal language learning methods (such as using a textbook), and drawing on her enthusiasm for capoeira and the Portuguese language, bolstered by her proficiency in other Latin languages (being a native French speaker and having studied Spanish). Marianne, on the other hand, demonstrates a grasp of functional Portuguese, effectively utilizing the language in context rather than merely relying on song lyrics or isolated vocabulary. Capoeira classes thus serve as a springboard for Portuguese language acquisition, with the practice of capoeira serving as a potent motivator for advancing beyond basic proficiency levels, given the necessity for accomplished capoeiristas to communicate at a more sophisticated level.
An evident implication of our research is the necessity to enhance the language learning opportunities within capoeira, by implementing pedagogical strategies to systematize and increase accessibility to these opportunities. The transition from the initial stages of language learning to successful language acquisition often requires personal initiative in studying the language. Various resources, including "Portuguese for capoeiristas" (WHYATT; BARBERIS; PASCHOAL, 2020), are available online and in print to cater to this need, claiming to provide comprehensive lessons on essential words, verbs, phrases, and grammar based on popular Capoeira songs. However, from our standpoint, Capoeira as an Additional Language involves learning capoeira as an embodied practice, where Portuguese, particularly an Afro-Brazilian variant, is a crucial but not the sole component.
The recent curriculum proposal by Ministério das Relações Exteriores (2020) of Português para capoeiristas explores the potential integration of systematic language learning within the structure of capoeira classes. This initiative, adopting a Language for Specific Purposes approach, forms part of a broader set of curricular suggestions for teaching Portuguese abroad in specific contexts. The aim is to address methodological gaps in Portuguese instruction within cultural centers and affiliated institutions outside Brazil. The proposal incorporates capoeira songs, texts, and videos, extending its scope to encompass references beyond capoeira, such as the works of Caribé, Brazilian dances like samba de roda and frevo, and renowned singers like Gilberto Gil, Dorival Caymmi, and Caetano Veloso. Notably, the proposal acknowledges the unique language used within capoeira, dedicating an entire unit to 'capoeira slang' (Unidade 13: a gíria do capoeira). While commendable for its efforts to integrate Portuguese language teaching into capoeira classes, this initiative primarily focuses on the linguistic dimension, emphasizing the importance of independent language use for progress in capoeira.
The approach adopted in this study diverges from traditional curriculum-driven methods, focusing instead on ethnographic research within the context of capoeira. This involved utilizing participant observation, as well as audio and video recordings, aligning with the principles of linguistic ethnography (SNELL; COPLAND; SHAW, 2015). Additionally, a translanguaging approach (BAYNHAM; LEE, 2018) was employed to explore the various communication modalities inherent in the spatial repertoire of capoeira, encompassing verbal, gestural, embodied, and musical elements. This approach underscores the interconnectedness of these modalities throughout different phases of a capoeira session, emphasizing that conventional languages like Portuguese or English represent just one facet of the diverse communication channels within capoeira. Furthermore, the presence of African elements, including linguistic influences from languages such as Yoruba, as highlighted by Sandro, further enriches the Afro-Brazilian synthesis that characterizes capoeira.
Our observations and recordings reveal that capoeiristas are engaging in a multifaceted learning process that involves delving into profound aspects of Afro-Brazilian language and culture through songs, sayings, historical narratives, and the specialized jargon of capoeira. These elements, which may not be readily accessible to all Brazilians, are mediated by Sandro in English. Simultaneously, learners are exposed to instructional language in Portuguese, made comprehensible through gestures, physical demonstrations, or interpretation by Sandro during workshops. An illustrative instance is Marianne's apt response to the Mestre's apology with "tudo bem." While this serves as a foundational step, we assert that additional modes of learning are necessary. We propose that involvement in capoeira could enhance mainstream Portuguese education, particularly at the tertiary level, by providing students with a profound understanding of Afro-Brazilian language and culture.
The paper commenced with the metaphor of "language learning in the wild," prompting the question of whether capoeira truly exists in a wild state. Historically, capoeira emerged as a realm of freedom and resistance on the fringes of a repressive slave-owning society. However, upon closer examination of capoeira as a practice, its highly structured and organized nature becomes evident. Each movement is governed by rhythm, while the songs and expressions are steeped in cultural significance that may not be immediately apparent even to some Brazilians. As Sandro highlighted, the fundamentos, or cultural values inherent in capoeira practice, inform the entire discipline. Anthropology and sociology have long sought to unveil the underlying logics of seemingly chaotic practices, revealing sophisticated order where outsiders might perceive primitiveness. Capoeira exemplifies this phenomenon, demonstrating a complex and layered logic of practice with a rich historical background. Despite its reputation, capoeira is far from wild; practitioners are initiated into, adhere to, and embody intricate and nuanced practices with deep roots. Therefore, we propose that the systematic approach to language learning, as defined by Agha in terms of enregisterment processes, can be integrated into diasporic capoeira classes. Capoeira can thus serve to enhance language and cultural learning within mainstream Portuguese programs. From our viewpoint, Capoeira as an Additional Language transcends mere language acquisition, encompassing the acquisition of a structured register that combines verbal, visual, and embodied elements. Novice capoeiristas embark on a journey of enregisterment, engaging with a multifaceted assemblage that defines the essence of capoeira.
The study commenced with a fundamental inquiry: how can capoeira in diaspora serve as a platform for Portuguese acquisition, specifically focusing on an Afro-Brazilian variant of the language? The concept of translanguaging prompted an exploration into the intricate interplay between language, physical movement, and eventually music within capoeira practice. Viewing capoeira solely as a means for learning Portuguese seemed overly simplistic, leading us to perceive capoeira practice as a register, comprising a blend of semiotic modes, including various language varieties. From this perspective, capoeira learning and language acquisition became intertwined as a form of enregisterment. A key question that arose was whether the Portuguese acquired through capoeira would suffice for mastering the language. Some capoeiristas viewed capoeira as a stepping stone towards fluency in Portuguese, while others did not share this experience. Nonetheless, there exists potential for capoeira engagement to enhance Portuguese learning more broadly. Perhaps, a combination of exposure to Portuguese through capoeira alongside other learning methods would prove most effective in language acquisition. The investigation initially delved into concepts like informal learning and language acquisition in natural settings, revealing the multi-layered and intricately structured nature of capoeira. Despite this complexity, it appears that within typical diasporic capoeira groups, Portuguese language learning tends to be informal and secondary, with contramestres not identifying themselves as language instructors. Nevertheless, the notion of language learning as enregisterment presents an intriguing concept that could be expanded to encompass more conventional language learning approaches.
