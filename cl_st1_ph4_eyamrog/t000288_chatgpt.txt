The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised significant concerns among healthcare professionals, particularly in the field of dentistry, given its high virulence and transmission through saliva aerosols. The virus can remain viable in the air for up to 3 hours and on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces for as long as 72 hours. Dental offices, whether in the public or private sector, are considered high-risk environments for cross infection among patients, dentists, and other healthcare workers, including those in hospital intensive dental care units. This article aims to consolidate the current evidence on preventive strategies for dental professionals and briefly outlines promising treatment approaches identified thus far. The goal is to educate dental practitioners on the virus's history, microbiology, and provide guidance on managing emergency consultations based on international guidelines. It is crucial for dentists to recognize that a significant number of individuals, including asymptomatic carriers such as children, may be infected and capable of spreading the virus. With no definitive treatment available, rapid diagnosis remains a challenge. Therefore, elective dental procedures should be postponed, with only urgent and emergency visits being conducted. Utilizing teledentistry, such as phone calls and text messages, can be a valuable tool for maintaining patient contact while minimizing the risk of infection.
The coronavirus family comprises viruses that lead to respiratory infections, including the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) identified in China in December 2019. These viruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses categorized into four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus. To date, six distinct coronaviruses have been recognized in humans: HCoV-OC43, -229E, HCoV-NL63, HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. Despite the recent prominence of SARS-CoV-2, the first human coronaviruses were isolated back in 1937. The name "coronavirus" stems from its crown-like spikes visible under a microscope, with the primary host receptor for humans believed to be the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
The recent COVID-19 pandemic has evolved into a global public health crisis. It is primarily transmitted through contact with infected surfaces and bodily fluids, such as saliva and aerosols. These modes of transmission highlight dental offices as high-risk environments for cross-infection among patients, dentists, and other healthcare professionals in clinical settings, including dental intensive care units within hospitals. Dental practitioners face significant exposure risks due to close interactions with patients, exposure to saliva aerosols, blood, and the handling of sharp, contaminated instruments.
Following the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of a pandemic, institutions such as the General Coordination of Oral Health within the Brazilian Health Ministry released a Technical Note outlining key guidelines for dental practice during the Coronavirus pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Dental Association (ADA) have advised dentists to defer elective procedures and focus on emergency or urgent dental care to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission, aligning with measures implemented in various cities in China.
As healthcare professionals, it is crucial for dentists to possess a comprehensive understanding of the biological and social factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This knowledge is essential for providing clear information to the public and implementing optimal clinical practices to mitigate unnecessary risks and prevent perioperative transmission. Drawing from existing evidence on oral healthcare, the primary objective of this critical appraisal is to consolidate preventive strategies for dental professionals. Additionally, it aims to educate dental practitioners on various aspects of the virus, including its history, pathogenesis, ongoing pharmacological clinical trials, and effective measures to reduce both economic and health repercussions within the oral health system.
This emerging health issue originated from a public market in Wuhan, China, where live animals are kept and traded. It garnered worldwide attention following the outbreak of a mysterious pneumonia epidemic. Initially, cases of pneumonia were closely monitored and tested in laboratories for coronavirus and potential influenza infections. On January 7, 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed the isolation of a novel Coronavirus, named nCoV-14.
The novel viral agent, previously unidentified in humans, was named SARS-CoV-2 and is responsible for the respiratory infectious disease known as COVID-19. Past outbreaks of coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV, resulted in 774 and 850 fatalities, respectively, underscoring the gravity of the situation and emphasizing the critical need to swiftly contain this emerging outbreak.
The genomic sequence of the new viral Coronavirus, known as Wuhan-Hu-1 with GenBank accession number MN908947, was promptly determined by public health support and the online community resource "virological.org" on January 10th. This was followed by the deposition of four other genomes on January 12th in the viral genomic sequence database maintained by the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). The initial clinical signs and symptoms indicated a virus closely linked to the SARS outbreak in 2002/2003, with a lineage that includes numerous viruses found in rhinolophid bats across Asia and Europe. Subsequent sequencing revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares 96.2% identity with the Bat RaTG13 CoV and 79.5% identity with SARS-CoV, suggesting bats as the natural host and a potential intermediary host for transmission to humans. While studies propose bats as the likely reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, there is also evidence pointing to the seafood market in Wuhan, China as the origin. Coronaviruses are categorized into α- and β-CoV, which infect mammals, and γ- and δ-CoV, which primarily infect birds. Among the six CoVs known to infect humans, most cause mild respiratory symptoms akin to a common cold, but SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can result in severe and potentially fatal respiratory infections.
Viruses are intricate pathogens with a significant ability to infect various host species, leading to a range of diseases with diverse symptoms. Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the pleomorphic RNA-viruses (specifically the subgenus sarbecovirus, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) known for their rapid gene recombination facilitated by frequent errors in their RNA polymerase-dependent replication process (RdRP). The replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 involves several key steps: initial recognition and binding to the host cell through membrane fusion or endocytosis, followed by the release of the viral genome, translation of the viral polymerase protein, RNA replication, sub-genomic transcription, translation of viral structural proteins, assembly of viral structural proteins with the nucleocapsid, formation of mature virions, and ultimately the release of mature virions via exocytosis. Throughout this cycle, approximately two-thirds of the viral RNA encode 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs), while the remaining one-third encodes four crucial structural proteins - spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) - along with additional accessory proteins. This intricate process culminates in the release of newly mature virions that can infect new targets, perpetuating the cycle continuously.
Host factors can significantly impact susceptibility to infection and disease progression, with research indicating that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S-glycoprotein, situated on the coronavirus surface, can effectively bind to the ACE2 receptor present on human cell surfaces. Upon this binding, the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm, initiating the translation of polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which encode non-structural proteins and form the replication and transcription complex (RTC), thereby perpetuating the replication cycle. Host antiviral defense mechanisms are crucial in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with type I interferon (IFN) serving as a pivotal component in triggering host antiviral responses. Upon viral infection, the innate immune system of the host is activated through the recognition of viral-specific components like ssRNA, dsRNA, or glycoproteins. The Toll-like and RIG-I-like receptors, as common host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), respond to RNA viruses, initiating an antiviral signaling cascade that involves the phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 and NF-κB, ultimately leading to the production of type I IFN. The secretion of IFN-β subsequently triggers the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, which in turn induce the expression of host antiviral effector factors.
Viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade host immune surveillance and subvert the host IFN system. These pathogens encode specific viral proteins that disrupt the signaling pathways of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), providing them with an early advantage against host defenses. For instance, the N proteins of SARS-CoV inhibit the ubiquitination of RIG-I, thereby suppressing the release of type I IFN. Similarly, the M proteins of SARS-CoV hinder the formation of the TRAF3/TBK1 complex, leading to the inhibition of TBK1/IKKε-dependent activation of IRF3/IRF7 transcription factors. Additionally, the nonstructural SARS-CoV nsp1 protein induces repressive modifications that impede host mRNA translation and facilitate host mRNA degradation.
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 primarily happens among family members, relatives, and close friends who have intimate contact with infected or asymptomatic individuals. COVID-19, being an emerging acute respiratory infectious disease, spreads predominantly through respiratory tract pathways via droplets, respiratory secretions, and direct contact, even at low infectious doses. Additionally, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in swabs from fecal and blood samples, suggesting the potential for multiple infection routes.
Based on the current epidemiological investigation, the incubation period of COVID-19 ranges from 1 to 14 days, with the majority of cases manifesting symptoms between 3 to 7 days. The virus is contagious even during its latency period and is highly transmissible among humans, particularly affecting the elderly and individuals with underlying health conditions. Common symptoms experienced by patients with COVID-19 include fever, malaise, and cough. While most adults and children infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit mild flu-like symptoms, a subset of patients progress to critical conditions, rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and, in severe cases, death. Despite ongoing research efforts, there are still significant gaps in understanding the epidemiology and clinical presentation of COVID-19, including uncertainties surrounding the exact incubation period, the potential for transmission from asymptomatic carriers, and the rate of transmissibility. Nevertheless, it has been conclusively established that human-to-human transmission plays a pivotal role in the continued spread of the disease.
Ensuring reliable laboratory diagnosis is a crucial aspect in enabling effective public health interventions. In cases of acute respiratory infections, RT-PCR serves as a standard method for detecting viruses present in respiratory secretions. The efficacy of real-time RT-PCR in promptly identifying viruses during global health crises has been underscored by successful collaborations between public laboratories and academic institutions.
The drugs that have shown efficacy against SARS-CoV and/or MERS are part of the WHO mega clinical trial known as SOLIDARITY. In this study, the World Health Organization selected several medications for evaluation, including the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir, the malaria drugs chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine, a combination of the anti-HIV medications lopinavir and ritonavir, and the latter combination along with interferon-b.
Remdesivir, an antiviral prodrug of remdesivirtriphosphate, demonstrates in vitro activity against coronaviruses. Remdesivir-TP functions as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, competing with adenosine-TP for integration into emerging viral RNA chains. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine also exhibit in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, with their mechanism of action encompassing the inhibition of viral enzymes such as RNA polymerase, viral protein glycosylation, virus assembly, new virus particle transport, and virus release. Additional mechanisms may include ACE2 receptor inhibition, reduction of acidity in endosomes, and modulation of cytokine release for immunomodulation.
The third arm of SOLIDARITY involves the combination of two HIV protease inhibitor drugs, lopinavir-ritonavir. This combination has demonstrated potential activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both in vitro and in vivo, with its mechanism of action centered on the inhibition of Mpro, a crucial enzyme for coronavirus replication. However, a recent report published in The New England Journal of Medicine was not promising, as the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir did not show significant differences compared to the "standard care" group.
The fourth arm of the SOLIDARITY trial combines lopinavir-ritonavir with interferon-beta. The activation of the innate antiviral response by interferon is expected to have beneficial effects, particularly in the early stages of infection. Nevertheless, caution is warranted as there is a possibility that interferon could potentially worsen inflammation during the later phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Clinical trials are currently underway to assess the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma, obtained from individuals who have recuperated from COVID-19 and may harbor antibodies, in treating patients with severe viral infections. Lei Liu's team administered convalescent plasma (400 mL total dose with SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody-IgG titer exceeding 1:1,000) to five critically ill patients, resulting in symptom alleviation within ten days. While these findings are compelling, the study by Shen et al. has its limitations. The intervention lacked assessment in a randomized clinical trial, and the treatment group's outcomes were not compared to a control group. Additionally, patients received various other therapies (antivirals and steroids), and the convalescent plasma was administered up to 21 days, raising questions about the optimal timing for administration and potential associations with different outcomes if administered earlier. Despite these constraints, the study offers valuable evidence supporting the need for more rigorous evaluations of this therapy.
Dentists are among the professionals most at risk of exposure to COVID-19 due to the nature of their work environment and the oral cavity, which are high potential sources for transmission of this and other pathogens. The presence of undocumented infections is particularly concerning as it contributes to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. A significant portion of individuals infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms, making them key contributors to the spread of the disease and posing a challenge for healthcare teams who may inadvertently become vectors for transmission.
The prompt identification of COVID-19 cases is essential for effectively managing the pandemic. Nevertheless, this remains a challenging task due to the absence of definitive symptoms, alongside the limited availability of specialized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which also have their own constraints. It is imperative to develop rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to swiftly detect a large number of infected individuals and asymptomatic carriers, thereby curbing the spread of the virus and ensuring appropriate measures are taken. The utilization of rapid tests could potentially streamline future elective care by eliminating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination. Nonetheless, it is crucial for dentists to remain vigilant about other diseases that can be transmitted through saliva and aerosols, such as hepatitis B, measles, and tuberculosis.
Dentists must prioritize preventive care and testing to effectively contribute to flattening the epidemic curve and preventing the health system from collapsing. Various modeling studies and scenario comparisons, drawing from experiences in China and Italy, emphasize the need for combined interventions targeting both the general population and healthcare professionals. Essential measures for all healthcare providers, including dentists, involve daily health monitoring, temperature checks, utilization of N95 masks, maintaining physical distance at work through remote communication technologies, practicing social distancing, adhering to mobility restrictions, avoiding crowded places, conducting diagnostic tests, and isolating infected individuals and their families. Dentists, in particular, should adhere to guidance protocols and adopt new tools and technologies in dental practice to ensure the safety of oral health professionals and the individuals they serve.
The nature of dental treatment involves various procedures such as the use of high-speed handpieces or ultrasonic scalers that generate aerosols, which are very small particles or droplets that can be inhaled, absorbed by the skin, or settle on nearby surfaces. According to the latest Scientific Brief from the World Health Organization, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur through respiratory droplets from direct contact with an infected person (within a distance of less than 1m), indirect contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, and aerosols produced during procedures on infected patients. Consequently, dental and health organizations have recommended postponing all elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures, restricting services to urgent and emergency visits only. Dental health care personnel (DHCP) are advised to understand the transmission mechanisms, implement enhanced infection control procedures, recognize patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of COVID-19, and differentiate between dental emergencies, urgent care, and non-emergency treatments.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is recommended that dental care providers utilize telecommunication or teledentistry prior to dental treatment in order to assess the patient's needs and reduce the risk of infection. This involves inquiring about symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath as advised by the American Dental Association (ADA) and inquiring about recent national or international travel according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dentists should provide guidance, prescribe appropriate medications for pain relief or antimicrobial purposes if necessary, and consider postponing non-urgent appointments while maintaining communication with patients through phone or text messages. In cases of dental emergencies that are potentially life-threatening, such as uncontrolled bleeding or severe pain with a risk of infection, immediate attention is required. However, if the patient also exhibits symptoms of a respiratory infection, they should not be seen in a dental office and should be referred to an emergency care facility equipped with Transmission-Based Precautions, including N95 masks and Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms, as recommended by the ADA.
In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) is collaborating with dental practices and community dental services to implement Local Dental Urgent Care Systems in each region. These dental facilities are designed to cater to a wide range of patients, including those suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, individuals who are shielded or vulnerable, as well as patients without any specific conditions. Within these facilities, dental public health practitioners will be present and equipped with FFP3 respirators to carry out necessary treatments.
In most countries, dental emergencies or urgent dental care for patients without any signs or symptoms of COVID-19 can typically be managed at the dental office. However, given the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19, it is crucial for dentists to exercise additional caution when attending to patients and not presume their COVID-19 status. Apart from asymptomatic cases, dental professionals should recognize that children pose a significant transmission risk for the virus due to their tendency to exhibit milder symptoms compared to adults. Therefore, it is imperative to uphold patient isolation by limiting the number of individuals in the waiting room to one, strictly adhere to infection control protocols, which involve the correct donning and doffing of all Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as gowns, goggles, N95 masks with face shields, and gloves. Prior to any procedure, patients should utilize a mouth rinse containing 1% or 1.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.2% povidone, and wear goggles and a bib throughout the entire treatment. To reduce aerosol generation, dentists should opt for hand instrumentation, employ a high-volume saliva ejector, use a dental dam, and avoid using a 3-in-1 syringe.
Intraoral radiographs should be avoided due to their potential to induce coughing; therefore, the office space should be restricted to the patient, operator, and dental assistant. Following treatment, Dental Healthcare Personnel (DCHP) must don appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for the cleaning and disinfection of the room and equipment using recommended disinfectants. Additionally, dentists are advised to reconsider the use of sedation (both inhalation and pharmacological) for managing severe anxiety or phobia in dental settings. Instead, they should prioritize non-pharmacological techniques to reduce the risk of requiring life support measures that involve airway manipulation and aerosolization, particularly in the context of inhalation sedation.
In a specific scenario where a patient faces an unavoidable emergency without any signs or symptoms of COVID-19, and the dentist lacks an N95 mask or a higher level of protection, it becomes imperative for them to don a single-use surgical mask, along with goggles and a face shield, to attend to the patient. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the risk of contamination in such a situation would be moderate. This approach is constrained by the current community transmission of COVID-19, which includes asymptomatic cases within the population. Recent studies indicate that the prognosis for COVID-19 patients is particularly severe for individuals over the age of 60 or those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular diseases. Consequently, healthcare professionals must exercise clinical judgment and adhere to all necessary precautions to mitigate the risk of transmission.
In this unprecedented situation, it is advisable to seek and implement the most recent protocols and guidance from local dental organizations in your country, which are grounded in current literature. It is important to recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges not only to dental healthcare providers in their practices but also in their financial circumstances. A general flowchart (Figure) has been developed based on the ADA's Interim guidance on minimizing COVID-19 transmission risk during the treatment of dental emergencies. As emphasized in the ADA document, Figure 1 is not intended as legal advice or guidance, but rather serves as a tool to assist clinicians in assessing the risks of infection while operating in dental offices.
Health professionals are encountering novel challenges in delivering patient care, with the advent of remote treatment modalities such as chat, video conversations, telemedicine, and teledentistry. These technologies have prompted a reevaluation of the professional-patient relationship, offering opportunities in an unexplored realm, particularly as most dentists have yet to integrate them into their daily practice. It is projected that by 2025, more than 60% of the population will be utilizing mobile internet, underscoring the significance of mobile technologies, including phones, as valuable assets in community health, especially within low and middle-income demographics. Even individuals currently lacking access to mobile services stand to benefit from reduced waiting times at local health facilities, such as Primary Health Units in close proximity.
In private offices, the restriction of dental and medical activities to urgent and emergency procedures has significantly impacted the economy of these sectors. This economic crisis has prompted reflections and concerns that extend beyond clinical safety and social distancing, emphasizing the significance of social security and financial literacy. These factors should be considered by the governing bodies of dental practice to facilitate discussions that can assist dentists in navigating the challenges of deviating from their usual clinical tasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The dental profession, predominantly consisting of autonomous practitioners, needs to address the crucial aspect of financial education, often overlooked in academic curricula. A noticeable dearth of literature exists on financial education tailored specifically for dental practices. Recommendations for this group should encompass establishing emergency financial reserves, determining suitable investment vehicles for these reserves, exploring long-term investment options, and considering public or private pension schemes. Comparable professional groups are actively engaging with these financial matters in light of the current imperative to ensure social security for all, surpassing governmental initiatives. These strategies must be sustainable, focusing on long-term viability to safeguard self-employed individuals and avert an unprecedented economic downturn.
The recent COVID-19 pandemic has evolved into a global public health crisis, primarily transmitted through contact with infected surfaces and bodily fluids such as saliva and aerosols. A significant proportion of individuals infected with the virus remain asymptomatic, potentially serving as carriers and facilitating its spread. This places dental offices at a heightened risk for cross-infection among both patients and dental professionals. With no definitive treatment currently available, the swift and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 remains a significant challenge. In response to this crisis, it is recommended that all non-essential dental procedures and elective treatments be postponed, with only urgent and emergency visits being conducted. The financial implications of such unexpected events underscore the importance of incorporating financial education into the curriculum of dental schools. Utilizing telecommunication methods such as phone calls and text messages, as well as embracing teledentistry, emerges as promising strategies to maintain patient contact while minimizing the risk of infection transmission.
The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico - CNPq) and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - CAPES) are two prominent organizations in Brazil that play crucial roles in supporting and promoting research and education in the country.
