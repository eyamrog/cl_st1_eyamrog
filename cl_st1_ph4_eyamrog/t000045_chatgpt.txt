In Brazil, politicians across various levels collaborate to achieve electoral and governance objectives. Recently, these interactions have been scrutinized through the lens of broker theories in comparative politics. This study delves into the foundational aspects of alliances between state representatives and local politicians, questioning the applicability of these theories in the Brazilian context. Our investigation integrates survey data from state representatives and insights from interviews with advisors, focusing on the establishment, maintenance, and dissolution of alliances. We highlight the pivotal role mayors and city councilors play as brokers for state representatives. Nevertheless, the dynamic nature of legislators and local brokers, who often assume dual roles, challenges the adequacy of principal-agent theories in comprehensively describing and analyzing these relationships. Drawing from our findings, we propose avenues to enhance our comprehension of interest intermediation dynamics and the intricate multilevel connections among political actors.
The present iteration of this article underwent blind review for submission to the journal DADOS - Revista de Ciências Sociais. Despite not meeting the criteria for publication, we have chosen to incorporate the received reviews (in Portuguese) within this version to uphold transparency and enhance scientific discourse.

In Brazilian politics, it is a prevalent practice for politicians situated at various tiers of the political system to collaborate with each other to attain goals, whether in electoral contests or in governance. This collaboration is evident in the alliances formed between legislators (at state and federal levels) and mayors and councilors, which can take the form of formal arrangements limited to the electoral cycle (referred to as dobradas) or informal partnerships that extend beyond elections. Within this dynamic, local politicians are typically perceived as brokers, a term employed in scholarly literature to describe individuals who serve as intermediaries between politicians and the electorate.
Numerous studies on the Brazilian context underscore the significance of the interactions between legislators and local politicians, with the latter playing a crucial mediating role (Bezerra, 1999; Avelino, Biderman, and Barone, 2012; Barone, 2014; Novaes, 2018). The prevailing notion is that representatives cater to and distribute resources to their geographically concentrated constituencies, while local intermediaries reciprocate by mobilizing votes for the legislators. These investigations typically operate on assumptions regarding the motivations of the involved actors and the visible outcomes of their alliances, yet they often lack concrete evidence on the underlying mechanisms of these relationships. This study aims to assess the applicability of the theoretical framework employed in analyzing the connections between brokers and leaders in comparative politics to elucidate the dynamics between legislators and local politicians in Brazil. Our research delves into the construction, sustenance, and potential dissolution of these relationships, juxtaposing our findings with the anticipated outcomes posited by existing theory.
To address these inquiries, we amalgamated survey data with inputs from state representatives across twelve Brazilian states and insights gleaned from in-depth interviews with advisors of these representatives. Our aim was to delineate the intricate connections between state legislators and local brokers across a diverse array of states, shedding light on the foundational elements of these alliances and the mediating dynamics that define them. Rather than conducting a systematic hypothesis test, our approach is exploratory, yet holds the potential to reshape future studies in this domain by delving into the underlying mechanisms of legislator-broker relationships. A key contribution of our work lies in outlining both theoretical frameworks and empirical avenues for further exploration in this field. Notably, our study diverges from existing literature by pivoting the focus from federal legislators, commonly scrutinized in prior research, to state representatives, thereby emphasizing both commonalities and distinctions in their roles and interactions.
Our analysis sheds light on a distinct category of brokers that has not been prominently featured in recent studies. Recent comparative literature has largely overlooked the role of elective officeholders at the local level as brokers, with only a few studies delving into their specific characteristics (Stokes et al., 2013; Camp, 2015). Existing research tends to focus on party activists (Stokes et al., 2013), activists motivated by political, ethnic, or religious affiliations (Aspinall, 2014), community leaders with or without party affiliations (Zarazaga, 2014; Holland & Palmer-Rubin, 2015), and independent brokers contracted solely for election-related activities (Muñoz, 2014).
Our analysis substantiates the notion that local politicians, specifically mayors and city councilors, function as intermediaries and serve as crucial pillars of support for state legislators. It was noted that financial resources and aid in addressing issues with state agencies are generally the most highly prized forms of assistance (Bezerra, 1999; Meireles, 2019), yet councilors and mayors exhibit variations in their requests and the manner in which they are addressed. Meeting their demands stands as the principal method through which representatives cultivate alliances, highlighting the predominantly reactive nature of legislators' actions and their offices in this context.
There are various avenues through which partnerships can be forged, notably through friendships and geographical proximity. Our research indicates that reputation plays a crucial role in the selection of brokers, while political parties serve more as potential veto points, contingent upon the local political landscape, rather than as definitive criteria for shaping alliances. Our analysis further reveals that the electoral benefits of partnerships for legislators are not guaranteed, entailing numerous uncertainties and a substantial investment of effort in gathering information, negotiating, and establishing priorities to support a local politician. Additionally, we have determined that electoral losses are the primary cause of relationship dissolution, with representatives displaying a reluctance to penalize local brokers who fail to meet expectations.
While acknowledging the significance of local political actors as intermediaries for legislators, our research highlights the inadequacies of principal-agent theories, the predominant theoretical framework in studying this subject in Brazil (Stokes et al., 2013), in capturing these dynamics, particularly when brokers also serve in elected positions and navigate dual roles. Contrary to the assumptions posited by such theories, our findings do not substantiate the presence of an inherent clash of interests between brokers and their superiors, nor do they support the notion of an information imbalance favoring the former irrespective of the specific context.
Based on our findings, it is imperative to delve deeper into the distinctions between local brokers with and without elective mandates, as well as between state and national representatives concerning their local affiliations. Additionally, there is a crucial need to examine the disparities and correlations between the intermediary processes observed during elections and those extending beyond the electoral periods. Furthermore, it is essential to explore alternative mechanisms of broker selection beyond the predominant focus on political parties, which has been more extensively analyzed in the context of Brazil.
Municipal and general elections in Brazil occur on a biennial basis, with mayors and councilors being elected in 5,568 municipalities, followed by state and national legislators, senators, governors, and the president of the Republic two years later. Executive officials at all levels are chosen through a majoritarian system, while legislators and councilors are elected using an open-list proportional system. In state and national elections, with the exception of the presidential race, the electoral districts correspond to the twenty-seven federation units. National representatives are elected within states, and their campaigns are primarily conducted at the state level.
The 1988 Constitution solidified the political and administrative autonomy of municipalities, elevating the significance of local leaders, particularly mayors. Despite this, a majority of Brazilian municipalities continue to rely heavily on financial transfers from higher levels of government (Bremaeker, 2018). The inadequate infrastructure in these areas compels mayors to establish connections with congressmen to guarantee the continuous influx of resources and advantages to their communities, ultimately leading to electoral triumph.
Various aspects of the Brazilian political system, including its federative structure, electoral mechanisms, delineation of electoral constituencies, distinct electoral processes, and centralization of resources, foster collaboration among local and state/national political figures, both during inter-election periods and election cycles (Carneiro and Almeida, 2008). Scholarly works in the fields of electoral and legislative studies consistently highlight the significance of the relationships between local leaders and elected representatives as a fundamental characteristic of Brazilian political dynamics.
Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of mayors establishing relationships with state and national representatives to facilitate investments in infrastructure and public works projects, which are widely regarded as a key indicator of effective local governance (Palmeira and Goldman, 1996; Bezerra, 1999). These connections can serve as a distinguishing factor for mayors, symbolizing power and prestige that can be leveraged for the benefit of the municipality and as a means to appeal to voters (Chaves, 1996; Bezerra, 1999; Eduardo, 2016). Additionally, many congressmen rely on mayors to secure recognition for the benefits they deliver, enhance their reputation within their region, and ultimately secure votes.
Ames, Baker, and Rennó (2008) provide evidence suggesting that voters largely consider local issues when selecting candidates for the national legislature, favoring individuals who demonstrate a capacity to effectively distribute resources within their respective regions. This reciprocal support between voters and candidates has been termed by Ames (1994) as "reverse coattails effects."
Research indicates that this collaboration yields electoral benefits for both parties involved. Avelino, Biderman, and Barone (2012) along with Barone (2014) demonstrate that winning a mayoral election enhances the electoral prospects of parties for state and national positions. Additionally, Eduardo (2016) reveals that forming alliances with legislators boosts the electoral prospects of mayors, particularly in smaller municipalities, especially when voters perceive it will lead to communal advantages.
One significant way in which representatives can serve their localities and local politicians is by allocating resources through pork barrel budget amendments, in response to requests from mayors and other local stakeholders. Another method involves providing allies with information and facilitating access to government agencies, particularly within the Executive branch, to assist in resolving bureaucratic issues (Bezerra, 1999; Carvalho, 2003, p. 152). Legislators highlight that the amount of resources directed towards municipalities serves as the primary yardstick for evaluating the performance of lawmakers by local leaders (Bezerra, 1999). Despite expressing reservations about these activities, representatives justify their focus on local matters by citing voter expectations, a sentiment supported by Ricci and Lemos (2011) through surveys conducted with national legislators.
Scholarly literature focusing on the Brazilian context has underscored the pivotal role of political parties in shaping these interrelationships (Bezerra, 1999). Research findings indicate that these entities significantly influence the outcomes across various electoral cycles at different levels of government, with a triumph in mayoral elections enhancing a party's prospects in subsequent legislative contests (Fleischer, 2002; Carneiro and Almeida, 2008; Avelino, Biderman, and Barone, 2012; Novaes, 2018). Moreover, there is substantial evidence pointing towards party coordination in the allocation of budgetary resources, a factor deemed critical within the electoral landscape (Baião and Couto, 2017; Meireles, 2019).
Most research on the interactions between legislators and local leaders predominantly focuses on national representatives. However, evidence highlighting the significance of local brokers for state representatives can be gleaned from studies such as Castro, Anastasia, and Nunes (2009) and Melo (2011). Drawing on survey data from twelve Brazilian states, these scholars demonstrate that many legislators place value on establishing connections with local leaders and the municipalities where they garnered substantial votes. These lawmakers frequently engage in visits to various localities, actively work towards directing resources from budget amendments to their regions, address constituents' needs, and assist mayors in resolving issues with government entities. Furthermore, the research indicates that a notable portion of state legislators perceive their ability to allocate resources to their constituencies as the most crucial factor influencing their chances of reelection.
In recent years, scholars have begun to explore the dynamics of the relationship between local politicians and legislators in Brazil using a theoretical framework centered around brokers (Eduardo, 2016; Novaes, 2018). This approach not only provides a structured foundation but also elucidates the underlying premises and observable implications of these relationships, thereby situating the phenomenon within the realm of comparative politics literature. In the subsequent section, we outline the fundamental concepts of brokers and elucidate how these intermediary relationships function based on existing theories, while also critically examining their applicability to the Brazilian context.
In recent years, scholars focusing on distributive politics and clientelism have shifted their focus towards brokers: individuals who act as intermediaries between politicians and parties on one side and voters and groups on the other. Brokers are considered pivotal figures in structuring and sustaining clientelist networks, thereby facilitating voter mobilization. Various studies highlight their significance, attributing it to their deep integration within their communities, which grants them privileged insights into the preferences of voters. Consequently, brokers play a crucial role in determining optimal distribution strategies (including what, who, when, and how much to distribute) with the ultimate goal of maximizing electoral gains (Stokes et al., 2013; Holland & Palmer-Rubin, 2015; Zarazaga, 2016; Szwarcberg, 2015; Aspinall, 2014; Novaes, 2018).
Brokers are individuals, typically not elected, who assume leadership positions or possess social and political capital enabling them to sway voters. While they may also serve in public office, typically at the local level, their influence transcends elections. Brokers often play a crucial role in addressing community issues (Auyero, 2001; Brierley and Nathan, 2021) and even participate in governmental responsibilities at the local level (Auyero, 2000; Zarazaga, 2014; Hoyler, Gelape, and Silotto, 2021).
While some scholars view brokers as agents of political parties entrenched within extensive and interconnected networks reminiscent of political machines (Stokes et al., 2013), others contend that a broader spectrum of broker profiles can be observed in less structured and more fluid party systems (Aspinall, 2014; Muñoz, 2014; Mares and Young, 2016). These brokers may be motivated by political, ethnic, religious, or territorial affiliations, driven by long-term material gains, or enticed by immediate material incentives (Aspinall, 2014). Alternatively, they may prioritize the interests of their respective groups (Holland and Palmer-Rubin, 2015). Furthermore, brokers may operate independently of parties and organizations, functioning as autonomous actors who switch loyalties within the same electoral cycle (Muñoz, 2014; Aspinall, 2014; Novaes, 2018).
With few exceptions (Auyero, 2000; Lawson and Greene, 2011; Finan and Schechter, 2012), the existing literature often overlooks the significance of friendship and emotions such as gratitude, reciprocity, and obligation in the dynamics of political brokerage. These elements can serve as mechanisms for establishing and reinforcing relationships while also acting as safeguards against opportunistic or predatory behavior. In many studies, these relationships are typically viewed through the lens of a market transaction, driven by instrumental calculations (Brusco, Nazareno & Stokes, 2003; Stokes et al., 2013; Zarazaga, 2014; Camp, 2015).
Principal-agent theories have served as a crucial framework for examining the dynamics between intermediaries and leaders. These theories, widely utilized in Political Science, particularly in studies influenced by rational choice theory, aim to elucidate scenarios where one party, the principal, incentivizes another party or parties, the agents, to make decisions and take actions aligned with the principal's objectives and interests (Gailmard, 2012). This framework operates on the assumption of conflicting goals between the principal and agents. To mitigate agency losses and deter opportunistic behaviors and disloyalty among intermediaries, principals employ a range of incentives and disincentives, such as promises of career progression, public sector appointments, preferential treatment for local supporters in candidate selection, financial backing during elections, and other forms of personal gratification (Camp, 2015; Novaes, 2018).
A recurring theme in principal-agent analyses is the agent's alignment with the principal's objectives and the methods bosses employ to select and oversee brokers to ensure their actions are in line with the principal's interests (Stokes et al., 2013; Aspinall, 2014; Gingerich, 2020; Holland and Palmer-Rubin, 2015). Scholars often highlight a potential conflict of interest between brokers and politicians/parties, posing risks for the latter in terms of optimization and return on investment (Stokes et al., 2013). Merely being esteemed leaders in their communities is insufficient for brokers; they must also exhibit the capacity to mobilize voters. In turn, principals must identify tangible indicators to guide and evaluate brokers' performance. Common indicators utilized by principals include the number of votes secured by brokers (Szwarcberg, 2012; Gingerich, 2020), participation in campaign events (Szwarcberg, 2012; Muñoz, 2014), and the extent of networks brokers can establish (Stokes et al., 2013).
The relationship between participants is sustained based on mutual benefit, a concept that some authors suggest is vulnerable to brokers' disloyalty, particularly in contexts where non-dominant clientelist parties operate without exclusive access to state resources (Muñoz, 2014; Novaes, 2018). Aspinall (2014) highlights that in such environments, the risk of defection and predatory behavior escalates as brokers prioritize short-term material gains within the network. Additional factors influencing brokers' loyalty include the quantity of resources available to candidates and their likelihood of success (Aspinall, 2014), levels of party identification among voters, and the presence of programmatic connections between brokers and leaders (Novaes, 2018).
Examining research on distributive politics in Brazil reveals several key findings: firstly, voters factor in local issues when making their voting choices, often favoring legislators known for securing resources for their municipality; secondly, a considerable portion of legislators actively work towards distributing resources and delivering services to their respective municipalities; thirdly, local leaders, particularly mayors, play a crucial role in influencing voter support for legislators; and finally, the allocation of resources to municipalities yields electoral benefits for both legislators and mayors.
The application of principal-agent models by brokers to describe brokerage relationships involving elected officials seeking votes is not entirely appropriate. The rigid assumptions inherent in these models, such as conflicting goals between principal and agent and informational asymmetry favoring the agent, do not always accurately depict the dynamics between Brazilian legislators and their local brokers. Our subsequent sections aim to illustrate the diverse nature of these relationships, highlighting that there is no singular equilibrium that can encapsulate their complexity.
In contrast to the predominant quantitative analyses in studies on brokerage between officeholders in Brazil, our paper adopts a multi-method approach. By combining quantitative and qualitative descriptive evidence, we aim to address key inquiries: how are the relationships between state representatives and local politicians established, sustained, and terminated? Furthermore, we seek to evaluate whether the principal-agent models commonly utilized in comparative politics offer a suitable framework for understanding and examining these relationships within the Brazilian context.
To discern overarching patterns in the interactions between state legislators and their intermediaries, we analyze data from two waves of a survey conducted by the Center for Legislative Studies (CEL/DCP/UFMG) in twelve Brazilian states. The survey included 513 state representatives in 2007 and 439 in 2012. While this data is not nationally representative, limiting its generalizability to the entire country, it does offer insights that contribute to a broader understanding of the Brazilian context. Furthermore, we supplemented this quantitative analysis with ten in-depth interviews with chiefs of staff and advisors of nine state legislators from a specific state. These interviews furnish additional perspectives on the research questions posed earlier in this section, complementing the quantitative data analysis.
Rather than basing assumptions about the motivations of actors and the anticipated outcomes of alliances on theory, interviews offer a more comprehensive perspective on these processes and their evolution over time. They allow us to pinpoint the underlying elements of the quantitative evidence found in existing literature and elucidate their operational mechanisms (Martin, 2013). These elements pertain to the perceptions and motivations of the individuals directly involved in forming these alliances, aspects that are often overlooked in surveys. Consequently, by providing a detailed account of how actors make decisions, behave, and respond within their interrelations, interviews can aid in formulating hypotheses and suggesting causal mechanisms (Martin, 2013; Kapiszewski, MacLean, and Read, 2015).
One challenge associated with the interviewing method pertains to the formation of the interviewee sample and the resulting bias (Martin, 2013). The objective of this phase was to explore the dynamics involved in establishing and sustaining alliances, leading us to target state legislators whose teams could offer insights into instances of this phenomenon. Specifically, we opted for representatives (elected during the 2015-2018 legislative term) who garnered a minimum of 30% of their votes from a specific region, under the assumption that legislators with higher concentrations of votes tend to exhibit more particularistic tendencies (Carvalho, 2003). By selecting these representatives, who were anticipated to rely more heavily on local intermediaries, we aimed to enhance the probability of obtaining narratives concerning these relationships.
Nine legislators from the selected state region met the aforementioned criterion, with six being re-elected in 2018 for the 2019-2022 term, while three were unsuccessful in their re-election bids. Due to the unavailability of advisors for two legislators, we substituted these instances with two legislators who garnered at least 20% of their votes from the region. A total of ten interviews were carried out, involving nine chiefs of staff and one advisor representing nine distinct state representatives. The decision to interview advisors instead of legislators was based on the assumption that they would be more accessible and possess a broader perspective on the legislative responsibilities. Among the ten advisors interviewed, only one was affiliated with the regional office.
The interviews unveiled that mayors (prefeitos), local councilors (vereadores), former mayors, and former councilors, individuals currently or previously in office, emerge as the most influential intermediaries for state legislators. This finding is substantiated by the survey results. When questioned about crucial support for their electoral triumph, the region's mayors rank as the second most significant group in both phases of the state legislators' survey. Combining the first and second most critical forms of support, a minimum of 30% of respondents in both survey waves identified the backing of "mayors from their region" as one of the top two most crucial factors (36.5% in 2007 and 30.3% in 2012). This outcome aligns with prior research emphasizing the pivotal role of mayors as local intermediaries (Mares and Young, 2016; Gingerich, 2020).
Our findings indicate that while city councilors are considered significant supporters, their influence is somewhat less compared to mayors. In the 2007 survey, nearly 24% of participants highlighted the importance of backing from local councilors for their electoral success (5.7% in the initial wave, 18.3% in the subsequent wave), with a slightly lower percentage of just over 18% expressing the same sentiment in the 2012 survey (4.3% in the first wave, 14.1% in the second). Overall, in 2007, a combined total of 50.3% of respondents cited mayors or councilors as one of the two most crucial endorsements, a percentage that decreased to 40.1% in the 2012 survey.
The research findings reveal a notable variation in the importance attributed to mayors and/or city councilors by the representatives surveyed, with distinct patterns emerging across different states as outlined in Appendix B. Notably, Bahia, Pernambuco, and Tocantins consistently rank these officials as crucial supports for their election, while Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Sul, and Rio de Janeiro exhibit lower levels of citation. Despite the disparities in state sizes, the stability of this pattern remains striking. Furthermore, an analysis of political parties with 10 or more members interviewed indicates that the PT consistently receives a lower than average proportion of mentions regarding mayors and/or councilors, while the DEM, PMDB, PP, and PSDB tend to have a higher than average proportion, as detailed in Appendix B.
In both waves of the study, the category that emerged as the most crucial for legislators' victory was community leaders. This finding stands in stark contrast to the in-depth interviews, where current and former elected officials such as mayors and councilors were given significantly more importance compared to other types of leaders. This disparity can likely be attributed to the distinct profiles of the survey sample, which included representatives with varied profiles and spatial voting patterns, and the interview sample, which concentrated on legislators with more localized voting support.
An intriguing aspect highlighted in the interviews, often overlooked in the existing literature, is the distinction between "support from the municipality" and "support from the mayor." Advisors commonly refer to these forms of support as "representatives' municipalities" (municípios do deputado) or "our municipalities" (nossos municípios). However, the determining factor in whether a municipality is considered "the legislator's" lies in having an aligned mayor or the backing of a political figure, typically city councilors, former mayors, former councilors, or individuals with aspirations for future political roles. Essentially, a legislator can exert influence over a municipality without necessarily having the endorsement of the mayor.
Advisors refer to their engagements with municipalities and local leaders as "political affairs" ("trabalho político"), distinguishing it from other tasks. During interviews, all participants provided estimates of the number of allied municipalities, with nearly all presenting spreadsheets detailing the list of municipalities associated with the legislator. While the organization of each spreadsheet varied, they typically included the names of municipalities, the number of votes received by the state legislator in the previous election, and the name of the reference broker, who could be the mayor, a councilor, a former mayor, a former councilor, or occasionally a community leader.
All interviewees, with the exception of one, emphasized the significance of the mayor's support in the legislator's recent election. They highlighted that mayors serve as crucial brokers due to their prominence within the municipality, political influence, and ability to implement decisions, distinguishing them from councilors. In many cases, mayors act as gatekeepers, with their endorsement often being vital, and at times indispensable, for representatives seeking entry into the municipalities. This observation aligns with Bezerra's (1999) research on national representatives, indicating a consistent pattern across different levels of government.
The mayor's support holds significant importance for the majority of legislators. To illustrate this, imagine yourself as the mayor of a municipality. If I were to approach that area alone and seek votes, being unknown to the residents, it is the local figures such as mayors, councilors, and community leaders who hold sway and influence over the perception of the legislator, as highlighted by Chief of Staff 2 in the research.
In two interviews, the diminished significance of mayors was linked, in part, to the legislators' relatively brief tenure in the State Assembly, spanning only two terms. Conversely, there were instances where representatives inherited political influence, including the backing of mayors, from their parents who had previously served as legislators. Furthermore, as previously posited by Novaes (2018), our research uncovered indications that representatives in the opposition face greater difficulties in maintaining their support networks due to limited access to patronage resources. In response to inquiries regarding the quantity of local brokers, an advisor affiliated with an opposition party remarked:
Approximately 40 mayors, along with around 60 councilors and leaders, were involved in the study. The number of participants has decreased over time, as in the initial term, there were as many as 70 to 80 mayors. It is noted that until the conclusion of the previous year, the group had aligned with the governor, resulting in a significantly enhanced access to state government resources, as highlighted by Advisor 1.
In certain instances, legislators blend a regional strategy, heavily reliant on mayors and municipal leaders, with thematic initiatives or engagements within a specific sector. When focusing on the latter, interviewees often assign lower significance to regional endeavors and the role of mayors as intermediaries. An example illustrating this diminished emphasis is a legislator advocating for a particular group's interests: she opts not to maintain a regional office and operates with just one paid assistant in her hometown.
The interviews reveal a clear distinction between two categories of legislators. The first category comprises policy-oriented individuals who invest significant time and effort into lawmaking and institutional engagements. In contrast, the second category prioritizes constituency service, placing high value on municipalities, local leaders, and what the interviewees refer to as "political affairs."
It is noteworthy that among the interviewees, there was one second-term representative who did not emphasize the significance of mayoral support for the legislator's election. This particular legislator concentrates her efforts on a specific policy domain, and her primary connections at the local level are with various stakeholders, including bureaucrats in managerial roles, presidents of NGOs, and organizations operating within the same policy sphere. Furthermore, her advisor mentioned that their office actively utilizes social media to promote the legislator's initiatives, indicating a strategic move to diminish the reliance on local politicians as intermediaries and instead foster a direct rapport with constituents.
It was surprising to observe the significance placed on city councilors in both the interviews and the survey, considering the limited attention given in the literature to the interactions of city councilors with external actors beyond the local sphere. During our interviews, advisors underscored the crucial role of councilors, particularly in municipalities where a legislator lacks the support of the mayor, enabling councilors to strategically pursue the acquisition or reinstatement of control over the local Executive.
The hierarchical structure within the legislative body is evident, as the legislator firmly believes that the councilor should convey her requests to the mayor, who in turn should present them here. However, this does not imply that we neglect the councilor's needs. In instances where the mayor is not aligned with our interests, we actively support the councilor. Conversely, when the mayor is aligned with our agenda, it is deemed inappropriate for the councilor to directly approach us, as it may be perceived as undermining the authority of the executive branch (Chief of Staff 4).
There is a perceived difference in the nature of demands placed on councilors compared to mayors, with councilors facing a more diverse range of requests while mayors primarily deal with financial resource-related demands. Mayors are typically linked to broader, more general requests, although they may also advocate for specific groups or individuals on occasion. In contrast, councilors often focus on representing the interests of individuals and social organizations, which they commonly refer to as "entidades."
In non-election years, councilors play a crucial role in mediating the allocation of resources to social organizations. This process circumvents the need for involvement from the mayor's office, making councilors particularly vital in municipalities where the mayor lacks direct control. Councilors have the autonomy to independently facilitate resource distribution. However, when a councilor requires assistance for a request of a more collective nature, collaboration with the Executive branch becomes essential as they are responsible for execution. This collaboration may lead to credit disputes, with a positive resolution often hinging on the goodwill of the mayor. Despite this potential hurdle, interviewees generally reported that such transactions proceed smoothly. It is typically disadvantageous for mayors to reject resources and benefits for the municipality, even if they originate from an opposing councilor or political group.
It is evident that brokers who also hold elected offices play a crucial role in supporting state representatives. However, existing research on brokers often fails to differentiate between those who are elected and those who are not. Consequently, the extent to which the findings and conclusions of these studies can be generalized to both groups remains uncertain.
Furthermore, as previously highlighted, these studies often rely on the assumptions of principal-agent models. To effectively utilize this framework, it is essential to clearly delineate the roles of the principal and the agent (Gailmard, 2012, p. 4). Our examination reveals that state representatives and brokers do not maintain fixed positions but rather navigate through time and space, assuming a dual role. Acting as the leader, a legislator serves as the primary figure expecting local actors to work towards her electoral triumph. To motivate brokers, she offers incentives like allocating discretionary budget resources to municipalities and fulfilling requests from mayors and councilors. However, in this capacity, she also faces inherent risks within this dynamic. Notably, as mayors and councilors also hold political positions, a temporal shift transforms legislators from principals to agents, prepared to rally voters during municipal elections. An additional unique facet of this dynamic, often overlooked in existing analyses, is the necessity for representatives to mobilize voters to safeguard the political longevity of those who previously served as their brokers. Essentially, the distinction between principal and agent is contingent upon the role played within this relationship, which evolves over time and space and cannot be solely deduced from the individual's position within the country's elected-offices structure.
In the preceding section, we demonstrated the significance of mayors and local councilors as crucial intermediaries for state representatives, highlighting their role in resource allocation to municipalities. This section delves into the mechanisms through which these alliances are forged and the criteria involved in the selection of brokers.
Our findings challenge the notion that friendship and reciprocal emotions are insignificant in the interactions between legislators and local brokers. Analysis of data from the 2007 and 2012 survey waves reveals that legislators did not attribute their ability to secure support from mayors and councilors to a singular factor. Notably, personal and family relationships emerged as significant factors, with 25.6% citing them as primary in 2007 and 32.4% in 2012. Other influential factors included executing public works in the area (26.7% in 2007), allocating resources to the region (15.3% in 2012), party affiliations (14% and 21%, respectively), and endorsing the campaigns of local officials (11.6% and 15.3%). Contrary to the prevailing focus on party ties in existing literature, our survey data illustrates a more varied landscape of influences in these relationships.
During the interviews, there was a frequent mention of friendship ties. Friend networks were highlighted as crucial sources of information, avenues to initiate new relationships, channels to secure donations for campaigns, and primarily as reservoirs of trust for situations where one party may not fulfill expectations set by their counterpart.
In contemporary times, mayors and councilors consistently seek resources for the municipality through a process that involves negotiation. Their commitment to a legislator is often contingent upon the provision of resources. Careful selection is employed in this regard to avoid individuals who may not foster a lasting relationship. The legislator possesses the unique ability to unite individuals affiliated with the party, those who harbor sympathy towards the party, and even those who share personal friendships (Advisor 1).
When examining the interactions between representatives and local actors, scholars often inquire about the influence of party affiliations on forming alliances. Essentially, they seek to understand whether alliances predominantly form among members of the same party or if there is any level of party coordination involved, leading to brokers acting as representatives of a particular party and alliances resulting in votes for the party's politicians. The Brazilian context, as previously noted, provides examples of partisan brokerage as evidenced by various studies (Baião and Couto, 2017; Avelino, Biderman, Barone, 2012; Barone, 2014; Bezerra, 1999; Meireles, 2019).
Contrary to common belief, the comparative literature indicates that this is not a universal norm (Muñoz, 2014; Novaes, 2018). It suggests that alternative types of brokers, devoid of affiliations with political parties, can indeed be identified (Holland and Palmer-Rubin, 2015).
Despite the low levels of party identification and the personalization linked to its open-list proportional representation system, political parties undeniably hold a significant role in the Brazilian electoral process. This is primarily due to the fact that parties serve as the sole avenue for individuals to run for public office and wield control over crucial resources essential for elections, such as funding, political advertising time on television and radio, and various organizational assets. Furthermore, it is logical for research to concentrate on party labels as they represent a readily accessible variable for analysis.
Our findings indicate that political parties may not be the sole factor shaping alliances, and perhaps not even the primary one. Therefore, our research shifts focus from determining the significance of party affiliations to exploring the circumstances under which they are overshadowed by other, more challenging to quantify, factors that influence partner selection and alliance formation. Through in-depth interviews, it became evident that chiefs of staff unanimously emphasized the limited or negligible role of political parties in establishing local alliances. They commonly asserted that representatives form alliances with leaders from various parties, indicating that party affiliation is not the predominant criterion. While one might argue that this observation is influenced by the specific legislators we interviewed (whose votes are concentrated in neighboring municipalities), even in a broader survey involving a more diverse group of legislators, only a minority (14% and 21% of interviewees in 2007 and 2012, respectively) identified party connections as the primary reason for garnering support from mayors and councilors.
We contend that while the party is not the primary factor in structuring brokerage networks, it is a significant element that initiates their formation. Our interviews indicate that political parties can function as veto points, contingent upon the political landscape of the municipality. The level of influence wielded by political groups within the local sphere and the extent of polarization can transform parties into obstacles that impede or thwart collaborations between local politicians and legislators.
Among the interviewees, the selection of brokers appears to adhere to a regional criterion and often unfolds through diverse, informal pathways. For instance, in the context of mayors, alliances can originate from the mayor's proactive outreach to a legislator, where requests are made and partnerships are proposed. This dynamic is particularly evident with "orphan mayors," those lacking a legislator's support either due to a strained relationship or the failure of their preferred candidate to secure election. Interactions between mayors from the same region or neighboring municipalities play a pivotal role: recommendations are exchanged, and information is sought, illustrating a network of mutual support. Some respondents highlighted the practice of vetting new mayors by gathering insights from former allies, underscoring the significance of reputation in alliance formation and hinting at a form of preliminary assessment in the nascent stages of a partnership.
In the realm of politics, we possess a comprehensive understanding of individuals - identifying the most suitable, dedicated, and effective figures, as well as those who may fall short in their duties. However, what happens when a candidate faces defeat or is unable to pursue office? This cycle of assessment and decision-making is perpetual, demanding our immediate attention to engage in substantive work post-election, as emphasized by the Chief of Staff (9).
Our interviews indicate that offices can strategically cater to individuals who have previously voted and demonstrated loyalty, as well as those who have the potential to provide future votes. This forward-thinking approach is often employed by legislators aiming to broaden their influence across different regions. While not a universal practice, a representative might proactively seek to secure a new ally by directing resources to a specific locality without the mayor's solicitation or guarantee of support. Additionally, the chief of staff and other advisors play a crucial role in cultivating new alliances, leveraging their professional networks or personal relationships to connect the representative with mayors and local political factions.
Selecting brokers and maintaining relationships is a multifaceted and ever-evolving process, as indicated by our interviews revealing three distinct dynamics. Firstly, some historical partners exhibit enduring loyalty stemming from past collaborations and personal connections. Despite potential disappointments such as low voter turnout or unmet requests, these partnerships persist. Conversely, short-lived partnerships arise from circumstantial factors like perceived lack of commitment or shifts in local politics, leading to their dissolution. The absence of strong ties beyond the immediate relationship makes it easier for both parties to part ways and seek new allies, with the evaluation of fulfilled requests and votes playing a significant role. Lastly, uncertain partners, such as a mayor or councilor who received benefits but lacks trust, are viewed as unpredictable alliances that advisors often exclude from vote projections. These relationships are considered as potential "extras" that may or may not materialize, adding a layer of uncertainty to the political landscape.
This municipality holds significant importance for our organization. The current mayor, now in her second term, is not entirely aligned with our interests. However, she is poised to endorse a prominent municipal leader from her faction, who holds a special place in the community. Despite not being formally associated with [the legislator's party], she has already pledged her support to this legislator. Our strategic planning for the upcoming year begins a year in advance, acknowledging the potential for shifts during elections while still investing resources in this direction. Despite her existing commitment to another legislator, the mayor, a close friend to both her and our organization, has facilitated access to municipal resources (Councilor 1).
The final statement underscores the uncertain nature of certain alliances and highlights how legislators often engage in risky endeavors, a concept also noted by Bezerra (1999). Our findings indicate that collaborations between representatives and local brokers may encounter adverse selection issues akin to those found in principal-agent dynamics. Factors such as participants' information acquisition, learning processes, and reputation play crucial roles in determining suitable partners (Gingerich, 2020). It is important to note that these risks are not exclusive to those in authoritative positions; local brokers also actively seek partnerships and information to enhance the likelihood of a successful alliance.
Once the broker has been chosen and the connection has been established, how do participants work to maintain it? How do requests and deliveries actually take place? Can state representatives assess the performance of brokers? Does this assessment significantly impact the decision-making process regarding whom to assist and in what manner?
Our interviews indicate that the dynamic between state legislators and mayors does not adhere to a strictly top-down approach where superiors dictate the allocation of benefits. This is due to the significant involvement of local brokers in facilitating this relationship. While there are instances where legislators' offices actively engage in providing benefits, the majority of requests originate from municipalities. These requests are consistently high in volume throughout the year, aligning with findings from Bezerra (1999).
Within the legislators' offices of the interviewees, a predominant focus lies on aiding municipalities, alongside other objectives. Each office exhibits an internal division of labor, striving to strike a balance between the "technical" and "political" aspects of their staff. Referred to as the "political side" by advisors, emphasis is placed on individuals with ties to local communities, connections to mayors, local leaders, and social groups, as well as those who have a longstanding history of service to the legislators, involvement in recent electoral campaigns, and access to Executive agencies. Conversely, the "technical" side values proficiency in office management skills (such as secretariat, communication, legal advising, and legislative processes) and expertise in critical policy areas like health and education.
All interviewees confirmed that the legislator maintains a regional office and/or employs advisors who operate in one or more designated municipalities. The total staff count in these offices typically hovers around 20 individuals, with a smaller subset (ranging from 1 to 4 employees) stationed at the regional office itself. Notably, in a specific instance, nearly half of the personnel (9 individuals) were based in the region and were slated to transition to the newly established office. The primary responsibilities of these regional advisors include identifying local needs, bridging the gap in the legislator's physical presence in the area, presenting the authentic perspective of a citizen, and serving as conduits for communication between the region and the legislator's office, as articulated by Chief of Staff 4.
It is worth noting that only a minority of the staff members were stationed at the ground level, which contrasts with Carvalho's (2003) findings regarding national representatives. This discrepancy could be attributed to the proximity of state assemblies to non-capital municipalities. Additionally, given that a significant portion of local requests pertain to bureaucratic processes involving Executive branch agencies, it appears more practical to allocate the majority of staff to headquarters where they can readily access these administrative structures.
Legislators with a municipalista profile typically adhere to a structured process in addressing the needs of municipalities. This involves receiving requests from mayors, city councilors, and other local leaders, particularly those with prior experience in municipal governance. Subsequently, the legislative office is activated to address these requests within the constraints of available resources and feasible options.
The mayors present their requests to the legislator seeking assistance with challenging projects, and we provide support by assisting them with crafting persuasive arguments. The mayors often struggle with this task, while we, being well-prepared, offer guidance and aid. We receive the necessary documentation, review it, file it appropriately, and then proceed with the necessary steps, as described by Chief of Staff 2.
Both survey waves indicate that a common activity among participants is "dealing with government agencies to fulfill the requests of mayors in their region." Among those who identified mayors or councilors as one of their primary sources of support, 71.7% of respondents in 2007 reported frequently engaging in this activity. This percentage increased in 2012, with 73.3% of surveyed individuals indicating the same.
The interviews provide compelling evidence that legislative offices dedicate significant time, energy, and staff resources to support municipalities and civic organizations, collectively referred to as "entities," in meeting the administrative criteria necessary to access resources from higher levels of government. This underscores the crucial informational function that state legislators' offices fulfill for mayors and local leaders. By engaging in these efforts, legislative offices aim to address the shortcomings of municipalities in terms of personnel and technical knowledge required to navigate intricate legal mandates.
Legislators' offices typically compile spreadsheets that organize budget amendments, detailing requests by category (such as public work, equipment, vehicle purchase, etc.), amount, municipality, and the broker who facilitated and presented the request. Prior to officially assigning an amendment to a specific locality, the office typically reaches out to the requesters to communicate what can feasibly be accommodated. Given the constraints that prevent all requests from being fulfilled, mayors and councilors are tasked with determining their priorities. According to many interviewees, particularly those who view the legislator as a "municipalist," budget amendments are regarded as the most valuable resources by mayors.
The municipal legislator, as a representative, abstains from public confrontation on the state assembly floor and instead advocates for union rights and education. The budget amendments serve as a prominent feature of their work, anticipated by leaders and mayors alike, as highlighted by the Chief of Staff (9).
In both survey waves, the allocation of amendments emerged as the third most valued parliamentary activity, accounting for 16.0% in the initial wave and 18.2% in the subsequent one, trailing behind lawmaking and addressing state issues. While not insignificant, it does not claim the top spot either. These responses could potentially be influenced by social desirability bias. However, it is crucial to recognize that amendments might play a pivotal role in the interactions between legislators and their local representatives, rather than directly impacting their performance as state officials. Additionally, the sample bias towards interviewees with a focus on municipal matters could accentuate the significance of pork barrel politics for these lawmakers.
Interviewees reported a diverse range of sources for requests, with a notable emphasis on those channeled through local brokers, which tend to receive more attention from the office. In terms of requests originating from individuals, groups, and civil organizations facilitated by councilors, one interviewee highlighted the significance of this intermediary role.
The individual directs their request to the councilor, who subsequently forwards the communication to us. Therefore, while the request originates from the person, it is channeled through the councilor. We are inundated with various forms of correspondence, including letters, emails, and messages via WhatsApp. The mayor has provided our WhatsApp contact information, resulting in a continuous stream of messages. Presently, the flow of messages on WhatsApp shows no signs of abating (Chief of Staff 8).
Our interviews indicate a tendency towards reactive behavior among state legislators, mirroring findings by Nichter (2018) on the interaction between politicians and constituents. Nichter suggests that politicians frequently respond to voter demands by addressing their requests. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that representatives can also exhibit proactive tendencies. For instance, one interviewee highlighted the lack of awareness among mayors regarding the various services offered by the state. In such instances, the legislative office plays a crucial role in facilitating the delivery of benefits to the municipality, a phenomenon also underscored by Bezerra (1999, p. 121).
In light of the substantial volume of requests municipalities receive, the question arises: how do these offices determine their priorities? Insights from interviews indicate that legislators weigh two key criteria in this decision-making process: the imperative to support a broad spectrum of local partners and the necessity to allocate resources that are both tangible for the populace and adequate for public projects. Of utmost importance is ensuring that the benefits are impactful and visible, a task that demands a larger resource allocation in bigger cities. As articulated by one interviewee, in larger urban areas, the distribution of resources may become more diffuse, potentially leading to criticism for insufficient allocation.
The majority of interviewees acknowledged a preference for municipalities in which they had achieved notable success, either through garnering a substantial number of votes or emerging as the most voted state representative. Additionally, some interviewees indicated a tendency to prioritize municipalities with high anticipated electoral returns, although they acknowledged that loyalty and other factors could lead to exceptions. One interviewee outlined a methodical approach to handling demands from mayors, stating that she first compiles a comprehensive list before proceeding with further actions.
In conducting the survey, all municipalities with recorded votes were included, irrespective of whether they were in favor of the opposition or the incumbent. Subsequently, the findings were presented to the representative, highlighting the localities where she garnered the highest number of votes, ranking from first to subsequent positions (Chief of Staff 6).
Another approach to addressing the disparity between the volume of requests and the resources at hand is to explore alternative sources of assistance for the municipality. For instance, representatives may contemplate the allocation of resources from organizations like Apaes and Santa Casas, which receive support from multiple representatives. Additionally, they can direct the mayor or other local leaders to seek aid from other legislators, focusing their efforts where the potential for electoral gains is higher and the outcomes are more predictable.
In the assembly, legislators typically serve by region. For instance, if a request comes in from a resident of [municipality], there is a reference book available to identify the appropriate representative for that area. While it is feasible to assist individuals outside our region, the scope of assistance is limited due to the overwhelming demand. The Chief of Staff acknowledges that while some cases have been accommodated, the capacity to handle a broader range of requests is constrained by the sheer volume of inquiries (Chief of Staff 8).
According to the interviewees, state representatives typically engage in collaboration with national representatives, often across party lines but within the same region. This collaborative effort appears to involve a division of labor that benefits all parties involved. The national legislator is able to allocate more substantial financial resources to municipalities through budget amendments, while the state representative maintains closer ties with the region and its constituents, as highlighted in the interviews. One instance from our sample suggested a near amalgamation of the state legislator and her national counterpart's office, particularly as they belonged to the same political party.
The interviewees often minimized the significance of the election period in terms of establishing relationships with local brokers, emphasizing that the groundwork with municipalities, local groups, and voters is a continuous process over time. They viewed elections as a means to publicize actions and channel benefits. However, it is undeniable that the electoral cycle does have an impact on the dynamics of these relationships. For instance, representatives are unable to directly channel amendments to civil organizations during election years. Additionally, an amendment passed in one year may not be implemented until the following year, by which time the author of the amendment or the allied mayor who advocated for it may no longer be in office.
It is essential to differentiate between the mediation dynamics during the election period and the inter-election period. Many studies on brokers (Szwarcberg, 2012; Munoz, 2014; Aspinall, 2014; Gingerich, 2020) primarily concentrate on the electoral phase and extrapolate their conclusions to the entire tenure. Consequently, they often exaggerate elements prevalent during elections while disregarding dynamics that persist beyond this timeframe. While it is logical to assume that politicians gear their actions towards electoral triumph, it is crucial to acknowledge that not all brokerage dynamics can be simplified to campaign logic, and they can embody diverse political implications.
In our analysis, we extended beyond the electoral period, aligning with previous scholars who emphasize the significance of non-electoral responsibilities undertaken by brokers (Auyero, 2000; Zarazaga, 2014; Hoyler, Gelape, and Silotto, 2021). These tasks encompass executing public projects, enacting governmental policies, conveying local needs to the state administration, and addressing both individual and communal issues of voters. Essentially, brokers contribute to shaping political results beyond mere electoral votes.
The examination of these brokerage relationships does not strongly support a key premise of principal-agent models: the presence of informational asymmetry in favor of the agent. Numerous studies on brokers suggest that brokers possess privileged information compared to principals and tactically leverage this advantage to secure additional resources (Stokes et al., 2013; Camp, Dixit, and Stokes, 2014; Keefer and Vlaicu, 2007; Novaes, 2018).
Mayors and councilors are crucial in providing valuable information to state legislators, as indicated by our interviews. It appears that representatives make resource allocations in response to requests from municipalities and engage with mayors and councilors during budget negotiations. Legislators depend on these intermediaries to understand the preferences of the local community and tailor resource distribution accordingly. The absence of such support from brokers would likely impede legislators in effectively representing their constituents and shaping public policies.
Legislators play a crucial role as informational actors for local brokers, offering expertise and exclusive access to state executive agencies that many municipal leaders lack. This mutual dependence on valuable information shapes the dynamics of their interactions. This perspective aligns with the extensive research by Brierley and Nathan (2021) on brokers in Ghana, which challenges the traditional "information asymmetry model." Their study revealed that brokers' selection hinges more on their connections with party elites than on their ties to ordinary voters or detailed voter information. Brokers with strong upward ties possess greater knowledge and access to government resources essential for voters, highlighting the significance of personal connections in this context.
The existing literature on electoral mobilization through brokers underscores the diverse indicators and metrics utilized by voters, candidates, politicians, and brokers to evaluate and oversee participants' conduct within mediation dynamics. While the literature and the preceding section suggest that collaborations between local leaders and state representatives can be mutually advantageous, analyses rooted in principal-agent theories stress the significance of monitoring brokers and offering them private incentives (Camp, 2015) to mitigate agency risks. These analyses necessitate ensuring that parties can gauge the value of sustaining or terminating relationships and determining the appropriate allocation of energy, time, and resources. In our context, how do state representatives assess the outcomes of their partnerships with local leaders and the potential electoral gains?
While the interviewees acknowledge the significance of these alliances, they often depict them as precarious and prone to numerous letdowns. They note that it is typical for mayors to provide significantly fewer votes than initially pledged or anticipated by the legislator. Despite these occurrences, the alliance is not automatically severed or destabilized; instead, factors like loyalty, the strength of the bond, and past collaborative efforts are crucial in rebuilding trust and sustaining the partnership.
The literature has extensively documented the uncertain nature of such partnerships in Brazil and other contexts (Bezerra, 1999; Aspinall, 2014; Novaes, 2018). However, in contrast to existing evidence, our interviewees less frequently conveyed feelings of disappointment towards mayors or other local intermediaries in terms of betrayal or opportunistic and predatory actions. When probed on these issues, interviewees demonstrated empathy towards the challenges faced by mayors.
Some mayors attribute the eventual switch of sides to changes in local politics' dynamics or shifts in parties' electoral strategy. In terms of exclusivity, our interviews unveiled divergent perspectives. One interviewee argues that it is most suitable for mayors to maintain loyalty to a single state legislator. Conversely, others acknowledge that diversification is a viable option, particularly when the allied legislator opposes the state governor and has limited access to resources - a parallel dynamic highlighted by Bezerra (1999).
Efforts to monitor the behavior of local brokers involve systematic procedures, including the use of spreadsheets containing information about them, the number of votes they deliver, and expectations for the upcoming election. With the exception of one, all legislators' offices maintained some form of this spreadsheet, reflecting the notion that politicians leverage election cycles to assess brokers' capabilities (Gingerich, 2020). However, our interviews unveiled additional informal monitoring methods, centered around collecting information on brokers' activities, past and present, while considering their capacity to achieve certain goals.
Communication among office staff plays a crucial role in providing valuable information to state representatives. For instance, advisors can learn about allied or soliciting mayors who have been seeking assistance and promising support in various offices. The legislator's local connections and visits to municipalities are also significant in gauging the level of effort mayors are putting into mobilizing voters during campaigns. Furthermore, invitations from mayors to attend public works inaugurations and other events serve as indicators of their commitment to promoting the representative in their city. Consequently, monitoring occurs through diverse strategies that help differentiate between brokers, enabling the calibration of resource allocation to different localities. Building on previous research (Szwarcberg, 2015; Gingerich, 2020), our findings underscore the importance of learning in the identification of brokers and the continual adjustment of expectations regarding their roles.
Samuels (2002) highlighted the potential issue of credit capture by mayors tasked with implementing amendments aimed at municipalities in partnerships with representatives. To mitigate this concern, representatives could consider prioritizing amendments for municipalities governed by members of the same political party (Baião and Couto, 2017) or establishing alternative direct communication channels with the public.
Our interviews indicate that representatives may not rely as heavily on mayors to take credit for benefits as previously believed in the literature. Firstly, credit claiming can also be facilitated through a city councilor, former mayor, or another local supporter (someone from their "political group"). Secondly, legislators' offices actively work to increase visibility of their actions, leaving mayors with limited space for credit capture. Additionally, interviewees highlighted that the increasing use of social media provides voters with more opportunities to access information independently and allows representatives to communicate directly with them, diminishing the significance of mayors in this aspect.
The interviewee highlighted the diminished significance of mayoral support in her election, attributing this to social media's tendency to overshadow mayors as conduits of information. Furthermore, when addressing the scenario of a mayor failing to acknowledge a representative's efforts or attempting to undermine her credibility, the interviewee expressed concerns regarding potential dishonesty or lack of recognition.
According to the Chief of Staff, if the mayor were to visit the municipality, approximately 400 individuals who are connected to their networks would quickly become aware of any misinformation spread by the mayor. This would swiftly escalate into a significant issue for the mayor within a mere two hours. Consequently, the Chief of Staff asserts that the mayor is not naive enough to engage in such deceptive actions.
Elections have emerged as the primary catalyst for explaining discontinuities within political alliances. The defeat of elected officials, whether at the legislative, mayoral, or city council level, often marks the end of existing alliances and creates opportunities for new partnerships among those who remain in office. It is evident that, aside from electoral outcomes, state representatives seldom explicitly terminate relationships with their brokers. While they may not exert as much effort to support a mayor or councilor who underperformed in terms of delivering votes, they typically explore alternative compensation strategies. Instances of relationship terminations appear to originate from mayors, who begin to explore new partnerships with other legislators in pursuit of enhanced financial resources and benefits for their constituencies, a trend also noted by Bezerra (1999).
If local brokers, particularly mayors, indeed wield significant influence over a legislator's electoral fortunes, one would logically assume that they would also bear some responsibility for electoral defeats. In our study, two interviewees had worked with representatives who failed to secure reelection. When probed about the reasons behind these defeats, while expressing disappointment in the mayors' performance in electoral brokerage, these interviewees tended to assign greater weight to other contributing factors. Specifically, they highlighted the challenges faced by the office in effectively engaging with voters through modern communication channels like social media. This suggests a growing recognition of the necessity for representatives to reduce their reliance on intermediaries in order to receive due credit for their actions.
The evidence presented in this section indicates that principal-agent theories fall short in capturing the complex relationship dynamics between state representatives and their local brokers. The risks inherent in these relationships do not stem from a fundamental conflict of interests or from information asymmetry favoring the agents. Our data reveals a significant alignment in the objectives of local brokers and representatives, primarily focused on securing electoral success by providing resources and benefits valued by the local populace and fulfilling private requests. Furthermore, if politicians select brokers based on their connections to party elites, as highlighted by Brierley and Nathan (2021) and supported by our findings, the likelihood of defection and opportunistic behavior is reduced. However, participants in these relationships often assume dual roles, leading to challenges related to commitment and information asymmetry. While both parties have exit options (Novaes, 2018), practical barriers may hinder this course of action. Ideally, legislators should expand their local networks by incorporating mayors and councilors continuously, while mayors should seek more advantageous partnerships. Nonetheless, this expansion comes with associated costs, at times prohibitive, as underscored by Hicken and Nathan (2020) and corroborated by our interviews. These factors contribute to the maintenance of aligned goals among these actors.
In the realm of assessing broker performance, challenges arise as actors may not consistently deliver the anticipated outcomes to their allies. Interviewees posit that local brokers often fall short of expectations due to external factors like political force reorganizations, party directives influencing their choices, and power shifts resulting from elections at state and municipal levels. Consequently, there is a tendency among interviewees to recognize the constructive contributions of local allies rather than assigning blame for unfavorable outcomes. This suggests a departure from theoretical assumptions, indicating that principals may not always effectively penalize or issue credible threats to ensure commitment.
In a context of intense electoral competition, such as the Brazilian political landscape, the significance of loyalty appears to escalate, particularly when disloyalty is not met with exemplary punishment. This heightened value of loyalty can be attributed to the sense of predictability it offers to legislators regarding their "secure" electoral support base. However, this does not imply that investing in brokers is an irrational choice from the representatives' perspective. As suggested by Hicken and Nathan (2020), this inclination may stem from legislators' recognition that, despite the associated risks and the challenges of effectively penalizing brokers, they rely on these intermediaries to cultivate their reputation within municipalities. Moreover, the pervasive expectations of voters may drive representatives to foster ties with brokers out of fear that failing to do so could result in their rivals seizing their position. In addressing informational asymmetry, principals may devise strategies to diminish their reliance on local brokers. One such approach involves establishing direct lines of communication with their constituents and seeking independent information from alternative sources.
Our empirical findings and their interpretation are grounded in the institutional design established in Brazil in 1988, which delineates the distribution of power, resources, and authority both horizontally and vertically among the branches and entities of the federation. Numerous studies have underscored the intricate system of crossed responsibilities within Brazilian institutions, characterized by various asymmetries, a blend of autonomy and dependency, and concurrent incentives for cooperation and competition. This complexity is evident in the career incentives for politicians, who may not necessarily prioritize national careers (Samuels, 2003; Santos; Pegurier, 2011), as well as in the diverse ways politicians at different levels interconnect, coordinate, and collaborate to address issues, implement policies, and pursue electoral objectives. These relationships cannot be strictly classified as horizontal, yet they also do not conform to rigid hierarchies.
This research article delves into the dynamics of the relationships between state legislators and local brokers. It delves into the significance and functions of local brokers for state representatives, exploring how these partnerships are established, maintained, and sometimes dissolved. The analysis draws from survey data collected from state representatives and in-depth interviews conducted with advisors in state assemblies.
We present evidence indicating that mayors and local councilors serve as crucial intermediaries for certain state representatives, with regional connections and personal relationships playing significant roles in alliance formation. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that lawmakers actively support these alliances by addressing the needs of local intermediaries, intervening in bureaucratic issues, and allocating public funds to local governments. Despite efforts by legislators to oversee the conduct of these intermediaries, there are limitations to their ability or willingness to enforce consequences for any misconduct.
The conclusions drawn from the Brazilian case study could hold significance for various other contexts. This includes decentralized countries where municipalities possess political autonomy, hold responsibilities in crucial policy domains, and where local politicians wield substantial influence within the political framework. Additionally, these findings may be applicable to countries where municipal elections are conducted independently from elections at other governmental levels. Furthermore, the insights gained from the Brazilian scenario could be valuable in settings characterized by a weakly institutionalized party system, where alternative factors play a pivotal role in shaping multilevel alliances.
Our findings raise doubts about the suitability of a pure principal-agent model for analyzing the interactions between legislators and local brokers in Brazil. Additionally, we propose four avenues for further research that could enhance our comprehension of dimensions that have been overlooked in existing literature on this subject.
In line with research conducted in Brazil and comparative literature, our findings suggest that cooperation between state representatives and local brokers can be mutually beneficial, despite the associated risks. We argue against viewing these risks as typical dilemmas within principal-agent models. Our study does not support the notion of an inherent conflict of interests between participants, particularly when dealing with brokers who have held elective office. While acknowledging information asymmetry, we note that this does not always favor agents or brokers. Therefore, lacking evidence to uphold the foundational assumptions of these theories, we emphasize their limitations in describing and analyzing the relationships under scrutiny. Consequently, we propose that principal-agent theories should not be the primary analytical framework for understanding these relationships but can serve as a heuristic tool. This approach allows for a more flexible interpretation, recognizing that actors are engaged in multiple relationships concurrently, across various levels and timeframes. It is crucial to acknowledge that these relationships unfold within diverse contexts that influence levels of uncertainty, information disparity, interdependence among participants, and the alignment of interests and objectives. Hence, what are typically considered universal assumptions should be treated as variables, given that the dynamics of these relationships may vary based on factors such as municipality size, proximity to elections, electoral competition intensity, party system institutionalization levels, and the potential scope of brokerage networks.
The importance placed on brokers who hold elective office, in contrast to other representatives' local supporters, underscores the necessity of gaining a deeper understanding of this specific type of broker and their contributions to the relationship. Elected officials such as mayors and councilors are subject to supervision and oversight by their constituents at times, while also assuming the role of decision-makers who seek resources like pork barrel budget amendments and electoral backing. This differs from the typical rewards associated with brokers as outlined in existing literature. Despite acknowledging the diverse array of broker types (Aspinall, 2014; Holland & Palmer-Rubin, 2015; Mares & Young, 2016), there is a tendency to overlook the distinction between elected and non-elected brokers. It is hypothesized that this differentiation likely results in varying relationship dynamics with constituents. To elucidate these distinctions, further research focusing on brokers themselves is warranted.
Another crucial aspect to consider is the necessity of enhancing the comprehension of brokerage dynamics by distinguishing between the electoral campaign period and the post-election phase. This distinction is often neglected in existing literature, which tends to formulate its theories regarding brokers based on observations during campaign activities, thereby overemphasizing the electoral aspects of these dynamics. Our research revealed that interviewees frequently minimized the significance of the election period to assert their contributions, indicating that this is an ongoing and enduring process. While some studies have acknowledged the role of brokers beyond elections in facilitating various political outcomes such as the implementation of public works and social policies (Auyero, 2000; Zarazaga, 2014; Hoyler, Gelape, and Silotto, 2021), further investigation is required to clarify the disparities and interconnections between these distinct phases.
One analytical task involves examining the distinctions that define the interactions of local brokers with state or national representatives. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed significant parallels with findings reported by Bezerra (1999) in a study conducted two decades ago. Subsequent research should delve into the underlying reasons for these similarities, particularly considering the variations in responsibilities and powers between national and state legislators. These similarities could stem from shared incentives among national and state representatives operating under the same regulations and competing in the same electoral constituency. However, we also noted disparities, such as the greater resource allocation available to national legislators for aiding their allies and the closer proximity state legislators maintain with their constituents. Consequently, it is reasonable to anticipate a division of responsibilities among legislators, with local brokers determining whom to approach based on the specific issue or requirement at hand.
The final line of inquiry pertains to the significance of additional factors in the selection of brokers beyond political affiliations. Existing literature in Brazil predominantly focuses on the examination of party brokers, a topic underscored by the findings of our survey. Nevertheless, our research has unearthed indications that alternative selection mechanisms, like personal and regional connections, hold significance despite being relatively underexplored, likely owing to the challenges in operationalizing these variables. To enhance comprehension of multi-level support networks and enhance current theoretical frameworks, delving into these other factors is imperative.
Our research findings offer significant analytical implications for investigating the mediation dynamics among political actors across various levels. They point towards promising research avenues, including the utilization of innovative network analysis in research designs, leveraging social media for the identification and analysis of multilevel alliances, conducting longitudinal analyses to gauge factors related to stability and discontinuities, and employing qualitative research techniques to delve into the mechanisms underpinning these relationships. We emphasize the importance of employing comparative (cross-country or subnational) and multi-method research designs as crucial tools to enhance the inferential potential of analyses in this domain. While some of the questions we pose stem from interviews conducted in a single state and with a specific legislator profile, integrating additional quantitative and qualitative evidence through comparative research designs would enable us to further explore the research avenues outlined earlier.
