Environmental issues have gained significant traction in recent years, with the impacts of climate change already being felt globally. As the environment deteriorates, human activities further exacerbate this process, creating a vicious cycle that could accelerate climate change. The healthcare sector, among other industries, plays a crucial role in this dynamic, given its substantial environmental footprint stemming from resource consumption, water and energy usage, and the generation of vast amounts of waste worldwide, all contributing to elevated levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Particularly noteworthy is the continuous operation of healthcare facilities to meet the medical needs of populations, necessitating round-the-clock energy consumption. Despite this, the implementation of sustainable practices in healthcare remains limited, often perceived as costly and ineffective. This raises ethical considerations, as the principles of corporate social responsibility and accountability come into play when deciding on investments in eco-friendly infrastructure. Balancing efficiency and financial management becomes pivotal in minimizing operational costs while ensuring optimal patient care. This study delves into the rationale for adopting green initiatives, assessing the current state of environmental sustainability in healthcare, and examining ethical dilemmas that arise in healthcare management, offering insights on how these considerations can drive policy changes.
Since the turn of the century, environmental concerns have garnered increased attention, emphasizing our influence on the environment and its repercussions for current and future generations. In 2015, the United Nations established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of seventeen objectives to be accomplished by 2030, encompassing various targets related to environmental sustainability, urban development (SDG11), and climate change mitigation (SDG13) (United Nations General Assembly, 2015).
Climate change encompasses prolonged alterations in environmental conditions and patterns, resulting in the occurrence of severe weather phenomena. These shifts can subsequently contribute to changes in health risks for individuals, exacerbating pre-existing health conditions. The impacts of climate change are significant contributors to widespread public health challenges. Conversely, health institutions also play a role in perpetuating this cycle by exacerbating environmental problems through their operations, accounting for approximately 8% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States (Eckelman and Sherman, 2016).
Recent years have seen a growing recognition of ethical concerns surrounding the health sector's impact on the environment, as highlighted by Paraizo and Begin (2020) and Lenzen et al. (2020) who have demonstrated the significant environmental footprint of global healthcare. The discourse on the advantages of implementing eco-friendly measures has gained traction, emphasizing the importance of institutional accountability, leadership, community education, and cost savings (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2007). Various policy proposals have been suggested to regulate energy usage in buildings, as noted by the UN Environment and International Energy Agency in 2017. These initiatives have only been feasible due to thoughtful deliberations on the ethical dimensions of healthcare practices across different sectors. To effectively address these challenges, it is imperative to adopt sustainable practices within the healthcare industry, implement environmental measures in health institutions, and promote green financing and investments that target the root causes of environmental degradation. These proactive steps are crucial in breaking the existing cycle of environmental harm.
Health institutions are considered open systems that engage in material exchanges with the environment. While the environment can have a detrimental effect on health, as highlighted by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (2007), it is important to recognize that health organizations also play a role in impacting the environment. This reciprocal relationship can lead to a cycle of negative health consequences, as emphasized by Skolnik (2020).
According to a report by the United Nations on buildings and the construction sector, it is stated that they account for approximately 35% of the global energy consumption and contribute to nearly 40% of energy-related CO2 emissions, thus playing a significant role in sustainable transformation (UN Environment and International Energy Agency, 2017; Khasreen et al., 2009).
According to a report published in 1995, the health sector ranks third in terms of consumption, following closely behind the food sales and services sectors. The health sector's consumption is approximately double that of the average consumption across all sectors. This information was highlighted in a report by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies in 2007.
The consumption of energy in hospitals has been steadily increasing, with hospitals in the United States consuming an average of 738.5 kWh/m2, which is 2.6 times higher than other commercial buildings (Bawaneh et al., 2019). This high consumption accounts for 8% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the country, as illustrated in Figure 2 (Chung and Meltzer, 2009). Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service consumed energy equivalent to 21.3 million metric tons of CO2 in 2007, contributing to around 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions in England (Brown et al., 2012). In Brazil, hospitals contribute significantly to energy consumption, accounting for 10.6% of the total energy used for commercial purposes (Dhillon and Kaur, 2015).
Common energy wastage practices in these sectors encompass the unnecessary use of air conditioning in unoccupied spaces, the failure to maintain or repair equipment, and the oversight of checking for air or water leaks, all of which contribute to heightened inefficiency and increased costs for institutions (Kaplan et al., 2012). Moreover, buildings consume a significant amount of water over their life cycle, alongside the energy required for supply and use, a trend that has escalated in recent decades (Rothausen and Conway), resulting in amplified emissions and subsequently, a more pronounced negative environmental impact (Mannan and Al-Ghamdi, 2020). Within the healthcare sector, the most conspicuous impact of its operations pertains to downstream products, specifically the waste generated (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2007). Notably, at the hospital level, a study highlights the United States' resource utilization, which culminates in the daily production of approximately 7000 tons of hospital waste and an annual management cost of around 10 billion dollars (Senay and Landrigan, 2018). Furthermore, it is noted that in this nation, 85% of the waste generated in a typical hospital is non-hazardous (belonging to groups I and II), often erroneously disposed of in the biological waste container, thereby inflating waste management expenses and exacerbating the environmental impact due to inadequate waste treatment (Kaplan et al., 2012).
A 2013 study conducted in the United States examined the environmental impact of health care activities, highlighting hospitals as the primary contributor, accounting for 31â€“37% of the total impact. Prescription drug expenditures were identified as the leading cause of ozone depletion at 33%, followed by medical devices at 22%, and hospital care at 15%. The study further indicated that power generation and the supply chain of health care facilities were the main processes contributing to acidification, while surgical and medical instrument manufacturing, as well as pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing, were significant contributors to ozone depletion. Waste management emerged as the most significant contributor to ecotoxicity and human health toxicity, underscoring the complex interplay between health care activities and environmental consequences (Eckelman and Sherman, 2016).
In a separate study, the global environmental footprint of healthcare in 2015 was assessed, as depicted in Figure 3. The evaluation involved categorizing the impacts into direct (lightest shade), first-order (middle shade), and supply-chain (darkest shade) impacts. These impacts were attributed to healthcare directly, its immediate suppliers, and the remaining chain, respectively. The percentage of total impact attributed to healthcare was illustrated for both the world (segments) and selected countries (spokes). In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, healthcare was found to contribute approximately 4.4%, while it accounted for 2.8% of particulate matter emissions, 3.4% of NOx emissions, and 3.6% of SO2 emissions (Lenzen et al., 2020).
Ethical dilemmas frequently surface in clinical environments, constituting a significant area of study in medical institutions globally (Shamim et al., 2020). Yet, an often overlooked aspect within this domain is organizational ethics, a branch of applied ethics that centers on the healthcare setting, resource distribution, and the decision-making mechanisms inherent to the organization (Paraizo and Begin, 2020).
Various challenges arise in organizational ethics, with professionals typically prioritizing cost management, efficiency, quality of care, and the impact of their decisions on patient well-being (Castlen et al., 2017).
Sustainability issues pertaining to buildings have been extensively discussed in the literature on this subject. A significant portion of the discourse at the close of the 20th century revolves around the longevity of buildings. Many health facilities constructed in the 1950s, and even more recent ones, are now deemed outdated, non-functional, and financially burdensome to both build and maintain. Such short-sighted decisions result in escalating costs and avoidable problems. The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (2007) highlights the repercussions of such choices. Consequently, there is a pressing necessity to approach the design of health facilities in a pragmatic, ethical, and comprehensive manner. This approach not only impacts the health environment but also potentially enhances the productivity of workers, as emphasized by the World Green Building Council in 2014.
Recent research has highlighted organizational vulnerabilities that can compromise the effectiveness of institutions, particularly in areas such as public money management and risk analysis in healthcare administration. These vulnerabilities can lead to ethical risks, impacting the quality of care provided and the allocation of financial resources. Understanding and addressing these issues is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of healthcare institutions and should be a key factor in decision-making processes. (Paraizo and Begin, 2020; Sepetis, 2020)
The Universal Declaration of Bioethics and Human Rights, specifically in Article 14, emphasizes "social responsibility and health" as a fundamental principle of bioethics (UNESCO, 2005). This inclusive perspective expands the domain of bioethics to encompass broader societal issues, health determinants, and health policy considerations (Vivanco, 2018), thereby incorporating elements of justice and equity into these discussions (Jennings et al., 2016). Consequently, healthcare is viewed as a governmental obligation towards their populace, focusing on four key areas: medical care, research, industry, and education (UNESCO, 2018).
The UNESCO report on social responsibility and health outlines specific actions that pertain to decision-making criteria in health policies and efforts to address environmental degradation and pandemic control. Neglecting to implement measures for mitigating and adapting to challenges like climate change would contravene the fundamental tenet of social responsibility as articulated in the report. (UNESCO, 2018; Vivanco, 2018)
Despite acknowledging environmental issues and natural disasters as components of social responsibilities within bioethics, UNESCO falls short in addressing the root cause of these issues - the necessity to proactively address them by promoting green practices and implementing sustainable measures before they escalate. These proactive changes could be facilitated through the establishment of public policies (Watts et al., 2015), revisions in regulations and protocols governing healthcare institutions' operations (Kallio et al., 2018), and the provision of green financing options (OECD, 2016).
Ethical considerations concerning the environment have been a subject of discussion among ethicists, often treated separately from health-related issues. This separation stems from the primary focus of environmental ethics on the environment itself and the intrinsic value attributed to non-human nature, leading to a distinct treatment of these matters from those concerning human health ethics (Jennings et al., 2016). One approach to bridging this gap involves viewing the environment through its instrumental value, recognizing its potential to positively impact population health through factors such as climate, food sources, and the aesthetic appeal of green spaces, thereby positioning the environment as a provider of ecosystem services (Jax et al., 2013). However, this perspective has faced criticism for reducing nature to a mere resource for human needs, neglecting its inherent value (Jennings et al., 2016). On the other hand, environmental ethics highlights the detrimental impact of healthcare practices on the environment, a concern that has prompted hospitals to adopt more sustainable management practices, acknowledging the interconnectedness of human health and environmental well-being (Jameton and Pierce, 2001).
Frameworks in environmental health ethics have emerged as a crucial component of public health, with a particular focus on climate change and its implications for human health. While there is significant attention given to the political and economic aspects of funding research on climate change, there is a notable absence in discussing the role of healthcare institutions in combating global warming. Instead, the discourse primarily centers around industries directly impacting the environment, such as those associated with fossil fuels. Nevertheless, these frameworks encompass key principles like utility, justice, stewardship, sustainability, and precaution, which inherently involve the participation of health institutions in the battle against climate change.
Ethical dilemmas surface during decision-making processes, particularly when considering the environmental ramifications of healthcare and the imperative for sustainability within healthcare institutions, prompting ethical inquiries into environmental stewardship (Jameton & Pierce, 2001). This extends beyond bioethics and social responsibility to encompass organizational and environmental health ethics.
The primary environmental responsibility in hospital care revolves around minimizing unnecessary emissions, a task guided by both the management body and ethical values. These values encompass social responsibility, quality care, and professionalism (Kallio et al., 2018), collectively serving as catalysts for the transformation and enhancement of environmental practices within healthcare institutions.
Organizational commitment from both management and staff is crucial for the successful implementation of environmental initiatives within healthcare organizations (Pisters et al., 2017; Kallio et al., 2018). However, mere commitment is not enough. To truly support these initiatives, healthcare organizations must also invest in education and training, establish clear procedures, define roles, foster a motivational culture, and ensure that their facilities are equipped to implement green measures effectively (Kallio et al., 2018).
The 2017 United Nations report outlines a series of objectives aimed at promoting the environmental sustainability of buildings. These objectives encompass various aspects such as planning policies, building adaptation, and energy management.
Various measures have been proposed to enhance sustainability, including leveraging technology to boost productivity, harnessing solar energy for heating, cooling, and water transportation, and implementing efficient lighting solutions like light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs (UN Environment and International Energy Agency, 2017; Dhillon and Kaur, 2015). Notably, nations like Canada, China, and Rwanda have already enacted regulations stipulating minimum standards for energy efficiency and resource conservation in constructions, yet approximately two-thirds of countries globally lack such mandates (UN Environment and International Energy Agency, 2017).
In order to implement these measures effectively, there needs to be a significant investment in energy efficiency, which currently constitutes a small fraction of the overall investment at the management level. Despite this, the European Union has put forth numerous projects and funding initiatives in recent years to work towards the objective of achieving carbon neutrality (European Commission, 2020). In the realm of health institutions, concerted efforts have been directed towards investing in them, particularly focusing on hospitals, with the goal of transitioning them into environmentally sustainable entities known as green hospitals. Green buildings, including these hospitals, aim to mitigate their environmental impact by reducing energy and water consumption and minimizing environmental harm during the construction phase (Allen et al., 2015).
Various measures have been discussed in prior research (Buffoli et al., 2014; McGain and Naylor, 2014). One study showcases the cost-effectiveness of implementing these measures by incorporating energy-saving strategies and reprocessing single-use materials, resulting in a substantial cost reduction of approximately ten billion dollars over a decade (Kaplan et al., 2012). Additionally, another study evaluates different initiatives and measures that enhance an institution's resilience to climate change, illustrating their long-term cost-effectiveness (Balbus et al., 2016). Pisters et al. emphasize the significance of organizational commitment and the reduction of energy consumption as crucial elements for the institution's success (Pisters et al., 2017).
A significant measure implemented in recent years is digitalization. Despite the energy required for this process, it enables energy savings through smart controls and connected devices, potentially saving approximately 230 EJ by 2040 and around 140 EJ in non-residential facilities (UN Environment and International Energy Agency, 2017). These initiatives collectively contribute to the development of more sustainable healthcare institutions by reducing resource consumption, enhancing operational efficiency, and ultimately lowering greenhouse gas emissions, thereby mitigating their environmental impact.
The Green Guide for Health Care, developed by Health Care Without Harm, serves as a comprehensive toolkit offering guidance on the necessary steps for implementing environmental measures in healthcare settings. This guide incorporates various strategies rooted in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and Triple Bottom Line (TBL) principles. It has been widely utilized in the construction and renovation of numerous healthcare facilities, as highlighted by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies in 2007.
The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO, 2013) has developed a Green Checklist and Discussion Guide inspired by the LEED rating system. These tools are designed to assist institutions in analyzing and preparing for the implementation of environmentally friendly measures.
Another valuable resource is the Green Hospital Procurement Policy and Procedure Manual, and Implementation Guide (Canadian Coalition For Green Health Care, 2016) established by the Canadian Coalition for Green Health Care. Additionally, the Green Purchasing in Health Care guide developed by Health Care Without Harm (Health Care Without Harm, 2006) aids institutions in implementing environmentally-friendly purchasing practices. These resources emphasize the importance of considering a life cycle perspective, resource efficiency, and pollution prevention in procurement decisions within healthcare settings.
The healthcare sector bears an ethical obligation to assess its influence through substantive research and adopt sustainable practices that minimize harm to the environment, thereby reducing its long-term footprint and promoting greater sustainability in its operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced waste production, leading to a rise in single-use materials and exacerbating waste management challenges. Consequently, the post-pandemic era necessitates a concerted effort towards sustainable recovery, emphasizing the implementation of eco-friendly practices and the reinforcement of healthcare system resilience. Nevertheless, the responsibility for green financing does not solely rest on healthcare institutions; ethical considerations and corporate social responsibility are equally pertinent in various private and public sectors. This multifaceted role is crucial, particularly given the imperative for healthcare institutions to maintain uninterrupted operations in order to deliver essential care to communities.
The imperative for investing in environmentally sustainable solutions is pressing, as a collective shift across all sectors holds the potential for a more robust and enduring positive influence on the environment, thereby mitigating the repercussions of climate change.
