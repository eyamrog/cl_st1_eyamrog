Numerous established commercial pharmaceuticals have been utilized in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, albeit in a haphazard and experimental manner, as this application is solely grounded on knowledge derived from in vitro cell cultures. However, it is widely acknowledged that this approach lacks correlation with in vivo assays conducted in animals or clinical trials in humans. Leveraging insights from treatments administered during previous pandemic infections caused by viruses like MERS and SARS emerges as a compelling strategy for identifying potential candidates to combat SARS-CoV-2. The mechanistic underpinnings of virus infections and antiviral mechanisms were scrutinized in this study under the premise that these commercial pharmaceuticals possess the capability to eradicate the virus. The study also delved into perspectives on these methodologies, ongoing clinical trials, and those that have been completed.
The extensive array of clinical trials conducted to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 underscores the essential role and capability of the scientific community in producing rigorous evidence, even amidst the challenges posed by the pandemic. Regrettably, the treatments implemented thus far have not demonstrated optimal efficacy (Sander et al., 2020).
Innate immunity relies significantly on the function of inflammatory caspases, which play a crucial role in replicating cytosolic signals and triggering dual responses (Jorgensen and Miao, 2015). One key strategy to combat viruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2, involves targeting pyroptosis, a process initiated by caspase-1 that leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-18 (IL-18) and IL-1β. Caspase-11 or caspase-1 can also induce a form of lytic, programmed cell death. Pyroptosis effectively eliminates intracellular pathogens, such as bacteria or viruses, by disrupting their replication sites, rendering them vulnerable to phagocytosis and subsequent destruction by phagocytes. However, excessive systemic activation of pyroptosis can result in sepsis in certain instances. Notably, inflammasomes play a critical role in recognizing viral infections, with pathogens evolving mechanisms to evade or inhibit pyroptosis (Durán and Fávaro, 2020a). These insights extend beyond viral infections to encompass various diseases, including cancer (Durán and Fávaro, 2020b), cardiovascular diseases (Zeng et al., 2019), and others (Ma et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2020). Another promising target for combating SARS-CoV-2 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), given the virus's reliance on this enzyme for replication. SARS-CoV-2, being an RNA virus, utilizes a multi-subunit replication and transcription complex of viral proteins facilitated by RdRp (Ziebuhr, 2005).
In the context of combating SARS-CoV-2, various targets can be considered, such as inhibiting the host target TMPRSS2 (ACE2 receptor). However, this study focuses on three crucial targets - pyroptosis, RNA-dependent polymerase, and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of viral proteins - which are closely linked to the pharmaceutical interventions currently in use.
In a recent study by Zhao and Zhao (2020), the investigation focused on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including LRR, PYD, and NACHT domains. These PRRs form the protein-3 inflammasome, a complex comprising the NOD-like receptor protein-3 (NLRP3), which consists of the NOD domain (nucleotide-binding oligomerization) NOD-like receptor NLRP3, acting as the transcription factor for apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and caspase-1. This complex plays a critical role in the host's defense against microbes by inducing the release of IL-1β and IL-18 and triggering pyroptosis. NLRP3 is capable of recognizing a wide range of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) produced during viral replication, leading to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, crucial for antiviral immune responses and viral clearance. However, some viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade the immune system's attack on the NLRP3 inflammasome, as noted by Sollberger et al. (2014). These viruses can inhibit the stimulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome to evade innate immunity and promote viral replication, either by directly or indirectly suppressing its activation or regulation.
Influenza virus NS1, paramyxovirus V, and measles virus have been shown to inhibit the induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome and reduce the release of IL-1β. This interaction between viral proteins and NLRP3 prevents self-oligomerization and the recruitment of ASC, ultimately leading to the inhibition of inflammasome activation (Zhao and Zhao, 2020). In a study by Yang et al. (2020), the history and epidemiology of SARS were investigated, with a focus on various aspects including pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and guidance for individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.
During the initial stage of coronavirus infection, epithelial and dendritic cells become activated, releasing a variety of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukins (IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferons (IFN-α/β), C-C motif chemokines, and IP-10. These immune factors are regulated by the immune system, but an excessive production of these molecules can hasten disease progression. Notably, interleukin IL-10, produced by T-helper-2 (Th2) cells, exhibits antiviral properties; however, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to significantly inhibit its activity (Zhang et al., 2020a).
Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit elevated serum IL-1β levels (Huang et al., 2020), a significant indicator of cell pyroptosis. This observation suggests that the induction of cell pyroptosis plays a role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
It is widely recognized that both non-classical and classical pyroptotic pathways can induce the release of IL-1β, a phenomenon that warrants deeper exploration in patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia. Additionally, pneumonia patients commonly exhibit leucopenia and lymphopenia, with a predominant presence of lymphopenia in most individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. This observation suggests a potential vulnerability of lymphocytes to pyroptotic cell death during the course of infection.
Chen et al. (2020a) observed a consistent pattern in patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia, noting that nearly all deceased patients exhibited lymphopenia (Durán and Favaro, 2020a; and references therein). In contrast, Chang et al. (2020) found that all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients they assessed had recovered, showing only slightly elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as lymphocyte counts; these findings were corroborated by Lipi and Plebani (2020) and Henry et al. (2020). Furthermore, current evidence suggests that the immunomodulatory effects of SARS-CoV-2 may trigger cell pyroptosis, particularly in lymphocytes, through the induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The signaling cascade involving NLRP3, IL-18, IL-1β, and gasdermin D was proposed by Yang (2020) and Yang et al. (2020a).
A comprehensive review of studies elucidated the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, detailing the intricate interplay between the virus and the immune system, and highlighting the role of dysfunctional immune responses in the progression of infection. Drawing from existing literature on coronavirus infections, the authors of this study underscored the significance of these insights in the development of therapeutic interventions aimed at targeting viral replication and modulating immune responses (Tay et al., 2020).
Numerous immunosuppressive therapies aimed at limiting immune-mediated damage in COVID-19 patients are currently at various stages of development. Trials involving corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, are underway, despite not being recommended during the 2003 SARS epidemic. Clinical trials are also evaluating the efficacy of tocilizumab, an IL-6 antagonist, and sarilumab. Other trials are investigating the effects of targeting granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with gimsilumab, lenzilumab, and namilumab. Cytosorb, a complement therapy that absorbs cytokines, PAMPs, and DAMPs to reduce circulating levels and improve immunopathology, is being studied. Thalidomide, known for its immunomodulatory properties, has shown promise in treating COVID-19 patients, with ongoing trials to assess its potential in reducing lung injury. TNF antagonism, suggested but not tested in SARS-CoV cases, has not been explored in COVID-19 patients. A combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has been proposed as potentially beneficial for acute COVID-19 cases, although the exact mechanisms of action against the virus remain unclear. Limited clinical data on ribavirin for SARSCoV-2 necessitates drawing inferences from other coronaviruses. Nitazoxanide has shown antiviral activity against MERS and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, warranting further investigation for its immunomodulatory effects and safety profile as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Ivermectin, studied in a phase-III clinical trial for dengue virus infection, demonstrated safety and reduced viral NS1 protein levels but did not show significant clinical benefits for patients.
It is well-established that the extensive release of cytokines in response to viral contamination by the immune system can result in a cytokine explosion and sepsis, contributing to mortality in around 30% of severe COVID-19 cases. Uncontrolled inflammation can lead to multiple organ injuries, particularly affecting hepatic, renal, and cardiac functions, often culminating in organ failure. Patients infected with SARS-CoV who progressed to renal failure have faced fatal outcomes. Conversely, individuals whose immune cells effectively resolved lung infection exhibited a regression in immunological response and eventual recovery. However, dysfunctional immune reactions have been noted in cases where cytokine explosions aimed to regulate overwhelming inflammation. Critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring intensive hospital care displayed exacerbated parameters, including notably elevated levels of G-CSF, interleukins (IL-2, 7, and 10), IP-10, MCP1, MP1α, and NTF. Elevated IL-6 levels in these cases correlated with higher mortality rates. Notably, individuals with severe, though not mild, COVID-19 exhibited a substantial presence of inflammatory monocytes from FCN1+ in bronchoalveolar material. Moreover, those in advanced disease stages showed a significant increase in inflammatory monocytes (CD14+CD16+) in peripheral blood compared to patients with milder forms of the disease. These cellular systems release inflammatory cytokines, contributing to cytokine explosions that include MCP1, MIP1α, and IP-10. Several key trials for COVID-19 have investigated compounds such as Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, thalidomide, ivermectin, remdesivir, favipiravir (pro-drugs), and prednisolone/dexamethasone.
Chloroquine functions as a potent inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, effectively suppressing the production of mature IL-1𝛽 and IL-18. This inhibition contributes to increased survival rates among patients with endotoxic shock by effectively suppressing NLPR3 inflammasome activation and the maturation of IL-1𝛽 and IL-18. The inhibitory mechanism of chloroquine on NLRP3 inflammasome activation involves the suppression of NLRP3, IL-1𝛽, and IL-18 transcription through the restriction of NF-𝜅B and MAPK pathways. Additionally, chloroquine inhibits NLRP3 complex assembly by limiting K+ efflux and ASC speck formation, as illustrated in Figure 2.
These findings suggest that chloroquine could potentially serve as a promising treatment for LPS-induced endotoxin shock and other NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases (Chen et al., 2017). Hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects on Th17-related cytokines (IL-6, -17, and -22) in both healthy individuals and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lupus erythematosus (SLE) (da Silva et al., 2013). However, as reported by Borba et al. (2020), administering high (600 mg x 2 day) and low (450 mg x 2 day) doses of chloroquine for 10 days, in combination with azithromycin and oseltamivir, was deemed unsafe for the study group's continuation. Notably, chloroquine did not demonstrate any significant improvement in patients' mortality rates.
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients in metropolitan New York who received treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or a combination of both did not exhibit significant differences in in-hospital mortality rates compared to patients who did not undergo these treatments. However, the interpretation of these findings may have been constrained by the observational nature of the study (Rosenberg et al., 2020). Another study involving hospitalized COVID-19 patients found that hydroxychloroquine treatment was not significantly associated with either a decreased or increased risk of patient intubation or mortality. The primary analysis did not reveal a significant link between hydroxychloroquine administration and patient intubation or mortality, with consistent results across multiple sensitivity analyses. The study emphasized the need for randomized controlled trials to further investigate the use of hydroxychloroquine in individuals with COVID-19 infection (Geleris et al., 2020).
France, Belgium, Italy, and more recently, the USA have voiced their opposition to the administration of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 cases, leading to a ban on its use in these countries. These nations are not the first to reject the medication, as the World Health Organization (WHO) recently removed hydroxychloroquine from a global trial due to safety concerns. Oxford University also halted a global trial just a week after its initiation. The current landscape is marked by conflicting reports on hospital treatments, including a retracted paper by Lancet (Mehra et al., 2020), reigniting the debate on the use of chloroquine. Despite these developments, healthcare professionals emphasize the importance of not indiscriminately using this pharmaceutical due to safety considerations.
Given that nitazoxanide disrupts mitochondrial electron transport, this study explored the possibility that mitochondrial effects, beyond DNA leakage, could impact antiviral responses. The failure of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD (Selleckchem) to block nitazoxanide's antiviral actions argues against pyroptosis or apoptosis, both of which can be influenced by mitochondrial factors and are integral components of the nitazoxanide mechanism (Hickson et al., 2018).
Nitazoxanide, in addition to its antiviral properties as highlighted by Antony et al. (2020), has been shown to inhibit the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In vivo studies involving mice administered with nitazoxanide orally demonstrated a significant reduction of plasma IL-6 levels by 90% compared to vehicle-treated mice. While the direct translation of these findings to humans remains unexplored, the data suggest that nitazoxanide could potentially improve outcomes in individuals infected with MERS-CoV by mitigating the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, as proposed by Rossignol et al. (2016).
Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of nitazoxanide as a monotherapy. These trials include Clinical Trials.gov Identifier NCT04348409 conducted in Aciduz, Brazil, as well as NCT04343248 and NCT04359680 conducted by Romak Lab in the USA.
Studies conducted in vitro or in vivo have demonstrated that thalidomide disrupts the synthesis of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha), leading to an increase in peripheral blood CD8+ T cells, IL-12 levels, IFN-γ generation, and cytotoxic activity. Tabata et al. (2015) found in an in vitro study that thalidomide reduced IL-1β and IL-6 expression in human lung epithelial cells, potentially aiding in the prevention of emphysema. Animal studies have indicated that thalidomide significantly alleviated pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the lungs of mice, while also reducing the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and modifying growth factor-β. Dogs receiving lung transplants exhibited improved corticosteroid levels in early postoperative immunosuppression, leading to a decreased incidence of pneumonia. Additionally, thalidomide demonstrated anti-fibrotic effects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. Its anti-inflammatory properties were evident in a study on lung injury induced by H1N1 influenza virus in mice, where thalidomide enhanced survival rates, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, lowered cytokine (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) and chemokine (chemokine ligand 5, C-X-C motif chemokine 10) levels, and inhibited p-NFκB p6 activation. Notably, a combination therapy of thalidomide and low-dose glucocorticoids has shown promising outcomes in the treatment of Covid-19 (Dastan et al., 2020; and references therein).
Thalidomide has been shown to inhibit the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 by human primary keratinocytes and monocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, this pharmaceutical has been found to reduce the release of the pro-angiogenic growth factor FGF2 and several other proteins. The secretion of these proteins is dependent on caspase-1 activity, which is activated by inflammasomes, multimeric innate immune complexes. Thalidomide exhibits inhibitory effects on the NLRP3 inflammasome by blocking caspase-1 activity, as demonstrated in studies by Keller et al. (2009) and Thi and Hong (2017).
A COVID-19 positive patient who received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir followed by thalidomide did not exhibit any discernible improvements. Laboratory assessments revealed a marked elevation in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, along with heightened cytokine levels (specifically interleukin IL-6, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)-γ), and a notable decrease in T cell counts, encompassing CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, NK cells, and B cells. Subsequent to the administration of thalidomide, cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ returned to within the normal range after six days.
Thalidomide, in addition to its known ability to inhibit cytokine release and regulate immune functions, has shown promise in relaxing COVID-19 patients to reduce oxygen consumption and alleviate digestive symptoms. This suggests a potential new avenue for adjuvant treatment in managing this potentially fatal viral disease. To further explore the effectiveness of thalidomide in conjunction with low-dose glucocorticoid therapy for treating COVID-19 pneumonia, a randomized controlled trial is necessary, as proposed by Chen et al. (2020). Notably, an ongoing clinical trial is already underway (Clinical trial.gov: NCT04273529-China).
Inhaled corticosteroids are known to reduce the number of inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, mast cells, and dendritic cells, at a cellular level in various airway diseases. The activity of corticosteroids involves suppressing the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the airways by inhibiting the production of chemotactic intermediates and adhesion molecules, as well as by preventing the survival of inflammatory cells like T-lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells in the airways. The primary target of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is the epithelial cells, where they can inhibit the activation of several inflammatory genes and restore epithelial integrity. Mucosal inflammation is rapidly reduced within six hours due to a significant decrease in visible eosinophils, leading to a decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness. However, the reversal of this stage may take months to achieve a threshold indicating structural improvements in the airways (Barnes, 2010).
Corticosteroids diffuse across the cell membrane and bind to glucocorticoid receptors (GRα) in the cytoplasm, subsequently translocating to the nucleus to initiate molecular effects. The formation of a GR homodimer with a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) in the gene promoter region determines whether gene transcription is activated or not. Genes responsive to corticosteroids include those encoding anti-inflammatory proteins like secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, β2-adrenergic receptors, and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), which modulates MAP kinase pathways, potentially contributing to the anti-inflammatory properties of corticosteroids. Conversely, GR binding to negative GREs can suppress gene transcription, potentially playing a significant role in the development of various side effects associated with corticosteroid use (Barnes, 2010).
Systemic glucocorticoid treatments were predominantly utilized in patients afflicted with the SARS coronavirus during the 2003 epidemic, particularly those experiencing severe respiratory complications. The use of pulsed high-dose methylprednisolone demonstrated clinical improvement in SARS patients, as evidenced by a female patient with acute myeloid leukemia post-bone marrow transplant who received oral prednisolone and ribavirin, resulting in rapid improvements in lymphopenia, transaminases, and radiological findings (Lam et al., 2004). Levels of interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and interferon-g-inducible protein-10 decreased following 5-8 days of glucocorticoid therapy. However, data indicated that high-risk factors, including increased 30-day mortality, were associated with pulsed methylprednisolone doses. Observational studies suggested that glucocorticoid treatment in MERS patients led to delayed respiratory syndrome onset. Yet, the efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in COVID-19 cases remains uncertain, necessitating further investigation into its application in severe COVID-19 cases (Qin et al., 2020, and references therein).
A recent study has demonstrated that the combination of glucocorticoids with antibiotics significantly reduced viral infection. Patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia exhibited elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, and ferroprotein (FER), indicative of the inflammatory reaction stage. Wang et al. (2020b) proposed that in cases of secondary infection in severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients, full-dose antibacterial drugs like cephalosporin should be promptly incorporated alongside methylprednisolone. This treatment regimen was associated with a swifter decline in CRP and IL-6 levels. Consequently, the early administration of low-dose corticosteroids for a short duration was linked to accelerated improvement in clinical symptoms among patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia. Methylprednisolone has been utilized in COVID-19 treatment protocols in conjunction with antibiotics, oseltamivir, and oxygen therapy (Huang et al., 2020; Rosa and Santos, 2020). However, recent research has indicated that prednisolone did not effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 growth in infected VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Conversely, ciclesonide, an inactive prodrug activated by esterase in the lungs to its metabolite des-ciclesonide, demonstrated high efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings suggest that ciclesonide's activity is specific to coronaviruses, with potential implications for treating MERS or COVID-19 patients, as proposed by Matsuyama et al. (2020).
Currently, clinical trials are underway in Italy (Clinical trial.gov NCT04323592) and Brazil (NCT04343729).
A recent randomized clinical trial has revealed that the low-cost steroid dexamethasone, administered in low doses, has shown efficacy in reducing mortality rates among COVID-19 patients. The trial indicated that dexamethasone was able to prevent one death in every eight ventilated patients and one death in every 25 patients receiving oxygen alone. This study, which involved over 11,500 patients from more than 175 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK, demonstrated significant reductions in mortality rates. The findings, available at https://www.recoverytrial.net/files/recovery_dexamethasone_statement_160620_v2final.pdf and registered under ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT04381936, highlighted a one-third decrease in deaths among ventilated patients and a one-fifth decrease in patients receiving oxygen only. Medical professionals have suggested that treating approximately eight ventilated patients or 25 patients requiring oxygen alone could potentially prevent one death based on these promising results.
There are currently several clinical trials in the recruiting phase, including NCT04325061 in Spain, NCT04347980 in France, NCT04395105 in Argentina, NCT04344730 in France, and NCT04327401 in Brazil.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) emerges as a promising target against SARS-CoV-2 due to the virus being a single-stranded RNA virus reliant on a multi-subunit replication and transcription complex of viral non-structural proteins (nsps) (Ziebuhr, 2005). Central to this complex is the catalytically active subunit (nsp12) of an RdRp (Ahn et al., 2012; Te Velthus et al., 2010). Studies have shown that nsp12 alone exhibits minimal activity, necessitating additional factors like nsp7 and nsp8 for optimal function (Subissi et al., 2014; Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019), enhancing RdRp scaffold binding and efficacy. Notably, Remdesivir stands out as a potent antiviral agent targeting RdRps (Wang et al., 2020c; Holshue et al., 2020; Warren et al., 2016); this pro-drug undergoes conversion into its active triphosphate form (RTP) within cells (Siegel et al., 2017). The detailed structural elucidation of RdRp-related components (Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019; Zhai et al., 2005; Peti et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2020) has facilitated the comprehensive understanding and design of the RdRp complex (Yin et al., 2020).
To comprehend the current and evolving antiviral efficacy against Covid-19, an examination of the pharmaceuticals employed for this disease is imperative.
Remdesivir, as demonstrated in murine models, exhibited efficacy against SARS and MERS (Holshue et al., 2020). Functioning as an RNA polymerase-dependent RNA antagonist, it induces early termination of viral RNA (Sheahan et al., 2017). This prodrug necessitates metabolization to activate its active form, GS-441524-triphosphate. Noteworthy is its successful application during the West African Ebola virus epidemic (2013–2016) and the Kivu Ebola epidemic (2018) (Warren et al., 2015), prompting its evaluation against COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020b).
In vitro studies have shown that Remdesivir (RDV) and IFN-β exhibit higher antiviral activity compared to lopinavir (LPV) and ritonavir (RTV). In mouse models, both prophylactic and therapeutic applications of remdesivir have demonstrated improvements in pulmonary function, reduced lung viral loads, and mitigated severe lung pathology. Conversely, prophylactic treatment with LPV/RTV-IFN-β resulted in a slight reduction in viral loads without significant impact on other disease parameters. Therapeutic administration of LPV/RTV-IFN-β enhanced pulmonary function but did not effectively reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology in mice. These findings underscore the potential of remdesivir in treating MERS-CoV infections, as evidenced in vivo (Sheahan et al., 2020).
The replication of SARS-CoV-2 relies on the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a key target of the antiviral drug remdesivir. Recent cryo-EM studies have elucidated the structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in its apo-form and in complex with a 50-base template-primer RNA, shedding light on the potential efficacy of remdesivir in combating viral replication. The structural analysis reveals the presence of a partial double-stranded RNA template within the central channel of RdRp, where remdesivir is covalently attached to the primer strand at the initial replicated base pair, effectively halting chain elongation. These findings offer crucial insights into the mechanism of viral RNA replication and present a rational basis for designing antiviral drugs to combat viral infections (Yin et al., 2020).
A recent clinical trial was conducted with adult Covid-19 patients hospitalized with confirmed lower respiratory tract involvement, utilizing intravenous remdesivir in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized manner. A total of 1,063 patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir or placebo for up to 10 days (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04280705-USA). The data and safety monitoring board recommended early unblinding due to analysis findings indicating a shortened recovery time in the remdesivir group. Initial results from 1,059 patients (538 remdesivir, 521 placebo) showed a median recovery time of 11 days for remdesivir recipients compared to 15 days for placebo recipients. Kaplan Meier estimates for 14 days revealed a patient mortality rate of 7.1% for remdesivir and 11.9% for placebo. Severe adverse events were reported in 21.1% of remdesivir recipients and 27.0% of placebo recipients. While remdesivir was more effective in reducing recovery time, the high mortality rate despite its use suggests that antiviral treatment alone may not be sufficient against Covid-19 (Wang et al., 2020; Beigel et al., 2020). Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in China with 237 patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (ClinicalTrials.gov.: NCT04257656- China) showed faster clinical improvement, but adverse events were reported in 66% of remdesivir recipients and 64% of placebo recipients. Early discontinuation of remdesivir due to adverse events occurred in 12% of patients compared to 5% in the placebo group. The study authors concluded that remdesivir did not show statistically significant clinical benefits, suggesting the need for further research to confirm the potential for early remdesivir treatment to hasten clinical improvement (Wang et al., 2020c). Ongoing clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04365725-France; NCT04280705-USA; NCT04302766-USA) are currently underway to provide more insights into the efficacy of remdesivir in treating Covid-19.
Favipiravir, as depicted in Figure 1, has been approved for use as a treatment for influenza in Japan. However, it is specifically recommended for treating new influenza strains that cause acute disease, rather than for seasonal influenza, as highlighted by Shiraki and Daikoku (2020).
The mechanism of action is believed to be associated with the selective suppression of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Jin et al., 2013). Baranovich et al. (2013) suggested that favipiravir induces lethal RNA transversion mutations, resulting in a non-viable viral phenotype. Favipiravir is a pro-drug that is metabolized to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP), which can be used in both intravenous and oral formulations (Guedj et al., 2018). The activation of favipiravir is presumed to involve human hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT). Interestingly, favipiravir does not inhibit RNA or DNA synthesis in mammalian cells and is non-toxic to them. Although it has been used in Japan since 2014, its efficacy in primary human airway cells for influenza therapy remains uncertain (Yoon et al., 2018). In 2020, favipiravir was utilized as a treatment for COVID-19 in China (Li and De Clercq, 2020). A study involving 80 patients compared the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, showing a reduction in the viral clearance period and enhanced CT scans in 91% of patients with minimal side effects. However, this study was not a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (Cai et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2020). Recently, favipiravir has been approved for clinical trials in the treatment of coronavirus disease in China.
In March 2020, Italy approved the use of favipiravir for research purposes in combating COVID-19 and has commenced trials in three regions most heavily impacted by the virus. The authorization and initiation of these trials were reported by a source (https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2020/03/22/coronavirus-il-veneto-sperimental-antivirale-giapponese-favipiravir-ma-laifa-ci-sono-scarse-evidenze-scientifiche-su-efficacia/5745426/) which also highlighted the limited scientific evidence available regarding the efficacy of this Japanese antiviral drug.
Trials with favipiravir are currently underway in three hospitals in Massachusetts, USA, as reported by advances.massgeneral.org/research-and-innovation/article.aspx?id=1171. Additionally, a trial is set to commence in London, UK, in the first week of May 2020, as indicated by standard.co.uk/news/uk/uk-coronavirus-patients-trial-japanese-covid19-drug-a4429731.html.
The antiviral drug favipiravir was approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospital settings in Russia on May 29, 2020, following an open-label randomized clinical trial that recruited 60 patients. The government clinical trial registry, known as COVID-FPR-01, is expected to enroll a total of 390 patients and conclude by December 31, 2020. Subsequently, on May 30, 2020, the Russian Health Ministry sanctioned a generic version of favipiravir named Avifavir. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) supported the investigation of Avifavir and confirmed its high efficacy in the initial phase of clinical trials (source: https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/russian-health-ministry-approves-anti-coronavirus-drug-avifavir-1.1443601; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-russia-cases/russia-plans-coronavirus-vaccine-clinical-trials-in-two-weeks-report-idUSKBN2360BJ).
Avifavir, also known as favipiravir, has emerged as a promising candidate for the treatment of Covid-19 in Russia and is likely to be introduced in England, Italy, and the USA in the near future.
Protein signal-dependent targeting within and outside the nucleus is governed by components of the importin (IMP) family of transport receptors, capable of recognizing targeting signals in cargo proteins and facilitating passage through nuclear pore complexes during nuclear translocation. This process is vital for triggering cell division and differentiation, as well as for viral replication and disease progression. Phosphorylation plays a crucial role in regulating viral protein trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm, along with other post-translational modifications. Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking mechanisms are influenced by the levels and distribution of IMPs/EXPs (export members of the IMPβ superfamily), as well as the composition and quantity of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). A well-studied mechanism of nuclear transport modulation involves phosphorylation near the nuclear localization signal/nuclear export signal (NLS/NES) and subsequent recognition by IMP/EXP; however, modifications like esterification (e.g., acetylation, ubiquitination) have also been shown to impact the trafficking of cellular proteins (e.g., p53), tumor suppressors (p110Rb, PTEN), survivin, nuclear factor NF-κB, and MEMO (NF-κB essential modulator). Viral proteins frequently undergo post-translational modifications, often involving cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which contribute to the cell cycle-dependent regulation of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (Fulcher and Jans, 2011; and references therein).
Ivermectin was the focal point of a phase-III clinical trial carried out to examine dengue virus (DENV) infection in Thailand from 2014 to 2017. The findings indicated that a once-daily oral dose was safe and effectively lowered serum viral NS1 protein levels. However, this treatment did not result in alterations in viremia or demonstrate any clinical advantages (Yamasmith et al., 2018).
A study has demonstrated that ivermectin can dissociate the pre-formed IMPα/β1 heterodimer and prevent its generation by binding to the IMPα armadillo (ARM) repeat domain, thereby enhancing IMPα thermal stability and α-helicity. Additionally, ivermectin has been found to inhibit the association of a non-structured protein 5 derived from the dengue virus (NS5) with IMPα in a cellular context (Yang et al., 2020). Caly et al. (2020) have reported that ivermectin exhibits antiviral activity against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with a single dose effectively controlling viral replication within 24–48 hours. This effect is believed to be attributed to the inhibition of IMPα/β1-mediated nuclear import of viral proteins, a mechanism observed in other RNA viruses. The validation of this mechanism in the context of SARS-CoV-2, along with the identification of specific viral and/or host components affected, are crucial areas for future investigation in this field (Figure 4).
According to Patel et al. (2020), administering 150 µg/kg of ivermectin to patients post mechanical ventilation could potentially reduce hospitalization time and enhance survival rates compared to standard treatments. However, this study failed to account for comorbidities that could influence these outcomes. If ivermectin indeed yielded these clinical benefits, it would imply that the in vitro study by Caly et al. (2020) may not translate to effective drug levels at the site of action in humans. To validate these findings, a well-controlled clinical trial with ivermectin is necessary, examining both approved low doses and higher doses beyond the placebo level in COVID-19 patients (Schmith et al., 2020). While doses up to 120 mg have been administered to a limited patient pool (Guzzo et al., 2002), daily applications at the approved dose (200 µg/kg) for extended periods, such as 14 days, have only been explored in severe infections using non-approved subcutaneous formulations (Turner et al., 2005). Monitoring is crucial if higher doses are administered weekly or through alternative routes. Exploring the feasibility of inhaled ivermectin therapy could be a promising avenue, although only one non-clinical study has reported an NOAEL of 380 mg/m3 after a month of treatment (Ji et al., 2016). The lack of human studies on this administration route necessitates careful evaluation by experts to determine if ivermectin is suitable for inhalation therapy without posing risks that could hinder its application. Schmith et al. (2020) proposed interdisciplinary collaboration to better grasp the potential of ivermectin-based therapy before testing suboptimal doses in clinical settings.
Clinical trials are currently underway in various countries, including Couse, Argentina (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04381884), Spain (NCT04390022), Pakistan (NCT04392713), and India (NCT04373824).
Based on the data analyzed in this study, it is evident that despite significant efforts to develop a new and effective antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 through clinical trials conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic, an efficient antiviral medication has not yet been discovered. The challenges observed in clinical trials investigating potential therapies for COVID-19 hinder both the necessity and ability to produce high-quality evidence, even amidst the ongoing pandemic. While various mechanisms exist that can inhibit or eradicate the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is optimism within the scientific community that a successful pharmaceutical intervention to end this pandemic will eventually be found. Understanding the pathogenesis of Covid-19 in its entirety will enable the selection of a compound that demonstrates efficacy in vivo rather than solely in vitro, as the translation of activity from cultured cells to animals and subsequently to humans is not straightforward. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a robust protocol for clinical trials to identify a new and safe antiviral drug.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced plans to launch a global "megatrial" called SOLIDARITY, employing a pragmatic trial design to randomize confirmed cases into either standard care or one of four active therapy arms (chloroquines, lopinavir/ritonavir alone, or lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-β) based on regional medication availability (Kupferschmidt and Cohen, 2020). This proposal was intriguing at the time; however, regrettably, priorities have shifted significantly from March to June 2020, necessitating a reevaluation of these potential approaches.
