Objective: This study aims to examine the distribution of journals and scientific collaboration related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) as documented on the Web of Science.
Methods: A bibliometric study was conducted to analyze the production of documents available on the Web of Science from 1989 to 2020.
Results: A total of 1623 documents were retrieved from 538 journals, resulting in an average annual production of 55.9 documents. The average production per author stood at 1.73. Within the categories, Nursing contributed 17 documents, representing 1.04% of the total, while Virology made the largest contribution with 324 documents, accounting for 19.96%. Notably, China emerged as the leading contributor with 640 publications, making up 39.43% of the total documents retrieved.
In conclusion, the data presented in this study illustrate a significant level of interest within the scientific community regarding the subject matter. Through our analysis, we were able to identify a group of 82 authors who constitute an Elite group of Authors, with a productivity rate of 66.1%. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia are the countries that predominantly formed Collaboration Networks in this field.
In late 2019, a novel virus belonging to the Coronavirus family, specifically associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China. This virus is characterized by severe respiratory symptoms, marking a significant public health concern.
Virologists have been studying coronaviruses since the mid-1960s. Environmental contamination, possibly resulting from respiratory secretions of SARS-CoV-2 patients, poses a significant risk for transmission, emphasizing the critical importance of adhering to strict environmental and hand hygiene practices. Consequently, health professionals have been identified as a high-risk population for contracting Coronavirus infection.
The declaration of a pandemic caused by the novel virus was made by Mr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on March 11, 2020. Since then, the global scientific community has been diligently working to combat the virus and the resulting disease. Given the multifaceted nature of the new Coronavirus pandemic, which spans across various disciplines in both basic and applied sciences, researchers from diverse fields are directing their efforts towards finding an effective treatment and, ideally, a vaccine for immunizing humans. Consequently, the advancement of such research could greatly benefit from studies of this nature.
In the past century, there has been a significant increase in the publication and dissemination of information, leading to a faster and more extensive incorporation of knowledge by researchers. It has become crucial for researchers to possess the necessary skills to identify the most suitable indexing databases and repositories, sift through vast amounts of information, and select the most pertinent data for their research. Bibliometric studies emerge as valuable resources across various research fields, offering insights that can support technological and scientific advancements. These studies are particularly adept at mapping scientific production, providing a comprehensive overview of research trends and contributions.
Bibliometric research, involving the statistical analysis of bibliographies, is underpinned by three well-established laws: Bradford's Law, Lotka's Law, and Zipf's Law. These studies rely on a framework of laws and empirical principles derived from information science, aimed at exploring the quantitative dimensions of information production, dissemination, and utilization. This approach not only aids in assessing the present status of scientific knowledge but also facilitates research management.
This study is motivated by the need to investigate the scientific production trends related to SARS-CoV-2, offering valuable insights to the scientific community focused on understanding this significant disease, which has triggered severe public health, economic, and social repercussions globally. The central inquiry guiding this research is: what patterns characterize the scientific output concerning SARS-CoV-2 within the Science web database? To address this query systematically, employing a range of indicators and metrics, the primary aim is to comprehensively depict and scrutinize the trends in scientific article production concerning SARS-CoV-2 accessible through the Science web platform.
This bibliometric study, conducted in a quantitative manner, utilized Bradford's Laws for journal dispersion and Lotka's Law of the inverse square to examine the patterns of scientific production and the utilization of electronically recorded information within an international database spanning the years 1989 to 2020. The analysis focused on documents indexed in the Science web base, with all types of documents meeting the inclusion criteria and no specific exclusion criteria applied.
The search was conducted on the Science web database in April 2020, utilizing the descriptor [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome] and applying a "title" filter. Access was granted through the CAPES Journal Portal, using the researcher's credentials at Rede Cafe. This database was chosen due to its widespread acceptance within the global scientific community, particularly in the field of health, offering abstracts and references from peer-reviewed scientific literature, thereby presenting a comprehensive overview of worldwide research output. For the subsequent bibliometric analysis, the VOSViewers® software's graphical interface and Microsoft Excel 2017® were employed.
In Figure 1, it is evident that the proportion of variance explained by the exponential model (R² = 0.4306) surpasses that of the linear model (R² = 0.0202), aligning with Price Law 6-8. These findings suggest that publications on SARS exhibit a strong alignment with the Price Law 6-8 during the period from 1989 to 2020, indicating that the scientific literature in this field is experiencing exponential growth.
Authorship or contribution in this study is defined as the involvement of a researcher as an author or co-author of a published article. Unlike Lotka's approach, which primarily acknowledged senior or first authors, we adopt a comprehensive counting method where each co-author is recognized for their full contribution, irrespective of the total number of authors involved. To accurately identify authors and maintain an accurate count, a disambiguation process based on the authors' affiliations was implemented.
Among the authors and co-authors, a total of 7,304 researchers were involved in the study. The average productivity was slightly above 1.73, with the most productive authors/co-authors contributing 43 articles (2.64%), while the vast majority, comprising 5,172 individuals (70.81%), published only a single article. To analyze productivity trends among authors, Lotka's Law was utilized, employing the equation xα . y = c, where x represents the number of documents published, y denotes the number of authors with x publications, and c stands for a constant. Figure 2 illustrates the equation derived from the distribution of articles by the number of authors, revealing a Lotka constant of 0.8101X-2.581. Furthermore, the Law of Elitism 3-4 was validated through the examination of a select group of 85 authors/co-authors (1.16%), whose collective output accounted for 1236 articles (76.15%) of the total publications.
The geographic distribution of the retrieved publications involved contributions from 66 countries. China emerged as the predominant contributor with 640 documents (39.43%), closely trailed by the United States with 443 publications (27.29%), Taiwan with 158 (9.73%), and Canada with 130 (8.01%). Brazil, on the other hand, secured the 17th position with a total of 10 publications (0.61%).
The collaborative analysis focused on countries with a minimum of 5 productions, resulting in only 24 countries (36.36%) contributing to the collaborative map (Figure 3). Conversely, an equal number of countries had only one publication. Figure 3 visually illustrates this distribution, showcasing six clusters differentiated by various colors. Among these clusters, Brazil stands as the sole Latin American representative, engaging in collaboration solely with Italy and Germany, while also sharing the cluster with Belgium, Spain, France, and the Netherlands. This particular cluster, comprising seven countries, collectively produced 306 documents, accounting for 18.85% of the total documents retrieved in this study.
The predominant language of scholarly publications is English, accounting for 1,590 documents (97.96%). This is followed by French with 11 documents (0.67%), German with 9 documents (0.55%), Spanish with 7 documents (0.43%), and Chinese and Portuguese each with 2 documents (0.12%). Hungarian and Russian each have 1 document (0.06%) in the dataset.
Among the 1586 institutions that participated in the study, the top three contributors are based in China, collectively responsible for 357 documents (21.99%). Leading the pack is the University of Hong Kong with 158 publications (9.73%). In terms of Brazilian institutions, notable mentions include the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) with three documents (0.18%), ranking 274th, and the University of São Paulo (USP) in the 464th position with two publications (0.12%).
Among the 103 categories identified, only seven yielded 100 or more documents each. These categories were Virology, accounting for 324 documents (19.96%); Infectious Diseases with 208 documents (12.81%); Immunology with 187 documents (11.52%); Microbiology with 172 documents (10.59%); General Internal Medicine with 166 documents (10.22%); Intensive Care Medicine with 139 documents (8.56%); and Molecular Biology with 108 documents (6.65%). Nursing, on the other hand, contributed a mere 17 documents (1.04%). The total documents were dispersed across 508 journals, averaging 3.02 articles per journal. Notably, the majority of journals, 338 in total (58.2%), published only a single document each.
The 1623 SARS documents were disseminated across 532 distinct journals. Following the application of Bradford's law, 15 journals were identified in the core, 86 in zone 1, and 532 in zone 2. Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the distribution of these journals and their output based on the Nucleus and the two zones. Additionally, the Bradford Multiplier (Bm) values are presented, with the calculation aimed at showcasing that the number of journals within the Nucleus aligns with those most dedicated to SARS research. Notably, the Bm values did not surpass 0.7, indicating a consistent distribution of journals across the zones.
Bradford's premise 8-9 suggests that scientific journals ought to be arranged in descending order of document productivity within a specific subject area. This organization entails dividing the journals into a core group that is specifically focused on the subject, alongside multiple groups or Zones that each contain an equal number of documents as the core. The number of journals within the core and subsequent Zones follows a proportional sequence of 1:n:n2:n3...
In this study, the distribution of the Nucleus and its respective zones adhered to the theoretical framework, with each accounting for approximately one-third of the total number of documents analyzed during the specified time period. Specifically, the Nucleus comprised around 541 documents, while zone 1 and zone 2 encompassed 1082 and 1623 documents, respectively (refer to Table 3). The Nucleus consists of 15 journals, all of which have Impact Factors (IF) listed in the Web of Science (WOS): Journal of Virology (IF = 4.324), Chinese Medical Journal (IF = 1.555), Journal of Clinical Microbiology (IF = 4.959), Journal of Infectious Diseases (IF = 5.045), Journal of Biological Chemistry (IF = 4.106), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (IF = 9.58), Clinical Infectious Diseases (IF = 9.055), Journal of General Virology (IF = 2.809), Critical Care Medicine (IF = 6.971), Emerging Infectious Diseases (IF = 7.185), American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (IF = 16.494), Virology (IF = 2.657), American Journal of Roentgenology (IF = 3.161), Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology (IF = 2.511), and Intensive Care Medicine (IF = 18.967).
In this study, a global bibliometric analysis of SARS was conducted over a span of 31 years. The extensive duration of this analysis, coupled with its thorough nature, enabled us to accurately employ methods and bibliometric indexes to minimize the subjectivity of the data.
Following the analyses conducted, it was established that the research corpus maintains consistency, as data mining facilitated the retrieval of documents based on key descriptors, thereby delineating the focal point of the study. The substantial quantity of 1623 documents retrieved surpasses other bibliometric studies within the health domain. For instance, a study on scientific production related to moral harassment yielded 53 documents from 2002 to 2012, while another study on virtual reality in venipuncture analyzed 213 documents from 1969 to 2018. This outcome underscores the significant interest of the scientific community in the pandemic and its global emergence.
When juxtaposed with research in the field of obstetrics, virology studies constitute a notably smaller fraction, as evidenced by the data spanning from 2002 to 2013, which yielded 142,659 articles and 9967 clinical trials. Nevertheless, the analysis revealed a remarkable surge in virology research, despite the inherent challenges associated with conducting studies on viruses. Such endeavors demand a profound understanding of advanced methodologies, substantial financial resources, and significant time investments.
A notable increase was noted between 2003 and 2007, spurred by the SARS epidemic that claimed the lives of hundreds in 2002 and 2003, particularly impacting Asian economies. The trend suggests that the period from 2020 to 2023 is poised to mirror the growth observed from 2003 to 2007, underscoring a resurgence of interest and attention from the scientific community, indicating that the subject has not yet reached a saturation point. This also confirms that the rate of knowledge dissemination or replacement in this field is still in its early stages, with no significant loss exceeding 50% in citations or the currency of information, highlighting the absence of a pronounced aging or obsolescence factor.
The transition rates and productivity of authors offer intriguing insights; disciplines with well-established scientific activity tend to have fewer occasional or transient authors, indicating that a high transition rate may signify a lack of relevant working groups or the presence of researchers from other scientific areas. A transience index of 70.81% was calculated, with highly productive authors at 1.16%, closely resembling the study on obstetrics (13) with values of 71.5% and 1.33% respectively.
Applying Lotka's law reveals an inversely proportional relationship between the number of authors and articles generated. The constant depicted in Figure 2 substantiates the notion encapsulated in the adage 'many with little and few with much' (7-10), indicating that as the volume of articles increases, the number of authors involved decreases. This finding transcends the constraints imposed by the biosafety level 4 prerequisite for SARS research and is intricately linked to augmented funding for investigations into infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS. Notably, funding has been shown to exert a positive impact on research outcomes and the citation rates of specific diseases.
Applying the Law of Elitism with a Price of 10 allowed for the identification of the Elite Group of authors. The square root of the total number of authors, which was 82, represented the elite in the field under study. This group of authors accounted for 66.1% of the retrieved documents, surpassing the minimum threshold of 50% set forth in the Law of Elitism. It is noteworthy that the productivity index was notably low at 1.65, primarily due to the significant presence of occasional authors.
The analysis of co-authorship revealed the robust scientific collaboration among authors/co-authors who have collectively produced a minimum of 5 documents with at least 10 citations, predominantly constituting the Elite Group. This examination of co-authorship is a crucial bibliometric metric, extensively studied within Social Network Analysis (SNA), offering researchers a comprehensive insight into the hidden networks within which research entities operate, along with various insights into collaborative relationships within the scientific community. Collaboration is increasingly vital given the complex nature of modern research and its associated financial implications.
When comparing the average co-authorship across institutions and countries of origin, it becomes evident that Social Networks within the scientific realm exhibit a globalized nature among authors, affiliations, and countries. This globalization is prominently spearheaded by the United States of America and Eastern nations, notably China and Saudi Arabia, with subsequent contributions from the United Kingdom and Germany. Brazil, positioned at 21st place, emerges as the sole representative from Latin America. The prevalence of English as the primary language in publications underscores its universal status in the scientific community. This linguistic dominance is easily rationalized, given English's widespread adoption as the lingua franca of science. Consequently, it is reasonable to deduce that the level of international engagement among Brazilian researchers is still in a phase of consolidation.
Applying Bradford's Law to analyze the distribution and dispersion of journals, Table 3 revealed a consistent pattern. The Bradford Multiplier (Bm) indicated a stable trend, with the Bm values across different Zones falling within the acceptable range of 5-9 ± 0.7. This consistency suggests a distribution that closely aligns with the ideal (I:n:n2) as prescribed by the Law. The Nucleus, consisting of 15 periodicals, emerged as the most dedicated to the subject matter at hand.
SARS constitutes a minor fraction of the overall scientific output within the health domain; nevertheless, its presence in the field is notably significant. Given the contemporary nature of this topic, it is justifiable to assert that the volume of retrieved documents holds considerable relevance when juxtaposed with other bibliometric investigations in the health sector.
Researchers can derive significant advantages from employing bibliometric analysis techniques, not solely in a quantitative capacity but also in a qualitative one. The numerical data aids in providing an approximate understanding of reality, and when supplemented with more detailed investigations, the depth and richness of the analyses are enhanced, rendering them more representative. Consequently, bibliometric studies play a pivotal role in facilitating the visualization of interconnections among information stemming from diverse fields of knowledge.
In this study, the laws of Bradford and Lotka, grounded in empirical evidence, have successfully validated theoretical hypotheses suggesting that the core of journals comprises the most dedicated and consequently, the most productive authors. However, the findings also indicate that as the specificity of the subject under investigation increases, there is a higher likelihood of identifying distinct groups of authors.
The utilization of the classical formulation of Bradford's Law inherently led to an anticipated imperfection in adjustment, given the influence of numerous variables on the empirical distribution within the literature. These variables, unaccounted for in Bradford's classical formula, pose a significant challenge to contemporary scholars grappling with its mathematical formulation. The core observation stemming from the Law's application aptly highlights a crucial facet concerning scientific academic behavior in the context of SARS: the tendency for publications to gravitate towards journals that are already recognized or poised for recognition. Consequently, it becomes imperative to assess the qualitative aspects of these journals, with a particular emphasis on impact factor indicators, as they are deemed the most reliable metrics for evaluation.
Lotka's Law offers a framework for assessing authors' productivity trends within a specified timeframe, with each discipline linked to an exponent denoting the author's productivity rate in that field. However, this framework alone fails to elucidate why certain individuals exhibit high productivity, churning out numerous published articles, while others produce only a handful or none at all.
The variation in author productivity can be partially elucidated by the unique context of each individual. While author productivity itself may not be directly correlated with collaborative authorship, it is evident that collaborative authorship can impact an author's productivity within a specific timeframe. This was notably observed in the present research, where the involvement of all authors and co-authors played a role in shaping the discourse around the law of the inverse square and the formation of an Elite Group of authors.
The study's results and methodological design can potentially provide a foundation for further propositions, addressing a gap in bibliometric research within the health field, particularly in nursing. This commitment aims to strengthen the existing body of knowledge by fostering research that not only contributes to its growth but also aids in its consolidation.
Several limitations are underscored in the current research methodology, such as reliance on a single study, variations in the sensitivity of the chosen descriptor for document retrieval based on titles. The exclusivity of the findings could be attributed to the sole reliance on one database. Subsequent investigations could explore whether the co-authoring productivity pattern expands with a broader sampling of articles from diverse databases. Notwithstanding these constraints, certain outcomes from this study appear intriguing and merit further deliberation.
