ABSTRACT – (Topsoil physical properties under a riparian forest in Central Brazil: infiltration and 
penetration resistance). Plant composition, diversity and structure of riparian forests of Central Brazil 
are well known. However, little is known about soil physical properties under these forests. This 
knowledge is important as a baseline for biodiversity restoration and ecosystem services that occur 
in riparian zones. In order to bridge this gap, here we assessed the infiltration capacity and soil 
penetration resistance in a plinthic soil under gallery forest in Planaltina, Distrito Federal, Brazil. We 
measured infiltration capacity (Mini-Disk infiltrometer) and soil penetration resistance (Stof 
penetrometer) following linear transects. The plinthic soil had high infiltration capacity and low 
penetration resistance. Our infiltration estimate is in the middle range when compared to other 
permeability studies in tropical forests. Like their counterparts, high biological activity along with 
the lack of disturbance are the likely explanations for such high topsoil permeability to water.  
Keywords: buffer zones, soil conservation, streamside áreas, tropical ecosystems, water management 
 
RESUMO – (Propriedades físicas da camada superficial do solo em florestas ripária no Brasil central: 
resistência à infiltração e penetração). As florestas de galeria são bem descritas em termos de 
composição, diversidade e estrutura da vegetação. No entanto, pouco se sabe sobre as propriedades 
físicas do solo sob essas florestas que são importantes para a restauração de zonas ripárias. A fim de 
preencher essa lacuna, no presente trabalho, avaliou-se a capacidade de infiltração e a resistência do 
solo à penetração em um solo plíntico sob floresta ripária em Planaltina, Distrito Federal, Brasil. 
Mediu-se a capacidade de infiltração (infiltrômetro de Mini-Disk) e a resistência à penetração no solo 
(penetrômetro de Stolf) seguindo transectos lineares. O solo plíntico apresentou alta capacidade de 
infiltração e baixa resistência à penetração. Nossa estimativa de infiltração está na faixa intermediária 
em comparação com outros estudos de permeabilidade em florestas tropicais. Mesmo assim, a 
mediana da capacidade de infiltração foi superior à intensidade de chuva de alto período de retorno o 
que descarta a possibilidade de escoamento superficial Hortoniano. Como em outras florestas 
tropicais, a alta atividade biológica junto com a ausência de perturbação do solo são as razões 
prováveis para essa alta permeabilidade do solo à água.

Introduction 
 
Gallery forests, also known as riparian forests, occur along small streams in the Cerrado biome 
of Brazil (Ribeiro and Walter, 1998). These forests are well known in terms of plant species 
composition, diversity and structure (Felfili 1994, Felfili 1995, Nóbrega et al. 2001, Silva Júnior 
2004, Silva Júnior 2005, Moretti et al. 2013, Cabacinha & Fontes 2014, Pio 2018). Generally, they 
present a high biological diversity. One of the possible explanations for such diversity might be 
attributed to heterogeneity of soil types over which these forests occur which include both well and 
poorly drained soils (Haridasan 1998). For example, they might occur on oxisols (latossolos) and 
histosols (organossolos) (Resck & Silva 1998). Since these soil types present a clearly distinct hydric 
behaviour, they not only affect plant community but are also expected to influence the ecosystem 
service of buffering zones that riparian forests play. For instance, riparian forests under histosols 
might not reduce surface runoff from uplands in the wet season since these soils would be water 
saturated during this period following the runoff generation (as described in Dunne & Black 1970a,b). 
So, it is important to understand hydrological functions of these forests under different soil types. 
Like many riparian forests elsewhere, such ecosystems are expected to carry out important 
buffer functions including retaining sediment, nutrients and human-made chemicals such as 
pesticides. The assumption behind is that riparian soil under these forests present high topsoil 
permeability which, in turn, diminish or extinguish surface runoff from uplands (Salemi et al. 2011). 
To date, there is no documentation on basic topsoil permeability for these riparian forests. 
Understanding such properties under specific physical settings may allow to infer whether they carry 
out the expected functions they are expected to. Moreover, such information may serve as a baseline 
which, in turn, may help scientists and managers to predict the impacts of inappropriate riparian 
occupation and restoration (see Brito et al. 2019; Pereira et al. 2021). 
 
In this context, the objective of the present paper was to characterize a plinthic soil under a 
riparian forest in terms of infiltration capacity and soil penetration resistance.  We expected that, like 
other tropical rainforests, these riparian forests would present high permeability to water. 
 
Methods 
 
Study área - We selected a riparian forest located in Planaltina, Distrito Federal, Brazil. The Köppen-
Geiger climatic classification is Aw, with two markedly defined seasons (dry and wet) (Alvares et al. 
2013). Annual rainfall is 1,393 mm with nearly 100% of it falling in the wet season (October to April)

(Malaquias et al., 2010). Average temperature is 20.7°C. The soil type is a clay Plintossolo 
(Plinthosols), according to the Brazilian Soil Classification System (Embrapa, 2018).  
Riparian forests in the study area usually have high plant species diversity. Trees density and 
basal area are around, respectively, 1.300-1.900 individuals ha-1 and 32-38 m2 ha-1 (Nóbrega et al. 
2001, Silva Júnior 2004, Silva Júnior 2005). Common species found in these forests are Protium 
spruceanum (Benth.) Engl. (Burseraceae), Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. (Fabaceae), Tapirira 
guianensis Aubl. (Anacardiaceae), Inga alba (Sw.) Willd. (Fabaceae), Cheiloclinium cognatum 
(Miers) A.C.Sm. (Celastraceae), Pseudolmedia guaranitica Hasler (Moraceae), Euterpe edulis Mart. 
(Arecaceae) and Talauma ovata A. St.-Hill. (Magnoliaceae) (Nóbrega et al. 2001, Silva Júnior, 2004, 
Silva Júnior, 2005).  
Variables and sampling design - We measure both infiltration capacity and soil resistance to 
penetration using, respectively, Mini-Disk infiltrometer (Decagon) and Stof Impact Penetrometer 
(Kamaq) during the dry season of 2018. 
The Mini-disk infiltrometer is a two-chamber device in which the Mariotte principle is applied 
to control soil suction. Such equipment uses the analytical solution proposed by Zhang (1997). 
Similar to Ghimire et al. (2013), to increase the contact area between the infiltrometer and the soil, 
we carried out two steps: (i) we carefully removed the litter layer and (ii) we used a thin (< 1 mm) of 
fine sand. These procedures ensure optimum contact between the infiltrometer and the soil. To 
capture the highest range of pores, we set a suction pressure of 0 cm which corresponds to Ko, that 
is, the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Reichardt & Timm 2019). The rates of water discharge 
through the Mini-Disk, as inferred from changes in the water levels in the storage chamber, were 
recorded until steady-state flow was reached. Infiltration was measured using three linear transects 
randomly distributed within the riparian forest (figure 2). To randomize linear transects, we used a 
randomizer software (randomizer.org) which selected 3 out of 50 grid transects. Ten infiltration 
samples were taken from each of these transects. Transects were established in parallel to stream 
channel. When measuring infiltration, it is important to minimize the effect of soil moisture on 
infiltration measurements since substantial variation can occur from one month to the next (see 
Pereira et al. 2021). Thus, we carried out two steps: (i) measurements were made in August (dry 
season) when soil moisture in the region is minimal (Oliveira et al. 2005), and (ii) we set 0 cm of 
suction pressure in the Mariotte bottle.  
In order to predict the effectiveness of the riparian forest in accommodating storms of the region, we 
compared our median of infiltration capacity with 5-minutes rainfall intensities of different return 
periods (100, 50 and 25-years) available in Souza (2014).  
Soil penetration resistance was measured for ten times following the linear transects described 
above (figure 2). We arbitrarily selected four impacts to determine soil penetration resistance. This

include the first impact which is the inherent weight of the equipment followed by the other three 
impacts which resulted from the impact of a standard 2 kg weight into the soil. To minimize the effect 
of soil moisture on our penetration measurements, we carried out the measurements in the dry season 
(August) when soil moisture is minimal (Oliveira et al. 2005). 
Data análisis - Sample sufficency was verified for infiltration capacity using a simple plot of mean 
and standard deviation versus number of samples. An adequate sample size was considered met when 
central tendency statistics stabilized for at least three times consecutively (Salemi et al. 2020).  
Residuals of soil penetration resistance were subjected to Shapiro-Wilk test which indicated 
a lack of gaussian distribution. Therefore, we used Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the post hoc Dunn 
test to check significant differences between impacts. Statistical analyses were carried out in PAST 
software at α < 0.05. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
The number of samples used for infiltration was considered appropriate given the relative  
stabilization of the median statistics (figure 3). The median infiltration capacity was 893 mm hr-
1(figure 4). Mean (± standard deviation) of soil penetration resistance for all four impacts were, 
respectively, as follows: 0.63 ± 0.21 MPa, 0.66 ± 0.32 MPa, 0.74 ± 0.22 MPa and 0.76 ± 0.22 MPa 
(figure 5). There was a significant increase in soil penetration resistance with depth. Such increase 
has previously been documented for a forest within the Brazilian savanna (see Pereira et al. 2021). 
Our resistance to penetration was lower compared to a nearby savana (regionally known as “Cerrado 
típico”) in the same area (Murta et al. 2021). Such difference of soil penetration resistance in the 
riparian forest compared to a savanna  might be attributed to the higher and more continuous addition 
of litter year-round in the forest compared to the savanna (Costa et al. 2020). For example, Aquino et 
al. (2016) measured an average of 6 ton ha-1 year-1 in a riparian forest whereas Valenti et al. (2008) 
found 0.6 ton ha-1 year-1 in a savana. 
We found infiltration capacity of the plinthic soil under riparian forest to be in the middle 
range compared to estimates carried out in other tropical forests such as the Amazon and Atlantic 
Forest (table 1). Generally, high soil biological activity (e.g. continuous litter production, root growth 
and decay and soil fauna) along with the lack of disturbance (e.g. human and animal trampling, use 
of heavy machinery) leads to high infiltration in forest soils (Bruijnzeel 1990, Salemi et al. 2011). 
Our median infiltration capacity estimate was higher compared to the rain intensity of various 
storms in the region (figure 4). Thus, we rule out the occurrence of infiltration excess overland-flow 
in this forest. However, our penetration resistance indicated a likely reduction of these permeability 
with depth which was, to some extent, expected due the presence of the plinthic horizon. A previous

study on plinthic soils showed the formation of a perched water table above such layer (Moraes et al. 
2006). Furthermore, riparian forests, like the one studied here, generally might occur in shallow water 
table zones (Ribeiro & Walter 2008).  In case the water table (perched or not) intersects the soil 
surface, both return-flow and overland-flow are triggered (Dunne & Black 1970a, b, Elsenbeer & 
Vertessy 2000). Thus, saturation overland-flow can occur. In this case, unlike the generally expected 
role of surface runoff sinks, these zones might act as surface runoff sources instead. More studies are 
needed to clarify percolation capacities of these soil and their implications for runoff processes.
