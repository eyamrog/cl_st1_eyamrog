A fundamental aspect of mutualisms is the presence of individuals within partner species that benefit from shared resources and services without reciprocating positively. The impact of these cheaters on the evolutionary dynamics of mutualisms has been acknowledged, but their broader implications at the community level and beyond interacting species remain inadequately understood. Given that mutualistic networks often encompass numerous species, the indirect effects of cheaters can potentially cascade throughout the entire community, altering trait evolution. This study delves into how hosting cheating interactions can shape coevolution within mutualistic networks. By integrating a coevolutionary model, empirical data on animal-plant mutualistic networks, and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a higher prevalence of cheating interactions leads to the formation of phenotypically similar species groups distinct from others, resulting in increased trait disparity. These clustered trait patterns subsequently influence interaction dynamics in simulated networks, promoting the development of modules comprising interacting species. Our findings suggest that cheaters in mutualisms play a role in generating phenotypic clusters, counteracting selection for convergence dictated by mutualistic patterns, and facilitating the emergence of interacting species modules.
Selection imposed by ecological interactions is a significant force influencing phenotypic patterns observed across various levels of biological organization (Thompson, 2005). This selection, as highlighted by Zhang et al. (2012), plays a crucial role in shaping trait matching among interacting individuals, trait distributions within populations (Bronstein et al., 2003), trait variation across populations of the same species (Thompson, 2005), and trait patterns at the community level (Strauss & Irwin, 2004). At the community level, ecological interactions can drive trait convergence (Wilson et al., 2012) and trait disparity (Siepielski & Benkman, 2010). Theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence suggest that different ecological interactions, such as mutualistic or antagonistic relationships, may lead to distinct trait outcomes within communities (Thompson, 1994).
Mutualistic interactions can promote trait matching, which refers to the similarity in traits between species that interact. While mutualisms can also result in other trait patterns like the intensification of traits, trait matching is a commonly observed phenomenon in various mutualistic systems, such as pollination by flies and bees, seed dispersal by birds and bats, and M√ºllerian rings in velvet ants. This trait matching is anticipated as a consequence of reciprocal selection, potentially enhancing interaction efficiency in mutualistic relationships. On the contrary, antagonistic interactions, such as those between parasites and hosts, typically lead to trait mismatching, fostering coevolutionary dynamics like coevolutionary alternation and escalation. These dynamics contribute to the maintenance or amplification of trait variation both across and within species involved in these interactions.
Antagonisms and mutualisms coexist in nature in various ways, with studies delving into the combined effects of these interactions on population dynamics (e.g., Meli√°n et al. 2009), community stability (e.g., Wilson et al. 2003), and network structure (e.g., Genini et al. 2010). It is crucial to acknowledge the diverse outcomes interactions can yield within a single community, with extremes along the gradient between mutualism and antagonism (Fontaine et al. 2011, Rodr√≠guez-Rodr√≠guez et al. 2017). Individuals of the same species can play dual roles as antagonists or mutualistic partners of the same interacting species, such as seed-caching rodents acting as both seed predators and dispersers of a plant species (Loayza et al. 2014). In other instances, individuals may exhibit antagonistic behavior towards some species while engaging in mutualistic interactions with others (G√≥mez et al. 2018, G√≥mez et al. 2014, Montesinos-Navarro et al. 2017). Additionally, certain species have specialized cheaters within their populations, exploiting mutualistic interactions without reciprocating benefits, as seen in fig wasps and yucca moths (Bronstein 2001). Consequently, in mutualistic interactions, selection pressures may drive the evolution of life histories that exploit resources and services from mutualistic partners without providing benefits, leading to what is termed as cheating interactions (Bronstein 2001, Vieira et al. 2003).
Understanding the impact of cheater interactions on evolutionary patterns in mutualisms is a growing area of research, with implications for coevolution and local adaptation. An illustrative example is the relationship between the plant Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae) and the floral-parasitic moth Greya politella, which transitions from parasitism to mutualism in the absence of legitimate pollinators for L. parviflorum within the community (Thompson & Cunningham, 2002). Investigating the evolutionary consequences of ecological interactions at the community level poses a significant challenge due to the interconnected nature of pairwise interactions within ecological networks. Cheating interactions, characterized by a negative impact on one partner and a positive effect on the other, can lead to cascading evolutionary changes through indirect effects, influencing the evolution of species traits and shaping community interactions (Guimar√£es et al., 2017). Given the non-random structure of interaction networks, central species play a crucial role in maintaining network integrity and enhancing the stability of selection pressures among species (Mart√≠n Gonz√°les et al., 2010). However, the specific impact of central cheaters on mutualistic coevolutionary dynamics remains an area requiring further investigation.
In this study, we employ a quantitative trait mathematical model, empirical networks of species interactions, and numerical simulations to examine the impact of cheater interactions on coevolution within mutualistic networks. Our investigation focuses on three key inquiries: i) How do varying frequencies of cheating interactions influence coevolutionary dynamics? We anticipate that scenarios with increased frequencies of cheater interactions will result in a higher trait mismatch due to the arms race dynamics favored by cheaters. ii) Do central cheater species exacerbate the impact of cheating interactions on trait evolution? Given the influential role of central species in shaping the trait evolution of multiple other species, we predict that central cheater species will magnify the effect of cheating interactions on trait evolution within mutualistic networks. iii) What are the implications of cheating interactions on the structure of mutualistic networks? Assuming that cheating interactions promote arms race dynamics, we hypothesize that higher frequencies of cheater interactions will lead to increased trait matching among species engaged in arms races but heightened trait mismatch with other partners, potentially resulting in interaction loss. Consequently, we expect that elevated frequencies of cheater interactions will give rise to greater arms race dynamics and, subsequently, a higher frequency of interaction loss, ultimately leading to networks with increased modularity (see Figure 1b).
Our discrete-time evolutionary model elucidates the evolution of the average trait of a species i, Zi, influenced by selection stemming from ecological interactions and various environmental factors such as abiotic conditions. Within this model, the selection differential, S, and the additive genetic variance of the trait dictate the changes in the trait over successive generations (Lande 1976). We postulate that S comprises three components that potentially impact the evolution of trait Z: selection driven by (i) mutualisms, (ii) cheating interactions, and (iii) other environmental factors. Initially, we make the simplifying assumption that, within a specific interaction, species are categorized as either mutualistic partners or cheaters, although a species may act as a cheater towards species j while behaving as a mutualistic partner towards species k.
The mutualism component, Smi, is characterized as the cumulative selective effects induced by all mutualistic partners of species i. It is posited that selection driven by mutualism promotes trait congruence among mutualistic partners, with perfect trait congruence between partners i and j achieved when |Zj(t) - Zi(t)| = 0 (Guimar√£es et al., 2011). A species can engage with multiple mutualistic partners, each potentially exerting varying influences on selection, denoted by mij(t) to describe the contribution of partner j to selection on species i. The collective impact of mutualistic partners on selection on Zi is delineated as: <>
In the cheating component, selection favors trait matching for the cheater species j (as in equation 1) but favors trait mismatch for the victim species i, which is defined as the species explored by the cheater. Similar to the mutualism component, our model dictates the magnitude of the trait change based on the evolutionary effect of species j on species i, denoted as vij(t). The selection for trait mismatching between the cheater and victim is determined by ùúÄùëñùëó.
In this study, we posit that when the difference in traits between individuals i and j is greater than or equal to ùúÄùëñùëó, denoted as |Zj(t)-Zi(t)| ‚â•ùúÄùëñùëó, the parameter Œ¥ij is set to 0, indicating that the cheater species exerts no selective pressure on the victim. Here, ùúÄùëñùëó serves as a trait barrier that hinders interactions due to dissimilar traits (e.g., Santamaria & Rodr√≠guez-Giron√©s, 2007). Conversely, if |Zj(t)-Zi(t)| is less than ùúÄùëñùëó, then Œ¥ij is assigned a value of 1, signifying that selection on victim i will promote either an increase or decrease in trait values based on the difference between Zj(t) and Zi(t). Specifically, a positive difference between Zj(t) and Zi(t) will yield a positive signal for ùúÄùëñùëó, while a negative difference will result in a negative signal (Andreazzi et al., 2017). Lastly, we consider the environmental component Sei as the cumulative impact of all other selective pressures that influence the optimal trait value, Œ∏i, for each species.
Combining the three selection components outlined in equations 1, 2, and 3, the evolutionary change of Zi in timestep t+1 can be expressed as: <>. Here, œÜi represents a compound parameter derived from additive genetic variance and the slope of the adaptive landscape. The parameter œíi, on the other hand, determines the relative significance of ecological interactions compared to environmental factors as selective pressures. Consequently, trait evolution within our model is characterized by: <>.
The evolutionary effects mij(t) and vij(t), which influence the extent of trait change resulting from mutualism and cheating interactions, are characterized as the relative impact of species j on i. Specifically, mij(t) is expressed as amijqij(t) and vij(t) as avijqij(t). Here, amij and avij represent the presence of mutualistic or cheating interactions between species i and j. The term qij(t) is defined as a function involving the parameter Œ±, which governs the sensitivity of the evolutionary effect based on trait matching between species i and j. Additionally, aik is set to 1 if there is a mutualistic or cheating interaction between i and k, and 0 otherwise.
We utilized 24 empirical mutualistic networks sourced from the databases Web of Life (http://www.web-of-life.es/) and Interaction Web Database (http://ecologia.ib.usp.br/iwdb/index.html). These networks consist of eight plant-pollinator networks, eight plant-frugivore networks, and eight ant-myrmecophyte networks. Each network is depicted through an adjacency matrix (A) where each species is denoted by a single row and column; the elements within the matrix indicate the presence or absence of the corresponding animal-plant interaction. Ant-myrmecophyte networks typically exhibit lower connectivity, higher modularity, and less nestedness compared to seed dispersal and pollination networks. In contrast, seed dispersal networks tend to be more nested and have greater connectance than pollination and ant-myrmecophyte networks (Supporting Information, Guimar√£es 2020).
Our simulations illustrate the temporal evolution of the mean trait Z (Figure 1a), with detailed values and model parameter descriptions provided in Table 1. Each simulation concludes after 1000 timesteps, a duration deemed adequate for the emergence of asymptotic trait values. Notably, equilibrium was typically attained before the 1000th timestep in most simulations. To expedite computations, we defined equilibrium as the point where |Zi(t+1) - Zi(t)|<10-4 for all species i, prompting simulation termination. A total of 72,000 simulations were conducted, with 3,000 per empirical network, tracking species trait dynamics over time in response to coevolution and environmental selective pressures (Figure 1a). All simulations were executed using R v. 3.5.3 (R Core Team 2018). Subsequently, we elaborate on how this modeling approach was employed to address each of our three research inquiries.
How do varying frequencies of cheating interactions influence coevolutionary dynamics?
We assessed the impact of cheating interactions on the coevolutionary process in our study. In each simulation, a probability p was defined to represent the likelihood that an interaction within a "mutualistic network" was a cheating interaction rather than a mutualism. We examined a range of p values from 0.01 to 1 to investigate how different frequencies of cheating interactions affected the coevolutionary process. Initially, we assumed that cheating interactions were randomly distributed across all interactions in the mutualism network, with the frequency of cheating interactions remaining constant in each simulation. This method of determining interaction outcomes based on p resulted in a network containing both positive and negative effects, combining the impacts of mutualism and cheaters within a single network. To define a cheating interaction, we considered it as having a negative effect on one partner and a positive effect on the other (i.e., an antagonism), prohibiting double-negative effects between species. The transformation from positive to negative effects based on p was applied only in the lower triangle of the adjacency matrix, maintaining cheating interactions as a mix of positive and negative effects. We also assumed that interaction outcomes remained constant over time, limiting our ability to explore conditional outcomes of interactions but providing a foundation for understanding how cheating interactions alter coevolution outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to relax the assumption of fixed interaction outcomes, allowing for shifts between positive and negative outcomes during simulations. These analyses indicated that temporal variability in interaction outcomes did not significantly impact our main findings (Supporting Information).
The coevolutionary dynamics were characterized by examining patterns in trait distributions across species. Initially, we quantified the average trait distance between species as an indicator of trait disparity within the network. This was achieved by calculating the mean pairwise distance (D), which involved summing the Euclidean distances of species traits across all possible pairwise combinations between species and then dividing by the total number of pairwise combinations (Ciampaglio et al., 2001). To further elucidate the trait matching resulting from coevolutionary dynamics, we employed Ward's hierarchical clustering analysis (Ward, 1963) in conjunction with the GAP validation index. This index served as a pre-analysis tool for the clustering algorithm, aiding in the determination of the optimal number of clusters within a given dataset (Tibshirani et al., 2001). Through this methodology, we were able to ascertain the number of trait clusters present among interacting species.
Do central species that exhibit cheating behavior amplify the impact of interactions involving cheaters on the evolution of traits?
Some species exclusively engage in cheating interactions, providing no benefits to their interaction partners (Bronstein, 2001). We propose that these exclusive cheaters could potentially magnify the impacts of cheating interactions, resulting in effects on trait distributions that surpass those observed in simulations where the same number of cheating interactions are randomly distributed across all ecological interactions (as seen in previous simulations). We anticipate that this amplification would be more pronounced if the exclusive cheaters are highly connected or play central roles in the network structure. To investigate the influence of these highly connected exclusive cheaters on coevolutionary outcomes, we identified the most connected species in the network and designated them as exclusively involved in cheating interactions. This involved calculating the degree centrality (Newman, 2018), a standardized measure of a species' number of interactions within the mutualistic network. The weighted degree centrality Ci for a species i within a specific set (e.g., floral visitors) is determined by the formula <>, where ùëòùëñ represents the interactions of species i and No is the species richness from the opposite set of i (e.g., for a floral visitor, the opposite set comprises flowering plants). By computing a z-score, we can pinpoint species with extreme centrality values and identify the most central species, <> where ùê∂ÃÖ denotes the average degree centrality of the network and ùúé is the standard deviation of degree centrality values. To assess the impact of central cheaters on trait evolution, we designated all species with Si>1 as exclusive cheaters, resulting in a network where central species act as obligate cheaters - our Central scenario.
In conclusion, we contrast the coevolutionary dynamics of the Central scenario with those of a scenario where cheating interactions were randomly dispersed throughout the network (the Random scenario). The Random scenario was constructed by determining the frequency of negative effects in networks (fCh) within the Central scenario, as outlined in Equation 10, and applying this frequency value as a parameter in the networks of the Random scenario. Here, n(-+) represents the quantity of cheating interactions, while n(++) denotes the number of mutualistic interactions present in the network.
In the Random scenario, negative effects are dispersed throughout the network rather than concentrated in central species. For each of the 24 empirical networks and scenarios (Random and Central), we conducted 1,500 simulations, resulting in a total of 72,000 simulations. All simulations were run until reaching equilibrium.
iii) How do cheating interactions impact the structure of mutualistic networks?
In our initial coevolutionary model, the trait barrier ùúÄùëñùëó signifies that the impact of a cheating species on its victim diminishes over time. To investigate how cheating interactions influence network structure, we modified our original coevolutionary model by introducing an extra trait barrier, bij, which sets the maximum allowable trait difference between two species for interaction to occur: <>.
Note that ùúÄùëñùëó represents a trait barrier determining whether a cheater species selects a victim. In contrast, bij signifies that a potential mutualism or cheating interaction is prevented by significant trait dissimilarity between partners. By integrating bij into our model, we investigated how network structure evolves over time as a result of the coevolutionary process. In each simulation timestep, we assessed if interacting species exhibited trait value differences exceeding bij. Following equation 11, we severed these interactions, resulting in interaction loss. Given our focus on network changes due to interaction loss, once an interaction is severed, it remains so and cannot be reestablished during the simulations. Consequently, at the simulation's conclusion, the interaction network may display a modified structure due to link removal. Subsequently, we compared the initial and final network structures in each simulation for analysis.
In this study, we analyzed the network structure by evaluating two commonly used measures: nestedness and modularity (Almeida-Neto et al., 2008; Blondel et al., 2008). To assess the impact of coevolutionary dynamics on the networks, we calculated the number of interactions lost, denoted as F, at the conclusion of each simulation. Subsequently, we determined the structural changes within the networks by computing two indices: ŒîNODF (Almeida-Neto et al., 2008) and ŒîQ (Blondel et al., 2008). These indices represent the difference in network nestedness (NODF) and modularity (Q) between the final and initial states of the simulations for each network.
In our model, coevolutionary dynamics may decrease the overall number of interactions, promoting specialization. We further investigated whether the reduction of interactions through coevolutionary dynamics differs from a random removal of interactions from the original network. To address this, in each simulation, we constructed a third network by eliminating F interactions from the initial network. This resulting network maintained the same total number of interactions as the coevolved network, but the specific interactions removed were randomly selected. Subsequently, we contrasted the alterations in network structure resulting from random interaction loss with those stemming from the loss of interactions due to trait dissimilarity in coevolutionary outcomes.
How do varying frequencies of cheating interactions influence coevolutionary dynamics?
The proportion of cheating interactions directly correlates with the observed trait disparity among animal and plant species in the network (Fig. 2a-c). This trend remains consistent across the three types of networks analyzed, resulting in a notable increase in trait disparity overall (Table 2). Consequently, cheating interactions play a significant role in amplifying trait disparity across species, irrespective of the ecological network's structure (Fig. 2). Building on these findings, we have developed an analytical approximation that establishes a link between evolutive effects and species trait disparity. Both simulations and the analytical approximation reinforce the notion that cheating interactions contribute to a heightened trait disparity among species (Supporting Information).
In our study, we observed that cheating interactions have a significant impact on the number of species trait clusters. When cheating interactions were at low levels (p = 0.01, where p represents the frequency of cheating interactions in the networks), simulations showed a correspondingly low number of clusters (2.43¬±0.62, as depicted in Fig. 2d-f). As the frequency of cheating interactions increased to intermediate levels (p = 0.5), the number of trait clusters also increased (3.03¬±0.79). Interestingly, when the majority of the network consisted of cheating interactions, we noted a trend towards lower numbers of species trait clusters, akin to scenarios with low cheating interaction frequencies (p = 0.9, Fig. 2d-f). This suggests that elevating the frequency of cheating interactions can drive trait disparity in mutualistic networks by facilitating the emergence of trait clusters. However, it is important to note that these trait clusters tend to diminish under higher frequencies of cheating interactions.
Do central species that exhibit cheating behavior amplify the impact of interactions involving cheaters on the evolution of traits?
Our findings do not align with the hypothesis positing that highly connected species would exert a more pronounced influence on trait evolution within mutualistic networks, as indicated in Table 3. Notably, our simulation results reveal substantial variability in mean trait disparity across different scenarios and interaction types, as illustrated by the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles denoted by the vertical bars in Fig. 3a-b. Consequently, it is evident that highly connected cheater species do not foster greater levels of trait diversity compared to scenarios where cheating interactions are dispersed throughout the network, as depicted in Fig. 3a. Furthermore, the variability in the number of trait clusters among species across scenarios is also apparent, as shown in Fig. 3b.
What impact do cheating interactions have on the structure of mutualistic networks?
In our simulations, coevolutionary dynamics assuming p = 0 (no cheating interactions) resulted in minimal changes in network structure [ŒîQ ‚âÖ 0; ŒîNODF ‚âÖ 0]. With an increase in the frequency of cheating interactions, mutualistic networks exhibited higher modularity and lower nestedness (Table 4). This observed rise in modularity and decrease in nestedness was not replicated by random interaction removal alone. Furthermore, the changes in modularity and nestedness were not uniform across all mutualisms. Mutualisms that were initially highly modular and not nested in the empirical network (e.g., ant-myrmecophyte networks) showed weaker alterations in network structure compared to mutualisms with higher levels of nestedness (e.g., pollination and seed dispersal). Consequently, empirical networks influenced by cheaters shifted towards patterns of high modularity and low nestedness (Table 4).
In our investigation, we delved into the coevolutionary consequences stemming from cheating interactions within mutualistic networks. Our findings shed light on how trait evolution and network structure may undergo alterations as a result of cheating behaviors that manifest within mutualistic relationships. Prior research has already delved into the impact of mutualisms and cheating interactions on population dynamics (Law et al. 2001, Bronstein et al. 2003, Wilson et al. 2003, Lee 2015) as well as phenotypic evolution (Ferriere et al. 2002). In this vein, our study contributes to the advancement of our comprehension regarding the coevolutionary dynamics of multispecies assemblages in three distinct manners.
Cheating interactions within mutualistic networks have been shown to promote higher community-level trait disparity. These interactions, by favoring trait mismatching, contribute to an increase in species trait disparity, thereby introducing an arms race dynamic that counteracts the selection for convergence and trait matching in mutualisms. This phenomenon sheds light on one of the mechanisms that prevent perfect trait matching in empirical mutualistic communities. However, it is important to note that trait disparity cannot escalate indefinitely, as environmental pressures and distinct selection regimes play a role in limiting this increase. Factors such as limited genetic variation, anatomical and physiological constraints on fruit sugar content and flower size, and annual variations in soil nutrients can all act as restrictions on trait matching. For example, the limited pulp composition of fleshy fruits due to annual variations in soil nutrients can hinder the development of sugar-rich fruits that are highly attractive to frugivores, thereby limiting trait matching in plant-frugivore systems.
Cheating interactions can lead to trait disparity in mutualistic networks by forming clusters of species traits at certain frequencies. In cases of intermediate cheating interactions, a combination of mutualistic selection favoring trait matching and cheaters favoring trait mismatching can result in the clustering of species traits. Theoretical evidence suggests that the balance between positive and negative effects among species in real communities is approximately 1:1 (Dodds, 1997), indicating that our findings on increased trait disparity due to trait cluster formation at intermediate cheating levels could be empirically validated. The presence of cheaters in empirical networks may be underestimated, possibly due to the significant behavioral plasticity observed among interacting individuals (Genini et al., 2010; Bronstein, 2001). This behavioral plasticity, leading to intraspecific variation and occasional cheating, could significantly impact individual fitness. Consequently, trait disparity in mutualistic interactions may be higher than anticipated, emphasizing the importance of measuring trait disparity in empirical community studies for future research.
The significance of a cheater species in ecological networks does not alter the pattern of trait disparity resulting from mutualisms with cheating interactions. While species centrality is a valuable metric for identifying key species in ecological networks (Mart√≠n Gonz√°lez et al., 2010), it is not the sole determinant shaping network structure and dynamics. The distribution of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species within a network also plays a crucial role in maintaining network structure in the face of perturbations (Montesinos-Navarro et al., 2017). A future direction for our research involves investigating how the positioning of specific cheating interactions may influence coevolutionary dynamics.
The presence of cheating species within mutualistic networks can prompt a reorganization of network patterns, primarily due to heightened trait dissimilarity. Our research indicates that cheating behavior results in increased modularity and reduced nestedness within mutualistic networks. Notably, the emergence of modularity has been observed as a consequence of coevolutionary dynamics in antagonistic networks, contingent upon the selection intensity between victim and cheater species (Andreazzi et al., 2017). Our findings suggest an alternative pathway to the development of modularity in mutualistic networks, hinging on the extent of cheating interactions supported within these networks. The configuration of interaction networks is influenced by various factors, including species abundance distribution (D√°tillo et al., 2014), trait mismatches between plants and animals (Stang et al., 2007), and constraints based on phylogenetic and phenology (Jordano, 1995; Jordano et al., 2003). Our study highlights that cheating interactions have the potential to alter the structure of mutualistic networks through the coevolutionary process. Subsequent research endeavors could explore the impact of cheating interactions on cascading co-extinctions within mutualistic networks.
Our findings indicate that incorporating the selection imposed by cheating interactions that naturally arise in mutualisms is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of coevolutionary dynamics in species-rich mutualistic relationships. These cheating interactions alter the outcomes of mutualistic coevolution, resulting in heightened interspecific trait variation and clustering. We offer insights into the impact of various interaction types within a network and how they can influence trait diversity by promoting either convergence or disparity among interacting species (Sauve et al., 2016). The structure of simulated networks underwent significant changes with an increase in the frequency of cheating interactions, prompting further inquiry into the balance of positive and negative effects that uphold the structure of real-world networks. Our theoretical projections also shed light on how networks might adapt in a rapidly changing environment, where interactions are diminishing due to various anthropogenic influences, with uncertain repercussions for ecosystem functionality.
