ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE: To use the advantages of a ratio scale with verbal anchors in order to measure 
the risk perception in the novel coronavirus infection, which causes covid-19, in a health belief 
model-based questionnaire, as well as its validity and reproducibility.
METHOD: We used the health belief model, which explores four dimensions: perceived 
susceptibility (five questions), perceived severity (five questions), perceived benefits (five 
questions), and perceived barriers (five questions). Additionally, we included a fifth dimension, 
called pro-health motivation (four questions). The questions composed an electronic 
questionnaire disseminated by social networks for an one-week period. Answers were 
quantitative values of subjective representations, obtained by a psychophysically constructed 
scale with verbal anchors ratio (CentiMax®). Mean time for total filling was 12 minutes (standard 
deviation = 1.6).
RESULTS: We obtained 277 complete responses to the form. One was excluded because it 
belonged to a participant under 18 years old. Reproducibility measures were significant for 
22 of the 24 questions in our questionnaire (Cronbach’s α = 0.883). Convergent validity was 
attested by Spearman-Brown’s split half reliability coefficient (r = 0.882). Significant differences 
among groups were more intense in perceived susceptibility and severity dimensions, and less 
in perceived benefits and barriers. 
CONCLUSION: Our health belief model-based questionnaire using quantitative measures 
enabled the confirmation of popular beliefs about covid-19 infection risks. The advantage in 
our approach lays in the possibility of quickly, directly and quantitatively identifying individual 
belief profiles for each dimension in the questionnaire, serving as a great ally for communication 
processes and public health education.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, several viruses have drawn the medical and scientific community attention 
for presenting great risk to international public health. Among them are the coronaviruses, 
with great international projection due to the severe respiratory syndromes they cause, 
with middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) being the best known1.
A recent outbreak of human infection by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, now named 
SARS-CoV-2) has been reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Until January 10, 
2020, there were 41 reported cases for SARS-CoV-2 infection between December 8, 2019 and 
January 2, 20202. Due to the rapid virus spread through different Chinese cities, on February 
13, 2020 the Chinese government announced 59,901 patients with a concordant diagnosis 
of pneumonia and 1,368 people killed by the novel coronavirus infection. Then the World 
Health Organization (WHO) officially named the 2019-nCoV infection coronavirus disease 
2019 (covid-19)3,4. 
As a result of the easy mobility across countries, covid-19 cases spread to other 
countries rapidly and intensely. This has led authorities from several countries to adopt 
non-pharmaceutical control measures to avoid transmission, such as social isolation. 
Some countries, such as Italy and Spain, have faced difficulties in population adhesion 
to the measure. Brazil has adopted similar strategies to control the virus transmission. 
Such populational difficulty in adhesion to behavioral controls may likewise occur in 
our country.
Therefore, understanding the determinants responsible for people’s resistance to protective 
measures against the virus spread is of great importance for the effectiveness of social 
isolation-based public policies, avoiding or reducing non-adherence to the proposed 
social controls. We expect the health believe model to help finding determinants for 
such behavior.
The health belief model is a tool developed to explain patient’s behavior in the face of an 
illness or the risk of falling ill5–7. It was developed in the 1950s and considers that positive 
factors increase pro-health behaviors while negative factors decrease or inhibit them.7–9 
Thus, to adopt a health care behavior and/or avoid risks for diseases, the patient must: 
(1) believe to be susceptible to the disease; (2) believe that the disease will negatively impact, 
at least moderately, their life; (3) believe that adopting certain behaviors is indeed beneficial 
to reduce their susceptibility or, if they already have it, its severity; (4) overlap important 
psychological barriers, key for a successful prevention or treatment8,10,11. Among other uses, 
this model has been successfully applied to assess diabetes severity12, analyze protective 
factors for bulimia6 find determinants for oral health care13 and study different cultures 
perception on dementias11.
Therefore, this study aims to use the expanded health belief model to map the profile of our 
population in view of the behavioral controls imposed by covid-19 in our country. To increase 
the ability to analyze the responses, we have used a psychophysical scaling methodology by 
ratio measurement, by a Borg CR® ratio scale with verbal anchorage (centiMax®)14–18. This 
methodology showed to be highly efficient regarding ratio measurements acquisition as it 
facilitates quantitative responses for anchoring the corresponding verbal descriptors. Our 
experiments showed that the use of ratio scales with verbal anchors improves significantly 
the sensitivity and quantitative measurement of major depression scores19. Studies 
within the literature usually base the belief model on ordinal measurements, obtained 
through a Likert-type scale5,20. A considerable innovative advance in our study is the use 
of a quantitative ratio scale21–23. Thus, there is a higher amount of information obtained, 
enabling the use of quantitative and statistical tools of high predictive power, unlike 
ordinal scales, which restrict information to frequency levels with mode and association 
non-parametric analyses.

METHODS
Sample
The collection period was from March 17 to 24, 2020. The collected demographic data consisted 
of sex, age, schooling level, type of health system used, annual income, marital status, ethnicity 
or race, transportation system used to daily locomotion and chronic diseases.
Answers were obtained using a digital form disseminated in social networks (REDCap), 
characterizing a convenience sampling and snowball recruitment method. After explaining 
the experiment purpose, age was inquired. If the participant was under 18 years old, page 
was automatically redirected to the appreciation for the participation message. If they 
were older than 18, they could follow to the page containing the informed consent form. 
Once it was accepted, instructions were provided and testing began. Total time spent for 
questionnaire completion was 12 minutes (standard deviation [SD] = 1.6). The study follows 
the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its revised versions.
Procedures
Participants were consulted about their beliefs and knowledge regarding covid-19 
contamination. The questionnaire consisted of 24 questions. Perceived susceptibility, 
severity, benefits and barriers contained five questions each, besides four additional 
questions regarding behaviors and attitudes aimed at improving general health, which we 
call pro-health motivation.
Perceived susceptibility corresponds to knowledge and belief about coronavirus infection 
probability (e.g., “based on my overall health, my chance of catching coronavirus disease 
is...”). Perceived severity investigates the personal belief regarding individual suffering of 
the disease process and intensity of symptoms (e.g., “if I caught coronavirus disease, the 
chance of getting too impaired to do my daily activities would be...”). Perceived benefits 
concern the effectiveness of the behavioral mechanisms adopted to prevent the infection 
(e.g.: if I wear a mask, the chance to catch coronavirus disease by walking in the street 
or at work is...”). Perceived barriers approach the difficulties in respecting norms and 
instructions for protection and avoidance of coronavirus infection (e.g., “I think the 
possibility of using alternative transportation to come and go from my job instead of public 
transportation is...”). We expanded the original model by including the item pro-health 
motivation, which presents questions adopted for general health improvement (e.g., eating 
habits, exercise routine, etc.). 
The responses obtained were numerical values of a ratio scale with verbal anchors, derived 
from the centiMax scale®14,24 that represents perception (Figure 1). This scale enables a 
direct quantitative measure of the participant perception degree on a psychophysical ratio 
scale22,25,26. The advantage of this quantitative method with verbal anchors is that qualitative 
descriptive anchors help participants to quickly locate the region of numeric scale values, 
in Cmax units, that represent their perception. Up from this point, a numerical value is 
chosen, always seeking the choice that indicates the most accurate representation.
Participants were instructed to choose the number that best represented the question-
related perception, guided by the descriptors. Values could be integers or even contain 
decimals. It was crucial that the numerical information was as accurate as possible in 
representing participant’s perception or behavior.
Data Analysis
The Statistica (version 10.2, Statsoft, Tulsa, USA) program was used for statistical analysis. 
An asymmetry test was performed to establish the necessary condition for parametric 
statistics, i.e. normality. Although centiMax® ratio scale has been successfully used to 
study different health conditions such as major depression19, fatigue and shortness of

breath27, physical exertion15 and chest pain28, it has not yet been applied in studies of purely 
psychological variables. Therefore, it is important to test some psychometric parameters. For 
reliability, we used split-half correlations with Spearman-Brown’s correction, Cronbach’s 
α for internal consistency and total items statistics to identify possible variables with low 
contribution to the questionnaire. We also calculated the standardized alpha, the reliability 
if we used standardized values (transformed into z score) for the items in cronbach’s α 
calculation. Repeated measures variance analysis was used to investigate the association 
between scale dimensions and sociodemographic characteristics, such as income level, 
type of health system and transportation system used to daily locomotion, through 
statistics F. Effect size was measured by h². Spearman’s correlation was performed among 
scale values and demographic data on age, schooling level and income to attest to our 
measure convergence validity. To illustrate the possible added value of proportion data, 
belief profiles on coronavirus infection were built.
RESULTS
Our study collected data from 277 participants. The responses of 276, aged between 18 
and 76, of both sexes (women = 197) were used. The excluded response was given by an 
11-year-old participant. Table 1 shows the summary of the demographic data of the sample. 
Table 2 shows the descriptive measures of the sums for the answers of each belief model 
dimension. Mean values are similar, ranging between 52.5 (SD = 31.6) for the pro-health 
motivation dimension and 26.6 (SD = 23.0) for perceived benefits.
Questionnaire Analysis
We performed an analysis of reproducibility for the questions of each belief model dimension. 
Initial values showed a very good cronbach’s α (αC = 0.817) as well as standardized

α (αP = 0.821), and a low correlation among the items (r = 0.168), suggesting a great 
independence of the questions (Table 3). However, for question 3 of perceived benefits and 
question 1 of perceived barriers, item-total correlation values were very low (r = 0.06 and 
r = 0.08, respectively), suggesting they interfere negatively in our scale.

After the removal of these two questions, our scale showed a better cronbach’s α than the 
previous one (αC = 0.883), exceeding the 0.800 value. This allows to presumpt the high 
efficiency of the scale, since it represents 80% of the population expected variability. Likewise, 
standardized α presented a slight improvement (αP = 0.834), and the low correlation among 
items was maintained (r = 0.179), certifying an excellent internal consistency. Subsequent 
analyses were performed without the presence of these two questions.
The scale reproducibility was estimated by Spearman-Brown’s split half coefficient. The 
values found suggest a high correlation (r = 0.882), confirming a high convergent validity 
for our scale.

Comparison between Groups
The analysis of variance of the grouped scores of the items of each belief model dimension 
showed differences for perceived susceptibility regarding: type of transportation, in which 
urban transportation presented higher mean values (44.0) than personal vehicle (36.1) and 
walking (30.2) (F = 5.21; p = 0.003; h² = 0.014); household income, in which participants with 
income lower than R$ 1,000.00 presented mean values (16.4) significantly lower than all 
other income groups (F = 3.44; p = 0.008; h² = 0.009); and different severe illnesses, in which 
participants with autoimmune diseases (83.1) and diseases affecting the immune system

(42.8) presented higher values than other diseases and those without severe illness (F = 3.13; 
p = 0.008; h² = 0.022).
For perceived severity, schooling level showed a significant difference (F = 2.79; p = 0.016; 
h² = 0.012), in which participants with complete secondary education (47.9) and incomplete 
(72.3) presented higher values than those with higher schooling level. Within the group with 
severe illness, participants with systemic arterial hypertension (47.9) and diseases affecting 
the immune system (47.8) reported higher values, whereas those with autoimmune diseases 
had lower values (22.5) than other groups (F = 10.79; p < 0.001; h² = 0.022).
Perceived benefits dimension was significant for different participants regarding the health 
system used (F = 4.32; p = 0.037; h² = 0.007), as participants who used private health systems 
(21.5) presented higher values than those who used the public system (18.2).
Perceived barriers were the last dimension to present significant differences among 
participants (F = 3.79; p = 0.004; h² = 0.014), in which public transportation users presented 
lower values than others groups. Significant differences regarding participants’ sex were 
not found, nor were significant correlations between age and scale responses.
Individual Profile
CentiMax scale® enables a directly and quickly graphical analysis of each participant. 
Figure 2 shows the profile of two participants who present the sum values of the scale 
items practically equal (participant A – 45.9; participant B – 45.7). However, different 
beliefs regarding covid-19 can be clearly identified. The vertical line in the value of 
50 scale units represents the high perception of the item in question. From an application 
perspective, Figure 2 shows how our questionnaire associated with ratio scale use 
provides a quantitative and refined gradation, enabling the participant to express their 
respective perceptions and intensities with a higher level of detail when compared with 
other ordinal or nominal scales.
DISCUSSION
Our study successfully fulfills our objective of quantitatively mapping risk behaviors 
perception in view of the coronavirus infection risk through the use of the health 
belief model associated with a verbal anchors psychophysical scale, enabling a detailed 
representation of individual perceptions. This approach has proved to be very efficient, by 
identifying in participants with the same value of risk perception very different profiles 
within the variables. 
The results identified that some factors are significantly important to understand risk 
perception. The type of transportation used to get around on a daily basis significantly 
affects risk perception. Public transportation users perceive a greater contamination 
susceptibility than personal vehicle users and those who do their activities by foot. The same 
greater susceptibility perception was found in people with very low income and individuals 
with autoimmune diseases and diseases that affect the immune system (allergies and 
rheumatism, for example).
These findings are important sources of information for adopting public policies that 
seek the widest possible scope. The perception that using public transportation results 
in a higher covid-19 contraction risk than private and personal transportation is positive. 
However, the use of collective private vehicles, such as transportation apps, presented a 
great variability and, thus, did not differ from any of the groups. Therefore, we understand 
this is an interesting target audience to provide more information regarding contagion 
risks. Low income was also an important factor and should be seen in a complex way, 
as it is associated with reduced information quantity and quality, housing conditions that 
favor contamination and difficulty in interrupting daily activities due to economic reasons.

A fact that drew our attention was that people with diseases associated with a higher 
covid-19 contraction risk, such as diabetes mellitus and systemic arterial hypertension,1,3 
do not present a significant different susceptibility perception to contamination risk in 
comparison with the group of people without self-reported chronic diseases. A possible 
explanation is that these patients are mostly asymptomatic and remain with a stable and 
clinically controlled disease, behaving as individuals without chronic diseases. Such result 
allows us to develop information dissemination policies emphasizing or even particularly 
targeting this risk group. 
Regarding intensity of symptoms and characteristics of disease progression, participants 
with the lower schooling levels in our sample (some and secondary education) showed 
greater concern with possible symptoms, because their perceived severity representations 
were higher than in other schooling levels. The perception of greater symptom severity 
may lead these group to seek health services earlier. This problem is currently at stake due 
to the risk of unnecessary covid-19 exposure, as well as other serious diseases, by visiting 
health institution without real need.
Another curious result for severity perception was obtained regarding chronic diseases. 
Participants with systemic arterial hypertension and diseases affecting the immune system 
registered higher susceptibility than other groups. However, participants with autoimmune 
diseases reported significantly lower values than others, suggesting that precautions 
taken for the treatment and care of their chronic diseases are being positively perceived 
as protective factors to the exposure. The type of health system used had an impact on 
benefits perception regarding the access and treatment in case of covid-19. Public system 
users were less benefited in comparison with participants who use private health systems.
Results obtained through individual profiles enable highly informative and direct 
quantitative analyses. For example, if we look at question 1 of the health motivation item in 
Figure 2, we notice that participant A believes 30 units that the behavior of washing their 
hands prevents the infection by the virus. Participant B believes 120 units that this behavior 
is beneficial. For being a ratio scale, we can directly state that participant B believes four 
times more than participant A in the effectiveness of washing hands as a healthy behavior 
that should be encouraged or increased. When comparing question 2 of the perceived severity 
item, participant A believes twice as much in the chance of presenting severe symptoms 
and complications as participant B. If a Likert-type scale of 5 points were used, in the first 
case, the result would have been too high (or value 5, if a numerical score) for participant 
B and low (value 2) for participant A. In the second case, participant A would present a 
moderate result (or value 3) and participant B a low result (value 2). In this example, there 
is a clear difference between the use of a ratio scale and an ordinal scale, whose sensitivity 
and resolution impair the actual identification of participants’ representations.
It is also significantly important to discuss the methodology used in this study. The health 
belief model was developed over 60 years ago8,9 and is applied in several areas of health – such 
as ophthalmologist education29, study of behavioral aspects in eating behavior psychiatry6, 
use and abuse of illicit injectable drugs30, clinics for diabetes mellitus and endocrine12, 
among others. However, the customary use of this model includes open or semi-structured 
questionnaires, using Likert-type scales to perform psychological dimension measurements. 
Our study is a clear advance in the use of this model, as it applies a ratio scale with verbal 
anchors, allowing ratio measures and, therefore, presenting a high-potential information 
detailing in a quantitative manner. This methodology is noteworthy because even a good 
questionnaire may have its information gathering potential greatly impaired if an inadequate 
or low information capacity metric is used. S.S. Stevens’ work on psychological measurement 
and psychophysical scaling21,23 expanded our understandings on metric possibilities applied 
into the psychological universe. Likert-type scales are ordinal and, hence, positional. 
Their descriptors solely indicate orders and are unable to designate the distance among 
them. Therefore, ordinal scales use nonparametric statistical measurement such as mode, 
frequency, association and categorical correlation. Estimating medians on Likert-type

scales, although the order is numerically represented, is a fundamental measurement error. 
On the other hand, measurements within ratio universes, for presenting an absolute origin 
of mathematical continuums, enable higher-order statistics. Our study, therefore, presents 
a high information quality and objective metric.
Our group is already experienced in constructing psychophysical measurement and 
scaling of interval and ratio orders for studies of various psychological continua, such as 
symptoms profile in patients with major depression19, sexual attitudes31 and color concept32. 
We encourage the use of these psychophysical scaling models, especially verbal anchors 
scales, because they are easy to apply and to understand the task to be performed. In addition, 
they are associated with quantitative measurements of high capacity for information, 
intervals and ratio. Such factors foster a great potential for more detailed and quantitative 
studies in public health, which, like psychology, commonly faces complex characteristics 
of human behavior regarding prevention issues as well as health and illness risks.
Our study presents some evident limitations, which may have impacted some of the results. 
Our sample presents a thickening in moderate- and high-income populations, which may 
affect the sample representativeness. Therefore, subsequent studies should seek to correct 
this social heterogeneity within the sample. 
In conclusion, our health belief model-based questionnaire associated with a ratio scale 
with verbal anchors is an important instrument to understand the population perception on 
coronavirus infection risks in a quantitative manner, much more detailed and informative 
than the commonly applied questionnaires models and psychological metrics, such as 
Likert-type ordinal scales. The graphical analysis grants a quick access to the individual 
profile, enabling the development of information strategies and more individualized 
approaches, which will certainly have a greater impact on communication efficiency.
