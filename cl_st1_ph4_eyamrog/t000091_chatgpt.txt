Anxiety among dental patients poses challenges for both dental surgeons and patients, prompting the exploration of therapies aimed at managing this anxiety to enhance patient cooperation during treatment. This study seeks to review the literature on the utilization of herbal medicines for controlling dental anxiety. The search encompassed databases such as ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scielo, Pubmed, and The Cochrane Library, resulting in the inclusion of 57 articles. Research findings highlight Valeriana officinalis and Passiflora incarnata as the most extensively studied herbal remedies for anxiety management, demonstrating their relative safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, lower concentration of active ingredients with superior effects, and reduced side effects compared to benzodiazepines. Nonetheless, further investigation is necessary to elucidate the actual effectiveness, appropriate dosages, and potential side effects of these medicinal plants in conscious sedation within the field of Dentistry.
Anxiety represents a significant element of patients' stress within the dental setting, impacting a substantial portion of the population, ranging from 10% to 60% (Deogade & Suresan, 2016). Despite notable advancements in technology and science, particularly in pain management techniques, dental procedures can still evoke fear, with varying intensities among individuals (Dantas et al., 2016; Facco & Zanette, 2017; da Cunha et al., 2021). Invasive treatments like anesthesia are closely associated with feelings of fear and anxiety, which can be influenced by factors such as cultural background, past experiences, and gender (Vanhee et al., 2020). This collective discomfort often leads even the most composed patients to experience heightened anxiety levels prior to their treatment sessions (Araújo et al., 2018; Farah et al., 2019; da Cunha et al., 2021).
Anxiety can significantly impede dental treatment, potentially resulting in harm to oral health (Pinheiro et al., 2014; da Cunha et al., 2021). Patients who are anxious, fearful, or phobic often postpone or avoid seeking necessary oral health care (Deogade & Suresan, 2016; Araújo et al., 2018). Furthermore, anxiety symptoms can disrupt dental procedures, jeopardizing patient safety and the efficacy of treatment (Facco & Zanette, 2017), ultimately impacting their overall quality of life (da Cunha et al., 2021).
To address this issue and manage patients' anxiety, a range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions can be employed. In cases where non-pharmacological methods prove inadequate, sedation techniques may be utilized to regulate this response (Gordon et al., 2013; da Cunha et al., 2021). Specifically, the approach known as minimal sedation, as defined by the American Dental Association, involves maintaining a minimally depressed level of consciousness that enables patients to independently maintain their airways and respond to physical stimuli and verbal commands (Mancuso et al., 2004; da Cunha et al., 2021).
The use of oral tranquilizing medications serves as a viable option for conscious sedation, offering a means to manage stress induced by medical procedures and promoting patient calmness and cooperation (Loeffler, 1992). In the realm of dentistry, oral benzodiazepines are frequently employed for their ability to decrease basal metabolism, salivary flow, and the vomit reflex, while also inducing relaxation in skeletal muscles (Pinheiro et al., 2014).
Despite its low toxicity, benzodiazepines can lead to adverse reactions including exanthema, nausea, and headache. Furthermore, they have the potential to enhance the effects of ethyl alcohol and induce paradoxical effects (Pinheiro et al., 2014). Moreover, benzodiazepines may elicit unwanted responses such as drowsiness, cognitive impairment, anterograde amnesia, reduced motor coordination, and psychomotor effects (Fajemiroye et al., 2016; Farah et al., 2019; da Cunha et al., 2021). These negative outcomes have prompted the exploration of new alternatives for achieving minimal sedation in dental settings (Araújo et al., 2018; Farah et al., 2019; da Cunha et al., 2021).
Phytotherapy has gained widespread acceptance as a recognized treatment for depressive disorders, prompting research into its potential efficacy in addressing various anxiety disorders (Kinrys et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2015; Fajemiroye et al., 2016). Phytotherapy is characterized by the utilization of fresh vegetables, plant-based medicines, or extracts derived from vegetables in the treatment of various ailments (Fajemiroye et al., 2016).
The aim of this study is to conduct a comprehensive literature review to stimulate the interest of healthcare professionals, particularly dentists, in conducting controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of phytotherapeutic medications as a potentially safe and viable alternative for managing anxiety in dental patients. The goal is to explore the potential benefits of these medications in alleviating anxiety without causing unpleasant sensations in patients, thereby highlighting the importance of further research in this area.
The increasing interest in herbal medicines possessing anxiolytic and hypnotic properties within various medical fields stems from their perceived low incidence of side effects (Farah et al., 2019). Studies in plant-based psychopharmacology have uncovered a range of potentially beneficial medications that could offer relief in managing both general anxiety and specific anxiety disorders (Sarris et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015).
In recent years, researchers have shown a growing interest in the field of plant-based psychopharmacology. Various mechanisms of action have been identified in medicinal plants utilized for the treatment of conditions such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. These mechanisms often involve the reuptake of monoamines, impacting the activity of neuroreceptors and transporter channels. Additionally, these plants have been found to modulate neuronal communication or influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as highlighted in a study by Liu et al. (2015).
The anxiolytic properties of medicinal plants typically involve mechanisms that target GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). These effects may manifest through interactions with GABA receptors, direct modulation of ion channels, modulation of the cell membrane, inhibition of GABA transaminase, or inhibition of glutamic acid decarboxylase. The resulting increase in GABA neurotransmission hampers stimulatory pathways, leading to a calming effect (Baldwin & Polkinghorn, 2005; Manayi et al., 2016; Sarris et al., 2018; Farah et al., 2019).
There is a burgeoning interest in phytotherapy among both professionals and patients, as plants are recognized as abundant sources of biomolecules with therapeutic potential for addressing anxiety (Liu et al., 2015; Fajemiroye et al., 2016). Nevertheless, healthcare professionals often face a lack of knowledge regarding the appropriate utilization of phytotherapy, leading to doubts about its efficacy. It is imperative that accurate information on phytotherapy be disseminated to these professionals through scientific channels, thereby promoting the adoption of phytotherapy, ensuring patient well-being, and solidifying its significance as a crucial therapeutic modality (Sarris et al., 2013).
In the field of dentistry, phytomedicine has been utilized to elevate pain thresholds and serve as a sedative. It is crucial to ensure that herbal medicines and other natural products are applied correctly, taking into account their therapeutic effects, potential side effects, and any possible interactions with other drugs (Groppo et al., 2008).
The utilization of phytotherapeutic agents in dental practice remains a relatively recent development (Groppo et al., 2008; Pinheiro et al., 2014), thereby posing challenges in locating relevant literature or research pertaining to this subject.
Current pharmacological strategies for managing anxiety are actively seeking positive outcomes in clinical settings. The exploration of medicinal plants offers promising avenues for the creation of novel anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications, as highlighted by research conducted by Fajemiroye et al. (2016) and Facco & Zanette (2017).
Valeriana officinalis, an herbaceous plant from the Valerianaceae family (Houghton, 1999), is commonly found in various phytoterapeutic products known for their anxiolytic and hypnotic effects (Murphy et al., 2010; Becker et al., 2014; Farah et al., 2019). Its benefits encompass inducing relaxation in the central nervous system, reducing stress and anxiety levels, and enhancing sleep quality, often with minimal to no adverse reactions (Behboodi et al., 2016; Farah et al., 2019).
The chemical composition of valerian comprises volatile oil sesquiterpenes (including valeric acid), iridoids (valepotriates), alkaloids, furanofuran, lignans, and free amino acids like tyrosine, arginine, and glutamine. While it is commonly thought that the sesquiterpene elements in the volatile oil drive most of valerian's biological effects, it is probable that all the active constituents of valerian work together synergistically to elicit a clinical response (Houghton, 1999).
The combination of the three active principles, valepotriates, sesquiterpenes, and lignans, elicits effects akin to those of tranquilizers, hypnotics, and sedatives (Hadley & Petry, 2003).
The medicinal properties of Valeriana officinalis are ascribed to its volatile oils, valepotriates, and their precursors (Houghton, 1999; Ricigliano et al., 2016). Valerenic acid and valerenol have been shown to enhance the response of various types of recombinant GABA receptors (Becker et al., 2014). These oils act by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for GABA metabolism in the brain, leading to elevated GABA levels, which are linked to sedation and reduced CNS activity, thus confirming its central and non-peripheral action (Thomas et al., 2016).
The study examining the impact of valerian extract on diazepam withdrawal syndrome in rats revealed a reversal of the anxiogenic effects in abstinent animals treated with a dosage of 12 mg/kg of body weight of valerian (Andreatini & Leite, 1994).
Valerenic acid, known for its ability to interact with the GABA system akin to benzodiazepine drugs, was the subject of a study in rats that compared its effects with diazepam and scrutinized its chemical composition. The findings revealed a notable decrease in anxiety-related behaviors in animals treated with valerian extract and valerenic acid, underscoring the potential of Valeriana officinalis as a viable alternative to conventional anxiolytics (Murphy et al., 2010). In a more recent investigation involving rats subjected to physical or psychological stress, the administration of 0.5 mg/Kg of valerenic acid once daily for a span of 3 weeks resulted in diminished responses to both physical and psychological stressors (Jung et al., 2015).
In clinical trials, the sedative and hypnotic effects of valerian were demonstrated at a dosage ranging from 400 to 900 mg, administered 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime. Unlike benzodiazepines, valerian extracts did not disrupt voluntary movement and speech coordination, nor did they result in physical or psychological dependence (Pakseresht et al., 2011).
In a double-blind clinical trial, the anxiety levels of women undergoing hysterosalpingography, a procedure known for its stress-inducing and painful nature, were evaluated following the administration of valeric capsules. The study involved the provision of three valeric capsules, each containing 500 mg, in a single dose totaling 1,500 mg, along with prophylaxis, administered 30 minutes prior to the procedure. The findings indicated that the valeric medication proved to be efficacious in alleviating anxiety among women undergoing this particular test (Gharib et al., 2015).
In a separate study, the efficacy of Valerian in managing anxiety in patients undergoing bilateral extraction of impacted third molars was assessed. Patients were given either Valerian 100 mg or a placebo orally as a single dose one hour before the surgical procedure commenced. The findings indicated that Valerian exhibited an anxiolytic effect, suggesting its potential use for conscious sedation in adult patients undergoing impacted mandibular third molar extractions. Furthermore, it was noted that this herbal remedy did not result in anterograde amnesia, as patients were able to recall all aspects of the surgical intervention (Pinheiro et al., 2014).
In the study conducted by Farah et al. (2019), 20 anxious patients requiring bilateral extraction of lower third molars were selected to undergo the surgery and participate in the research. On the day of the procedure, patients were administered capsules containing either 100 mg of valerian or 15 mg of midazolam orally 60 minutes before the procedures in a randomized crossover, split-mouth design. The study aimed to assess changes in physiological parameters at specific times during surgery. Postoperatively, patients completed a self-assessment questionnaire to evaluate their anxiety levels. The results indicated that the use of valerian did not result in anterograde amnesia, whereas midazolam caused this effect in 40% of respondents. Consequently, 55% of patients expressed a preference for the surgery involving valerian over midazolam. These findings suggest that valerian may offer patients comfort and relaxation without sedation and with less drowsiness compared to midazolam, highlighting its potential benefits in dental procedures.
The literature presents various studies examining the impact of Valerian Officinalis extract on the management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (Andreatini & Leite, 1994; Pakseresht et al., 2011) and insomnia (Fernández-San-Martín et al., 2011). Furthermore, it indicates that V. officinalis demonstrates efficacy in alleviating emotional, physical, and behavioral symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome (Behboodi et al., 2016) while also mitigating neuropsychiatric adverse effects like sleepiness and anxiety in HIV positive patients (Ahmadi et al., 2017). Moreover, studies have highlighted the neuroprotective properties of V. officinalis in various neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (Pereira et al., 2011).
Several studies have indicated that V. officinalis exhibits low toxicity (Bos et al., 1998; Yao et al., 2007). A comprehensive literature review confirms Valerian as a generally safe herb across various studies, with the sole adverse effect being diurnal sleepiness, typically observed only at higher doses. Furthermore, no harmful side effects have been documented in studies by Kinrys et al. (2009) and Baek et al. (2014). This trend is consistent with findings from Pinheiro et al. (2014), where adverse reactions such as dizziness, gastrointestinal issues, allergic reactions, or paradoxical effects were notably absent.
Research has demonstrated that the utilization of Valeriana officinalis extracts does not result in side effects like dizziness, gastrointestinal issues, allergies, or paradoxical effects (Pinheiro et al., 2014). Furthermore, Yao et al. (2007) confirmed that the ethanolic extract of V. officinalis did not adversely impact the embryonic development and fertility of rodents.
In a recent study, the impact of a single dose of Valerian (1600 mg) on sedation was evaluated using standardized field sobriety tests and performance metrics from a driving simulator. The researchers confirmed that the immediate consumption of the herbal remedy did not impair the driving performance of the subjects in the simulator, as reported by Thomas et al. in 2016.
Moreover, valerian has been found not to enhance the effects of alcohol or central nervous system depressants, does not impede the capacity to operate vehicles or machinery, and does not lead to physical or psychological dependency (Ugalde et al., 2005). Nevertheless, according to Hendriks et al. (1985) and Leuschner, Müller, and Rudmann (1993), Valerian-based herbal medicine could potentially interact with barbiturates and benzodiazepines, resulting in an escalation of the therapeutic impacts of these medications and intensifying central nervous system depression.
The decision to utilize valerian as a substitute for benzodiazepines stemmed from its documented anxiolytic and sedative attributes, which have been validated in both clinical and experimental research. Furthermore, supported by existing literature, this herbal remedy appears to exhibit minimal side effects, garnering positive reception from patients receiving medical treatment (Hadley & Petry, 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2014; Gharib et al., 2015).
Limited research has been conducted on the utilization of valerian in dentistry, highlighting the necessity for well-designed controlled trials to enhance the body of evidence regarding the effectiveness of this product in conscious sedation (Pinheiro et al., 2014; Farah et al., 2019).
In 1569, the Spanish explorer Monardus discovered Passiflora incarnata (Passifloraceae), commonly known as passion fruit or passionflower. This plant has been found to possess sedative and anxiolytic properties, as supported by various studies (Dhawan, Kumar & Sharma, 2001; Carlini, 2003; Miroddi et al., 2013; da Cunha et al., 2021). Its historical use includes treating anxiety, insomnia, drug dependence, mild infections, and pain (Schunck et al., 2017). Moreover, recent research suggests its potential in managing anxiety related to dental procedures (Kaviani et al., 2013; da Cunha et al., 2021).
In a study comparing Passiflora incarnata extract (45 mg/day) with oxazepam (30 mg/day) for the treatment of generalized anxiety, it was found that benzodiazepines, such as oxazepam, can lead to undesirable effects during therapeutic administration (Akhondzadeh et al., 2001). The results indicated that the passiflora extract had a slower onset of action compared to oxazepam, but did not result in any decrease in cognitive functions or work performance during its use, unlike oxazepam.
Grundmann et al. (2008) conducted a study to assess the anxiolytic properties of a commercially extracted phytochemically characterized from Passiflora incarnata in mice using the elevated plus maze test. Following oral administration, the extract demonstrated an anxiolytic effect comparable to diazepam (1.5 mg/Kg) at a dose of 375 mg/Kg, displaying a U-shaped dose-response curve. Furthermore, they conducted antagonistic studies employing flumazenil for the GABA/benzodiazepine receptors and WAY-100635 for the 5-HT1A receptor. The anxiolytic effect at the active dose was effectively counteracted by flumazenil but not by WAY-100635. This research marked the first in vivo evidence of the GABA-mediated anxiolytic activity of a Passiflora incarnata extract.
In their study, Movafegh et al. (2008) carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 60 patients who were randomly allocated to receive either Passiflora incarnata (500 mg) or a placebo as a premedication 90 minutes prior to surgery. The researchers assessed anxiety levels, sedation, and psychomotor function. Their findings indicated that the oral administration of Passiflora incarnata as a pre-anesthetic medication effectively alleviated anxiety without causing sedation in the patients.
In their study, Aslanargun et al. (2012) examined the impact of pre-operative oral administration of Passiflora incarnata Linneaus on anxiety, psychomotor functions, sedation, and hemodynamics in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Their findings indicated that the pre-operative oral intake of Passiflora incarnata Linneaus effectively mitigated the rise in anxiety levels prior to spinal anesthesia. This intervention was deemed safe and efficient as an anxiolytic treatment, as it did not interfere with psychomotor function, sedation levels, or hemodynamics during the procedure.
A study was conducted to assess the efficacy of passionflower in alleviating anxiety during dental procedures. Sixty-three patients with varying levels of anxiety (moderate, high, and severe as per ASA classification) undergoing periodontal treatment were enrolled in the study. One group received 20 drops of passionflower extract the night before and 20 drops the morning of the treatment (at least 90 minutes prior). A second group received a placebo following the same administration schedule as the first group, while a third group received no medication. Results indicated that the administration of passionflower as a pre-medication significantly reduced anxiety levels (Kaviani et al., 2013).
In a recent study by Dantas et al. (2017), it was demonstrated that administering Passiflora incarnata (260 mg) or midazolam (15 mg) orally 30 minutes before the extraction of impacted mandibular third molars resulted in Passiflora incarnata exhibiting an anxiolytic effect comparable to midazolam. This finding suggests that Passiflora incarnata is a safe and effective option for conscious sedation in adult patients undergoing oral surgery. The study highlights the potential of Passiflora incarnata as a significant pharmacological alternative for managing anxiety during dental procedures.
In a recent study by Da Cunha (2021), a randomized, triple-blind clinical trial was conducted involving 200 asymptomatic patients undergoing impacted lower third molar extraction. The primary aim of the investigation was to evaluate the anxiolytic efficacy of 15 mg of Midazolam in comparison to 500 mg of Passiflora incarnata, 500 mg of Erythrina mulungu, and a placebo. The participants were divided into four groups, each receiving a different medication 60 minutes prior to the surgical procedure. Anxiety levels were assessed through questionnaires and physical parameter measurements. The findings of this study indicated that Passiflora incarnata demonstrated a comparable anxiolytic effect to midazolam, while the placebo and mulungu did not effectively manage the anxiety levels in these patients.
There is currently no evidence indicating any safety concerns associated with the use of herbal medicine. Adverse reactions are rare but may include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headache, tachycardia (Sarris et al., 2011), and anterograde amnesia (Dantas et al., 2017).
The Passiflora genus presents significant potential for the development of novel pharmaceuticals and health-promoting products. Investigations in this field are poised to make substantial contributions towards enhancing the quality of life for global populations (Trompetter et al., 2013).
Kava, also known as kava-kava, has seen widespread use in recent decades, particularly gaining popularity in Western countries for its anxiolytic properties (Baek et al., 2014). The active components of kava-kava, known as kavapirones or kavalactones, are integral to its phytotherapeutic properties. Apart from its effectiveness in anxiety management, this phytotherapeutic agent is utilized for mood modulation, acts as a skeletal muscle relaxant, and has a mild depressant effect on central nervous system activity (Fajemiroye et al., 2016).
The pharmacological properties of kava encompass voltage-dependent sodium-channel blockage, heightened GABA binding, reduced release of excitatory neurotransmitters through calcium ion channel blockage, neuronal depression, and noradrenaline uptake (norepinephrine). Furthermore, kava exhibits reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase and suppression of eicosanoid thromboxane synthesis activity, which antagonizes GABA receptor function (Jamieson & Duffield, 1990; Singh & Singh, 2002; Tzeng et al., 2015).
Clinical studies have assessed the effectiveness of a kava extract compared to a placebo in individuals experiencing symptoms of anxiety, with findings indicating a notable reduction in these symptoms (Witte et al., 2005; Sarris et al., 2013). Furthermore, this herbal remedy demonstrates promising outcomes across various symptoms and disorders, encompassing general anxiety, tension, restlessness, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and insomnia (Baek et al., 2014).
The meta-analysis conducted by Pittler & Ernst (2003, 2003) encompassed seven studies involving patients with anxiety disorders, revealing a notable reduction in anxiety levels as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. Conversely, Sarris et al. (2020) conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 171 participants diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder to assess the efficacy of kava-kava at two doses of 120mg administered twice daily. The findings indicated that this specific extract did not prove effective in treating generalized anxiety disorder. Nevertheless, in instances of "situational" anxiety, such as that experienced in dental settings, this medication may serve as a viable anxiolytic due to its potential for short-term sedation.
The systematic literature review conducted by Araújo et al. (2021) highlighted that the commonly utilized and efficacious medications for managing anxiety in dental patients included alprazolam (0.5 and 0.75 mg), midazolam 15 mg, Passiflora incarnata 260 mg, and Valeriana officinalis 100 mg. These medications were also frequently associated with adverse effects, leading many patients to opt against their use, prompting healthcare professionals to seek alternative options. Consequently, a thorough assessment of the patient and their anxiety levels should be conducted beforehand to determine the most suitable medication for their individual needs.
Herbal agents are regarded as relatively safe, effective, and cost-effective medications that result in fewer side effects compared to benzodiazepines. A key benefit lies in their lower concentration of active principles, which can yield superior effects, offering a substitute for the overuse of anxiolytics. Nevertheless, further research is imperative to ascertain the actual efficacy, appropriate dosage, and potential side effects of these medicinal plants in conscious sedation within the field of Dentistry.
