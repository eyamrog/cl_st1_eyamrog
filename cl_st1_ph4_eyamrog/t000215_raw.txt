Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global 
pandemic affecting the world, seen in more than 
1,300,000 patients. COVID-19 acts through the 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. 
Cardiovascular comorbidities are more common with 
COVID-19, and nearly 10% of cases develop myocarditis 
(22% of critical patients). Further research is needed to 
continue or discontinue ACE inhibitors and angiotensin 
receptor blockers, which are essential in hypertension and 
heart failure in COVID-19. Intensive research is promising 
for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been 
characterized as a global pandemic. As of March 28, 2020, 
there were infected patients in 167 countries worldwide 
and more than 1,300,000 cases with approximately 69,780 
deaths.1 The outbreak originated in China, and the number 
of cases outside China has exceeded the number of cases 
in China. It is increasing steadily as of March 28, 2020. 
Furthermore, the number of deaths in Italy now exceeds three 
times the total number in China. COVID-19 interacts with the 
cardiovascular system and increases morbidity and mortality 
by causing myocardial dysfunction in patients with previous 
cardiovascular comorbidities.
COVID-19 causes severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In its single-chain envelope 
structure, the RNA virus is the seventh known human 
coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 differs from the coronaviruses 
that caused zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV)² in 2002 and middle east 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)³ in 2012. 
SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have 89% to 96% nucleotide 
similarity with bat coronaviruses and to be caused by bats, 
similar to other coronaviruses.4 Like SARS-CoV-1 and 
MERS, SARS-CoV-2 can pass from bats to an intermediate 
host (possibly a Malayan pangolin sharing 91% nucleotide 
identity) and then to humans.5
SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Figure 1) after activation of 
the spike protein by transmembrane protease, serine 2 
(TMPRSS2).6 ACE2 is mainly expressed in the lung (type 
II alveolar cells),7 and this appears to be the dominant 
access site. ACE2 is highly released in the heart in cases of 
excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin system, such 
as hypertension (HT), congestive heart failure (CHF), and 
atherosclerosis.8 In addition to its cardiac effects, ACE2 
is expressed in the lung, intestinal epithelium, vascular 
endothelium, and kidneys, which is one of the causes of 
multiple organ failure in SARS-CoV-2 infection.8,9 Evidence 
for the association of COVID-19 with morbidity and mortality 
is growing in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In this review, 
we aimed to share up-to-date data on COVID-19, which 
spreads very rapidly.
COVID-19 in CVD
CVD was a common comorbidity in SARS and MERS 
infections before COVID-19. The prevalence of diabetes 
mellitus (DM) and CVD in SARS was 11% and 8%, respectively, 
and the presence of both comorbidities had a twelve-fold risk 
of death.10 DM and HT were common in approximately 50% 
of MERS cases.11 The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities 
also applies to COVID-19, and its importance increases in 
more severe cases. In Wuhan, 30% of infected patients (48% 
of survivors) had HT; 19% had DM (31% of survivors), and 
8% had KVH (13% of survivors).12 In a cohort of 138 patients 
with COVID-19, cardiovascular comorbidities were similarly

common (46% overall, 72% in intensive care patients). 
Of these, 31% had HT (58% in intensive care patients); 15% 
had CVD (25% in intensive care patients), and 10% had DM 
(22% intensive care patients).13
In a cohort analysis of 1,099 outpatients and inpatients, 
24% had some comorbidity (58% among intubation or death); 
15% had HT (36% among intubation or death); 7.4% had 
DM (27% among intubation or death), and 2.5% had KVH 
(9% among those with intubation or death).14 The Chinese 
National Health Commission reported that 35% of patients 
diagnosed with COVID-19 had HT, and 17% had coronary 
heart disease.15 A metaanalysis in China showed that, in 
46,248 infected patients, the most common comorbidity 
was HT.16 The possible mechanism of these associations is 
considered to be more common in people with advanced age, 
impaired immune system, high ACE2 levels, or predisposition 
to CVD. Another study conducted in China indicated that the 
most common comorbidity seen in patients who died from 
COVID-19 was CVD with 10.5% (Figure 2).17
COVID-19 and myocardial damage
Myocardial damage, with increased cardiac biomarkers, 
was among the first cases in China. In a study with 138 
patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, cardiac damage with high 
sensitivity Troponin I (hs-cTnI) and ECG or echocardiographic 
abnormalities were generally present in 7.2% of patients and 
22% of patients in need of intensive care.13 The Chinese 
national health report stated that approximately 12% of 
patients without CVD have increased troponin levels or arrest 
rates during hospitalization.15 Hs-cTnI, in particular, was above 
the 99th percentile upper reference limit in 46% of survivors.12
Initial results show that there are two myocardial damage 
patterns with COVID-19. One study showed that on the fourth 
day following the onset of symptoms, the median hs-cTnI 
level in survivors was 8.8 pg/mL and 2.5 pg/mL in those who 
died. During follow-up, mean hs-cTnI between survivors did 
not change significantly (2.5 – 4.4 pg/mL), but on the seventh 
day, hs-cTnI values ​​were 24.7 pg/mL; 55.7 pg/mL on the 13th 
day; 134.5 pg/mL on the 19th day, and 290.6 pg/mL on the 
22nd day. In particular, average time from onset of symptoms 
to death was 18.5 days (IQR 15 – 20 days).12 
The increased hs-cTnI level was associated with other 
inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer, ferritin, interleukin-6 
[IL‑6], lactate dehydrogenase). This was the reason for 
the cytokine storm or secondary hemophagocytosis. Viral 
myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy is mostly reported 
in the cases who mostly present with cardiac symptoms. 
Recently, a case with chest pain with ST-segment elevation 
on ECG but normal coronaries was reported. The patient 
had reduced ejection fraction (EF) (27%), increased left 
ventricular diameters, and high cardiac biomarkers (troponin 
T > 10 ng/mL, NT-proBNP > 21,000 pg/mL).18 Intravenous 
immunoglobulin and steroids improved his cardiac capacity 
within three weeks.
In another report from China, a 63-year-old male with no 
cardiac history had severe respiratory symptoms, enlarged 
left ventricle (LVEDD 6.1 cm), and fulminant myocarditis with 
reduced EF. He had higher troponin-I (> 11 ng/mL) and NT-
proBNP (> 22,000 pg/ml) levels. Extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation and intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, 
antiviral treatment regimens were applied because of the 
cardiogenic shock situation. Ventricular function improved 
significantly within 2 weeks.19
Glucocorticoid therapy is not recommended by the world 
health organization because the effect of this therapy is still 
uncertain.20,21 China’s national report also reported that 
symptoms might be palpitations and chest pain rarely.15 Limited 
data showed a lower incidence of fulminant myocarditis and

cardiogenic shock. However, the rate of recovery and treatment 
is not yet at a systematic level.
The exact mechanism of COVID-19’s cardiac involvement is 
still under investigation. A potential mechanism is ACE2‑mediated 
direct myocardial involvement. It was observed that a myocardial 
infection due to ACE2 was also triggered by SARS-CoV pulmonary 
infection developed by in murine model.²² During the Toronto 
SARS epidemic, SARS-CoV viral RNA was detected in 35% of 
autopsies.²³ Other possible mechanisms of cardiac involvement 
related to21 COVID-19 are cytokine storm induced by an 
imbalanced response between T helper cell subtypes and excess 
intracellular calcium inducing hypoxic cardiomyocyte apoptosis.¹²
The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 
angiotensin receptor blockers 
ACE2 is an ACE homolog that converts angiotensin II to 
angiotensin 1-7, thereby reducing vasoconstriction mediated by 
the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) use is 
common in CVD (HT, coronary artery disease [CAD], CHF, and 
DM). There are conflicting data from studies showing that these 
drugs increase ACE2 levels.24,25 SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 in 
order to gain entry into cells. However, ACE2 has a protective 
role against acute lung injury.
In a murine model, binding of the SARS-CoV spike protein 
to ACE2 is the reason for ACE2 downregulation, increased 
angiotensin II levels, pulmonary vascular permeability, pulmonary 
edema, and impaired lung function. However, treatment with 
recombinant ACE226 and losartan27 reduced the degree of lung 
injury. Studies are currently underway in patients with COVID-19 
due to the potential to reduce lung damage with losartan.28 
Currently, no recommendations have been reported on the 
continuation or discontinuation of ACEi, ARB or other renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists. Due to the 
lack of evidence about the harms of RAAS antagonists, RAAS 
therapy will continue in COVID-19.29
Peng et al.30 reported that patients with COVID-19 and 
CVD had a higher risk of mortality. Critical patients also had low 
lymphocyte counts and high body mass index (BMI). ACEI/ARB 
usage does not affect morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 
patients with CVD. Aggravating causes of death include fulminant 
inflammation, lactic acid accumulation, and thrombotic events.
COVID-19 has caused great damage to the health and 
economic situation of China. How to deal with aortic diseases has 
become a serious problem in this situation. Rapid diagnosis, safe 
and effective transportation, implementation of the interventional 
procedure, protection of the vascular surgery team, postoperative 
management, and follow-up of such patients are urgent problems 
for patients. More studies are needed to minimize complications 
in vascular diseases, critical emergencies in vascular surgery and 
even manage routine vascular diseases with COVID-19. ³¹
Drug Therapy and COVID-19: Cardiovascular Effects
Antiviral Therapy
Ribavirin and remdesivir are two agents that bind to the 
active site on RNA-dependent RNA polymerases on SARS-
CoV2.³² However, lopinavir/ritonavir inhibits the replication 
of the RNA virus and proves to have a synergistic effect with 
ribavirin.³³ Clinical trials are currently researching ribavirin 
and lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID19, and these antivirals 
were used as components of hepatitis C and HIV treatment 
for years.34,35
Ribavirin does not characteristically have direct 
cardiovascular toxicity. However, lopinavir/ritonavir may cause 
QT prolongation in patients with long QT.35 Both ribavirin and 
lopinavir/ritonavir have the potential to affect the anticoagulant 
dose.36 Ribavirin affects warfarin doses. It may be necessary 
to avoid CYP3A-mediated drugs such as rivaroxaban and 
apixaban with lopinavir/ritonavir treatment.37,38
Lopinavir/ritonavir may also influence the activity of P2P12 
inhibitors through CYP3A4 inhibition, lead to decreased serum 
concentrations of clopidogrel and prasugrel active metabolites, 
and increase serum concentrations of ticagrelor. In the United 
States and Canada, it is not recommended to use such drugs 
with ticagrelor due to the excessive risk of bleeding.39,40
On the contrary, clopidogrel may not always provide 
adequate platelet inhibition in the simultaneous administration 
of lopinavir/ritonavir.41,42 Prasugrel may be preferable to other 
P2Y12 inhibitors during lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. However, 
it is contraindicated in cases such as a history of stroke 
or TIA, low BMI, or active pathological bleeding. A test-
guided approach with alternative antiplatelet agents may 
be considered. Details about switching P2Y12 inhibitors 
have already been determined.43 cangrelor metabolism is 
independent of hepatic function, so drug interaction is not 
expected.44 HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) also 
have the potential to interact with the lopinavir/ritonavir 
combination. Co-administration may cause myopathy 
due to high statin levels. Lovastatin and simvastatin are 
contraindicated for co-administration with lopinavir/ritonavir 
due to the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Other statins, including 
atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, should be administered in 
the lowest possible dose, and they should not exceed the 
maximum dose indicated with lopinavir/ritonavir.35
Remdesivir is a research drug previously evaluated during 
the Ebola epidemic and currently studied in patients with 
COVID-19. Although extensive cardiovascular toxicities and 
drug interactions have not yet been reported, preliminary 
assessment of this drug during the Ebola epidemic noted the 
development of hypotension and subsequent cardiac arrest 
in one patient (out of a total of 175 patients).45
Other therapies
In addition to antiviral drugs, a large number of 
immunomodulators and secondary drugs are being investigated 
to prevent complications from COVID-19. Chloroquine, used 
as an antimalarial agent, blocks virus infection by increasing the 
endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion and stops SARS-
CoV2 activity in vitro.46,47 Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 
act toxic to cardiac myocytes. Risk factors include prolonged 
exposure (> 3 months), higher weight‑based dose, pre-existing 
heart disease, and kidney failure. Chloroquine cardiac toxicity 
occurs as restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy or conduction 
abnormalities that are thought to be due to intracellular 
819

inhibition of lysosomal enzymes in myocytes.48
Furthermore, due to the effects of chloroquine on CYP2D6 
inhibition, beta-blockers (such as metoprolol, carvedilol, 
propranolol, or labetalol) metabolized via CYP2D6 may cause 
increased drug concentration that requires careful monitoring 
of heart rate and blood pressure changes. Finally, both agents 
are associated with the risk of conditional torsade de pointes in 
patients with electrolyte abnormalities or in combination with 
agents that prolong QT. Short-term exposure to these agents 
as expected in the treatment of COVID-19 poses a lower risk 
for these dose-dependent side effects.49
COVID-19 cases complicated by severe acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) are currently treated by 
methylprednisolone.50 This steroid cause fluid retention, 
electrolyte irregularity, and hypertension, and it also interacts 
with warfarin through an unknown mechanism. Clinicians 
advise observing these drug interactions. Finally, severe 
COVID-19 may create difficulties in the application of routine 
cardiovascular medications; for this reason, patients at a risk of 
ischemic heart disease or heart failure may worsen.47
Other recently published studies
Recent studies provide promising information for treatment 
and follow-up of COVID-19. Diaz et al.51 showed that ACEi 
and ARB therapy increased the number of ACE2 receptors in 
experimental animals. ACE2 receptors serve as binding sites for 
SARS-CoV-2 virions in the lungs. This increase can produce serious 
disease outcomes. COVID-19 can suppress cardiac functions and 
cause myocardial damage. History of CAD and increased levels 
of cTnI are two major independent markers that affect clinical 
evolution of patients with COVID-19.52
In HT and DM, ACE2 enhancing drugs pose a risk for serious 
COVID-19 infection, so ACEi and ARB therapy require close 
monitoring. As calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have not been 
shown to affect ACE2 expression or activity, they may be an 
alternative therapy in COVID-19 patients.53 Age, presence of 
underlying diseases, secondary infection, and high inflammatory 
indicators in the blood are determinants of mortality in COVID-19. 
COVID-19 mortality develops due to virus-activated “cytokine 
storm syndrome” or fulminant myocarditis.54
Previous cardiovascular metabolic history may further increase 
the severity of COVID-19 and greatly affect the prognosis of 
COVID-19. On the other hand, a marked increase in myocardial 
damage is observed in patients with COVID-19.55 Recent 
studies have focused on the beneficial effect of chloroquine, an 
antimalarial drug, which is effective on the treatment of patients 
with SARS-CoV-2. Due to previous experiments with chloroquine 
in the field of antiviral research, the scientific community is more 
concerned with the treatment of chloroquine56 Among cases of 
COVID-19, patients with comorbidities have worse clinical results 
than those without comorbidities. More comorbidity is associated 
with worse clinical outcomes.57
Recognizing acute myocarditis as a complication associated 
with COVID-19 is important for close follow-up of patients 
affected by COVID-19 and increased knowledge of public health 
officials about this type of complication. Clinical surveillance and 
laboratory tests, including troponin levels, are essential for proper 
identification of COVID-19 and reduction of transmission. More 
studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids 
in suppressing the myocardial inflammatory response. It cannot 
be denied that antiviral drugs or chloroquine can contribute to 
the recovery of patients with COVID-19.58
Myocardial injury has fatal consequences for COVID-19. 
Patients with a history of CAD without myocardial damage have 
relatively better prognosis. Myocardial damage triggers cardiac 
dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation is one of the possible 
causes of myocardial injury. Closer follow-up and multiple 
treatment regimens should be considered for patients with a high 
risk of myocardial injury.59 Cardiac damage has been common 
among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and it is closely 
related to the risk of in-hospital mortality. More research is needed 
to clarify the mechanism of cardiac injury, and complications 
should be carefully monitored in COVID-19 management.60
Chen et al.61 observed that the elderly, male patients, and/or 
patients with high ACE2 expression-related diseases had worse 
prognosis when exposed to COVID-19. With preclinical evidence, 
renin-angiotension system blockade was thought to alleviate 
COVID-19. Multicentre studies are needed to test the hypothesis 
before making recommendations on potentially essential drugs.62
Conclusion
SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 is a global pandemic 
problem. KVH is more common in COVID-19 patients. 
Morbidity and mortality rate is high in these patients. Whether 
CVD is an independent risk or whether it is mediated by other 
factors (e.g. age) has not been clarified yet. Myocardial damage 
occurred in more than a quarter of critical cases. Clinical ACEi 
and ARB medications do not present problems according to 
the current evidence. Research is currently promising in terms 
of treatment.
