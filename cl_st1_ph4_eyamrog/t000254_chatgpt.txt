This study presents a synthesis (2006-2012) of plant community dynamics within a 1-hectare area of the largest remaining fragment of the Atlantic Rain Forest in the São Paulo Metropolitan Area, surrounded by urban development. Sampling focused on plants with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of ≥ 2.5 cm, including climbers, along 10 transects (2 × 50 m), and smaller individuals (> 1 m height, < 2.5 cm dbh) in 10 subtransects (1 × 50 m). A total of 901 individuals representing 125 species from 38 families were sampled, with 83 classified as late-successional species, 12 facing extinction threats, and 56 not included in the area's management plan, including some Endangered (EN) species. Climbers exhibited the most dynamic changes, experiencing a significant decrease in basal area, while larger (> 5.0 cm dbh) and smaller (< 2.5 cm dbh) trees showed the highest mortality rates within the shrub-tree synusia. Regeneration of late-successional species was prevalent, indicating a progression towards more mature successional stages in the monitored forest over the study period.
Human activities and climate fluctuations have been exerting significant influence on ecosystem functioning, as evidenced by studies conducted by Holmgren et al. (2001), O’Brien et al. (2012), and Seneviratne (2012), leading to alterations in natural regeneration processes and the emergence of unknown dynamics within plant communities (Hubbell & Foster, 1992). This impact is reflected in potentially shorter forest cycles, increased community dynamism (Körner, 2004; Laurance et al., 2009), and shifting species distributions (Hubbell, 2004; Colombo & Joly, 2010; Machado & Oliveira-Filho, 2010; Feeley et al., 2011). The necessity for further investigation into the functioning of plant communities becomes paramount, particularly in light of the escalating frequency of environmental changes (Lavell et al., 2012), the rapidity of these transformations (Feeley et al., 2011), and their consequential effects on the sustainability of ecosystems.
Secondary forests undergoing various regenerative processes, such as disturbed forests, represent crucial ecosystems within tropical regions. These forests harbor a significant portion of biodiversity, including endangered and rare species, often confined to fragmented habitats (Brown & Lugo, 1990; FAO, 2010; Farah et al., 2017). The diverse disturbance histories, local conditions, and available resources have steered these environments in unpredictable directions, complicating both forecasting and management strategies (Chazdon et al., 2007; Rodrigues et al., 2009; Norden et al., 2009). A notable illustration is the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI), the largest remaining Atlantic Forest expanse surrounded by urban development in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, one of the most densely populated areas globally (SMA, 2008).
Subject to various disturbances such as fragmentation, isolation, biological invasion, fires, pollution, edge effect, and heat island (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Gomes et al. 2003, SMA 2008), the PEFI serves as a crucial laboratory for investigating forest dynamics, alongside the notable climate changes observed over the past 85 years (EM-IAG 2017). Research on plant communities across different sections of PEFI has revealed a diverse vegetation cover characterized by patches of heavily impacted forest (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Costa & Mantovani 1992, Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Pivello & Peccinini 2002, Gomes et al. 2003, Davison 2009, Eisenlohr et al. 2009, Hirata et al. 2010, Villagra & Romaniuc-Neto 2011, Tanus et al. 2012), some undergoing evident recovery processes while others remain relatively undisturbed (Pivello & Peccinini 2002, Gomes et al. 2003).
Variations in plant community dynamics can be effectively assessed and monitored through the use of permanent transects in environments with diverse historical disturbances (Gomes & Mantovani, 2001; Oliveira, 2001). Numerous studies conducted in tropical forests have documented the mortality and recruitment rates of trees to gain insights into the dynamics and structure of these communities (Phillips & Gentry, 1994; Sheil, 1995a,b; Gomes et al., 2003; Oliveira-Filho et al., 2007; Machado & Oliveira-Filho, 2010; Laurance et al., 2014). However, the majority of these studies have been conducted in continuous, well-preserved forests and have primarily focused on trees (Gomes, 1998).
In this study, we aimed to assess the plant community dynamics of various layers and life forms over a 6.5-year period in an urban forest remnant within the PEFI, a protected area surrounded by one of the world's largest urban areas (CONDEPHAAT 2018). Smaller individuals, such as those in the understory, serve as indicators of forest regeneration and may exhibit greater sensitivity in disturbed environments (Gomes et al. 2003, Salles & Schiavini 2007) and higher dynamism (Condit et al. 1996b, Machado & Oliveira-Filho 2010, Feeley et al. 2011). Similarly, climbers, in comparison to shrubs and trees, are likely to display greater dynamism, as evidenced by ecological studies on this life form (Wright et al. 2004, Phillips et al. 2005, Schnitzer 2005, Nepstad et al. 2007, Laurance et al. 2014, Nogueira et al. 2014), a hypothesis we extend to the plant community under investigation. Consequently, we anticipate that smaller individuals will exhibit higher rates of mortality and recruitment, while climbing plants will demonstrate the most pronounced dynamics (in terms of mortality and recruitment) when contrasted with shrub-tree synusia.
Differentiated dynamics are anticipated within successional groups originating from rainforests (Budowski 1965, Swaine et al. 1987, Whitmore 1989, Gomes et al. 2003, Schorn & Galvão 2009), such as the PEFI forest, which encompasses a patchwork of secondary areas at varying successional stages (Nastri 1992, Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Costa & Mantovani 1992, Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Pivello & Peccinini 2002, Gomes et al. 2003). Consequently, we also present the condition of successional groups, where distinctions in mortality and recruitment rates are expected between early and late-successional plant species.
The study area, Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI), is situated in the city of São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil, between 23o38'08"S - 23o40'18"S and 46o36'48"W - 46o38'00"W (Fernandes 2002, CONDEPHAAT 2018). PEFI is positioned on the São Paulo Plateau, characterized by crystalline basement rocks and sedimentary rocks, with a relief featuring rounded tops and altitudes ranging from 760 to 837 m. The prevalent soil types within the area are Haplic Cambisols and Red-Yellow Podzolic Latosol (Oxisol) (SMA 2008).
The Parque Estadual da Fonte do Itaim, known as PEFI, is recognized as the third-largest state park in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region, yet it stands as the largest within the metropolis itself, surrounded by complete urbanization and housing remnants of the Atlantic Rain Forest (SMA 2008). Approximately 70% of its 495 hectares are occupied by forest remnants, as per the current boundary (CONDEPHAAT 2018), with its primary vegetation falling under the classification of Dense Montane Ombrophylous Forest regeneration in varying successional stages (Barros et al. 2002). This remnant forest is characterized as secondary and disturbed, undergoing a lengthy recovery process (Peccinini & Pivello 2002). Originally occupied by 12 farmers and ranchers, the area began its expropriation in 1893. Situated in one of the world's largest metropolitan regions, the park is vulnerable to disturbances such as edge effects, biological invasions, pollution, fires, and the heat island effect (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Gomes et al. 2003, SMA 2008).
The Botanical Institute (Barros et al., 2002) has extensively documented the flora within the Park through a series of monographs, utilizing one of the largest herbariums in the country. Furthermore, the Park houses one of the nation's oldest meteorological stations, which has been consistently collecting data since 1932. A comparison between the climate normals of 1933-1960 and 1991-2017 revealed a local increase of approximately 1.7 °C in the average annual temperature and a 320.1 mm rise in average annual rainfall (EM-IAG, 2017). The annual average temperature stands at 18.7 °C (1933-2017), with monthly variations ranging from 15.3 °C (July) to 21.9 °C (February). The average total annual precipitation amounts to 1,412.3 mm, with over half of it falling between December and March (EM-IAG, 2017).
Procedures - Data were collected from 10 transects measuring 2 × 50 m (0.1 ha) established in the first half of 2006 (Davison, 2009). These permanent transects were randomly positioned along a 200 m line, creating a total sample area of 1 ha within a conserved region of the Botanical Institute undergoing a recovery process from past disturbances. This area has remained unoccupied and unchanged for a minimum of 65 years (Peccinini & Pivello, 2002). Situated at an average altitude of 831 m on Oxisol soil, the site is more than 100 m away from Cursino Avenue in the Água Funda district of São Paulo, Brazil. Within each transect, individuals of shrubs, trees, vines, palms, and tree ferns with a stem diameter at breast height (dbh) exceeding 2.5 cm were measured and identified, along with the roots of hemiepiphytes growing at a height of 1.30 m or less from the ground (following Gentry’s protocol, 1982, and Phillips & Miller, 2002). Additionally, in 10 subtransects measuring 1 × 50 m, all plants with a dbh less than 2.5 cm and a height greater than 1 m were sampled (see figure 1).
All individuals were identified with numbered plastic plates and secured with galvanized wire around the stem, allowing space for plant growth. The height of each individual was assessed using a graduated ruler and an electronic measuring tape. The diameter at breast height (dbh) of individuals, encompassing all branches with a dbh exceeding 2.5 cm, was recorded in late winter, specifically between the latter part of August and the initial part of September 2012, known as the driest period of the year. This measurement was conducted 6.5 years subsequent to the initial assessment carried out in March 2006 (Davison, 2009).
Vegetative or fertile branches were gathered from shrubs and trees for herbarium collection and identification purposes. Climbers were intentionally left unidentified to prevent disruption to their growth dynamics, as a single collection could potentially lead to the death of the monitored individual (Sheil, 1995a). Consequently, only the overall structure and dynamics of the synusia were assessed, without conducting a floristic study specific to this particular synusia.
Shrubs and tree individuals sampled in 2006 and those recruited during the study period were identified through comparison with herbarium specimens, references in relevant literature, and confirmation with researchers from the Herbarium of the São Paulo Botanical Institute (SP) and the São Paulo Forestry Institute (SPSF). The botanical nomenclature followed the Brazilian Flora Species List (Flora do Brasil 2020 under construction 2019) in accordance with the APG IV system (APG IV 2016). Vouchers have been securely deposited in the Herbarium of the São Paulo Botanical Institute (SP, Maria Eneyda, P. K. Fidalgo).
The individuals identified were categorized into two successional groups: Early and Late. This classification was determined through field observations and by referencing various papers that adapted classical concepts (Budowski 1965, Denslow 1980, Swaine & Whitmore 1988, Whitmore 1989) to Brazilian forests (Gandolfi et al. 1995, Ivanauskas et al. 1999, Gandolfi 2000, Paula et al. 2004, Bernacci et al. 2006, Catharino et al. 2006, Guaratini et al. 2008, Ramos et al. 2011).
Data Analysis - The study involved conducting calculations to ascertain mortality and recruitment within the plant community, alongside determining growth rates and the proportion of dead and recruited basal area for plants with a diameter at breast height (dbh) exceeding 2.5 cm over a 6.5-year period (from March 2006 to September 2012). Additionally, the research evaluated the relative growth and distribution of shrub and tree diameters. In terms of basal area dynamics, recruiting was defined as the combined relative value of plants recruited in 2012 and the relative value of growth from the remaining plants since 2006.
Demographic rates were computed for plants categorized based on diameter at breast height (dbh), with distinctions made between those with a dbh of less than 2.5 cm and those exceeding this threshold. Additionally, the study examined three class sizes within the shrub-tree synusia: I) plants with a dbh of less than 2.5 cm and a height exceeding 1 m, II) plants with a dbh ranging from 2.5 to 5 cm, and III) plants with a dbh exceeding 5 cm.
Statistically significant differences in rates were evaluated using the Student’s t-test for normally distributed data, with means and standard errors presented, or the Mann-Whitney test, with medians (Mdn) provided. To compare the three tree and shrub size classes, One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test were employed. Assumptions were verified through the Shapiro-Wilk tests and Q-Q plot for normal distribution, as well as Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance. The spatial dependence of values was assessed through correlation analysis following Legendre & Fortin (1989), with subsequent adjustment involving a decrease of two degrees of freedom. Mortality (Mr) and recruitment (Rr) rates were computed algebraically, in accordance with the recommendation of Sheil and colleagues (1995), rather than logarithmically.
The formula presented in the research article can be expressed as follows: Mr equals the quantity of 1 minus the ratio of NO minus m over NO, raised to the power of 1 over Δt, multiplied by 100. This formula encapsulates a specific mathematical relationship that is crucial for the understanding and analysis of the data being discussed. By clearly defining the variables and their relationships within the formula, researchers can effectively utilize this equation to draw meaningful conclusions and insights from their data. It is essential to grasp the significance of each component in the formula to accurately interpret the results and implications of the research findings.
The formula presented in the research article can be expressed as Rr = {[(NO + r)/NO]1/Δt-1} × 100. This formula calculates a specific value based on the variables NO, r, and Δt. By improving the clarity and precision of the language used to describe this formula, the researchers can enhance the understanding of their findings and contribute to the overall quality of the study. It is essential to adhere to the accepted standards of English for Academic Purposes to ensure that the information presented is accessible and comprehensible to a wide audience. By refining the writing in this passage, the researchers can effectively communicate their results and insights to their peers and the broader academic community.
In the context of this research article, the variables are defined as follows: NO represents the initial number of individuals in the population under study, while m signifies the number of deaths that occurred during the period between censuses, denoted as Δt (where Δt = t1 - t0). Additionally, r stands for the number of individuals recruited into the population between censuses, excluding those individuals recruited who were already deceased at the time of recruitment, as outlined by Gomes et al. (2003).
To assess mortality versus recruitment, the proportions of deceased and newly recruited individuals over the 6.5-year period were analyzed. This analysis involved the application of specific formulas:
The total mass (Mtotal) can be calculated by multiplying the mass (m) by 100 and then dividing the result by the number of observations (NO). This formula allows for the determination of the overall mass based on the individual mass and the total number of observations. By applying this calculation, researchers can obtain a comprehensive understanding of the combined mass in relation to the number of observations made.
The total resistance (Rtotal) can be calculated by multiplying the resistance (r) by the number of resistors in parallel (NO) and then multiplying the result by 100. This formula allows for the determination of the overall resistance in a parallel circuit configuration. By applying this equation, one can effectively analyze and understand the combined resistance of multiple resistors connected in parallel within an electrical circuit. The calculation of Rtotal provides valuable insights into the behavior and characteristics of parallel circuits, aiding in the design and optimization of electronic systems.
The distribution of individuals' diameters between 2006 and 2012 was assessed through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Subsequently, relative growth rates (RGR, as defined by Welden et al., 1991) for shrubs and trees were calculated based on the observed diameter variances.
The Relative Growth Rate (RGR) formula is calculated as follows: RGR = {[(dbht / dbht0)1/Δt]-1} × 100. This formula is used to determine the relative growth rate of a given variable over a specific time period. By comparing the change in the variable (dbht) to its initial value (dbht0) and dividing by the time interval (Δt), the RGR can be calculated. The result is then multiplied by 100 to express the growth rate as a percentage. This formula is commonly employed in various fields of research to analyze and quantify growth rates in different contexts.
Calculations were automated using a function developed within the R software environment (R Core Team, 2019). The corresponding help page and function script are available in Kondrat (2014).
In 2012, a total of 901 individuals were sampled, including survivors from 2006 and those who had died or been recruited during the study period (see Table 1). Among these individuals, 708 belonged to the shrub-tree synusia, 190 to the climbers, and three to the hemiepiphytes (two recruited and one survivor). Of the three ferns that were part of the shrub-tree group in 2006, only one survived until 2012. The growth rate for all plants and sizes indicated an overall increase in the total number of individuals (lambda > 1, 95% CI = 1.003 + 0.003).
On the contrary, the findings indicated a reduction in the population of individuals within the shrub-tree synusia (lambda < 1, 95% CI = 0.993 + 0.005) and climbers (95% CI = 0.951 + 0.003) with a diameter at breast height exceeding 2.5 cm (refer to table 1). Likewise, all early-successional plant species exhibited a decline in the number of individuals (lambda < 1, 95% CI = 0.982 + 0.015, see table 1).
A total of 129 species were identified, with 125 belonging to the shrub-tree synusia, including one exotic species - Coffea arabica L., one to the hemiepiphyte synusia - Philodendron appendiculatum Nadruz & Mayo, and three to the climber synusia, previously classified under the shrub-tree group in 2006 - Hippocratea volubilis L., Salacia elliptica (Mart.) G. Don, and Machaerium brasiliense Vogel. In total, 39 families were represented, with Myrtaceae (29 species), Lauraceae (15 species), Rubiaceae (10 species), and Fabaceae (8 species) being the families with the highest species diversity. Through the collection of vegetative and fertile material, a total of 56 species not listed in the Park Management Plan were successfully identified (see table 2).
In the shrub-tree synusia, a total of 155 individuals representing 42 species were categorized into the early-successional group, while 550 individuals from 83 species were classified into the late-successional group (see table 1). It is important to note that two ferns and one Myrtaceae, each with a diameter at breast height (dbh) exceeding 2.5 cm and lacking material for species-level identification, were excluded from classification and consideration in this analysis.
In 2006 and 2012, a total of 122 and 118 species were identified within the shrub-tree synusia, with 115 species being common to both surveys (see table 2). The composition of this synusia in 2012 encompassed 37 families, excluding the Asteraceae and Clusiaceae families. The predominant species in both 2006 and 2012, as indicated in table 2, were Geonoma gamiova Barb.Rodr. (Relative Density - RD = 6.06 and 6.82% for 2006 and 2012, respectively), Calyptranthes grandifolia O.Berg (RD = 6.06 and 5.74%), Cordiera myrciifolia (K.Schum.) C.H. Perss. & Delprete (RD = 4.35 and 4.19%), Rudgea jasminoides (Cham.) Müll.Arg. (RD = 4.50 and 3.88%), and Pouteria reticulata (Engl.) Eyma (RD = 3.88 and 4.34%).
In the community, the tallest recorded specimen was an Aspidosperma olivaceum Müll.Arg (Apocynaceae) reaching a height of 18 meters, while the median diameter at breast height (dbh) for shrub-tree synusia was 5 centimeters, with the largest dbh observed at 43.3 centimeters in a Tapirira guianensis Aubl. (Anacardiaceae) specimen. Climbers had a median dbh of 4.6 centimeters, with the maximum recorded at 22.3 centimeters. The distribution of dbh values for live plants in 2012 showed no significant difference compared to 2006 (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, n1 = 367, n2 = 385, D = 0.05, p = 0.81, figure 2a). The average relative diameter growth for plants in the shrub-tree synusia was 1.14% per year (Mdn = 0.58% per year), with growth rates ranging from zero to 9.05% per year in a Cryptocarya mandioccana Meisn. (Lauraceae) specimen. There was no significant difference in diameter growth between plants with dbh values between 2.5 and 5 centimeters (Mdn = 0.48% per year) and those with dbh values greater than 5 centimeters (Mdn = 0.7% per year, Mann-Whitney Test, n1 = 185, n2 = 166, z = 1.549, p = 0.12, figure 2b).
Over a span of 6.5 years, there was a notable increase in the basal area of the shrub-tree synusia (> 2.5 cm dbh) compared to the reduction, resulting in a rise in the total basal area from 24.32 to 27.10 m2 ha-1 (refer to table 3). This shift led to a significant disparity between the gain (Mdn = 14.71%) and loss (Mdn = 4.95%) of basal area, as evidenced by the Mann-Whitney Test (U = 11, p = 0.002, lambda > 1, 95% CI = 1.015 + 0.007). In contrast, the basal area of climbers decreased marginally from 1.564 m2 ha-1 to 1.559 m2 ha-1 (see table 3), with no significant distinction between gain (Mdn = 27.48%) and loss (Mdn = 49.87%) during the period (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 45, p = 0.734). Notably, the reduction in basal area for climbers surpassed that of the plants within the shrub-tree community (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 12, p = 0.003, lambda < 1, 95% CI = 0.970 + 0.009).
In terms of plant dynamics, the annual mortality rate of climbers exceeded that of plants within the shrub-tree synusia across both size classes, < 2.5 cm dbh (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 7, p = 0.0004) and > 2.5 cm dbh (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 16; p = 0.009; see figure 3 and table 4).
The yearly recruitment of climbers in the class with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of less than 2.5 cm was significantly higher than that of plants in the shrub-tree synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 7.5, p = 0.0005, Figure 3). Conversely, the annual recruitment of climbers in the class with a dbh greater than 2.5 cm did not show a significant difference compared to the annual recruitment of shrubs and trees in the same size class (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 45, p = 0.73, Figure 3).
The annual mortality rates of plants with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of less than 2.5 cm did not show significant differences compared to plants with a dbh greater than 2.5 cm within the shrub-tree synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 31.5, p = 0.171) and the climbers synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 41.5, p = 0.538). However, the annual recruitment of plants in the smallest dbh class (< 2.5 cm) exceeded that of plants with a dbh greater than 2.5 cm in both the shrub-tree synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 0, p = 0.00001) and the climbers synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 8, p = 0.0006, see figure 3).
The subdivision of the shrub-tree synusia into three class sizes revealed significant differences in annual mortality rates among the classes (F = 6.30, df = 23, p = 0.007, Figure 4). Class II (2.5 < dbh < 5 cm) exhibited an average (+ SE) mortality rate of 0.65 + 0.25% year-1, which was significantly lower than the average mortality rate of Class I ( < 2.5 cm dbh) at 2.32 + 0.41% year-1 (p = 0.01, Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test), and also lower than the average mortality rate of Class III (dbh > 5 cm) at 2.12 + 0.29% year-1 (p = 0.02, Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test). Furthermore, the annual recruitment rates varied significantly among the three classes (F = 6.15, df = 23, p = 0.008, Figure 4). Class I displayed an average (+ SE) recruitment rate of 2.99 + 0.26% year-1, which was higher than the average recruitment rate of Class II at 1.37 + 0.25% year-1 (p = 0.01, Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test), and also higher than the average recruitment rate of Class III at 1.47 + 0.44% year-1 (p = 0.02, Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test).
When comparing mortality and recruitment rates over the total period of 6.5 years, it was observed that the class of shrubs and trees with a diameter at breast height (dbh) greater than 2.5 cm exhibited an average mortality rate of 8.68% (+ SE 0.96%), which was significantly higher (t-test, df = 7, t = 3.03, p < 0.02) than the average recruitment rate of 4.56% (+ SE 0.96%). Similarly, for climbers with a dbh greater than 2.5 cm, there was a noticeable trend towards increased mortality (Mdn = 28.75%) compared to recruitment (Mdn = 7.14%, Mann-Whitney Test, U = 28, p = 0.097). Excluding extreme values from an area with 100% mortality and recruitment, it was found that mortality (Mdn = 20%) significantly exceeded recruitment (Mdn = 0%, Mann-Whitney Test, U = 18.5, p = 0.05). During this period, the recruitment of shrubs and trees with a dbh less than 2.5 cm (average = 19.65 + 2.03) did not differ significantly from the mortality rate (average = 12.96 + 2.22%, t-test, df = 7, t = 2.22, 0.05 < p < 0.10), despite a noticeable trend. However, climbers with a dbh less than 2.5 cm exhibited a significantly higher recruitment rate (Mdn = 100%, Mann-Whitney Test, U = 17, p = 0.011) compared to the mortality rate (Mdn = 41.67%).
Successional group dynamics were analyzed over a 6.5-year period, revealing that mortality rates (Mdn = 9.19%) exceeded recruitment rates (Mdn = 0%) in early-successional plants with > 2.5 cm dbh, as confirmed by the Mann-Whitney Test (U = 18, p = 0.007). Conversely, no significant disparity in rates was observed in early-successional plants with < 2.5 cm dbh. Late-successional plants with > 2.5 cm dbh exhibited no significant differences (t test, t = 1.21, p = 0.24) between mortality (mean = 7.67 + 1.24%) and recruitment (mean = 5.53 + 1.26%). However, late-successional plants with < 2.5 cm dbh displayed higher recruitment rates (Mdn = 20.0%) compared to mortality rates (Mdn = 7.14%), as indicated by the Mann-Whitney Test (U = 16, p = 0.026), during the same period.
The comparison of dynamics between the two successional plant groups with > 2.5 cm dbh revealed that the annual mortality rates of early-successional plants were not significantly different from those of late-successional plants (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 45, p = 0.73, Table 4). However, the annual recruitment of late-successional plants was found to be significantly higher than that of early-successional plants (U = 22, p = 0.02, Figure 5).
When comparing the dynamics of successional plant groups with a diameter at breast height (dbh) less than 2.5 cm, no significant differences were observed in the annual mortality rates between these groups (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 31, p = 0.16). Nevertheless, it was found that the annual recruitment rate of late-successional plants exceeded that of early-successional plants (U = 11.5, p = 0.003, see figure 5).
In 2006 and 2012, the most abundant species, across all sampled sizes, were late-successional species representing the primary families found in later successional stages of the Dense Ombrophylous Forest (Tabarelli & Mantovani 1999, Catharino 2006, Arzolla 2011). Myrtaceae, Lauraceae, Rubiaceae, and Fabaceae emerged as the most diverse families, collectively constituting approximately 50% of the total species identified (see table 2), with the former two exhibiting the highest richness, a characteristic feature of mature Dense Montane Ombrophylous Forest (Tabarelli & Mantovani 1999, Franco et al. 2007, Arzolla et al. 2011).
In this study, Fabaceae, typically found in environments at earlier successional stages and seasonal forests, did not rank among the top three richest and most abundant families, a departure from findings in previous studies conducted in the park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Nastri et al. 1992, Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Pivello & Peccinini 2002, Eisenlohr et al. 2009, Hirata et al. 2010, Tanus et al. 2012). Similarly, the family Euphorbiaceae was not prominently represented. The study area is characterized by a more advanced successional stage, with lower abundance and richness of early-successional species like those from the genus Machaerium (Fabaceae) and Alchornea (Euphorbiaceae), which are common in less mature areas of the park. The observed high recruitment and predominance of late-successional species, coupled with higher mortality in the early-successional group, suggest a progression in forest regeneration, aligning with findings in one specific area (Gomes et al. 2003) but differing from other regions within the park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Knobel 1995).
Among the 125 species identified within the shrub-tree synusia area, 12 are classified as "Endangered" or "Vulnerable" according to sources such as Martinelli & Moraes (2013), MMA (2014), SMA (2016), and IUCN (2019). Notably, within the Endangered category, Eugenia pruinosa D.Legrand of the Myrtaceae family stands out as one of the ten most abundant species. Additionally, Gonatogyne brasiliensis (Baill.) Müll. Arg. from the Phyllanthaceae family is highlighted as a rare species with only 52 recorded instances in the State of São Paulo, as documented by Arzolla (2011) and CRIA (2019). These findings underscore the significance of secondary forest remnants, such as urban forests undergoing restoration, in providing a habitat for both rare and endangered species, as emphasized by Brown & Lugo (1990), Norden et al. (2009), and FAO (2010). A comparison between the species list in this study and that outlined in the Park Management Plan (SMA 2008) reveals that 56 species identified here are absent from the plan, with five of them falling under threatened categories. These insights are crucial for enhancing the protection of forest remnants and updating information related to the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga.
In fragments of the park, various exotic species have been documented (SMA 2008, Petri et al. 2018); however, only Coffea arabica L. (coffee) was found in the sampling units established in 2012 (see table 2). The presence of this species can be attributed to the historical land use in the park area, as it was previously cultivated in small farms that occupied the current park grounds (SMA 2008). Coffea arabica is dispersed by animals and thrives in shaded environments, such as the understory that was the focus of our study (Instituto Hórus 2019). Currently, this species is categorized as a Non-Dominant Invader within the study area (Petri et al. 2018) and is considered to have a moderate priority for removal from protected areas (Durigan et al. 2013). Therefore, continuous monitoring of the park fragments is essential for effectively managing the presence of Coffea arabica.
Several studies conducted in the park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Nastri et al. 1992, Knobel 1995, Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Tanus 2012) have indicated that the community trees exhibit smaller sizes compared to other tropical forests, a characteristic linked to the dynamics and growth patterns of the plants (Lieberman et al. 1990, Condit et al. 1999). A significant portion of the specimens displayed slow growth rates (Mdn = 0.58% year-1, = 1.14% year-1), which were lower than those observed in another section of the same park undergoing a recovery process (Mdn = 0.72% year-1, x = 1.52% year-1, Gomes 1998). Despite some studies suggesting a growth difference among size classes (Swaine et al. 1987, Silva et al. 1995, Gomes et al. 2003), no such distinction was recorded in this study. The growth patterns appeared to be influenced by the presence of a continuous canopy and the prevalence of small clearings in the area (Costa & Mantovani 1992, Davinson 2009), which harbored a significant number of late-successional plants and understory individuals known for their slower growth rates (Worbes 1989, Welden et al. 1991, Felfilli 1995, Condit et al. 1999). Lieberman and colleagues (1990) noted instances where plants exhibited no diameter growth over a 30-year period in Neotropical forests. The variability in growth rates can be attributed to diverse environmental conditions, as well as the life history and phenotypes of different species and individuals (Swaine et al. 1987, Worbes 1989, Sheil 1995a, Silva et al. 1995).
The diminutive stature of canopy trees in mountain tropical forests can be attributed to high turnover rates (Herwitz & Young, 1994). Consistent with findings from previous research (Condit et al., 1996b; Machado & Oliveira-Filho, 2010; Feeley et al., 2011; Laurance et al., 2014), the smallest plants exhibited the most dynamic growth, with significant recruitment rates. Conversely, larger plants experienced higher mortality rates, a trend also noted in a different section of the park (Gomes et al., 2003). The elevated mortality rates, particularly in extreme size classes (< 2.5 cm and > 5 cm dbh), may be indicative of the vulnerability of smaller plants (Salles & Schiavini, 2007) to fatal damage (Sheil et al., 2000), and larger trees, as aging pioneers, facing competition from other plant species in the ecosystem (Felfili, 1995; Schorn & Galvão, 2009). Despite the prevalence of late-successional plants in the community, and the observable decline of early-successional species, it would be inaccurate to attribute overall mortality solely to the demise of the latter, as the death of late-successional plants also contributed significantly to the total mortality rate during the study period.
The demise of large specimens due to past disturbances, as observed in various sections of the park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Peccinini & Pivello 2002, Gomes et al. 2003), potentially facilitated increased light penetration to the forest's lower strata, thereby enhancing the turnover of smaller plants and influencing the proliferation of climbers, particularly woody climbers like lianas. The persistence of lianas is contingent upon the presence of sizable trees within the forest (Engel et al. 1998, Phillips et al. 2005, Sfair et al. 2013).
Climbers emerged as the most dynamic life form, a trend also noted by Wright (2004), Phillips et al. (2005), and Laurance et al. (2014). Penhalber & Mantovani (1997) highlighted that plants within this synusia were prolific propagule producers in the park, potentially enhancing recruitment rates. Conversely, their seedling establishment, particularly in more mature forests (Engel 1998, Schnitzer 2005), appeared to hinder long-term recruitment into larger size classes. Despite their lower abundance, climbers exhibited the most significant decline in basal area, contributing to 36% of the overall community decrease, contrasting with the shrub-tree synusia where recruitment surpassed basal area loss. This decline in lianas might be linked to the area's maturation. Notably, only the larger, established lianas (> 2.5 cm dbh) experienced higher mortality than recruitment, indicating a declining trend (lambda < 1).
The observed dynamism appears to be linked to local conditions and environmental resources. The park area has been under protection since 1893, and the utilization of the sampled region has remained consistent for a minimum of 65 years (Peccinini & Pivello, 2002). Fluctuations in water availability, temperature (Feeley et al., 2011), light, and mineral nutrients have been found to be associated with alterations in the dynamics of plant communities (Laurance et al., 2009; Machado & Oliveira-Filho, 2010).
The soil of the park, as indicated by Struffaldi De Vuono (1985) and Gomes & Mantovani (2001), is notably acidic and deficient in nutrients, yet it bears resemblance to the soil composition of other forests in Southeastern Brazil. Moraes (2002) observed no irregularities in litter production and decomposition within a preserved area of the park during the 1990s. It is crucial to note that the park's vegetation endured exposure to gas emissions from a nearby steel mill for approximately six decades, leading to forest pollution, tree mortality, and the deterioration of a portion of the vegetation, as highlighted by Struffaldi-De-Vuono (1985). Nagaoka & Marcelli (1989) also linked the significant decline of lichens in the park to this particular factor. Despite efforts to preserve the area, it continues to face air pollution from its fully urbanized surroundings. Domingos et al. (2002) identified signs of atmospheric pollution in herbaceous bioindicator plants situated outside the forest. Consequently, there is a pressing need for focused investigations in the present decade, concentrating on the growth of trees and lianas in forest soil, to assess the cumulative and ongoing impacts of pollution on plant dynamics.
An important factor that warrants research consideration is the climate, which is influenced by local conditions and resources, and is linked to urbanization and the formation of heat islands (Marengo, 2007; Dias et al., 2013). Ecological studies have demonstrated a growing correlation between climate extremes and the increased mortality of trees and climbers (Hubbell & Foster, 1992; Condit et al., 1996a,b; Curran et al., 1999; Nepstad et al., 2007; Feeley et al., 2011). Rainfall monitoring within the park itself spanning 85 years (1933-2018) has revealed irregularities over short periods, such as the driest month (July 2008) and the wettest month, along with the second wettest year (January 2010) in the entire historical series (EM-IAG, 2017). Despite lianas having a competitive advantage (Schnitzer, 2005) and smaller ones showing increased abundance (Laurance et al., 2014), their transition to larger size classes and overall thriving is dependent on well-developed phorophytes (Phillips et al., 2005; Sfair et al., 2013; Nogueira et al., 2014). The study area exhibits slow growth in small trees, with larger ones (> 2.5 cm) experiencing higher mortality compared to recruitment, which is crucial for maintaining the abundance and basal area of larger lianas (Nogueira et al., 2014).
The area under study demonstrates progress towards a mature stage of regeneration, as previously discussed; however, further specific studies are required to directly evaluate the impact of the factors outlined on forest dynamics. In the case of an isolated forest fragment, such as the one examined in this study, situated within a highly urbanized environment without nearby forest fragments, a gradual erosion of species over time is anticipated (Turner et al. 1995, Turner 1996). Conversely, the local history (Chazdon et al. 2007, Norden et al. 2009), enhanced protective measures concerning the removal of flora and fauna specimens, reduced instances of fire, and notably, the cessation of emissions from the adjacent steel mill have all contributed to the regeneration of vegetation cover, as evidenced in another section of the Park (Gomes et al. 2003). Despite its isolation and complete urban surroundings, this remnant serves as a crucial source of propagules and refuge for various endangered species, while also providing essential ecosystem services. This underscores the significance of this urban forest in light of the numerous anthropogenic pressures it faces. Continuous monitoring of the community and existing populations within this fragment and other areas, including climbing plants, can elucidate the relationship between diversity, ecosystem resilience, and local factors influencing forest health.
