The response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic necessitates a reevaluation of the validity of scientific knowledge. As non-pharmacological interventions for disease control serve as a global natural experiment, it is crucial to subject research findings to the scrutiny of established epistemological theories. Additionally, researchers should be mindful of relaxing methodological criticisms during times when the rapid dissemination of results is imperative. While criticism remains a fundamental aspect of scientific thinking and practice, scientists must strive towards achieving a consensus that can inform public health policies effectively.
In the year 2000, South African President Thabo Mbeki emerged as a prominent figure in the organized movement of AIDS denialism, a stance that continues to resonate in various countries, including Russia. When confronted with pandemics, scientific denialism can manifest in diverse forms and guises. The argument minimizing the potential severity of COVID-19 by likening it to the common cold is disseminated widely through social media channels. The delicate balance between social, economic, and public health outcomes of lockdown measures can be tainted by overarching ideological debates on a global scale or by local political agendas. Public health dilemmas are exacerbated when critical decisions hinge on mathematical models and limited, suboptimal empirical data. Consequently, the epistemological underpinnings of contemporary public health practices warrant thorough examination. In the subsequent sections, we aim to subject the scientific rationale behind pandemic responses to rigorous scrutiny, drawing insights from esteemed philosophers of science. Furthermore, we will delve into the strategies for disseminating knowledge during times of global crisis.
In his seminal work "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996) posited that unlike doctors, scientists are not compelled to select problems based on immediate solutions. Although Kuhn did not witness the 1918 influenza pandemic, he did witness the emergence of AIDS in the early 1980s. His assertion that scientific progress occurs within or in relation to historically determined paradigms garnered acclaim from sociologists, anthropologists, and even influenced certain epidemiologists in a non-traditional manner. Kuhn's concept of incommensurable paradigms suggests that conflicting perspectives within different scientific frameworks cannot be reconciled through mere discussion or experimentation. This prompts the question of whether the germ theory itself falls under the category of Kuhnian paradigms. Through Kuhn's lens, the scientific developments arising from pandemic responses may possess historical justifications, but not necessarily epistemological ones.
Karl Popper (1902-1994) devoted his life to exploring what he termed "the two fundamental problems in the theory of knowledge": (i) the problem of induction, articulated by David Hume (1711-1776), which posits that no matter how many observations (akin to scientific evidence) of "A" followed by "B," a causal link remains a psychological rather than a logical inference; and (ii) the problem of demarcation, which underscores the necessity of a clear delineation between what is scientific and what is not. In alignment with Hume, Popper rejected induction (the foundation of "evidence-based medicine") and advocated for scientists to be imaginative in formulating theories, followed by rigorous testing through both rational and empirical means. The survival of a theory hinges on its ability to withstand empirical refutation, thereby defining science by its potential for empirical falsification. How does this perspective apply to scientists combatting COVID-19? Through a Popperian lens, a robust public response would be bolstered by a network of mutually critical researchers. While theoretical debates and critiques must not impede progress or proceed too slowly amidst the urgency of the situation, the scientific community should be poised to embrace policy changes when a theory is disproven and new studies suggest more effective strategies.
Of particular concern is Paul Feyrabend's (1924-1994) "anything goes" assertion in his renowned work "Against Method," as well as his critique of modern medical advancements in his later writings. Similarly, the skeptical argument put forth by New York University Philosopher Peter Unger (born 1942) that "nothing can ever be truly known" is, at best, unproductive and, at worst, potentially perilous if widely disseminated in public discourse.
An intriguing resolution to the epistemological dilemma is presented through Imre Lakatos's insights on "Programs of Scientific Investigation." Lakatos, who sought to harmonize the ideas of Popper and Kuhn, engaged in a fruitful discourse with Feyerabend. Essentially, Lakatos envisioned networks of mutual criticism akin to Popper's, engaged in perpetual competition. Periodically, one program emerges as "progressive," surpassing others labeled as "regressive." While acknowledging a degree of historicity in this dynamic, akin to Kuhn, Lakatos staunchly advocates for a demarcation criterion in science. Consequently, it is imperative to consider virological-epidemiological programs as progressive, ensuring they are not only consulted by governmental authorities but also granted greater visibility in scientific publications.
This leads us to the final discussion. Peer review has served as the foundation for ongoing Popperian-Lakatosian critique, and in principle, it bestows a scientific quality endorsement on information. Both the peer review and editing processes are time-consuming, a luxury we lack during the current pandemics. Hundreds of studies are either being published in pre-print repositories or fast-tracked for peer review. This inevitably results in a relaxation of critical standards, prioritizing speed over rigor. This aligns with Lakatos's anticipated advantages for progressive programs. However, it necessitates a perpetual critical stance from readers and a continual state of vigilance within the scientific community.
In conclusion, achieving consensus is not a prerequisite for responding to COVID-19. Criticism stands out as a crucial tenet of scientific thought and practice. By subjecting the role of science in addressing the pandemic to the scrutiny of prominent critics within the scientific community, we not only immunize our society against nihilistic viewpoints but also underscore the intrinsic value of research endeavors. It is imperative that research and scientific critique be conducted with the goal of aligning with public policies, steering clear of conveying messages of doubt and insecurity to an already anxious populace. Moreover, while acknowledging the impossibility of completely value-neutral science, it is essential to distance our research from political and corporate influences. Consequently, in a time marked by extremism, science can emerge as a cornerstone of democracy and a force for safeguarding human life.
