Objective: The aim of this study was to translate, adapt, and ascertain the psychometric properties of the Selfitis Behavior Scale (SBS). Methods: An online study was conducted with 261 Brazilian adolescents. The translation and cross-cultural adaptation process adhered to international guidelines, resulting in a scale with satisfactory face, content, and construct validity. Results: The five factors elucidated 78.2% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis, employing a structural equation model for latent variables, demonstrated a good fit of the five-factor model with χ2= 2.42, p=0.001, GFI=0.92, AGFI= 0.89, NNFI= 0.92, TLI= 0.96, CFI= 0.93, RMSEA= 0.041. All factor loadings were statistically significant (t >1.96, p<0.05). The overall internal consistency, as measured by Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega, exceeded 0.80, with individual factor consistencies surpassing 0.79. Conclusion: This study represents the first investigation in Brazil to assess the psychometric properties of a selfie scale. The SBS emerged as a dependable and valid tool for evaluating selfie behavior.
Engaging in various online activities like accessing websites, using messenger apps, participating in social media, and Internet gaming has become a ubiquitous part of daily life for many individuals, particularly adolescents and young adults (Lin et al., 2017; McLean et al., 2019). With the proliferation of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tik Tok, Snapchat, and others, there has been a surge in research examining problematic social media use, dependency on these platforms, and their implications on individuals' lives (Alimoradi et al., 2019; Montag et al., 2015, 2017). Nevertheless, the exploration of well-being and self-esteem concerning social media usage, including behaviors like taking and sharing selfies, particularly among adolescents, remains a relatively under-discussed topic in the existing literature.
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has officially recognized the act of taking "selfies" as a mental disorder, a declaration made during its annual board meeting in Chicago (Vincent, 2014). This disorder, termed selfitis, is characterized by the compulsive desire to capture images of oneself (body and/or face) using a smartphone and subsequently sharing them on social media platforms (McLean et al., 2019). This phenomenon is prevalent globally, particularly among adolescents and young adults (Griffiths and Balakrishnan, 2018; Lin et al., 2019; McLean et al., 2019). Selfitis behavior encompasses various actions, including image preparation (staging), editing (such as adjusting colors and backgrounds), image selection, posting, and subsequently monitoring the number of "likes" and comments received from others on the posted image (Balakrishnan and Griffiths, 2017; McLean et al., 2019). With approximately half of the world's 7.6 billion population engaged in some form of social media, an average of over 170 selfies are taken daily, resulting in a staggering 650 billion selfies worldwide (Kemp, 2018). This practice is more prevalent on certain platforms, with Snapchat, for instance, seeing 74% of all shared images being selfies (Reilly et al., 2019).
Research suggests that adolescents exhibit higher levels of engagement in posting selfies compared to both young and older adults (Dhir et al., 2016; Baiocco et al., 2016). This underscores the importance of examining the impacts of selfie practices specifically within the adolescent population.
Research on selfie behavior remains limited, with a focus primarily on negative impacts, particularly in studies conducted by Asian researchers (Dokur et al., 2018; Pantic et al., 2017). Findings suggest a potential link between selfie behavior and traits such as narcissism, self-centeredness, low self-esteem, loneliness, and depression. However, these studies have not employed psychometric instruments to directly measure these behaviors, rendering the results as speculative rather than conclusive.
Adolescents and young adults engage in posting selfies on social media platforms with the aim of seeking popularity, recognition, and appreciation, as noted by McLean et al. (2019). Chua & Chang's (2016) study revealed that adolescents identified peer recognition as the primary motivation for sharing selfies, underscoring the pivotal role feedback quantity and positivity play in shaping self-esteem and feelings of acceptance. Conversely, Jong & Drummond (2016) found that a lack of desired "likes" or comments on a post can lead to diminished well-being. The acknowledgment of young individuals towards the relationship between social media photo sharing and well-being underscores the significance of studying selfie practices. It is crucial to deepen our comprehension of these impacts on adolescents, given that adolescence is a critical phase for identity formation, self-perception, and social interactions, all of which are likely influenced by selfie behaviors.
The behavior of taking selfies has become increasingly prevalent among adolescents and young adults. In response to this trend, Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017) introduced the Selfitis Behavior Scale (SBS). The psychometric tests conducted to evaluate the scale's reliability and validity, including exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency, yielded satisfactory results when administered to Indian university students. Additionally, the scale was found to be reliable and valid when tested on university students from Iran and Afghanistan (Lin et al., 2019), Turkish university students (Ciplak & Atici, 2021), and Italian university students (Monacis et al., 2020).
Research has shown that selfie behavior can potentially develop into an addiction, as evidenced by studies conducted by Kaur and Vig (2016), Kela et al. (2017), Shah (2015), Singh and Lippmann (2017), and Griffiths and Balakrishnan (2018). Despite this, there remains a significant gap in understanding the overall impact, whether positive or negative, of such behavior. Additionally, while Brazil has seen the development of various instruments and studies focusing on problematic internet use and its consequences on individuals, there is a notable absence of research specifically addressing the phenomenon of taking selfies within the Brazilian context. This dearth of Brazilian studies on selfie behavior can likely be attributed to the lack of a validated instrument tailored for use in this region.
The objective of this study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for use with adolescents in Brazil.
Data were collected in two stages. Initially, a pilot sample of 45 adolescents (mean age = 16, SD = 2) was recruited through social media and WhatsApp contacts for an online study. Following approval from the research ethics committee of the Federal University of São Paulo (No. 4.526.802), the researchers created an online study using Google forms. The study commenced with a clear outline of its purpose and requirements, accompanied by an informed consent form. Participants were required to provide informed consent to proceed with the study; failure to do so resulted in their inability to complete the online questionnaire. The inclusion criteria stipulated participants to be aged between 12 and 18 years and to possess an active social network account. This study, comprising a pilot phase (n=45) and a final phase (n=261), adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, which governs medical research involving human subjects.
In the second stage of the study, a factor analysis was conducted with the participation of 261 Brazilian adolescents, with a mean age of 16 years (SD = 2), who had consented to take part in the research and subsequently completed the Self-Belief Scale (SBS).
After securing permission from the original authors of the SBS (Balakrishnan & Griffiths, 2017), we followed the cross-cultural adaptation method outlined by Brislin (1970; 1973; 1980; 1986), which involved four key stages: translation (and adaptation), assessment of semantic equivalence, pilot testing, and back-translation. Additionally, we adopted the universalist approach to cross-cultural adaptation of instruments, as proposed by Herdman et al. (1997; 1998), which is widely regarded as suitable for ensuring both conceptual and item equivalence. This approach necessitated a comprehensive literature review to ensure the original scale's concepts were applicable in the Brazilian context, as well as evaluations of semantic fidelity (ensuring the scale maintains its original meaning) and operational considerations (such as questionnaire format, mode of administration, and method of completion).
In the initial phase, the authors of this study, proficient in English, undertook the translation of the questionnaire into Brazilian Portuguese. This process involved a comprehensive analysis of each questionnaire item, juxtaposing it with the original English version. The translation went beyond mere word-for-word equivalence, delving into nuanced aspects like the potential impact of terms within the cultural milieu of the target population. Such a comparative evaluation between the translated and original versions becomes imperative as direct linguistic correspondence does not guarantee uniform interpretations across diverse cultural settings (Giusti & Befi-Lopes, 2008). This methodology acknowledges the profound influence of culture on the comprehension of variables, underscoring the need for cross-cultural adaptation to ensure that the scale's primary objectives are preserved when implemented in the adapted language (Herdman et al., 1998).
For the pilot study, it is advisable to test the translated and adapted questionnaire within a small subset of the target population, comprising at least 30 to 40 individuals, to identify potential challenges in comprehending the questionnaire. During this phase, operational equivalence was also assessed, focusing on the practical elements involved in administering the questionnaire, such as the question format (online or paper) and the method of completion (self-completion or via interview). Following the cross-cultural adaptation of the SBS, it was integrated into a virtual Google Forms platform, and a link was generated for distribution to facilitate data collection from the pilot sample, which included 45 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. Alongside responding to the questionnaire, participants were requested to rate the ease or difficulty of understanding each item and provide feedback in an open-ended section.
Following a meticulous process involving translation, adaptation, semantic equivalence search, and pilot sample application, the Brazilian Portuguese version of the SBS underwent back-translation into English by a proficient individual fluent in Brazilian Portuguese but with English as their native language. The back-translation was conducted blindly, ensuring the professional had no access to the original questionnaire or technical expertise on the subject, aligning with recommended practices in the literature (Beaton et al., 2000; Beaton et al., 2002; Beaton et al., 2007; Guillemin et al., 1993; Eremenco et al., 2005). Subsequently, the original and back-translated versions were compared to ascertain the maintenance of semantic and conceptual equivalence, ensuring the items retained their intended meaning post-translation. This back-translation review, particularly focusing on conceptual equivalence, enhances the quality of cross-cultural adaptation (Herdman et al., 1998). The expert committee, comprising the principal investigators in this study, conducted a thorough examination to identify any potential discrepancies between the original and translated versions. Notably, no disparities were found during this comparison. Following this assessment, the back-translated version was forwarded to the original authors of the questionnaire for item equivalence verification, which they deemed excellent. The original authors granted authorization for the scale's use in Brazil, affirming the successful adaptation process.
The Selfitis Behavior Scale (SBS) was developed by Indian researchers Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017) to evaluate behaviors associated with taking selfies. In their original study involving 225 Indian university students with an average age of 20 years, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted, revealing six factors: environmental enhancement, social competition, attention seeking, mood modification, self-confidence, and subjective conformity. The SBS consists of 20 items rated on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree), with higher scores indicating more frequent selfie-taking behavior. Scores falling between 20-40 suggest low selfitis behavior, 41-60 indicate mild selfitis behavior, 61-80 point towards moderate selfitis behavior, and 81-100 signify a severe level of selfitis behavior.
In the initial study, an exploratory factor analysis revealed the presence of six factors, with four items associated with both the "environmental enhancement" and "social competition" factors, and three items linked to each of the remaining four factors: attention-seeking, mood modification, subjective conformity, and self-confidence. The original assessment tool demonstrated acceptable internal consistencies across all six factors, yielding an overall internal consistency of 0.876 (Balakrishnan & Griffiths, 2017).
The face validity assessment of the SBS was conducted by utilizing a sample from the pilot application of the scale involving 45 adolescents. This step was crucial in evaluating face validity, encompassing aspects such as comprehension, clarity, and the simplicity of language employed in the questionnaire (Campos et al., 2019).
Content validity, as defined by Wynd et al. (2003), pertains to the correlation between abstract concepts and tangible, quantifiable indicators of the construct under examination. This evaluation also delves into the extent to which individual scale items accurately reflect and embody a particular construct for the precise purpose of its assessment, as outlined by Haynes et al. (1995). The assessment of content validity involves scrutiny through factor analysis and appraisal by an expert panel, in this case, comprising the authors of the study, mirroring the approach taken in the research conducted by Toledo Junior et al. (2018).
We conducted construct validity assessment using factor analysis and structural equation modeling on a sample of 261 Brazilian adolescents (mean age=16, SD=2). This evaluation was based on the utilization of a scale that had been previously adapted and demonstrated face validity.
In this study, we utilized exploratory factor analysis to evaluate the scale's dimensionality in the Brazilian version, followed by confirmatory factor analysis through a structural equation model. The decision to start with exploratory factor analysis was driven by the age range of the study population (adolescents), which differed from the original instrument's validation population (young adults), necessitating an investigation into the scale's dimensionality maintenance. To confirm data adequacy and potential factorization, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett's test of sphericity were conducted as per Schumacker and Lomax (1998). The principal components extraction method with Oblique rotation was employed, alongside an assessment of communalities to determine the extent to which each item's variance (correlation) was explained by the extracted factors.
MANOVA was utilized to examine the relationship between multiple response variables concerning the construct, followed by ANOVA to assess the mean differences among the individual factors across varying levels of selfie intensity (low, mild, moderate, and severe). The calculation of the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) was employed as a key indicator to evaluate the structural model quality of the psychometric instrument, based on parameters estimated through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). AVE, representing the squared factor loading, signifies the average proportion of variance explained by the latent variable in the SEM equation, where measurement error and the square of factorial loadings are expressed in the same unit. Fornell and Larcker (1981) suggested an AVE value equal to or exceeding 0.50 as indicative of a satisfactory model fit. Convergent validity can be assessed through AVE and Cronbach's alpha, as noted by various researchers (Fornell & Larcker, 1981; Pestana and Gageno, 2005; Hair et al., 2009). The use of AVE for convergent validity is increasingly prevalent in recent empirical studies (Fock et al., 2013; Niclasen et al., 2013; Obasi et al., 2014). In analyzing the variance of factors identified in the SBS, the study considered four levels of selfitis: 20-40 for low selfitis behavior, 41-60 for mild selfitis behavior, 61-80 for moderate selfitis behavior, and 81-100 for severe selfitis behavior.
To assess the relationship between the SBS factors, a Pearson's correlation analysis was conducted.
To assess internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega were employed, with values equal to or exceeding 0.70 deemed satisfactory, alongside corrected item-total correlation (Fornell & Larcker, 1981).
The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, as well as the calculation of average variance extracted, were conducted using the statistical software R – SEM (Structural Equation Models) package version 0.9-21. For all other analyses, the statistical package SPSS (Statistical Program for Social Sciences) version 20.0 was employed.
The sample consisted of 261 Brazilian adolescents with a mean age of 16 years (SD=2) from public schools in Brazil. The majority of participants (74%) were students, with 89% reporting no employment. Additionally, 66.5% of the adolescents lived with both parents, 73% identified as female, and 81% belonged to a B/C socioeconomic level.
The translation and cross-cultural adaptation process were meticulously executed, emphasizing semantic and conceptual equivalence of the items, as validated by the back-translation of the scale. Operational equivalence was ensured by maintaining the same number of questions and response options when the scale was administered online, as demonstrated in previous studies (Balakrishnan & Griffiths, 2017; Lin et al., 2019). During the pilot study, participants were asked to assess the clarity and comprehensibility of each item, with an opportunity to provide feedback. Analysis revealed that no suggestions were made for improving the scale's items, and all participants agreed that the questions were clear and easily understood. Consequently, the face validity of the scale was confirmed, as adolescent participants encountered no difficulties in understanding the items or proposing enhancements. This outcome underscores the appropriateness of the cross-cultural adaptation, indicating the scale's readiness for implementation in larger samples, as suggested by Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017).
The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkim (KMO) test yielded a value of 0.803, and Bartlett's test of sphericity resulted in 0.89921 with a significance level of p=0.001, indicating the adequacy of the sample and readiness to factor the data (Hair et al., 2009; Kaiser & Rice, 1974; Tabachinich and Fidell, 2001). The results of the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on SBS, conducted with a sample of 261 adolescents, are presented in Table 1. In contrast to the original version, the EFA identified 5 factors instead of 6, with the items "mood modification" and "self-confidence" loading on the same factor, termed "mood and confidence." Eigenvalues ranged from 1.05 to 5.10 across the factors, indicating satisfactory results (Hair et al., 2009). These five factors collectively explained 78.3% of the total variance. Consistent with the original study (Balakrishnan and Griffiths, 2017), each factor had at least three items converging, contributing to the measure's homogeneity (Byrne, 2001).
Confirmatory factor analysis, conducted through a structural equation model, revealed an excellent fit with χ2= 2.42. The Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) stood at 0.92, surpassing the acceptable threshold of 0.85, while the Adjusted for Degrees of Freedom (AGFI) reached 0.89, meeting the criterion of 0.80. Other fit indices included Bentler & Bonett's Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI) at 0.92, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) at 0.96, and Bentler's Comparative Fit Index (CFI) at 0.93, all aligning with or exceeding the acceptable values. The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) was calculated at 0.041 with a 90% confidence interval of 0.034 to 0.062, falling below the threshold of 0.08. All factor loadings were found to be statistically significant (t>1.96, p<0.05). The acceptance criteria for these rates were based on the works of Hair et al. (2009), Hatcher (1994), Hu & Bentler (1999), and Bowling (2005). Factor loadings equal to or greater than 0.60 were considered significant, meeting the content validity requirements as per Nunnally (1978). The correlation between items in factor analysis, Pearson correlation, and corrected item-total correlation further supported the content validity of the scale. The observed communalities ranged from 0.61 to 0.89, with item 8 "Taking selfie in different poses increases my social status" exhibiting the highest communalities at 0.89, explaining 89% of the variance. Notably, high factor communalities (≥0.5) indicated substantial variance extraction by the principal components method. Among the factors, "environmental enhancement" had the lowest variance explained at 20.33%, while "subjective conformity," "mood and confidence," "attention seeking," and "social competition" factors accounted for 78.22%, 67.88%, 52.34%, and 38.94% of the explained variance, respectively (see Table 1).
Convergent validity assesses whether the items within a scale or the dimensions of a multidimensional scale align with a single construct or dimension (Graver and Mentzer, 1999). In the context of partial least squares (PLS) modeling, convergent validity is demonstrated through the average variance extracted (AVE), which quantifies the variance accounted for by each variable. The current study revealed AVE values exceeding 0.79 (environmental enhancement=0.81; social competition=0.79; attention seeking=0.83; mood and confidence= 0.85 and subjective conformity=0.79), thereby confirming the convergent validity of the scale (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Sanches-Franco and Roldan, 2005; Balakrishnan and Griffiths, 2017) (see Table 1).
The degree of association between the factors was assessed using Pearson's correlation matrix, revealing values consistently exceeding 0.50 across all factors. Notably, instances of high correlation were identified, such as the "social competition" factor displaying strong associations with "attention seeking" (r=0.79), "mood and confidence" (r=0.80), and "subjective conformity" (r=0.81). Furthermore, robust correlations were evident between "attention seeking" and "subjective conformity" (r=0.80), as well as between "mood and confidence" and "subjective conformity" (r=0.82) as depicted in Table 2.
Table 3 displays the refined item-total correlation data and the internal consistency of the SBS as evaluated through Cronbach's Alpha (α) and McDonald's Omega (ω) coefficients, along with their respective values in case of item deletion. The analysis revealed satisfactory levels of alpha and omega (ranging between 0.60 and 0.89; Toledo Junior et al., 2018; Bowling, 2005; Tavakol & Dennick, 2011) not only across the factors but also within the individual SBS items. Notably, omega values slightly surpassed alpha values in certain factors and items. The overall reliability of the scale stood at α=.80 and ω=.81, with individual factor reliability scores exceeding 0.78 in both α and ω rates. Some items demonstrated a decrease in α and ω coefficients upon deletion, underscoring their robustness and indispensability for scale reliability. The "Corrected Item-Total Correlation" column showcases the correlations between each item and the total scale score, with a general guideline suggesting correlations should not fall below 0.3 for reliability. Items failing to correlate with the total score diminish questionnaire reliability. In this study, correlations above 0.52 were observed, affirming the scale's reliability (Hair et al., 2009).
The MANOVA results revealed significant differences in factors across the four levels of selfitis intensity (low, mild, moderate, severe) with Wilks’ l= 0.421; f=39.32 (15.981); p<0.001). Table 4 displays the average results of the mean differences in individual factors at each intensity level (ANOVA). The effect size was determined using the partial eta-squared test (ɳ2), indicating a moderate to large level of significance (Cohen, 1988). Notably, "attention seeking" exhibited the most substantial variation among the factors across the four levels of selfie intensity, followed by "social competition," "mood and confidence," "subjective conformity," and "environmental enhancement" factors.
Table 5 illustrates the mean and standard deviation of the factors concerning the levels of selfitis intensity. The data indicates that participants with a low level of selfitis intensity exhibited the highest mean (3.39) in the "environmental enhancement" factor. For individuals with a mild selfitis intensity level, the "mood and confidence" factor had the highest mean (3.21). Among those with a moderate selfitis intensity level, the "subjective conformity" factor reached the highest mean (3.19). Conversely, individuals with a severe selfitis intensity level displayed the highest mean in the "attention seeking" and "social competition" factors, with means of 4.02 and 3.45, respectively.
The meticulous process of cross-cultural adaptation of a scale necessitates careful attention to ensure equivalence between the original version and the translated and adapted version, taking into account the appropriateness within each country's context and ensuring comprehension among the target population. In this study, we adhered to international guidelines for translation and cross-cultural adaptation, following the recommendations of SBS Brislin (1970; 1973; 1980; 1986), Beaton et al. (2007), Guillemin et al. (1993), Eremenco et al. (2005), and Herdman et al. (1997). We assessed face validity through the pilot sample, content validity through expert committee evaluation, factor analysis, corrected item-total correlation, and Pearson correlation, and construct validity through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.
In terms of construct validity, the exploratory factor analysis revealed that the 20 items of the scale loaded onto 5 factors, contrasting with the original study by Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017) where 6 factors were identified. This discrepancy is likely attributed to the sample variation between the two studies, with the original study involving college students and the present study focusing on adolescents. Numerous researchers have noted that adolescents tend to be more active in posting selfies compared to young adults or older individuals, underscoring the importance of assessing the impact of selfie practices within this demographic (Dhir et al., 2016; Baiocco et al., 2016). Furthermore, it is essential to take into account the cultural nuances of both Brazil and India, which could have influenced the reduction in factors observed in the Brazilian version. A study examining the psychometric properties of the SBS in countries such as Iran and Afghanistan (Lin et al., 2019) found that the SBS retained 6 factors and demonstrated strong fit in the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model. Conversely, the Italian version of the SBS, akin to the Brazilian version, also exhibited a model with 5 factors (Monacis et al., 2020). Notably, the amalgamation of the "mood modification" and "self-confidence" factors, termed "mood and confidence" in this study, displayed satisfactory communalities exceeding 0.62.
It is noteworthy that the initial study identified six factors solely through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). In contrast, our current study not only utilized EFA but also incorporated confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), demonstrating a strong fit for structural equation models. Furthermore, the reliability of the factors was assessed using Cronbach's α and McDonald's ω coefficients, indicating good internal consistency.
Moreover, the sample size adheres to the recommended standards for more intricate statistical analyses, with a minimum of 200 participants, as advised for confirmatory factor analysis by Watkins (1989). The Structural Equation Model utilized in the factor analysis exhibited a strong fit, as evidenced by the CFI (0.93), TLI (0.96), RMSEA (0.041), GIF (0.92), AGIF (0.89), and NNFI (0.92) values. Furthermore, the reliability of the factors and the overall scale was deemed satisfactory, with Cronbach's α and McDonald's ω coefficients surpassing 0.80 and 0.81, respectively, as per Bentlet's (1995) guidelines.
In examining levels of selfie behaviors (low, mild, moderate, and severe), it was observed that individuals with low levels of selfie engagement exhibited higher scores on the "environmental enhancement" factor. This factor highlights that individuals who partake in selfie behaviors perceive a sense of privilege in connecting with their surroundings through selfies to capture emotional memories, linking the selfie with a specific environment (such as taking selfies with friends in various settings like bars, restaurants, or other locations to document the moment) (Boursier & Manna, 2018; Kiprin, 2013).
Individuals with mild selfitis levels were found to exhibit higher scores on the "mood and confidence" factor, reflecting changes in mood and self-confidence stemming from selfie behavior. Positive mood changes, particularly those enhancing self-confidence, can potentially reinforce this behavior, escalating the risk of addiction by triggering the brain's reward circuitry. The current study revealed that individuals experienced an increase in self-confidence by feeling good about taking and privately viewing selfies before sharing them. Tajuddin et al. (2013) emphasized the positive correlation between self-confidence and a positive mood (self-efficacy feeling). Meier & Gray (2013) examined American adolescents and noted that frequent Facebook photo posts were linked to heightened self-confidence, while activities like viewing friends' photos, commenting on them, and unfollowing were associated with lower self-confidence indicators. Self-admiration can further boost self-confidence, enhance mood, and foster a greater inclination towards taking and sharing selfies (Boursier & Manna, 2018). However, it is crucial to investigate whether the surge in self-confidence primarily occurs online during selfie posting. Mobile social media interactions have been shown to assist individuals in managing negative moods (McLean et al., 2019), a notion supported by Khan & Imran (2019) who suggest a connection between selfie behavior and mood regulation.
Self-esteem plays a significant role in influencing individuals' mood states by enhancing their self-confidence, thereby increasing the likelihood of engaging in selfie-taking and sharing activities. It is suggested that sharing selfies may be linked to heightened self-confidence, particularly in scenarios where individuals carefully select their selfies or anticipate positive feedback. However, the effects of selfie posting on self-esteem appear to be more variable in the short-to-medium term, contingent upon the feedback received. Further exploration is warranted to understand the impact of mood modification in selfitis, encompassing both the positive and negative repercussions of selfie-related behaviors on mood. The current investigation revealed that individuals in the early stages of selfitis exhibited higher scores on the "mood and confidence" factor, indicating a greater susceptibility to experiencing positive emotions and confidence when sharing selfies. Conversely, participants with moderate selfitis levels demonstrated elevated scores on the "subjective conformity" factor, reflecting a desire for group acceptance. This inclination towards conformity, often at excessive levels, may drive individuals to seek validation within online communities through various means, such as garnering likes. Previous research has shown that the quest for acceptance within online groups is linked to self-esteem ratings and the pursuit of positive feedback. In this study, individuals with moderate selfitis levels displayed a heightened need for acceptance compared to other groups, with the "subjective conformity" factor exhibiting strong correlations with "social competition," "attention seeking," and "mood and confidence" factors. These findings suggest that a greater need for acceptance is associated with increased competition, attention-seeking behaviors, and enhanced confidence when engaging in selfie-related activities.
Among individuals exhibiting severe levels of selfitis, the scores were notably high on the "social competition" and "attention seeking" factors. The concept of social competition encompasses a range of behaviors, extending from compulsive gambling to substance use (Balakrishnan & Griffiths, 2017). In this study, the "social competition" factor emerged with the second-highest mean score (3.45) among the five factors, indicating its strong association with severe selfitis behavior. This suggests that individuals with severe selfitis tend to engage in activities such as sharing selfies in various poses, eagerly awaiting "likes" and comments, and utilizing image editing tools. Similarly, the "attention seeking" factor recorded the highest average score (4.02). Individuals scoring high on this factor typically exhibit attention-seeking behaviors on social platforms, actively seeking validation through "likes" and positive feedback, striving for increased popularity, competing for attention and feedback, and dedicating time to enhancing images for sharing. Positive feedback received on posts can bolster self-confidence, meeting the individual's expectations (Boursier & Manna, 2018). It is important to acknowledge that attention seeking can also reflect narcissistic tendencies (Khan & Imran, 2019; McCain et al., 2016). Gnambs (2017) highlighted a strong positive correlation between self-promoting selfies shared on social media and levels of narcissism, underscoring the link between "attention seeking" and severe selfitis levels, aligning with previous studies by Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017) and Seidman (2013). Haggard (2014) observed that individuals are often more focused on showcasing their experiences in real-time rather than fully immersing themselves in the moment, indicating a perpetual quest for attention.
The findings of this study indicate that the Selfitis Behavior Scale (SCS) serves as a valuable tool for evaluating selfie-taking behavior, a novel area of inquiry within the realm of digital technology studies. This pioneering Brazilian investigation contributes significantly to the existing body of literature concerning disorders associated with digital technology and media usage. Beyond shedding light on the psychological implications of selfie-taking behavior, which can vary in nature, this research offers a foundation for future investigations to delve deeper into this concept across diverse contexts and populations. Subsequent studies should explore the role of various factors such as personality traits, motivations, cognition, and attitudes in the development, perpetuation, and consequences of selfiitis behavior.
To date, limited research has been conducted on selfie behavior, particularly on the topic of selfie addiction. The majority of existing academic literature, encompassing both theoretical and empirical studies, originates from researchers based in India. This prevalence can be attributed to the high number of social media users in India and other Asian countries (Lamba et al., 2016).
The primary limitations of this study pertain to the non-representative nature of the sample concerning Brazilian adolescents and the exclusive focus on adolescents. To address these limitations, future research should consider utilizing larger and more diverse samples encompassing various age groups and genders. While the current study employed multiple criteria to assess the content validity of the SBS, it is important to note that there is no definitive gold standard available for a comprehensive validation of the concept.
This study has made a significant contribution to the ongoing scientific discourse surrounding the psychological functions and underlying attitudes associated with selfie behavior, shedding light on the potential motivations driving this prevalent practice. Moreover, the findings of this research highlight the reliability and validity of the Selfitis Behavior Scale (SBS) as an effective tool for evaluating selfitis.
