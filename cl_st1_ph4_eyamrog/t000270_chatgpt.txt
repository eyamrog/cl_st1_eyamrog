The investigation of the algal flora at Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI) commenced in 1962, initially uncovering 17 desmid species from the hydrophytoterium at the São Paulo Botanical Gardens. However, a more systematic approach was only adopted 28 years later in 1990, leading to the establishment of the "Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga Cryptogamic flora." This comprehensive study primarily relies on specimens collected from the plankton, periphyton, and surface sediments of PEFI's water bodies, with additional samples obtained from tree barks, rocks, and soil. To date, 42 fascicles detailing the algal flora have been released, documenting a total of 869 taxa, encompassing species, varieties, and taxonomic formae. It is projected that 95% of the local algal flora has been cataloged, with the project anticipated to conclude by the end of 2020.
The initial documentation of the PEFI, Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga biota, likely emerged as the third significant contribution to understanding Brazilian orchids by Schlechter & Hoehne (1926). In their work, the authors identified a total of 13 orchid species within the PEFI region, among other findings.
Forty-six years passed before the first comprehensive attempt to document the algal biodiversity of PEFI was published. Bicudo & Bicudo (1962) were the pioneering researchers who examined samples collected from the hydrophytoterium, an artificial aquatic plant display system at the São Paulo Botanical Gardens. They identified seventeen desmid species, including Closterium cynthia De Notaris, C. leibleinii Kützing, C. moniliferum (Bory) Ehrenberg, C. navicula (Brébisson) Lütkemuller, C. parvulum Nägeli, C. setaceum Ehrenberg, C. venus Kützing, Desmidium cylindricum Greville, Euastrum ansatum Ehrenberg, E. oblongum (Greville) Ralfs, Micrasterias denticulata Brébisson, M. laticeps Nordstedt, M. rotata (Greville) Ralfs, Pleurotaenium ovatum Nordstedt, P. truncatum (Brébisson) Nägeli, Staurastrum cuspidatum Brébisson, and S. erlangense Reinsch, providing detailed descriptions and illustrations for each. In a subsequent study two years later, Bicudo & Bicudo (1965) expanded their inventory, identifying an additional 23 desmid taxa, which included 16 species, six varieties not typical of their respective species, and a taxonomic forma not typical of its respective variety. This list included Closterium gracile Brébisson, C. laterale Nordstedt, C. turgidum Ehrenberg var. giganteum Nordstedt, Cosmarium ocellatum Eichler & Gutwinski, Desmidium baileyi (Ralfs) Nordstedt f. tetragonum Nordstedt, D. swartzii C. Agardh var. amblyodon (Itzigsohn) Rabenhorst, Micrasterias laticeps Nordstedt var. acuminata Krieger, M. pinnatifida (Kützing) Ralfs, M. truncata (Corda) Brébisson var. truncata, M. truncata (Corda) Brébisson var. excavata Nordstedt, Sphaerozosma granulatum Roy & Bisset, Staurastrum inaequale Nordstedt, S. punctulatum Brébisson, S. quadrangulare Brébisson var. quadrangulare, S. quadrangulare Brébisson var. longispinum Börgesen, S. rotula Nordstedt, S. trifidum Nordstedt var. tortum (Börgesen) Grönblad, and Tetmemorus granulatus (Brébisson) Ralfs, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and illustrations. The material examined was collected from artificial tanks, ditches, and rain pools within the PEFI area, although specific locations were not specified.
Subsequent publications emerged without a coherent organizational framework. In 1990, the "Flora Criptogâmica do Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga" (Cryptogamic Flora of the Ipiranga Sources State Park) was established, comprising three distinct sections: algae, fungi and lichens, and bryophytes. The ensuing discussion encapsulates the findings accumulated over 28 years of dedicated research on the algal flora of PEFI.
The study area for this research is the PEFI, Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (Ipiranga sources State Park), situated in the southeast region of the Municipality São Paulo between parallels 23°38'08''S and 23°40'18''S and meridians 43°36'48''W and 43°36'00''W. PEFI encompasses an area of 526.30 hectares and is home to 24 sources of the Ipiranga Creek, which feed nine reservoirs known locally as lakes. Of particular significance are the Garças, Cisnes, Ninfeias, and IAG reservoirs due to their size. For more detailed information regarding the Garças, Ninfeias, and IAG reservoirs, please refer to Bicudo et al. (2002).
Methods - Plankton, periphyton, and surface sediment samples were collected using specific techniques. Plankton samples were obtained by utilizing a cone-shaped net with a ± 20 µm mesh nylon fabric, which was repeatedly passed through the top 30 cm layer of water bodies until a visible amount of material accumulated at the bottom of the attached flask. Samples from various depths within the water column were collected using a van Dorn sampler. Periphyton samples were gathered by collecting littoral plant specimens, which were either scraped in the field or in the laboratory using a razor blade or a brush made of marten’s hair to extract material closely adhered to the substrate. In some cases, plant specimens were manually squeezed to release loosely attached material. Algae residing in ravines among bryophytes or ferns were sampled using suction pipets. Additionally, rocks, tree trunks, and cement walls were scraped with a spatula, typically used for removing wall paint, to gather sufficient material for analysis. Sediment material from reservoir bottoms was collected using a van Dorn sampler. For a comprehensive understanding of these methods, Bicudo & Menezes (2017) provide detailed descriptions.
The majority of the materials gathered in the current inventory have been stored at the Instituto de Botânica Herbarium "Maria Eneyda P. Kauffmann Fidalgo" (SP). However, a small number of samples were not deposited due to being lost or damaged during the examination process.
With the exception of fascicle 18, which focused on the Volvocales (Chlorophyceae) and was published in the "Revista Brasileira de Botânica" (now known as the "Brazilian Journal of Botany"), all other fascicles were published in "Hoehnea," the journal specifically established for the publication of the "Flora Ficológica do PEFI" (PEFI Algal Flora). To date, forty-two fascicles have been published, and it is anticipated that the flora will be fully documented by the end of 2020. Table 1 below provides a comprehensive list of the groups that have been studied thus far, along with the corresponding number of taxa identified within each group.
The survey of freshwater algae in PEFI has been extensively conducted, spanning over 50 years of random samplings across various water bodies within the park. The collection efforts were focused on nine reservoirs, locally referred to as "lakes" (Garças, Ninfeias, IAG, Cisnes, Bambus I, Bambus II, Bugios, Monjolo, and Girinos), the hydrophytoterium at the São Paulo Botanical Gardens, and Pirarungáua Creek. These locations were visited multiple times, with some, such as Garças, Ninfeias, and IAG, being surveyed successively over months for ecology projects. Throughout the 57-year inventory period, approximately 1,000 sample units were gathered. Notably, the survey is yet to include the Radiococcaceae (Chlorophyceae), while the Coscinodiscophyceae and various other groups from the Bacillariophyta have been identified, including the Eunotiaceae, Pinnulariaceae, Cymbellales, Surirellales, and Rhopalodiales. However, the survey is still lacking data on all other diatom groups at this time.
A total of 986 samples were gathered for the current survey, with Ninfeias Lake emerging as the most frequented location within PEFI, accounting for 327 samples. Following closely behind were Garças Lake with 177 samples, the hydrophytoterium with 157, and the IAG Lake with 152 samples collected. Ninfeias Lake also boasted the highest number of identified taxa within the system, with Garças Lake trailing behind. The hydrophytoterium, while ranking third in sample collection, is a system that has been extensively manipulated, leading to uncertainty regarding its true floristic composition.
Plankton material (423 samples) constitutes the largest sample group, followed by periphyton (294), benthos (54), and surface sediments (28). Additionally, soil material, epiphyton, tree trunks, and epilithon were sampled on a smaller yet appropriate scale. It is crucial to note that the collection of periphytic material significantly enhanced knowledge, contributing approximately 40% of the total PEFI's inventoried taxa, which would have been missed if only plankton material had been gathered. Another noteworthy sample type that played a significant role in surveying the PEFI algal flora, particularly diatoms and non-pigmented euglenoids, was the collection of surface sediments from reservoirs.
Sixteen algal classes were documented in the PEFI area, with a total of 869 taxa surveyed, including species, varieties, and taxonomic formae. It is estimated that approximately 95% of all taxa in the PEFI area have been inventoried. Chlorophyceae stands out as the richest group in terms of species numbers, while the addition of Radiococcaceae to the total taxa count is expected to be minimal. Zygnematophyceae follows with 167 taxa, already surveyed in the PEFI area. Bacillariophyceae ranks third with 115 taxa, although this number likely does not fully represent the group's presence in the Park. While Chlorophyceae boasts a high number of genera, only a few have a significant number of species. In contrast, Zygnematophyceae, with fewer genera than Chlorophyceae, includes two (Cosmarium and Staurastrum) with a high number of species, contributing significantly to the class's total taxa count in the Park. Bacillariophyceae is known to have the largest number of taxa globally, indicating that there are still many species-rich groups within this class yet to be surveyed in the area.
The research findings revealed a strikingly high number of species, varieties, and taxonomic formae, capturing our attention. This abundance can be attributed primarily to the extensive sampling efforts spanning over 50 years of rigorous collection. The prolonged duration of the sampling period naturally resulted in the identification of a greater number of taxa. In addition to the sampling intensity, the taxonomic richness of the Plano Estadual de Florestas Inteligentes (PEFI) was significantly influenced by the diverse water body compartments explored, including plankton, periphyton, and surface sediments of semilentic systems such as reservoirs. Notably, the latter two compartments collectively contributed approximately 40% of the total taxa in the current flora inventory. This comprehensive approach undoubtedly facilitated the compilation of the most exhaustive freshwater algal flora survey ever conducted in Brazil.
A flora is not the product of one individual but rather a collaborative effort. We extend our deepest gratitude to the 20 professional researchers and the 19 students who have contributed to the development of the "PEFI Algal Flora" thus far.
