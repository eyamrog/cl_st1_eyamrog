The invasive terrestrial herb, Hedychium coronarium J. König (Zingiberaceae), is known for its competitive nature. In order to investigate its impact on the spider community in the soil, a total of 45 traps were strategically placed across three treatments and three replicates within the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga in São Paulo State, Brazil. Over the course of the year 2018, a total of 292 individual spiders were captured and identified. The Intermediate Areas exhibited the highest number of individuals and the greatest diversity index, with 107 spiders (37% of the total) belonging to 14 different species. This was followed by the Dominated Areas, where 97 individuals (33%) were found across 12 species, and the Free Areas, where 88 individuals (30%) were distributed among 10 species. The analysis conducted indicated that there were no significant differences in the spider assembly within the park, suggesting that these findings are not merely coincidental but potentially linked to the presence of H. coronarium. Additionally, it was observed that two spider families displayed variations in their distribution patterns.
Invasive alien species, once introduced from foreign environments, adapt, reproduce, and proliferate extensively, leading to disruptions in ecological processes and harm to native species. These biological invasions rank as the second largest contributor to global biodiversity loss (Mack et al., 2000; Latini et al., 2016). Pombo et al. (2016) highlight that such invasions bring about changes in ecological soil properties, nutrient cycling, water availability, trophic chains, population and community dynamics, and distribution. Additionally, invasive alien species impact ecosystem functions by altering biomass distribution and decomposition rates (Helsen et al., 2018), interfering with evolutionary processes, causing local species extinctions, and homogenizing ecosystems (Herrera et al., 2016).
Hedychium coronarium J. König (Zingiberaceae), commonly referred to as the "White garland-lily," is a monocot invasive alien species of significant importance. Possessing a herbaceous habit, it exhibits a competitive edge over other species owing to its rapid growth and notable phytochemical properties (Castro, 2013). The plant boasts aromatic inflorescence that entices nocturnal pollinators, such as moths, during the period from January to March, with seed dispersal facilitated by birds (Ferreira et al., 2016). Through asexual propagation via rhizomes, H. coronarium outcompetes native vegetation, as observed in studies by Santos et al. (2005).
The species, H. coronarium, has the capability to obstruct small streams and channels with its thick rhizomes, as noted by Lorenzi (2000) and Amaral et al. (2008), and has been identified as particularly damaging in Hawaii due to the formation of extensive monospecific patches, as highlighted by Herrera et al. (2016). Correa (1984) mentions the versatile uses of H. coronarium, including its ornamental, medicinal, fungicidal, and cosmetic properties, as well as the production of cellulose paste from its textile fibers, as supported by Kissmann & Groth (1991), Silva (2006), Martins et al. (2010), and Carrara et al. (2012). Ferreira et al. (2016) propose a ban on the sale of this species in florists and nurseries as a control measure to prevent further invasions. The conducive climate of Brazil, similar to Southeast Asia, has facilitated the growth and dispersion of H. coronarium across all Brazilian states, as evidenced in virtual catalogs of Brazilian national herbariums (Flora do Brasil 2020). The accidental introduction of this species into Brazilian territory may have occurred through the transportation of commercial plants on ships or for landscaping purposes, as discussed by Primack & Rodrigues (2001), Ziller (2001), and Petenon & Pivello (2008).
This species has the potential to exert a detrimental influence on plant populations, including Cucumis sativus L., and animals such as Formicivora paludicola Buzzetti et al. 2014, as noted by Rodrigues & Lopes (2006) and Del-Rio (2014). Notably, the rapid proliferation of this species is compounded by the absence of a known effective predator. Nevertheless, Castro (2013) documented the first herbivore record, highlighting the incorporation of H. coronarium into the food chain of Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris Linnaeus 1766.
Several studies have been conducted on the utilization of this species and recent warnings regarding the impacts caused by this plant; however, literature pertaining to arthropods, particularly spiders, remains scarce. Spiders, being a megadiverse group, possess characteristics that enable them to thrive in various environments (World Spider Catalog 2021). They are categorized into guilds based on habitat and foraging behaviors (Uetz 1977, Cardoso et al. 2011), recognized for their efficacy as controllers of pest populations (Aguilar 1988, Flórez 2000), and have the ability to indirectly interact with invasive plants, thereby influencing the arthropod community (Mgobozi et al. 2008). According to Bultman & De-Witt (2008), the invasive alien species Vinca minor L. (Apocynaceae) has been shown to impact the mobility of native spiders, resulting in a reduction in their abundance.
This study investigates the impact of H. coronarium on the composition of soil spider communities in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI). It was hypothesized that H. coronarium would affect spider abundance due to its tendency to form monospecific populations, similar to V. minor as noted in the publication by Bultman & De-Witt (2008). The significance of this research on spider diversity is heightened by the ongoing land removal in the area, as well as the frequent passage of vehicles and research groups, underscoring the importance of studying spider diversity in this region. The findings contribute to our understanding of ecological interactions between spiders and plants, emphasizing the need for caution when introducing species into conservation units.
The study area, Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI), is situated in the municipality of São Paulo at coordinates 23°39’S and 46°37’W, with an average altitude of 798 m (Melhem et al., 1981). The predominant phytophysiognomy in this area is the Dense Ombrophilous Rainforest. Sampling units were strategically chosen near Lago das Garças, along a dirt road connecting the Instituto de Botânica to the Zoológico de São Paulo, where H. coronarium is widely distributed (see figure 1).
The effect of H. coronarium on the assembly of soil spiders was compared using a method akin to that of Robertson et al. (2011), albeit with only three treatments, each with three replicates. This deviation from the study by Robertson et al. (2011) is due to the constant removal of invasive plants in PEFI, resulting in limited areas affected by H. coronarium. The selection of study areas in close proximity aimed to minimize influences from distant regions. Within the protected area, the only environment with a satisfactory amount of H. coronarium for all three treatments was identified. The treatments encompassed dominated areas (DA) where H. coronarium exclusively covered the soil, intermediate areas (IA) with 50% ground coverage, and free areas (FA) devoid of H. coronarium. Each sample unit measured 100 m² (see figure 2 a-c).
Spiders were collected using pitfall traps, which were constructed using 2-liter plastic pots with dimensions of 18 × 13 cm and a depth of 12 cm (see Figure 2d). Each pot was filled with 500 ml of water mixed with neutral detergent and left in place for 48 hours before being removed. A total of 45 pitfall traps were collected monthly over the course of one year, with five traps in each replicate. These traps were strategically positioned, with one trap placed in the center of the sample unit and the remaining four traps located at 1.5 m from each vertex towards the center (see Figure 3).
Data analysis involved the utilization of various species richness estimators including Bootstrap, Jackknife 1, Jackknife 2, Chao 1, Chao 2, and ICE to assess sampling sufficiency and estimate potential species presence. These calculations were executed using EstimateS 9.1 (Colwell 2013), with the resulting estimator curve juxtaposed against the observed species curve. The combined count of all treatments (each sample representing the total spiders collected monthly per treatment) was subjected to scrutiny for significant differences (p < 0.05) in the number of collected individuals across treatments. This assessment involved the application of the Shapiro-Wilk test, Levene test, ANOVA test, post-hoc Tukey HSD test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and post-hoc Dunn’s, conducted through the R program (R Development Core Team 2009). However, any inconclusive outcomes were omitted from the study. The Simpson Diversity t test, carried out using Past 2.1 (Hammer et al. 2001), was employed to identify significant differences (p < 0.05), while Cluster analysis was executed using the Bray-Curtis similarity index and the UPGMA clustering method.
A total of 292 spiders from 17 families were collected in this study. Among these, only 35 individuals, constituting 12% of the total, were identified as adults, representing 20 species across 11 families. The families exclusively represented by young individuals included Oxyopidae, Pholcidae, and Sparassidae, each with four individuals, Anyphaenidae with two individuals, and Philodromidae and Scytodidae with one individual each. Families with sampled adult individuals included Linyphiidae (nine adults), Corinnidae (eight), Theridiidae (seven), Salticidae (three), Idiopidae (two), and Ctenidae, Nemesiidae, Pycnothelidae, Theridiosomatidae, Xenoctenidae, and Zodariidae, each with only one adult individual.
Among the identified species, Theridiidae exhibited the highest diversity with five species, trailed by Corinnidae and Linyphiidae, each comprising three species. Notably, out of the 20 species cataloged, Ianduba varia (Keyserling, 1891) stood out as the most prevalent with six individuals, constituting 17.14% of the total adult population, followed closely by Agyneta sp. with five individuals (14.28%). The remaining species were represented by only one or two individuals each, as illustrated in Table 1.
Despite the limited species richness and low number of collected adult individuals, a Cluster analysis revealed an 82% similarity in family composition between the IA and DA treatments (see figure 4). The IA treatment exhibited the highest species count with 14, followed by DA with nine and FA with four species (refer to table 1); however, the treatments did not show significant differentiation from one another.
The species richness estimators that closely approximated the total number of observed species were Bootstrap and Jackknife 1, suggesting a potential presence of 24 – 31 species (Figure 5a). This outcome was derived from an analysis of richness per treatment, with only Bootstrap falling within the standard deviation across the three treatments (FA, IA, and DA). Jackknife 2 and Chao 1 were found to be less conservative, while Jackknife 1 and Bootstrap emerged as the more conservative estimators. Notably, IA exhibited the smallest variance among estimators (Figure 5c), whereas DA and FA displayed the largest disparities between estimations (Figure 5b, d).
The data from the total number of collected individuals, including both youth and adults, exhibit a normal distribution, with no significant difference detected by the ANOVA test (F-value = 0.414; P-value = 0.678) and p-values exceeding 0.5 in the Simpson Diversity t-test. Comparisons between treatments show no significant differences, as supported by the Tukey HSD statistical test. Additionally, the sampled data within each treatment adhere to normal distribution, as confirmed by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (W-test) (see table 2).
The family Linyphiidae was represented by a total of 101 individuals, with 47 (46.52%) collected in FA and 27 (26.74%) in each of the other areas. However, the ANOVA test did not reveal a significant difference (F-value = 1.274; P-value = 0.346). During the cold and dry period (April to September), Linyphiidae specimens were predominantly found in FA and IA. The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed the normality of data distribution, and the ANOVA test did not yield a significant difference (F-value = 2.121; P-value = 0.201). Conversely, in the rainy period (October to March), the majority of specimens were collected in DA (refer to Figure 6). The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated a significant difference (W-test = 0.7500; P-value = 0.00000000000000002), which, however, was not supported by the Kruskal-Wallis test or the Dunn post-hoc analysis, conducted using the Bonferroni method.
Corinnidae were represented by 84 individuals, with 32 (38.1%) collected in DA and 20 individuals (23.8%) in IA and FA. The ANOVA test did not reveal any significant differences (F-value = 0.98; P-value = 0.428). Throughout both the cold and dry periods and the hot and rainy periods, Corinnidae were predominantly collected in DA and IA (Figure 6b), as indicated by the ANOVA test (F-value = 0.208; P-value = 0.818). The family exhibited a normal distribution in the treatments according to the post-hoc analysis. Notably, only FA during the cold and dry period showed a significant difference (W-test = 0.7500; P-value = 0.00000000000000002), although this distinction was not confirmed in the Kruskal-Wallis test or in the Dunn’s post-hoc analysis adjusted for the Bonferroni method.
Theridiidae was represented by 37 individuals, with 16 (43%) collected in the DA, 13 (35%) in the IA, and 8 (22%) in the FA. The DA exhibited a significant difference in the Shapiro-Wilk test (W-test = 0.7500; P-value = 0.000000000000000022), although this distinction was not evident in the Kruskal-Wallis test or in the Dunn’s post-hoc analysis, adjusted for the Bonferroni method. When considering the time of year, the heat and humidity period did not reveal significant differences, while during the cold and dry period, no distinctions were observed between DA and IA individuals, and FA individuals were absent from the collection.
The Xenoctenidae family was represented by 30 individuals, with 20 (67%) collected in the IA, 7 (23%) in the DA, and 3 (10%) in the FA. Significant differences were observed among treatments in the ANOVA test (F-value = 4.017; P-Value = 0.0781), with the Tukey HSD test revealing distinctions only between IA and FA (P-value = 0.0781). When considering the time of year, the family exhibited variations primarily during the hot and humid periods in the IA and FA, as well as in the cold and dry period in the FA (W-test = 0.7500; P-value = 0.00000000000000002). The Levene test, utilizing the mean as a reference, indicated differences in variance homogeneity solely during the heat and humidity period (F-value = 5.0256; P-value = 0.05223), although this distinction was not evident when the median was employed as a basis (F-value = 0.4138; P-value = 0.6787). Data related to the time of year did not yield significant differences in the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-hoc analysis, even after adjusting for the Bonferroni method.
In this study, a considerable number of individuals were sampled, predominantly comprising young individuals, which hindered the ability to pinpoint a specific level of species richness. Contrary to Bultman's study and De-Witt (2008), the observed species richness was not linked to H. coronarium but potentially linked to the anthropic impact in the region. The study area is adjacent to a dirt road with continuous vehicular traffic and a significant influx of residents and employees working in the PEFI's research zones, leading to the constant eradication of this invasive plant.
The lack of a universally adopted method for spider collection poses challenges in result comparison. Nonetheless, the data gathered in this study align with findings from various geographical areas. Linyphiidae and Theridiidae emerge as prominent families in multiple investigations (Lopes et al., 2008; Silva et al., 2014; Breitenbach et al., 2015). Specifically, in this research, Linyphiidae was notably more prevalent in the FA treatment.
The statistical analysis reveals that the treatments exhibit similarity concerning spider diversity, yet the two most prevalent families were predominantly found in distinct locations. Notably, fluctuations in temperature and humidity were not found to impact the distribution of the spider community (Maciel, 2011). However, leaf architecture can affect various guilds divergently, despite its lack of influence on their prey (Diniz, 2011).
The Linyphiidae family is commonly associated with litter and constructs sheet-shaped webs near the ground, often being captured in pitfall traps (Ferro 2008, Ubick et al. 2005). Previous studies have consistently identified Linyphiidae as the most abundant family (Ferro 2008, Silva et al. 2014, Breitenbach et al. 2015). Research by Gonçalves-Souza (2008) supports the preference of these spiders for forest interiors, aligning with the findings of the present study. The higher abundance of individuals observed in DA during the hot and humid seasons could be linked to their search for climatic refuge within the dense foliage of H. coronarium, creating a cooler microenvironment. However, further investigations are necessary to validate this hypothesis.
Corinnidae, typically larger than Linyphiidae, exhibit a glossy black coloration that renders them more conspicuous to predators. It is plausible that these spiders evade predation by seeking shelter in habitats with denser foliage, offering enhanced protection, as suggested by Dinniz (2011). Additionally, the preference of Corinnidae for moist environments, as highlighted by Patucci (2018), is a contributing factor. H. coronarium, a member of this family, has the ability to retain small amounts of water in specific plant regions.
Spider families can be categorized into five distinct behavioral guilds as proposed by Diniz (2011). The findings of this study reveal that the most prevalent families are associated with the Builders of Three-dimensional Web (TDW) guild, exemplified by Linyphiidae and Theridiidae, and the Night Corridors (NC) guild, represented by Corinnidae and Xenoctenidae. Members of the TDW guild exhibit a pronounced affinity for denser leaf structures and a preference for plants with greater spacing between leaves, as supported by statistical evidence for Linyphiidae, which aligns with their inclination towards open areas. Further research is warranted to fully comprehend the dynamics of Theridiidae. Conversely, spiders within the NC guild display a preference for environments with intricate structures, likely seeking refuge from predators and parasites within the plant architecture, a notion supported by the higher prevalence of NC guild spiders in areas with complex structures, as per Diniz (2011) and existing literature.
This study revealed that Hedychium coronarium does not directly impact the population dynamics of soil spider assemblages. Although significant differences were observed, these were not confirmed in post-hoc analyses, suggesting that impacts may be more evident when studying groups with lower behavioral complexity, such as guilds, families, and species. Weaver spiders exhibited a preference for IA, while Linyphiidae displayed varying preferences influenced by seasonal changes. Runner spiders, conversely, showed a consistent preference for DA throughout the year. Further research on these ecological relationships in undisturbed habitats is essential to supplement the findings presented here, particularly considering the spread of H. coronarium in numerous conservation areas in Brazil. Understanding such relationships can aid in the conservation of species, particularly predatory arthropods like spiders, which play a crucial role in controlling insect populations.
