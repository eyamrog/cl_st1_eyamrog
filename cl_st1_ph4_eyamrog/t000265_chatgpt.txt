In December 2019, a novel human coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSâ€‘CoV-2) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as designated by the World Health Organization, emerged in Wuhan, China. Rapidly spreading worldwide, it has been declared a pandemic, with an estimated 3 million cases globally by the end of April. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and headache, with shortness of breath being a predominant feature. There appears to be a correlation between COVID-19 and cardiac muscle damage, with individuals suffering from hypertension and diabetes exhibiting a poorer prognosis. Consequently, individuals with pre-existing health conditions may experience exacerbated symptoms, and a significant proportion of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have been diagnosed with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. The link between systemic inflammatory responses, immune system dysregulation, and disease progression is being explored in this context. The virus utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptors, specifically ACE2, for cellular entry, raising concerns that ACE inhibitor medications and angiotensin receptor blockers could potentially upregulate these receptors, facilitating viral entry. Despite these concerns, there is currently no scientific evidence supporting the discontinuation of these essential medications. Given their critical role in managing chronic conditions, the decision to discontinue these drugs in the context of COVID-19 should be carefully evaluated based on individual risk-benefit assessments. Lastly, cardiologists and healthcare professionals must remain vigilant about the risks of infection, prioritize adequate rest, and avoid prolonged working hours to safeguard their own health.
In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases caused by a novel coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in Wuhan, China. This virus is identified as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the official name designated by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, respiratory tract, and other bodily systems. Phylogenetic evidence suggests a zoonotic origin, indicating transmission from animals to humans, with subsequent person-to-person spread. The virus has been detected in various bodily fluids such as sputum, saliva, and throat and nasopharyngeal swabs, indicating potential transmission through respiratory droplets. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum production, myalgia/arthralgia, lymphopenia, and prolonged prothrombin time, with shortness of breath being a prominent indicator of the disease.
While the precise impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system remains largely unexplored, emerging reports suggest a range of potential complications including arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, tachycardia, and a notable prevalence of underlying cardiovascular conditions among infected individuals. This trend appears to be more pronounced in patients with elevated comorbidities and risk factors, necessitating heightened levels of intensive care.
Diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 typically involves electron microscopy for morphological identification, although the current gold standard method relies on detecting nucleic acid in nasal swabs, throat samples, or other respiratory tract samples through real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by confirmation through next-generation sequencing.
It is imperative to emphasize that prevention remains the most effective form of treatment. Basic practices like regular handwashing with soap, utilizing alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and disinfecting commonly touched surfaces, including cell phones, are crucial in mitigating the transmission of the virus.
Recent data as of April 23 revealed that the global tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases had surpassed 2,700,000. By January 30, 2020, 9,976 cases had been reported across at least 21 countries. A month later, the number surged to 83,652 cases with 2,791 fatalities, indicating a mortality rate of 3.4%. The spread of cases extended to 24 countries across 5 continents. In Brazil, as of March 3, 488 suspected cases were documented in 23 states. By April 23, the country had confirmed approximately 49,500 cases and 3,313 deaths due to COVID-19. Italy witnessed its first case on February 20 when a young man in Lombardy was hospitalized with an unusual pneumonia, later identified as COVID-19. Within 24 hours, 36 more cases emerged, none of which had links to the initial patient or known COVID-19 carriers. Despite stringent containment measures, the disease persists in its spread, particularly affecting elderly individuals with a notable fatality rate. Hence, special consideration must be directed towards safeguarding this vulnerable population.
As of April 23, the global tally of COVID-19 cases had reached 2,707,356, with China accounting for 83,880 cases. Among the 190,743 deaths reported worldwide by that date, 4,636 were in China. Europe, on the other hand, had recorded 1,193,276 cases and 114,259 deaths, marking it as the region with the most significant surge in new infections within a 24-hour period. Additionally, various regions, such as Somalia, Benin, Liberia, and the Bahamas, had reported their initial cases of the virus.
There exist uncertainties regarding the accuracy of estimates concerning the actual number of individuals infected, a critical factor in assessing the severity of the infection, the prevalence of mild or asymptomatic cases, and the potential for transmission.
Epidemiological data on COVID-19 among children is limited. Dong et al. (16) conducted a retrospective analysis on children, with an average age of 7 years, included in the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention between January 16 and February 8, 2020. Their study revealed 731 confirmed cases and 1,412 suspected cases. Notably, over 90% of these cases were either asymptomatic or presented with mild to moderate symptoms. These findings underscore the susceptibility of children of all ages to COVID-19, emphasizing the need for comprehensive attention and care across the entire population, without age distinctions.
Respiratory infections and influenza have been identified as significant contributors to the short-term elevation of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke risk. Recent studies have highlighted the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, indicating its potential to exacerbate myocardial damage. Data analysis reveals that acute cardiac injury, shock, and arrhythmia were prevalent in 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7% of patients, respectively, with higher occurrences among those in intensive care. Given the virus's capacity to harm the cardiovascular system, it is imperative to prioritize cardiovascular protection in the management of COVID-19. Notably, cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension and disease have been linked to a heightened case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China.
Myocardial injury linked to SARS-CoV-2 was documented in 5 out of the initial 41 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan, exhibiting high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels exceeding 28 pg/ml. In a separate investigation from 2019, Panhwar et al. noted that simultaneous influenza infection heightened risks among hospitalized individuals with heart failure. A study involving 25 patients who had recuperated from SARS-CoV-1 infection revealed that nearly half displayed cardiovascular system alterations, while 60% exhibited glucose metabolism irregularities. Furthermore, a study encompassing 1,099 confirmed COVID-19 patients highlighted that 173 individuals experienced severe illness, with prevalent comorbidities including hypertension (23.7%), diabetes mellitus (16.2%), coronary diseases (5.8%), and cerebrovascular disease (2.3%).
In an analysis of data from 138 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in China, it was found that the median duration between the onset of the initial symptom and the development of dyspnea was 5 days, while the median duration between the first symptom and hospital admission was 7 days. Chest computed tomography scans revealed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Around 90% of the patients received antiviral treatment with oseltamivir, and over 60% were administered antibacterial therapy with moxifloxacin. Thirty-six patients necessitated transfer to the intensive care unit due to complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (61.1%), arrhythmia (44.4%), and shock (30.6%). Those requiring intensive care were typically older, had underlying comorbidities, and experienced dyspnea. By February 3, 34% of patients had been discharged, while 6 had succumbed to the illness, resulting in an overall mortality rate of 4.3%.
In individuals with COVID-19, there is a notable prevalence of cardiovascular symptoms, attributed to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system dysregulation that occurs throughout the course of the disease. Those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions who contract COVID-19 are at an increased risk of experiencing a more severe prognosis. Consequently, it is imperative to prioritize cardiovascular protection as a crucial component of the treatment regimen for COVID-19 patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 infection utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptors, specifically ACE2, as an entry point into host cells. Consequently, there is a hypothesis suggesting that the administration of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) might upregulate these receptors, potentially enhancing viral entry.
The Brazilian Society of Cardiology recently highlighted the significance of utilizing medications like ACE inhibitors and ARBs, stressing the lack of conclusive evidence linking the use of these drugs to a deteriorating prognosis of the disease. It is advised that physicians thoroughly assess the risk-benefit ratio before discontinuing these medications, considering their essential role in managing chronic conditions like hypertension and heart failure. Patients are also urged not to cease their usage without consulting their healthcare providers first, emphasizing the importance of informed decision-making in medication management.
The Coronavirus, a group of viruses known to cause respiratory infections, includes COVID-19, a severe illness necessitating specialized care. Those experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing should promptly seek medical attention. It is crucial to dispel the misconception that COVID-19 solely affects older individuals; young people and children are also susceptible. Nevertheless, older patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions who contract COVID-19 may face a more severe prognosis. Mitigating the spread and severity of the disease, particularly in cardiovascular patients, can be achieved through practices like frequent handwashing, using alcohol-based sanitizers, coughing into the elbow, and avoiding crowded spaces.
