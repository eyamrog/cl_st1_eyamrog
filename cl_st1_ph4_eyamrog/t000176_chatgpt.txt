Background: A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients exhibit neurological symptoms, spanning from anosmia to severe conditions like stroke and encephalopathy. Additionally, individuals with pre-existing neurological disorders may necessitate tailored treatment approaches and could potentially experience more adverse outcomes. Despite these implications, the contribution and significance of neurologists in the context of COVID-19 management are likely underestimated.
Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the factors driving internists and intensivists to seek neurological consultations within a hospital exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 care.
Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil, a 900-bed COVID-19 dedicated center with 300 intensive care unit beds. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed through SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR testing on nasal swabs. All inpatient neurology consultations from March 23rd to May 23rd, 2020 were scrutinized. Neurologists conducted comprehensive neurological examinations, evaluated all accessible data for diagnosing neurological conditions, and ordered additional tests as deemed necessary. Challenging diagnoses were deliberated upon in consensus meetings. Following diagnosis, neurologists actively participated in the treatment process.
Results: Neurological consultations were requested for 89 out of 1,208 (7.4%) inpatient COVID admissions during that period. The primary neurological diagnoses comprised encephalopathy (44.4%), stroke (16.7%), pre-existing neurological conditions (9.0%), seizures (9.0%), neuromuscular disorders (5.6%), other acute brain lesions (3.4%), and miscellaneous mild nonspecific symptoms (11.2%).
Conclusions: The majority of neurological consultations at a COVID-19-dedicated hospital were sought for severe conditions with potential implications for patient outcomes. It is imperative for primary care physicians to be adept at identifying neurological symptoms, underscoring the crucial role of neurologists as integral members of the medical team in the provision of care for COVID-19 patients.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic disease with unknown consequences. By mid-May 2020, nearly five million reported infections and over 300,000 deaths worldwide had been attributed to SARS-CoV-2. Despite its initial characterization as primarily a respiratory illness, emerging evidence indicates that neuropsychiatric complications play a significant role in the disease. A Chinese retrospective cohort study revealed that impaired consciousness was present in 7.5% of COVID-19 patients and in 14.8% of severe cases. Neurological manifestations are nearly universal in severely affected COVID-19 patients, with agitation or positive CAM-ICU findings observed in more than 65% of cases. Additionally, COVID-19 can lead to complications such as encephalopathy, headache, and stroke.
Pre-existing neurological diseases have been linked to heightened disease severity and unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19. Additionally, comorbid SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to result in elevated rates of disability among acute neurological patients. Concerns are also growing regarding the potential adverse effects of COVID-19 on the management of chronic neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.
The significance of inpatient neurological assessment and treatment during the pandemic is underscored by these issues. Neurology societies have emphasized the necessity of restructuring neurology consultation services for both inpatient and outpatient settings. While a limited number of retrospective case series have documented the presence of particular neurological symptoms and signs in COVID-19 patients, systematic reports detailing the practical experiences of consulting neurologists are scarce, with the exception of the anecdotal editorial by Bersano and Pantoni.
The aim of this study was to outline the primary reasons for internists and intensivists seeking neurological consultations at a COVID-19 specialized hospital, as well as to determine the prevalence of specific neurological diagnoses in a practical setting over a span of 60 days.
In March 2020, the Instituto Central do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil (ICHC-HCFMUSP) was designated as a COVID-dedicated tertiary referral center with 900 beds, including 300 Intensive Care Units (ICU) beds. Following its reorganization, a team comprising seven neurologists and eight neurology residents was tasked with offering on-demand consultations exclusively for COVID-19 patients.
Patients hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 underwent SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with throat swab samples. In instances where there was a high clinical suspicion despite a negative PCR result, a repeat RT-PCR test was conducted.
This retrospective study exclusively included PCR-positive cases assessed by the neurology inpatient consultation team from March 23rd to May 23rd, 2020. It represents a real-life scenario where neurological consultations were sought based on the judgment of the attending physician for each patient.
Patient clinical evaluation encompassed a comprehensive assessment involving clinical examination, standard laboratory investigations such as blood cell count, biochemical analysis, liver and renal function tests, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase, in addition to chest computed tomography (CT). The patients were stratified into two distinct groups according to the severity of their respiratory manifestations, categorized as severe and non-severe. Severe respiratory symptoms were characterized by respiratory insufficiency necessitating mechanical ventilation.
The purpose of this study involved retrieving the rationale for seeking neurological consultation and the ultimate neurological diagnosis from the electronic form utilized for specialist consultations. The neurological assessment encompassed a thorough examination along with supplementary ancillary assessments such as brain CT scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, all of which were ordered based on the neurologist's professional judgment.
Difficult diagnostic cases were deliberated upon during a consensus meeting involving the Neurology Department staff at Hospital das Clínicas. In instances where multiple neurological diagnoses were identified, the ultimate diagnosis was determined based on the most severe condition or the most likely cause of the condition. For instance, if an encephalopathy was attributed to a confirmed stroke, the final diagnosis would be stroke. The neurological diagnoses were subsequently categorized into four primary groups: encephalopathy, cerebrovascular disease, epilepsy, and neuromuscular disease. A fifth group, labeled as "others," encompassed diagnoses that did not align with the aforementioned categories (such as headache or vertigo), as well as the management or monitoring of pre-existing neurological conditions.
All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software, version 21.0 (SPSS, IBM Statistics, Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical variables were presented as absolute and relative frequencies and compared using Pearson’s χ2 univariate analysis. Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviations and compared using either Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney test based on the normality distribution. All tests were two-tailed, and statistical significance was considered at p<0.05.
The investigation protocol was approved by the institutional review board, which also waived the need for informed consent due to the retrospective nature of the study and the absence of any experimental interventions performed on patients.
Throughout the observed timeframe, a total of 1,208 patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital, with 89 requests for neurological consultations being made, accounting for 7.4% of the cases. The frequency of neurological consultations exhibited a notable escalation, starting at 0.3 consultations per day during the initial week and surging to 3.6 consultations per day by the final week, marking a twelve-fold surge in demand as illustrated in Figure 1.
Roughly half of the patients presented severe respiratory conditions necessitating orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, as indicated in Table 1. The mean age of the 89 cases stood at 57.4 +/- 15.9 years, with no discernible differences between the groups; the majority of patients (61.8%) were male. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus emerged as the most prevalent comorbidities. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the most commonly reported typical symptoms of COVID-19, while anosmia and dysgeusia were infrequently mentioned by patients. Notably, 39 patients (43.8%) had a prior neurological diagnosis, as outlined in Table 1.
The primary reasons for seeking neurological consultation included altered levels of consciousness, muscle weakness, and psychomotor agitation. In eleven instances, the neurologist was summoned to aid in the care and monitoring of patients with pre-existing neurological conditions lacking acute neurological symptoms (refer to Table 2). Occasionally, clinicians noted multiple symptoms in their requests for neurological consultations. The predominant ancillary tests conducted were brain CT scans (in 71 patients) and lumbar punctures (in 27 patients), with brain MRIs being carried out in only 15 patients (20.0%).
The most common diagnoses included delirium/encephalopathy, stroke, pre-existing neurological conditions, seizures, neuromuscular disorders, other acute brain lesions, and various mild nonspecific symptoms as outlined in Table 3 and Figure 2.
Associations were identified between specific reasons for neurological consultation requested by the internist and the final diagnoses determined by the neurologist. For instance, an altered level of consciousness was found to be correlated with encephalopathy, muscle weakness was associated with cerebrovascular disease, and both seizures and transient changes in consciousness were linked to epilepsy, as indicated in Table 4.
In this research, a total of 89 neurological consultations were examined, which were requested from a pool of 1,208 COVID-19 patients who had been admitted to a specialized tertiary referral hospital associated with a university, focusing on the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases, representing 7.4% of the overall patient population. Within this context, patients underwent assessments by neurologists possessing equivalent levels of training, and instances of complex cases were deliberated upon during a weekly consensus meeting involving the neurology department's personnel.
Over 65% of the complications observed were classified as severe or potentially severe, encompassing conditions such as encephalopathy, acute cerebrovascular disease, and non-vascular acute encephalic lesions, all of which have the potential to lead to significant neurological consequences. These severe complications were evident across patients requiring mechanical ventilation as well as those with milder forms of the illness.
During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mao et al. documented the presence of neurological symptoms in 214 individuals who were hospitalized in three specialized COVID-19 medical facilities in Wuhan, China. Through a retrospective examination of medical records, the researchers identified that 78 patients, constituting 36.4% of the total, exhibited signs of central or peripheral nervous system involvement. The spectrum of manifestations varied from mild symptoms like anosmia and headaches to more severe conditions such as stroke and encephalopathy. Notably, within this cohort, a significant proportion of 28.2% experienced severe central nervous system (CNS) complications, including acute cerebrovascular events and altered consciousness levels, underscoring the gravity of neurological implications associated with COVID-19.
In a study mirroring the methodology employed in Wuhan, neurological manifestations were identified in 512 out of 841 patients (57.4%) across two COVID-19 hospitals in Spain. Severe manifestations of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, categorized similarly to the present study, were reported in 36.5% of the cases.
In an observational case series conducted by Helms et al., neurological manifestations were documented in 58 consecutive patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome in Strasbourg, France. All patients received treatment in intensive care units. The study found that 69% of the patients exhibited agitation upon discontinuation of neuromuscular blockade, while 67% showed signs of diffuse corticospinal tract involvement. Interestingly, the severity of neurological manifestations observed in these cases of acute respiratory failure was reported to be higher than what was observed in the sample under study.
The lower frequency and increased severity of neurological involvement observed in our study are likely attributed to case ascertainment, mirroring real-world scenarios where neurologists are consulted to assess patients exhibiting concerning signs or symptoms identified by internists or intensivists. Consequently, our study exhibited a bias towards rarer and more severe manifestations, reflecting the nature of the cases referred for neurological evaluation.
Our data indicates that neurological manifestations are prevalent in cases necessitating mechanical ventilation, as well as in less severe instances. Surprisingly, the occurrence of severe neurological conditions like stroke and encephalopathy was found to be equally common in both more and less severe patient groups.
Neurological manifestations in COVID-19 may arise from indirect involvement of the nervous system due to systemic conditions like hypoxia, uremia, coagulopathy, and critical care neuropathy. Alternatively, they can stem from the invasion of the central nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 or be triggered by mechanisms like inflammatory and immune-mediated responses, including post-infectious reactions.
Indirect (systemic) mechanisms supporting neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, like encephalopathy, are underscored by the absence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the general lack of brain involvement signs on neuroimaging (CT and MRI) in the majority of cases where these tests were conducted. Recent postmortem analysis of brain specimens from 18 COVID-19 deceased individuals revealed no inflammatory changes suggestive of encephalitis or alterations linked to a direct viral impact, instead highlighting hypoxic changes as the primary findings.
On the contrary, case reports and small case series have presented evidence indicating direct central nervous system (CNS) involvement in COVID-19 infection. For instance, Moriguchi et al. in Japan documented a case of meningoencephalitis with medial temporal lobe lesions on MRI, where SARS-CoV-2 was identified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through RT-PCR. In the study by Helms et al., leptomeningeal enhancement was observed on MRI in 8 out of 13 patients, and bilateral frontotemporal hypoperfusion was noted in all 11 patients who underwent perfusion MRI. Another report highlighted MRI findings of subtle hyperintensity in the olfactory bulbs and cortical hyperintensity in the right gyrus rectus, indicative of local invasion and direct brain parenchymal involvement by SARS-CoV-2 in a case presenting with anosmia. Particularly noteworthy was the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in neurons and endothelial cells in the frontal lobe of a COVID-19 case through electron microscopy, further confirmed by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the brain using RT-PCR. Interestingly, in this instance, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF yielded negative results.
SARS-CoV-2 encephalopathy can also be attributed to acute necrotizing encephalopathy and encephalitis linked to an exaggerated inflammatory response in the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by elevated levels of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), possibly stemming from a hyperinflammatory systemic reaction against SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent compromise of the blood-brain barrier. Alternatively, encephalitis may arise from a CNS-specific inflammatory reaction. Reports of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in SARS-CoV-2 patients suggest a likely immune-mediated mechanism triggered by the virus, resulting in inflammatory lesions within the CNS.
In our study, the presence of neurological manifestations in individuals with milder cases of COVID-19 systemic disease suggests that neurological symptoms may arise independently of systemic involvement in some cases, indicating a potentially diverse range of underlying causes. Additional research is necessary to uncover the specific mechanisms responsible for the neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, which could lead to the development of more targeted therapeutic strategies and potentially mitigate the severity of the virus's impact on the nervous system.
The retrospective nature of our study imposes certain limitations. For instance, the information regarding pre-admission symptoms of COVID-19 and neurological symptoms was often reliant on accounts from relatives of critically ill or confused patients, potentially introducing recall bias. Additionally, pertinent clinical and demographic data, such as the prevalence of obesity or the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, were not accessible. Our patient cohort was derived from neurology consultations initiated by internists, representing only 7.4% of the total COVID-19 cases in our hospital, thereby restricting our ability to assess the overall prevalence of specific signs and diagnoses in the broader COVID-19 population. Variability in the perceived necessity for neurological evaluations, particularly in severely ill patients, may have existed among different medical teams. Notably, there was a noticeable increase in the number of requests for neurological consultations over the study period, likely indicating a heightened awareness of the frequency and severity of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the significance of specialized neurology care for these patients. As is common in studies conducted in COVID-19 specialized facilities, limitations in access to diagnostic tools such as MRI, CT scans, electroencephalography, CSF analysis, electroneuromyography, and neuropathological examinations were present. It is important to clarify that the primary aim of this study was not to delve into the intricate details of individual cases to establish the pathophysiology of conditions like stroke, encephalopathy, seizures, and other neurological disorders, which we plan to address in subsequent publications. Furthermore, we are currently preparing neuroimaging and CSF findings for future dissemination.
The primary findings of this research can be summarized as follows:
Severe neurological complications necessitating intervention by neurologists are frequently observed in patients with COVID-19.
These complications occur with similar frequency in patients experiencing severe respiratory failure necessitating respiratory support and those who are less severely ill and exhibit no significant respiratory symptoms.
Neurologists should be integrated into the medical teams in specialized COVID-19 hospitals, while internists should receive training to identify neurological complications and to promptly seek neurology consultations when necessary. Further research is essential to enhance our comprehension of the pathophysiology underlying nervous system manifestations in individuals with SARS-CoV-2, enabling the development of more efficient therapeutic strategies to mitigate and prevent severe neurological complications.
