In the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, more than 8 million residents rely on the water supplied by the company responsible for water and sewage, sourced from the Guandu river's water treatment station. However, since January 2020, the water has been reported by the population to exhibit unusual odors, tastes, and colors. Analysis of the raw water microbiome through metagenomics revealed the presence of cyanobacteria, specifically the Planktothricoides genus and the Planktothricoides sp. SR001 species, as the most prevalent. This finding raises concerns for public health, as cyanobacteria have the potential to produce cyanotoxins that can adversely impact human health.
Cyanobacteria capable of producing cyanotoxins, including microcystin (a hepatotoxin), saxitoxin, and BMAA (a neurotoxin), among others, pose a significant risk to human health, particularly when found in water sources intended for human consumption.
According to Brazil's current legislation, monitoring of cyanobacteria is mandated at shallow spring water collection points. Additionally, if the density of cyanobacteria surpasses 20,000 cells/mL, a weekly analysis of cyanobacteria must be conducted.
In early January 2020, over 8 million residents of the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, who rely on the drinking water supplied by the Company responsible for water and sewage (CWS), reported experiencing an unusual and unpleasant taste, turbidity, and odor in the water (4,5).
This metagenomic study was conducted to assess the microbiome of CWS's raw water, which refers to water captured at the water treatment station prior to undergoing any cleaning or filtering processes. The aim was to identify any potential public health risks associated with the presence of cyanobacteria in the water.
In this study, water samples (700 mL total volume) were gathered from the water treatment station barrage at the precise raw water captation site. Of this, 600 mL were homogenized and subjected to ultracentrifugation for 2 hours at 120,000 g and 4oC. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was reconstituted to the original volume. A total of 6 mL of sediment volume was obtained, which was promptly divided into two distinct aliquots labeled Raw water #1 and Raw water #2.
The DNA extracted from both samples was obtained using Quiagen's DNEasy kit. Libraries were constructed utilizing Illumina's Nextera DNA FLEX 2x150 bp paired-end kit in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. Quantification of DNA was carried out using Qubit DNA HS, and sample sizes were assessed using the DNA Sensitivity bioanalyzer prior to sequencing.
Samples were sequenced at the SENAI CETIQT Innovation Institute for Biosynthetic and Fibers sequencing facility using Illumina's NextSeq 550 (Illumina, Inc., USA). The sequencing data were subsequently analyzed on the Stingray@Galaxy platform.
FastQC version 0.67(8) was employed with default parameters to assess the quality of the sequencing data. No additional cleaning procedures were necessary as both samples exhibited PHRED values exceeding 30. For sequence similarity searches, Diamond software version 0.9.29 was utilized with an e-value threshold of 1e-05, querying against NCBI's 2019 RefSeq protein database.
The results were visualized using MEGAN6(10) and KronaTools 1.1.0(11). Both samples' rarefaction curves were plotted, and Shannon-Weaver's alpha diversity index(12) was calculated using MEGAN6(10).
The DNA concentrations for each sample were 6ng/30 µL (Raw water #1) and 4.6ng/32 µL (Raw water #2). The alpha diversity values ranged from 3.7 (Raw water #1) to 4.8 (Raw water #2), indicating low species diversity. However, rarefaction curves demonstrate that both samples' richness was fully explored (Graph 1). Graph 2 illustrates the top 10 most representative species.
In both water samples, the predominant gender was Planktothricoides, with the most prevalent species sequences closely resembling NCBI's RefSeq Planktothricoides sp. SR001.
Planktothricoides is a genus comprising environmental filamentous cyanobacteria that fall under the Oscillatoriales and Phormidiaceae families. These organisms have the ability to thrive in both brackish and fresh water environments, exhibiting characteristics of flowering.
Although initially classified as Planktothrix within the Phormidiaceae family, recent 16S rRNA gene analysis has revealed significant morphological similarities prompting its reclassification as a new genus. This reclassification was based on its distinct phylogenetic distance from other cyanobacteria, highlighting the need for a more accurate taxonomic placement.
Cyanobacteria have the capability to generate compounds such as geosmine and 2-methylisoborneole (2-MIB) that contribute abnormal odors and unpleasant tastes to freshwater, alongside other substances recognized for their toxicity to water ecosystems. Sivonen and Jones (14) emphasize that despite cyanobacteria originating from aquatic environments, terrestrial mammals face greater risks from these organisms compared to the aquatic biomes they inhabit. Consequently, the contamination of raw water poses a significant public health concern, particularly in scenarios where cyanobacteria may be present.
Continuous monitoring of water reservoirs is essential to prevent incidents like those that occurred in Itaparica, Bahia, Brazil in 1988, resulting in 88 fatalities and 2,000 cases of intoxication; Caruaru, Pernambuco, Brazil in 1996, where contaminated water used in hemodialysis machines led to the deaths of 54 individuals; and Pennsylvania in 1975, where 5,000 people experienced gastrointestinal infections due to water contamination.
The genome of Planktothricoides sp. SR001 was sequenced and subsequently deposited in NCBI. This particular strain was discovered in a freshwater source in Singapore in 2017, located in a hydrographic bay impacted by industrial and residential waste. The basin was identified as eutrophic, exhibiting high levels of phosphorus. Notably, this marked the initial isolation of a Planktothricoides sp. genome in tropical freshwater environments. The researchers also noted that this strain has the capability to produce 2-MIB, a compound known to impart an unpleasant taste and diminish the palatability of freshwater sources.
In addition to Planktothricoides, the top ten bacterial genera identified in our samples are Limnochabitans, Actinobacter, Polynucleobacter, Cuticterium, Pseudomonas, Massilia, Sphingomonas, Illumatobacter, and Staphylococcus.
Within the Ministry of Health's list of public health-related cyanobacteria, we successfully identified the genera Cylindrospermum, Raphidiopsis, and Hydrocoleum, which are associated with neurotoxin production. Additionally, we pinpointed Microcystis, Nostoc, Synechocystis, and Nodularia as genera linked to hepatotoxin production. Furthermore, we recognized Aphanizomenon, Arthrospira, Oscillatoria, Phormidium, Planktothrix, Anabaena, Lyngbya, and Cylindrospermopsis as genera capable of producing both neurotoxins and hepatotoxins.
The absence of fundamental sanitation infrastructure in urban areas located upstream from the spring water collection point contributes to a situation where nutrient influx promotes bacterial growth in lagoons near the raw water collection point. Consequently, the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area is currently utilizing indirectly recycled water for consumption (19).
As outlined in ABNT n°13969/1997, this phenomenon occurs when effluents are initially discharged into the environment (upstream) and subsequently reused downstream in a diluted form, unintentionally and without proper control measures in place.
Due to the production of cyanobacteria toxins, the disposal of treated or untreated effluent containing such toxins could have a significant impact on the water biome and alter the food chain by inhibiting the growth of other algae species (21).
Finally, it can be inferred that the raw water captured at the Guandu water treatment station exhibited a high level of algae bloom, specifically cyanobacteria capable of producing cyanotoxins.
