Abstract This study aimed to review 
femicide, which is a result of violence 
against women and a serious public health 
problem, from a different perspective. 
Accordingly, it analyzed the presence of a 
relationship between foreign exchange, 
which was an essential trigger of the crises 
and unemployment, and femicide, which 
was the result of violence against women 
different from the act of murder. In the light 
of this aim, the data were obtained from 
the We Will Stop Femicide Platform, and 
the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey. 
These 
data 
were 
examined 
through 
various 
analyses. 
According 
to 
the 
analysis results, a long-term cointegrating 
relationship was found between the 
foreign exchange rate and femicide in 
Turkey. The findings have demonstrated 
that the deviation caused by a 1% shock in 
the exchange rate could be balanced after 
22.6 days. This study, which is significant 
in terms of questioning femicide from a 
neglected 
economic 
perspective, 
contributes to the literature by revealing 
that current and advanced empirical 
analyses and exchange rate fluctuations 
are "vital" in terms of non-economic facts 
and public health as well.  

Femicide is the result of a violent 
interaction that involves the death of a 
woman or a girl and the extreme and direct 
form of an interpersonal process. Researchers 
have suggested that femicide should be 
considered 
a 
specific 
case 
of 
violent 
phenomena, which can be interpreted in a 
comprehensive and theoretical framework. 
Femicide was first used as a concept in 1801, 
referring to "the murder of a woman"1. It was 
legally recognized in 1848 and published in 
the Wharton Legal Dictionary, thereby 
appearing in the English legal terminology. 
Radford (1992)2 made a special emphasis by 
saying, "You cannot mobilize against something 
with no name." The fact that the violent deaths 
of individuals belonging to gender have reached 
non-negligible 
systematic 
dimensions 
has 
drawn all disciplines' attention. Hence, studies 
have been initiated to establish a conceptual 
framework. The word femicide was introduced to 
the literature when Diana Russel first used it at 
the International Tribunal for Crimes Against 
Women in March 1976. Later, femicide was 
defined by Radford & Russell (1992)3 as "the 
misogynistic killing of women by men." In 
addition to this, Radford emphasized that a 
femicide is a form of sexual violence. The 
word Homicide, which refers to the murder of 
a human being, has been restricted with the 
word 
femicide4, 
a 
theoretical 
concept 
referring to the murder of a woman5. Due to 
the 
increasing 
number 
of 
cases, 
this 
phenomenon has started to be included in 
other languages. It has been referred to as 
feminicide in Spanish and kadın cinayetleri in 
Turkish. In 1985, the term gendercide 
emerged 
to 
express 
the 
deliberate 
extermination of individuals of a particular 
gender6.  

Femicide is a sociological effort of 
apprehension that has been successful 
in transforming traditional perception, 
public awareness, scientific research, 
and 
policymaking. 
Femicide 
is 
a 
sociological effort of apprehension that 
has been successful in transforming 
traditional perception, public awareness, 
scientific research, and policymaking. 
This new word is used in the political 
context to understand women's violent 
deaths and create changes in the social 
order. It aims to prevent the confusion of 
women's violent deaths with the concept 
of murder, which does not discriminate  
between genders, draw attention that it is a 
crime in itself, and raise awareness7. Thanks 
to Radford & Russell (1992)8 and Russell & 
Harmes (2001)9, the word femicide evolved as a 
theoretical concept aimed at reversing the 
structuring forms of patriarchal power.  

According to Ertürk (2015)10, the female 
body is subjected to social control for the 
social groups to reproduce generations 
according to specific criteria. Violence against 
women has been normalized throughout the 
historical process and has become an 
"ordinary tool" used to maintain labor division 
between 
the 
genders. 
The 
data 
have 
demonstrated that this tool has been used all 
over the world. In particular, women are more 
vulnerable to the inevitable violence and 
death in societies where women are of less 
value and provided fewer rights than men. 
Inequalities in the gender ratio and the 
relatively high number of males have 
potentially devastating consequences for 
society11.  

Figure 1 presents the global scale of 
femicides. There is a great difficulty in 
accessing data on this sensitive matter, which 
requires a multidimensional approach. It 
necessary and of public interest to store the 
data and make it available to scientists. On 
the other hand, the available data belonging 
to the period after 1990 does not include 
some of the countries' annual data or some of 
the data of many countries at all. According 
to available data, the number of women 
murdered in 2018 in the world is 82,227. 
Figure 2, which has been created based on 
the available data, presents the total global 
values revealing how the femicides have been 
deliberately and systematically committed.  
The increasing violence, were associated 
with the destruction and dissolution resulting 
from globalization by Friedman (2003)12. And 
female movements against the increasing 
violence have become global and attracted 
attention. It is clear that this multifaceted 
phenomenon 
requires 
multidisciplinary 
studies. According to the literature review, 
femicide has been studied regarding i. 
feminist, ii. sociological, iii. criminological iv. 
human rights and v. decolonial paradigms; 
however, it is observed that the investigation 
of the issue in terms of the economy has been 
neglected. However, economic conditions 
affect the psychology and behavior of 
individuals. Therefore, it is important to 
investigate femicide from a perspective based  
on the economy. In order to prevent future murders, it is vital to determine the causes of 
genecide from different perspectives, take the necessary measures, and put the necessary 
policies into practice. 

This study investigates the presence of a 
relationship between the foreign exchange 
rate, which has devastating effects when not 
taken under control, and femicide in Turkey, 
which has a chronic current account deficit 
and is dependent on short-term foreign 
capital. Current and advanced empirical 
analysis will be used in the study.  Before 
investigating femicide in terms of economy, it 
would be appropriate to explain why the 
foreign exchange rate was selected by 
describing its effects on individuals. A foreign 
exchange rate is a crucial tool applied in 
Orthodox 
anti-inflationary 
stabilization 
programs. Its effects are not limited to 
international trade and capital flows. The 
policies implemented by the central banks 
and political authorities, whose primary 
purpose is to protect the national currency's 
value, affect all areas of life, starting with the 
economy. The foreign exchange rate policies 
implemented in Turkey are observed to be a 
significant cause of economic crises. There is 
a linear relationship between the exchange 
rate, foreign trade, and unemployment13. 
Besides, the foreign exchange rate affects the 
labor market through imports and exports14. 
An increase in imports can affect the 
relationship between the employer and 
employee, thereby leading to the termination 
or change of various rights and regulations 
regarding 
wages, 
labor 
and 
working 
conditions against the employees. Studies 
reveal that a 10% increase in competition 
between imported and domestic goods leads 
to a 1.6% decrease in wages and increases the 
unemployment rate15. In addition, it is clear 
that currency crises have a significant impact 
on the unemployment phenomenon. For 
instance, both the foreign exchange rate and 
unemployment level increased in Mexico 
during the 1994 Crisis. In the 1997 Asian 
Crisis, the currency crisis in South Korea led 
to 
both 
unemployment 
and 
inflation16. 
Turkey experienced a process starting with 
the 1978 crisis, and particularly with the 
crisis created by the threat of unemployment 
after 1990. Since the establishment of the 
Republic, there have been five serious crises 
(1929-32, 1958-61, 1978-83, 1998-2001, 
and 2008). Before the crises, there have been 
increases in current account deficits. In 
1977, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2000, and 
2008, despite the fact that the external value 
of the national currency should have been 
corrected against the ongoing inflation 
problem, it was not reduced. Or, the external 
value of the national currency was increased. 
All these were the factors that increased the 
current account deficit. Currency explosions 
constituted the main factor that triggered the  
crises. In addition to inflation, the current 
account deficit is the leading cause of crises. 
Unemployment replaced inflation in the 2008 
Global Financial Crisis17. The fluctuations of 
the foreign exchange rate were empirically 
presented in the study conducted for Turkey 
by Demir (2009)18 regarding its negative effect 
on employment.  

Recession, unemployment, and poverty 
caused by the crises adversely affect human 
psychology. In a report published by the 
World Health Organization (WHO)19 during 
the days of the COVID-19 pandemic when the 
risk of violence against women increased, it is 
observed that the reasons for the increase of 
violence 
against 
women 
include 
unemployment, 
economic 
problems, 
prolonged staying at home and stress. The 
main reason for the increasing domestic 
violence is the predominant patriarchal order 
and 
gender 
inequality. 
The 
long-term 
presence of the potential aggressor and victim 
in 
a 
certain 
socio-geographic 
location 
prepares the ground for violence, conforming 
with the many theories of criminology20. 
Unemployment has been proven to be 
associated with family breakdowns, alcohol 
addiction, crime, and violence, based on a 
relationship found between the increase in 
the unemployment rate by 1% and the death 
of 37 thousand individuals, 920 cases of 
suicide, 650 cases of murders, 4 thousand 
hospitalizations in the mental hospital and 
the imprisonment of 3.3 thousand individual, 
over a six-year period21. Empirical studies 
have demonstrated that the increase in 
unemployment22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 and income 
inequality31,32 increases crime rates.  Nikolaos 
& Alexandros (2009)33 found a negative 
relationship between wage and crime rate in 
the short term. According to Lombardo & 
Falcone (2011)34, the highest crime rates are 
observed in regions with high divorce rates, 
youth 
unemployment, 
and 
female 
employment. Andresen (2012)35 determined 
that the income had a significant and positive 
coefficient in the crimes of violence and 
mentioned that the unemployment rate had a 
significant and positive coefficient in the 
crimes of violence in the long run. Taş et al. 
(2014)36 determined a similar relationship 
between the rates of unemployment and 
divorce. Kavaklı (2020)37 found that femicide 
was committed mostly in economically less 
developed locations. Economic development 
reduces the negative impact of the risk factor. 

There is a clear loop among crisis, 
unemployment, violence, and murder in light 
of all this information. Is there a relationship 
between systematically committed femicide 
and the foreign exchange rate as an                    
important trigger of crises? In this study, which sought an answer to this question, firstly the 
methods and data sets used will be presented, and the findings will be explained. Next, 
inferences will be made based on these findings.  

In order to investigate the existence of the relationship between the foreign exchange rate 
and femicide n Turkey, the daily femicide data belonging to the period between 01 January 
2019 and 29 September 2020 were obtained from the We Will Stop Femicide Platform, and the 
data regarding the daily buying rates of US Dollar in the same period were obtained from the 
Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBTR) Electronic Data Delivery System (EDDS) (Table 
1). These data were examined through various analyses. The analyses consisted of 373 
observations. Figures 3 and 4 present the distribution of variables over the period of analysis. 
While an increase was observed in the foreign exchange rate during this process, a systematic 
"gendercide" was also prominent. 

Is there a relationship between the 
depreciation of the national currency and 
femicide? Before starting to search for the 
answer to this question, firstly the series's 
linearity tests were carried out using Harvey 
& Leybourne (2007)38 and Harvey, Leybourne 
& Xiao (2008)39 Tests. Next, the stationary 
tests were performed. 

Linearity tests of the series should be 
performed first since the linear analysis of the 
series exhibiting nonlinear behaviors would 
lead to the establishment of false models.     

Linearity Tests are structured upon the 
models based on smooth transitions typed 
the STAR (Smooth Transition Autoregressive). 
These tests are a priori test for the transition 
to the STAR type test. Unlike other tests, 
these tests, which were introduced to the 
literature by Harvey, do not have any 
prerequisites. 
Considering 
the 
main 
advantage 
of 
not 
being 
affected 
by 
stationarity levels, Harvey & Leybourne 
(2007) and Harvey, Leybourne & Xiao (2008) 
Tests were administered for testing the 
linearity. 

This test, which introduced to the 
literature by Harvey & Leybourne (2007), 
does not make any assumptions, 𝐼1 and 𝐼2 it 
allows the coexistence of processes. This test 
has a structure with four degrees of freedom, 
where the following equation is used (1): 

𝑦𝑡= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑦𝑡−1 + 𝛽2𝑦𝑡−1
2
+ 𝛽3𝑦𝑡−1
3
+ 𝛽4𝛥𝑦𝑡−1 +
𝛽5(𝛥𝑦𝑡−1)2 + 𝛽5(𝛥𝑦𝑡−1)3 + 𝜀𝑡                              (1) 

The 
null 
hypothesis 
indicating 
the 
linearity and the alternative hypothesis 
indicating the nonlinearity is presented in 
Equation 2 and Equation 3;   

𝐻0 : 𝛽2 = 𝛽3 = 𝛽5 = 𝛽6 = 0                     (2)                                                    
𝐻1 : 𝛽2 ≠𝛽3 ≠𝛽5 ≠𝛽6 ≠0                     (3) 

Test 
statistics 
of 
Harvey 
& 
Leybourne (2007) are presented in 
Equation 4; 

<> (4)  
 
In this equation (Equation 4), b 
indicates the non-zero constant, 𝐷𝐹𝑇 
indicates the standard ADF t statistics 
derived from the restricted regression, T  
indicates the number of observations, 
𝑅𝑆𝑆1 , indicates sum of squares of the 
error term for the H1 hypothesis. The 
Harvey & Leybourne (2007) test statistics 
are suitable for the distribution of 𝑥4
2.  

The Harvey, Leybourne & Xiao (2008) 
Linearity Test, which was developed by 
enhancing and strengthening the Harvey 
& Leybourne (2007) Test, reviews the 
state of stationarity and I1 separately. It 
has a structure with two degrees of 
freedom.  

In 
order 
to 
analyze 
the 
basic 
hypothesis 
of 
linearity 
(Equation4) 
compared to the alternative hypothesis 
indicating the nonlinearity (Equation5), 
it is suggested to use the Equation 6; 
 
𝐻0 : 𝛽2 = 𝛽3 = 𝛽5 = 𝛽6 = 0                            (4) 
𝐻1 : 𝛽2 ≠𝛽3 ≠𝛽5 ≠𝛽6 ≠0                           (5)

𝑗=1
+ 𝜀𝑡                                  (6) 

Equation 6 can be reorganized using 
the first-order Taylor expansion, and it 
can be written as Equation7; 

𝛥𝑦𝑡= 𝜆1𝛥𝑦𝑡−1 + 𝜆2(𝛥𝑦𝑡−1)2 + 𝜆3(𝛥𝑦𝑡−1)3 +
∑
𝜆4,𝑗𝛥𝑦𝑡−𝑗
𝑝
𝑗=1
+ 𝜀𝑡                                   (7) 

In Equation 7, p indicates the number 
of delays, and Δ indicates the difference 
operator.  The (W0) test statistics, which 
are calculated for stationarity, and the 
(W1) test statistics, which are calculated 
for nonstationarity, are calculated by 
using the Harvey et al. (2008) Wλ test 
statistics. 
They 
conform 
with 
the 
distribution of Wλ 𝑥2
2. 

Following the determination of the 
nonlinearity, the unit root tests produced 
from nonlinear models were performed. 

Leybourne, Newbold & Vougas (LNV) 
(1998)40, 
who 
suggested 
gradual 
integration of structural changes to the 
model with a smooth transition instead 
of instantaneous integration, developed a 
unit root test as an alternative to the unit 
root tests with structural breaks. This 
test, in which structural breakage is 
taken into account with a logistic 
function, 
allows 
smooth 
structural 
transitions 
and 
constitutes 
the 
beginning of nonlinear tests. Logistic soft  
transition regressions were created by 
defining three models; 

Model A 

<> (8) 

Model B 

<> (9) 

Model C 

<> (10) 

In the models, the St(λ,τ), indicates 
the logistic smooth transition, which is 
presented in Equation 11. In this logistic 
function, 𝜏 determines the midpoint of 
the transition process, and 𝛾 determines 
the transition speed. Where γ>0, S−∞(γ 
τ)=0, S+∞(γ τ)=1 and SτT (γτ)=0,5. If 𝛾 is 
smaller, it would take longer for the 
logistic smooth transition of Sτ(γτ) to 
exceed the interval (0,1). If 𝛾= 0, 
S_τ(γτ)=0,5 at all t moments. If 𝛾 is 
greater, Sτ(γτ) would exceed the (0,1) 
interval rapidly. If 𝛾 converges to +∞, the 
value of the function changes from 0 to 1 
momentarily at 𝑡= 𝜏T. 

<> (11) 

vt is the expression of the stationary 
process with a mean of zero. Hence, the 
Y initial value for Model A is stationary 
around a mean that gradually changes 
between  α1 and α1+α2. Similar to Model 
A, there is also a mean gradual change in 
Model B between α_1 and α1 and α1+α2; 
however, unlike Model A, there is a 
constant trend term in Model B. In Model 
C, the constant ranges from α1 to α1+α2, 
and the trend ranges from β1  to β1 +β2 
gradually, only once, and at the same 
speed and time. In this test, there is a 
constraint that the constant and trend 
transitions occur at the same time and at 
the same speed. 

There are two phases for calculating 
the test statistics. In the first step, using 
the Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS), the 
appropriate model is estimated only with 
deterministic 
components, 
and 
the 
residuals are obtained; 

Model A 

<> (12) 

Model B 

<> (13) 

Model C 

<> (14) 

After the residuals are obtained, the 
ADF regression is established in the 
second phase, and the unit root test is 
performed over this regression (Equation 
15).   

The hypotheses to be established in 
the analysis of the unit root are 
presented 
in 
Equation16 
and 
Equation17. This test is performed by 
testing the statistical significance of ρˆ 
using the t test. 

The unit root test based on soft 
transition, 
created 
by 
Leybourne, 
Newbold & Vougas (1998), was extended 
to two soft transitions and introduced to 
the literature by Harvey & Mills (2002)41. 
Three models were also created for this 
test; 

Model A 

<>(18) 

Model B 

<> (19) 

Model C 

<> (20) 

While there are two transitions for 
mean in Model A and Model B, unlike 
Model A, there is a fixed trend in Model 
B. Model C allows two transitions in both 
mean and trend. 

In the models, 𝑆𝑖𝑡(λ1,τ1) indicates the 
logistic smooth transition, which is 
presented in Equation 21. The error 
term, 𝑣𝑡 is the expression of the 
stationary process with a mean of zero.  

τ1T and τ2T, indicate the middle points of 
the transition process; γ1 and γ2 indicate 
the transition speeds. The difference in 
transition speeds is allowed. 

The hypotheses to be established in 
the analysis of the unit root are 
presented in Equation 26 and Equation 
27. 

Unit root testing can be performed 
using 
the 
two-step 
procedure 
recommended by Leybourne, Newbold & 
Vougas (1998). The t statistics of ρ 
obtained by the classical least squares 
method of estimation is used as the test 
statistics.  

The Kapetanios, Shin & Snell (KSS) 
(2006) Cointegration Test from the 
nonlinear cointegration tests, and the 
Banerjee, Arčabić & Lee (2017) Fourier 
Cointegration Test from the cointegration 
tests based on Fourier functions, which 
were used in the analysis, were explained 
in this part.    

Kapetanios, Shin & Snell (KSS) 
(2006)42 enhanced the Engle-Granger 
Cointegration Test and introduced it to 
the literature by applying this test to 
nonlinear 
models. 
The 
alternative 
hypothesis stating that there is a 
nonlinear 
long-term 
relationship 
between the variables is tested against 
the basic hypothesis stating that there is 
no cointegration relationship.   

The KSS Test, in which a smooth 
transition is modeled using a logistic 
function, can be used for the variable  
series of raw data, demeaned data, and 
detrended data. 

This test, which was introduced to the 
literature by Banerjee, Arčabić & Lee 
(2017)43, is a typical cointegration test 
expanded in Fourier terms that takes the 
delayed structures of both dependent 
and independent variables into account. 
The test is logically based on error 
correction. As presented in Equation 34 
and Equation 35, the test includes 
constant and trend terms, the delayed 
value of the independent variable, and 
the value of its level the previous period.   

Testing is performed based on the 
equation that the coefficient (δ) before the 
variable of 𝑦𝑡−1  is equal to or smaller 
than zero. In other words, the null   
hypothesis 
indicates 
that 
there 
is 
no 
cointegrating 
relationship, 
and 
the 
alternative hypothesis indicates the presence 
of a cointegrating relationship. What we need 
to do is to estimate this model and 𝑦𝑡−1 test 
the coefficient before the variable. variable.  

This part presents the empirical 
findings obtained by performing the tests 
described 
in 
the 
methodology 
and 
dataset parts. The linearity test results of 
the series are presented in Table 2. 

According to the results of both tests, 
there is nonlinearity in the femicide 
series. In the foreign exchange rate 
series, there is nonlinearity, according to 
the Harvey & Leybourne (2007) Test, and 
linearity, according to Harvey, Leybourne 
& Xiao (2008) Test.  Following the 
determination of the nonlinearity of the 
series 
in 
the 
linearity 
tests, 
the 
stationarity of the series was tested using 
nonlinear unit root tests. The results of 
the analysis are presented in Table 3. 

In order to confirm that the series that 
were determined to have unit roots by 
nonlinear unit root tests (Table 3) are 
stationary in I1, the ADF and PP tests 
were applied by taking their first 
differences (Table 4). Following the 
determination of the stationarity of the 
series at I1, cointegration tests were 
performed. 

According to the results of the 
Kapetanios, Shin & Snell (KSS) (2006) 
Cointegration 
Test, 
a 
long-term 
synchronized relationship was found 
between the foreign exchange rate and 
femicide. Due to the provision of the 
precondition, 
which 
was 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
cointegrating 
relationship, the short-run causality test 
was performed; 

In the short run, no causality was 
determined from the exchange rate towards 
femicide.  

Based on the error correction coefficient 
(ECC), it is possible to calculate the rebalance 
ratio of the system by dividing the ECC by “1” 
(1/0.044197075). This value indicates that 
the deviation caused by a 1% shock in the 
foreign exchange rate can be balanced after a 
period of 22.6 days. 

As a result of the Banerjee, Arčabić & Lee 
(2017) Fourier Cointegration Test, one of the 
cointegration 
tests 
based 
on 
Fourier 
functions, long-run cointegration was found 
between the foreign exchange rate and 
femicide. 

The 
current 
living 
conditions 
of 
individuals and their economic status affect 
their psychology and behavior. Therefore, it is 
very imperative to investigate the widespread 
and systematic violence and murders of 
women from an economic perspective, as well 
as the feminist, sociological, criminological, 
human rights, and decolonial paradigms. It is 
also necessary to investigate the effects of 
macro-economic phenomena on the violent 
deaths of women and shape the monetary 
and fiscal policies based on the findings to 
prevent future murders. 

All experiences are the results of the 
choices. For instance, as Erturk (2015), 
pointed out, the allocation of available 
resources 
to 
defense 
and 
military 
expenditures leads to the neglect of social 
development 
and 
human 
rights 
while 
bringing about an increase in poverty and 
violence. Disintegrations and fragmentation 
experienced, destroyed livelihoods lead to an 
increase in male unemployment in some 
areas. Losing socio-economic status and the  
balance of power are tried to be compensated in the 
form of violence against women and girls. 

As mentioned by Engelen et al. (2016)44, based on 
the findings of their study, the significant and strong 
deterrent effect of the increase in the probability of 
being caught and punished should be benefitted 
from. Nonetheless, it is also possible to identify the 
factors that trigger these criminal elements and 
prevent them with appropriate policy practices. For 
this reason, it is necessary to investigate the 
phenomenon of violence and murder against women 
and girls in terms of the economy. The purpose of this 
study carried out from this point was to investigate 
the presence of a relationship between the foreign 
exchange rate and femicide. The reason for choosing 
the foreign exchange rate among various variables to 
carry out the study was that exchange rates were one 
of the triggers of many crises. Crises lead to 
unemployment and poverty. The increase in the 
foreign exchange rate in Turkey, which has a chronic 
current account deficit and is dependent on foreign 
capital, affects various socio-economical factors in 
addition to growth and employment. The data on 
femicide required for conducting this study was not 
available; eventually, the support was requested from 
a non-governmental organization. The daily data on 
femicide and US Dollar buying rates belonging to the 
period between 01 January 2019 and 29 September 
2020 were obtained from the We Will Stop Femicide 
Platform and the Central Bank of Turkey. Various 
econometric analyses were performed on these data. 
According to the results of the analyses, 

- A long-run cointegrating relationship was found 
between foreign exchange rate and femicide. 

- It was determined that the deviation caused by 
a 1% shock in the exchange rate could reach the 
balance after 22.6 days.  

Based 
on 
these 
results, 
maintaining 
the 
fluctuations in exchange rates under control and 
ensuring that they remain within a specific range is 
important regarding the value of the national 
currency, foreign trade, growth, and employment, 
and also in terms of preventing deaths of women and 
girls. This study is a contribution to the literature as 
it is the first study to reveal this subject matter 
empirically using current and advanced analyzes. It 
is clear that the independence of the Central Banks, 
whose main task is to protect the value of the 
national currency, and the implementation of correct 
policies in this direction is of vital importance. 
Policymakers have important responsibilities in 
preventing violence and murder of women and girls, 
which have become widespread and legitimized by 
discourses and policies. It is essential to carry out 
future 
studies 
investigating 
widespread 
and 
systematic violence against women and girls and 
femicide from an economic perspective.
