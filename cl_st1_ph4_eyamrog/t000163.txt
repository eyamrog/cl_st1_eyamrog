ABSTRACT 
The effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental 
health of healthcare professionals has become a concern, particularly among those 
who are in close contact with infected patients, including dentists. The aim of this 
critical literature review was to analyze the possible implications of the COVID-19 
pandemic on the mental health of dentists. This bibliographic search was carried out 
in the PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases, using the following search 
keywords “Psychiatry OR anxiety OR fear OR depression OR psychological distress 
OR mental health” AND “COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2” AND “Dentists OR dental 
practice. Original research publications that included data on the mental health status 
of dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Data were tabulated in 
Microsoft Excel 2016 for Windows and descriptively presented. Eleven publications 
were eligible for this review. All studies had cross-sectional design. Most of them used 
questionnaires created by study researchers (81.8%) and were carried out in Italy 
(45.5%). The number of participants ranged from 14 to 1,500. Effects on the mental 
health of dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic were observed, regarding fear of 
contamination, anxiety, concerns, stress, depression, job insecurity, subjective 
overload, perceived risk and feelings and emotions. It was concluded that the COVID-
19 pandemic had negative impact on the mental health of dentists, with high 
prevalence of fear, anxiety and concern, among other psychological symptoms.

INTRODUCTION 
  
At the end of 2019, in the province of Wuhan, China, the spread of a new virus 
of the family Coronaviridae was detected, the same as the causative agent of the 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2002-2003 [1,2]. This virus 
spread rapidly around the world, causing an infectious respiratory disease that became 
known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1,2]. In March 2020, the World 
Health Organization recognized the disease as a public health problem and raised the 
contamination status to the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. Currently, the disease is found in 
216 countries, accounting to more than 18.5 million confirmed cases and 700,000 
deaths, with the Americas concentrating almost 10 million diagnosed individuals [4]. 
  
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive, spherical, enveloped RNA virus with approximate 
size of 30 kilobase (kbp) [5], which can be transmitted by direct contact - coughing, 
sneezing and inhalation of droplets -, and by contact with mucous membranes - oral, 
nasal and ocular [6]. Thus, people who are in close contact with patients with COVID-
19, including health professionals, are at increased risk of contamination [2,7]. Dentists 
in particular, have high risk of contamination and great potential to infect their family 
members and other patients, as they work close to the oral cavity of patients in direct 
contact with salivary fluids and in closed environment [8]. 
  
Most infected individuals have mild symptoms [2], with common fever and 
cough, and may also experience shortness of breath, muscle pain, confusion, 
headache, sore throat, diarrhea and vomiting [9]. Among the most severe cases, 
patients develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), cardiac arrhythmia 
and shock [9]. Older individuals and the presence of comorbidities are associated with 
worse prognosis [10]. 
  
Social isolation and distancing measures have been adopted by the 
governments of different countries to prevent contagion and spread of the virus [11], 
such as severe restrictions on dental practice, in which dentists were allowed to 
perform only emergency procedures in several countries, such as China [2], Italy [12], 
United States of America [13], Brazil [14] and the United Kingdom [15]. These 
conditions generated financial consequences, insecurity and anxiety, leading to 
greater risk for the emergence of mental health problems [7,16]. Workers who were 
forced to stop working due to the pandemic reported increase in suffering and decline 
in general health [17]. 
  
In addition, social networks and the media in their various forms, spreading 
alarming news about the growing number of infected people, may have adversely 
affected the population and generated situations of stress, fear of contamination, 
personal frustration and difficulties in obtaining protective equipment [18], as well as 
stigma of COVID-19 and concerns about the well-being of themselves and their 
families [19]. 
  
Therefore, this critical review aims to analyze the possible implications of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of dentists. 
 
METHODS 
  
This is a bibliographic search conducted through the analysis of articles indexed 
until July 2020 in PubMed (U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of 
Medicine), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) and Scopus (Elsevier) databases. For 
the study, the search keywords used were “Psychiatry OR anxiety OR fear OR 
depression OR psychological distress OR mental health” AND “COVID-19 OR SARS-
CoV-2” AND “dentists OR dental practice”. The PRISMA guidelines were followed 
(Available: http://prisma-statement.org/). 
  
Articles eligible for the study were original research publications that presented 
data on the mental health status of dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic. Review 
and editorial articles were excluded. The analysis of studies was independently carried 
out by two researchers (ICCL and LF). At the end of the analysis, information collected 
was compared and differences were discussed. In cases of lack of consensus, a third 
researcher (ALC) decided to include or exclude the article. 
  
The following variables were collected: information about the article (authors 
and year of publication), country, study design and research instrument, sample, sex, 
age, mental health conditions, COVID-19 status (positive or negative), risk group (yes 
or no), main results (related to the mental health of dentists). Data were tabulated using 
the Microsoft Excel 2016 software for Windows (Microsoft Press, Redmond, WA, USA) 
and were descriptively presented. 
 
RESULTS 
  
Eighty-eight articles were found and distributed as follows: 14 in PubMed, 8 in 
Web of Science and 66 in Scopus. After removing duplicates, 70 studies remained, of 
which 15 were selected from reading of titles and abstracts. Of these, two systematic 
review articles were excluded because they did not meet the eligibility criteria. All other 
articles identified were analyzed in full. After full reading, two articles were excluded: 
one for not presenting information about the mental health of dentists and the other for 
not showing data specifically collected from dentists, but from health workers in 
general. At the end, 11 articles were included in this review (Figure 1). 
 Regarding geographical distribution, most studies were carried out by 
researchers in Italy (45.5%), followed by India (36.4%). Regarding the methodological 
design, all studies had cross-sectional design, using questionnaires (100%), with 
predominance of questionnaires created by study researchers (81.8%). The sample 
size ranged from 14 [20], to 1500 participants [21], with Chinese and Italian individuals, 
respectively. In most studies, participants were men (55.6%) and young adults 
(55.6%). Six studies evaluated the fear of dentists during COVID-19 pandemic; six 
studies, anxiety; five studies, concerns; five, stress; two, depression; two, job 
insecurity; two, subjective overload; one, perceived risk and one, feelings and 
emotions. Only one study found dentists diagnosed with COVID-19 (50%) [22], and 
the frequency of dentists in the risk group ranged from 4.5% [23] in Italy to 28.8% [24] 
in Poland (Table 1). 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
  
The COVID-19 pandemic brought changes around the world, such as situations 
of social distancing and isolation associated with the proposed restriction measures to 
control the disease [20]. In this context, mental health problems among health 
professionals resulting from changes in various daily routine aspects are gaining 
prominence [20]. This review highlights the significant impact of COVID-19 on the 
mental health of dentists and aims to inform these professionals about adversities 
experienced, to enable greater understanding of the problems that may affect the 
dental class and to assist in the planning of actions in this pandemic moment. 
  
Feelings of fear, anxiety and stress have been reported in most studies [8,22-
24,26,27]. Fear was associated with the fear of being infected by a patient or co-
worker, taking the infection to their families and possibly causing permanent effects 
[7,8,22,25]. The dentist works in an environment with intense generation of aerosols 
and close contact with patients and their salivary secretions, which significantly 
increases their chances of contamination, justifying this behavior. Staying in hospital 
or in social isolation, possibility of infection, and the increase in mortality in the country 
were also causes for feelings of fear [8]. It is possible to infer that the lack of knowledge 
about the viral behavior pattern in the population can directly influence this behavior. 
  
Two studies [20,22] used the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to check the 
level of anxiety and both identified increase in anxiety disorders in this period. These 
data suggest that the pandemic is a source of anxiety for dentists and other 
professionals who are part of the dental team. The symptom was mainly related to the 
routine of care when treating patients with suspicious symptoms [20,22]. The guidance 
of the World Health Organization is that the suspected or diagnosed individual remains 
in isolation until recovery or presenting negative diagnosis for COVID-19 [3]. However, 
in cases of dental emergencies, the dentist will need to intervene to minimize or resolve 
the patient's problem, and there may be need for close contact between patient and 
professional and, therefore, greater likelihood of infection. 
  
The prevalence of generalized anxiety symptoms found in studies [20,29] is 
relevant, since high GAD-7 scores have been shown to be associated with reduced 
productivity at work, increased inflammatory processes and, consequently, decreased 
immune system response [20,29]. Being immunocompromised may be related to 
worse prognosis in confirmed COVID-19 cases. In addition to anxiety, the highest 
stress levels were found among dentists included in a risk group [27]. 
  
Depressive symptoms have also been identified [7,26]. Younger or less 
experienced individuals reported having greater fear of losing their jobs, indicating 
increase in depressive symptoms [7]. It is suggested that these professionals may be 
in a less stable and financially more insecure job condition. Knowing more than one 
person who died due to COVID-19 was also associated with higher levels of depressive 
symptoms [7]. The loss of close people makes these professionals more sensitive to 
the situation and aware of the disease severity. 
  
Regarding patient management concerns, significant number of dentists 
(57.8%) reported that they would like to request test results for COVID-19 from all 
patients before performing any aerosol-generating treatment procedure [25]. Rapid 
diagnostic tests for COVID-19 have low sensitivity and there is a period of latency and 
virus manifestation that varies between populations, making the test result unsafe [30]. 
In addition, the cost of tests can make their performance unviable. The adoption of this 
criterion for access to care can make it even more difficult for the patient to seek the 
dental office. Another concern reported was the impossibility of purchasing personal 
protective equipment due to the lack of these products on the market [20]. 
  
Other less common psychological effects reported were job insecurity, 
subjective overload, perceived risk and feelings and emotions. For Italian dentists 
[7,21], perceived job insecurity was associated with depressive symptoms and this 
association increased with fear of COVID-19 infection [7]. The perception of job 
insecurity is the fear of losing or maintaining it [31]. Measures to avoid virus contagion 
such as social distancing, isolation and limitation of dental activities resulted in financial 
losses and, possibly, in the perception of job insecurity. Professionals with higher fear 
of COVID-19 infection may consider their jobs at greater risk, because, if they are 
contaminated, they would be unable to work for a specified period [7]. 
  
Subjective overload differed significantly among different countries - China, 
India, Israel, Italy and the United Kingdom, with the highest average value in the United 
Kingdom, followed by China, Italy, India and Israel [23]. When subjective overload and 
psychological distress correlations were compared between countries, the highest 
values were observed among Italian dentists compared to Chinese, Indian and Israeli 
dentists [23]. Subjective overload refers to perceptions and feelings that surround 
circumstances experienced by individuals in various aspects of the daily life, and not 
just the professional aspect [32]. However, included studies used instruments that 
assessed subjective work-related overload [23,27], demonstrating that Italian dentists 
experienced higher levels of stress at work, possibly due to the scenario observed in 
the country. This association between subjective overload and psychological distress 
can be explained by the Karasek's [33] demand-control-support model, in which stress 
experience is the result of the interaction between stressor, the individual's perception 
of control over the stressor and social support. In the context of uncertainties 
surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, dentists have poor control, resulting in greater 
subjective overload [27]. Additionally, COVID-19 numbers may have a different impact 
on overload subjective and psychological distress experienced by individuals from 
different cultures and countries [23]. 
  
The assessment of perceived risk among Italian orthodontists in relation to 
COVID-19 revealed that most professionals considered dental practice to be of high 
risk for themselves and their families [26]. Regarding orthodontic care, there was 
higher frequency of professionals who considered it to be of lower risk [26], since 
Orthodontics can be classified as a specialty that represents little risk of contamination, 
since care is faster, generates less aerosols and most patients are in the age group 
least affected by the virus [34]. However, orthodontists should be aware of the SARS-
CoV-2 transmission pathways, screen suspected patients, follow official protection 
guidelines for controlling virus transmission and request patient cooperation. 
  
Other psychological consequences reported were the high frequency of some 
level of sadness and moderate frequency of anger related to COVID-19 [22]. This result 
corroborates findings of a recent review on the effects of quarantine in previous 
outbreaks, which demonstrated that health professionals were more psychologically 
affected, reported more anger, fear and sadness [35], suggesting the importance of 
psychological attention to health professionals, including dentists, during pandemics. 
In addition, the creation of programs to provide economic support for professionals and 
encourage the use of applications or computer programs to facilitate communication 
via the Internet with patients, which are measures that can help reduce the impact on 
the mental health of these professionals, including dentists. 
  
All studies included in this review were carried out through the distribution of an 
online questionnaire [8,20-25,27,28]. Digital tools gained prominence in studies during 
the COVI-19 pandemic, as they are a means of obtaining information quickly and 
directed to their target populations. Other advantages include answering 
questionnaires via cell phone, obtaining data in real time, sending questionnaire via 
links from one person to another and knowledge of the instant diagnosis of the health 
situation [36]. On the other hand, the use of non-validated questionnaires and 
convenience samples end up by influencing data generalization [37]. 
 
CONCLUSION 
  
The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health of 
dentists, with high prevalence of fear, anxiety and concern, among other psychological 
symptoms. The support and monitoring of these professionals is highly necessary to 
minimize traumatic episodes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

85.1% of dentists reported being concerned of 
contracting COVID-19 during their clinical activity; 
83.4%, 83.7%, 96.6%, 74.7%, 55.9%, reported 
feeling some level of fear, anxiety, worry, sadness 
and anger when they think about COVID-19, 
respectively.  The results of the GAD-7evaluation 
showed that 9% of respondents reported a severe 
anxiety. 
The GAD-7 score was positively correlated to the 
level of concern about the professional future (r 
(356) = 0.32, p < 0.001) and the level of concern 
of contracting the COVID-19 (r (356) = 0.26, p < 
0.001). 
Dentists aged between 35 and 55 years were 
those more concerned about their professional 
future.

Perceived job insecurity (b = 0.58, p < 0.001, 95% 
CI [0.35,0.70]) and fear of COVID-19 (b = 2.11, p 
< 0.001, 95% CI [1.58,2.60]) were positively 
associated with depressive symptoms. Fear of 
COVID-19 significantly moderated the relationship 
between perceived job insecurity and depressive 
symptoms (b = 0.61, p = 0.007, 95% CI 
[0.14,1.06]), suggesting that the association 
between perceived job insecurity and depressive 
symptoms increases with the levels of fear of 
COVID-19,. 
The regression coefficients of age and number of 
people who had died known personally were also 
statistically significant (p = 0.014 and p = 0.049,

As for patient management concerns, a small 
majority of dentist (57.8%) perceived that they like 
to request COVID-19 test results from all patients 
prior 
to 
any 
aerosol-generating 
treatment 
procedures. 
54.3% of the respondents were not confident and 
35.7% were hesitant to commence their post-
pandemic dental practices and the main reason 
was the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection 
via a patient (45.9%). 
75.5% 
were 
worried 
about 
medico-legal 
consequences of post-pandemic dental care 
provision. 
62% users of the COVID-19 tracking mobile 
application introduced by the Indian government in 
(Aarogya Setu), were significantly better prepared, 
with modest concerns, than non-users in providing 
patient care (p = 0.0001).

dental practice as at higher risk; 88% were 
consider their work of higher risk for their families 
and 63.1% were consider orthodontic procedures 
at lower risk. 
There was an association between the number of 
dentists that dealt with fewer than 5 emergencies 
during this period and the level of fear facing the 
emergencies (OR 1.8; p = 0.035), there was an 
association between the level of distress (PHQ-4) 
and the fear during emergencies (OR 0.1; p <
