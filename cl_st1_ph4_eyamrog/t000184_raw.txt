Abstract  
38 
The diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is a 
39 
cosmopolitan pest that causes leaf-area reduction in Brassicaceae plants. DBM populations 
40 
have significant genetic variability that manifests in different feeding preferences and 
41 
reproductive behaviors across generations. We evaluated the influence of Brassicaceae 
42 
cultivars on biological and behavioral parameters across 18 generations of DBM populations 
43 
that were separated and held on three varieties of Brassicaceae: Brassica oleracea var. 
44 
acephala (kale), Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli), and Brassica oleracea var. capitata 
45 
(cabbage). P, F6, F12, and F18 generations were evaluated, and biological aspects of young 
46 
adulthood and fertility parameters of adults held on each host plant were examined over 
47 
multiple generations. Additionally, larvae and adults were subjected to dual-choice and 
48 
multiple-choice (feeding and oviposition) between cultivars, over generations. The results 
49 
indicated that larvae of P. xylostella consumed greater quantities of kale and broccoli 
50 
cultivars, on average (4.05 cm2), than cabbage (2.7 cm2). The number of eggs per female in 
51 
F18 generation was 1.95 and 2.17 times higher than those in the parental (P) generation, when 
52 
reared on kale and cabbage. The population reared exclusively on kale had higher net 
53 
population growth rate (R0), intrinsic rate (rm), finite rate (λ) and generation time (T) than that 
54 
reared on broccoli and cabbage. Last generations evaluated, the larval stage reared on cabbage 
55 
showed feeding preference (F18) and oviposition preference (F12 and F18) for cabbage. 
56 
Thus, we note the existence of learning, characterized as pre-imaginal conditioning to 
57 
cabbage cultivars, over various DBM generations.

Introduction 
63 
The diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) is the 
64 
most detrimental pest of Brassicaceae worldwide, and is one of the main factors limiting the 
65 
cultivation of these plants. The DBM is widely distributed. Caterpillars that attack 
66 
Brassicaceae plants reduce leaf area, which interferes with plant growth, causes depreciation 
67 
of the product, and can lead to total loss of the crop (Castelo Branco & France 2001; Cheng et 
68 
al 2008). Plant losses can reach up to 80% defoliation and annual monetary losses are 
69 
approximately $4 to $5 billion USD (Zalucki et al 2012). 
70 
The significant genetic diversity of P. xylostella facilitates the development of 
71 
resistance to insecticides, which is a major pest control method (Ahmad et al 2012; Zago et al 
72 
2014). Thus, alternatives are being researched to optimize management of the pest. Studies 
73 
examining the life-history and behavior of DBM reared on different Brassicaceae cultivars are 
74 
important to determine cultivars that are more resistant and less conducive to the development 
75 
and reproduction of the pest (Badenes-Perez et al 2010). 
76 
Species of Brassicaceae have different types of defenses against herbivory, including 
77 
chemical and mechanical defenses (Travers-Martin et al 2008; Karowe & Grubb 2011). 
78 
However, selecting varieties appropriate for specific conditions can directly influence the 
79 
herbivory of insects (Louda & Collinge 1992). Pest insects prefer to feed on plants that offer 
80 
survivability for themselves and their descendants (Thompson 1988). Chemical defense 
81 
compounds formed in the Brassicaceae, such as sinigrin, undergo improved quantitative 
82 
variation between cultivars (Thuler et al 2007). However, this substance has great importance 
83 
in plant-insect interactions, and may positively affect the DBM by stimulating their feeding 
84 
and oviposition (Sarfraz et al 2006; Hopkins et al 2009). 
85 
Physical aspects also present in Brassicaceae plants provide mechanical protection 
86 
against insects, such as trichomes and leaf surface wax layers that may interfere with the 
87 
5 
 
feeding and oviposition on P. xylostella. The DBM has been shown to have lower growth 
88 
rates in cultivars with more trichomes than in plants containing fewer mechanical defenses 
89 
(Mathur et al 2011). 
90 
 However, in studies using plants rich in trichomes, such as black mustard (Brassica 
91 
nigra), was preferred over broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. lieutenant) and cabbage (Brassica 
92 
oleracea var. acephala) for oviposition (Newman 2014). These results suggest that the 
93 
presence of trichomes was not the main criterion influencing females’ choice of oviposition 
94 
sites. 
95 
The ability of insect pests to satisfactorily feed and succeed in their life cycle covers a 
96 
sequence of behaviors (Karban & Agrawal 2002). Learning in holometabolous insects, such 
97 
as P. xylostella, occurs in both the larval and adult stages, and learning is retained after 
98 
metamorphosis of larvae up to pupae and to adult stages (Bernays & Chapman 1994). Host 
99 
location and host selection learned behavior has been extensively studied in the imaginal 
100 
stage, but no concrete evidence has shown that preimaginal conditioning influences 
101 
preferences in adults (Bernays 1995). The conditioning may influence the life-history (life 
102 
cycle or fecundity) and substrate preference for feeding and oviposition of Lepidoptera 
103 
(Bernays & Weiss 1996). Studies on multiple DBM generations reared on kale showed that 
104 
when DBM established in another Brassicaceae cultivar, such as cabbage, causes reduction in 
105 
biological parameters (De Bortoli et al 2011, 2013). Our hypothesis suggests that biological 
106 
and behavioral aspects of P. xylostella can be changed over generations when it is reared on 
107 
different cultivars of Brassicaceae. Therefore, to further examine our hypothesis, we 
108 
evaluated biological parameters of P. xylostella in three cultivars Brassicaceae, their 
109 
reproductive behavior, and the preference for feeding and oviposition over 18 generations.

The studies were conducted at Laboratory of Biology and Insects Rearing (LBIR), 
113 
Department of Plant Protection, UNESP, Jaboticabal, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The insects used in 
114 
the rearing experiments (~ 185 generations) were kept following a methodology adapted from 
115 
Thuler (2009) on studies with Brassica oleracea var. acephala-kale HS20 (Horticeres®, 
116 
Indaiatuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil) at LBIR. DBM populations were reared in a room at 25 ± 1°C, 
117 
relative humidity of 70 ± 10% and photoperiod of 12 h light and 12 h dark.  
118 
 
119 
Life-history of P. xylostella in kale, broccoli, and cabbage 
120 
 
121 
 
We evaluated the biological characteristics of DBM across various generations: P 
122 
(parental), F6, F12 and F18, reared on three varieties of Brassicaceae. The cultivars used 
123 
were: Brassica oleracea var. acephala - kale (HS20 cultivar; Horticeres), Brassica oleracea 
124 
var. italica - broccoli (Piracicaba cultivar; Feltrin®, Farroupilha, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) e 
125 
Brassica oleracea var. capitata - cabbage (Bob Cat cultivar; Sakata®, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, 
126 
Brazil). The host plants selected in this study are widely used by brassica producers in the São 
127 
Paulo state of Brazil. The seeds of each cultivar were planted in 10L pots containing a 3: 1: 1 
128 
substrate mixture of ravine of land, cattle manure, and rice husk. The potted plants were 
129 
maintained in a greenhouse designed for growing plants. After 60 days, only the formed 
130 
leaves (fully developed) were selected as substrate to avoid interference age. 
131 
 
To start the populations of P. xylostella on kale, broccoli and cabbage host plants, ~ 
132 
3,000 pupae were removed from stock reared and divided into three cages until adult 
133 
emergence. Approximately 1,000 newly emerged adults were kept per cage with leaves of 
134 
each cultivar disc. Cages contained a circular plastic container (12-cm diameter × 15-cm 
135 
height) sealed with cling film (PVC). A foliar disc (8-cm diameter) of the substrate (kale, 
136 
broccoli or cabbage) and a filter paper disc (9-cm diameter) moistened with distilled water 
137 
7 
 
were placed inside the cage. The leaf discs containing eggs were removed 24 hours after 
138 
introduction and transferred to Petri dishes (9-cm diameter) where they remained until larvae 
139 
hatched. Approximately 50 newly hatched larvae from each substrate were selected for the 
140 
study of the first generation (parental), and the surplus of the three populations were 
141 
maintained following the methodology designed by Thuler (2009) to repeat the study using 
142 
the F6, F12, and F18 generations.  
143 
 
Caterpillars in the first instar of the parental population were collected using a brush and 
144 
placed in Petri dishes (9-cm diameter) forming the following treatments: i) population on 
145 
kale, ii) population on broccoli, and iii) population on cabbage. In each dish, 10 larvae were 
146 
placed on each leaf disk substrate, totaling five Petri dishes for each population (5 replicates). 
147 
After transferring the caterpillars, the dishes were capped and sealed with plastic wrap (PVC) 
148 
in order to maintain moisture and prevent the escape of larvae.  
149 
The first evaluation was performed four days after the caterpillars were introduced to 
150 
the dishes that due to feeding habit of first instar are leaf mining. After the first evaluation, the 
151 
treatments were evaluated every three days, and leaf discs were replaced until the formation 
152 
of pupae. The assessed parameters were as follows: leaf consumption (using leaf area meter 
153 
Laser CID® CI-202 model, Washington, USA), survival (viability), and larval stage. Pupae 
154 
originating from each treatment were collected and individualized using the cell type ELISA® 
155 
96 well plates and sealed with plastic film (PVC). At this stage, we evaluated the viability 
156 
parameters and the pupal period, subject to the emergence of adults.  
157 
The newly emerged adults were removed from the cells of ELISA® plates with suction, 
158 
separated by gender, and transferred to the laying cages. Two couples from each of the 
159 
respective treatments were placed in cages, creating five replicates per treatment in total. 
160 
Inside each cage, leaf discs (8-cm diameter) were placed on paper moistened with distilled 
161 
water for oviposition. Adults were fed daily with 10% sucrose solution made with honey 
162 
8 
 
dampened sponge, fixed to the top of the cage. Every day, the total egg count on the disk and 
163 
the survival of adults was recorded. At this stage, the following parameters were evaluated: 
164 
longevity of males, longevity of females, and number of eggs per female. All studied 
165 
parameters, including larval, pupal, and adult periods, were repeated in the F6, F12, and F18 
166 
generations of the three DBM populations.  
167 
 
168 
Fertility life table  
169 
 
170 
The study was conducted with three populations of P. xylostella, reared with kale 
171 
leaves, broccoli, and cabbage to determine the population growth characteristics of insects 
172 
over the P, F6, F12, and F18 generations. In this study, we used the previously obtained 
173 
information about survival and duration (both with respect to egg, larval, pupal, and adult 
174 
stages), sex ratio, and eggs per female per day. 
175 
 
The biological data obtained permited estimates of the parameters needed for the 
176 
construction of fertility life tables (Price, 1984), which are as follows: x = mean age of the 
177 
female parental (seen as the emergence of the egg stage); lx = life expectancy to age x, 
178 
expressed as a female; mx = specific fertility or number of offspring produced per female at 
179 
age x that result in females; lx.mx = total number of females at age x. Growth parameters 
180 
resulting from the life table were evaluated as follows: R0 = net reproductive rate (considering 
181 
the number of females produced by females in generation), rm = intrinsic rate of increase in 
182 
number, λ = finite rate of increase (the number of times the population multiplies in unit 
183 
time), and T = average generation time in days. The growth parameters (R0, rm, λ and T) were 
184 
calculated using the following equations:  
185 
R0 = ∑ (mx.lx)  
186 
rm = ln . R0 / T  
187 
9 
 
 = erm  
188 
T = (∑ mx.lx.x) / (∑ mx.lx)  
189 
 
190 
Feeding preference 
191 
 
192 
The dual-choice feeding test was performed with P. xylostella caterpillars of the P, F6, 
193 
F12, and F18 generations derived from populations reared on kale, broccoli, and cabbage. The 
194 
arenas used in the feeding preference study consisted of Petri dishes (15-cm diameter) with 
195 
bottoms covered by filter paper, and were lightly moistened with distilled water to retain the 
196 
moisture of the leaf discs. In each arena, four leaf disks (2-cm diameter) were arranged 
197 
equidistantly and alternately, two cultivars per dish. Ten first instar caterpillars were then in 
198 
the center of each arena. In total, five replicates per treatment (three populations and four 
199 
generations) were assembled; each area was considered a replicate. The evaluations were 
200 
performed 24 hours after the release of caterpillars. Evaluations consisted of recording the 
201 
number of tracks present on the surface of each leaf disc. 
202 
In the multiple-choice test, three leaf discs (2-cm diameter) were placed in each arena 
203 
equidistant from each cultivar. In the center of the arena, 10 first instar caterpillars were 
204 
released. The experiment consisted of five replicates per treatment (three populations and four 
205 
generations); each area was considered a replicate. Evaluations were conducted 24 hours after 
206 
the release of the caterpillars and consisted of recording the number of tracks present on the 
207 
surface of each leaf disc.  
208 
 
209 
Oviposition preference  
210 
 
211 
10 
 
The test dual-choice oviposition was performed with DBM adults in the P, F6, F12, and 
212 
F18 generations. Individuals from each of these generations were derived from caterpillars 
213 
reared on kale, broccoli, or cabbage. The cages used were made of transparent plastic 
214 
containers (13-cm diameter × 9-cm height). In each cage, two discs (8-cm diameter) from a 
215 
cultivar and two discs from other cultivar were arranged in an alternating fashion so that 
216 
DBM adults would encounter the two cultivars at the same time. The leaf disc containing two 
217 
host plants was placed on a Petri dish covered with filter paper. The filter paper was lightly 
218 
moistened with distilled water to maintain moisture. The two newly emerged couples were 
219 
then released inside the cage to copulate and oviposit. The experiment consisted of five 
220 
replicates per treatment (three populations and four generations); each cage was considered a 
221 
replicate. Evaluations were conducted 24 hours after the release of adults, and the number of 
222 
eggs present on the surface of each cultivar was recorded. 
223 
In the multiple-choice test, an 8-cm diameter leaf disc composed of one-third of each 
224 
cultivar (kale, broccoli, and cabbage) was placed in each cage. The two newly emerged 
225 
couples were then released inside the cage to copulate and oviposit. In total, five replicates 
226 
were assembled, and each cage was considered a replicate. Evaluations were conducted 24 
227 
hours after the release of adults, and the number of eggs present in each cultivar was recorded.  
228 
 
229 
Data analysis 
230 
 
231 
The effects of the different cultivars of Brassicaceae on the P. xylostella were analyzed 
232 
using the repeated measures procedure for an analysis of variance using the PROC MIXED of 
233 
SAS Institute software. Each biological characteristic was analyzed separately (independent 
234 
fixed variables: treatment and time, random variables, and replicates within treatment), and an 
235 
appropriate covariance structure for each characteristic was used (Littell et al 2006). As there 
236 
11 
 
was a significant interaction between the main effects (cultivars and generations), an 
237 
additional analysis of variance was performed for each treatment. Assumptions of normality 
238 
and homogeneity of variance were checked using the Cramer-von Mises criterion and 
239 
Bartlett’s test. If significant differences were found between the treatments, means were 
240 
compared using Tukey’s test. All of the statistical analyses were conducted in SAS 9.1 (SAS 
241 
Software version 9.0, 2002; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).  
242 
 
The data on the fertility life table were analyzed according to the procedure described by 
243 
Maia et al. (2000) using the SAS GLM (SAS Institute, 2002) software. The proportion of 
244 
surviving adults between treatments was compared with the Kaplan-Meier method PROC 
245 
LIFETEST. The means and confidence intervals were compared using the Student t test for 
246 
paired groups generated by PROC LIFETEST (SAS Institute, 2002). 
247 
Collected data pertaining to the number of fed larvae and the number of eggs laid in 
248 
dual-choice and multiple choice tests were analyzed using Proc FREQ in SAS statistical 
249 
software (SAS Institute, 2002). The resulting analysis of the frequency of dual-choice and 
250 
multiple-choice were interpreted using the chi-square test (χ2) using the ratio 50:50 as the 
251 
expected preference (i.e. no preference was displayed by test subjects) and was performed the 
252 
chi-square test using SAS software (SAS Institute, 2002).

Life-history of P. xylostella in kale, broccoli, and cabbage  
257 
 
258 
 
In the analysis of leaf consumption by DBM, significant differences were observed 
259 
between the kale, broccoli, and cabbage cultivars (F2, 57 = 8.44, P = 0.0006). On average, less 
260 
consumption of cabbage leaves was observed (2.7 cm2) than kale leaves (4.0 cm2) and 
261 
12 
 
broccoli (4.1 cm2). However, when we evaluated the leaf consumption between generations 
262 
(P, F6, F12, and F18), no significant differences were observed (kale, F3, 16 = 0.31, P = 
263 
0.8203, broccoli, F3, 16 = 2.06, P = 0.1458, and cabbage, F3, 16 = 0.59, P = 0.6282). When the 
264 
caterpillars were reared on kale, consumption between generations ranged from 3.8 cm2 to 4.8 
265 
cm2. In broccoli, consumption was between 3.3 cm2 and 5.1 cm2, and in cabbage, 
266 
consumption was 2.2 cm2 3.8 cm2 (Table 1). 
267 
With regard to the duration of larval period, there was no significant difference between 
268 
cultivars (F2,57 = 0.89, P = 0.4169) with an average change from 6.7 to 7.1 days. In relation to 
269 
the generations, the larval period in kale was lower in P generation (6.0 days) (F3,16 = 13.26, P 
270 
<0.0001). In broccoli, there was a significant difference in the larval period of the P 
271 
generation (5.6 days), which displayed a shorter period than that displayed by the F18 
272 
generation (8.0 days) (F3,16 = 5.40, P = 0.0093). In cabbage, the shortest generation was 
273 
observed in the P generation (6.0 days), which differed from other generations (F3,16 = 39.87, 
274 
P <0.0001), with the largest period observed in the F18 generation (8.4 days) (Table 1). 
275 
In the larval stage, no significant differences were observed in the survival parameter 
276 
among cultivars (F2, 57 = 0.17, P = 0.8459) or between generations studied in: kale (F3, 16 = 
277 
1.73, P = 0.2006), broccoli (F3, 16 = 0.78, P = 0.5230), and cabbage (F3, 16 = 1.65, P = 0.2185). 
278 
The percentage of larval survival ranged from 56.0 to 90.0 among the three cultivars (Table 
279 
1).  
280 
When examining the pupal period, significant differences were observed among the 
281 
three cultivars (F2, 57 = 7.28, P = 0.0015). When the caterpillars were reared on cabbage, the 
282 
pupal period was shorter (3.2 days) than that on broccoli (3.9 days) and kale (3.6 days). 
283 
Significant differences were also observed between the generations reared on kale, with a 
284 
shorter pupal period observed in the P generation (2.4 days), and the longest observed in the 
285 
F18 generation (3.8 days) (F3, 16 = 4, 44, P < 0.0188). DBM reared on broccoli showed a 
286 
13 
 
shorter pupal period in the F6 generation (3.0 days) than in the P generation (5.6 days) (F3, 16 
287 
= 55 87, P < 0.0001; Table 1). 
288 
When examining the longevity of males, no differences were observed between the 
289 
three cultivars (F2, 57 = 0.51, P = 0.6061) with ranging from 15.4 to 17.0 days. However, there 
290 
was a significant difference between generations when the caterpillars were reared on kale 
291 
(F3,16 = 5.23, P = 0.0010) with a longer longevity of males observed in the P generation (24.7 
292 
days) (Table 2). There was no difference observed between the generations when the 
293 
caterpillars were reared on broccoli (F3,16 = 0.67, P = 0.5837) and cabbage (F3,16 = 2.01, P = 
294 
0.1525). 
295 
The longevity of females showed no differences among cultivars (F2, 57 = 2.51, P = 
296 
0.5274) and the average ranged from 13.8 to 15.4 days. However, there was a significant 
297 
difference between generations, when the caterpillars were reared on broccoli and cabbage 
298 
(F3,16 = 6.98, P = 0.0032) and (F3,16 = 5.47, P = 0.0088 ), respectively. In broccoli, there were 
299 
differences in the longevity of females; longevity was shorter in the F12 generation (10.5 
300 
days) than in the P generation (20.8 days). In cabbage, there was no difference between the 
301 
F12 generation (10.5 days) and P generation (20.8 days) (F3,16 = 5.74, P = 0.0012) (Table 2).  
302 
Regarding the average number of eggs per female, no difference was observed between 
303 
cultivars: kale, broccoli, and cabbage (F2, 57 = 0.63, P = 0.5338) with the average of 74.9 and 
304 
84.8 eggs. In the generations, a significant difference was observed between females reared 
305 
on kale, which had the lowest fertility in the P generation (60.8 eggs) and higher fertility in 
306 
the F18 generation (117.2 eggs) (F3, 16 = 9.51; P = 0.0008), and reared on cabbage, with lower 
307 
fecundity noted in the P generation (46.0 eggs) and higher in the F18 generation (100.2 eggs) 
308 
(F3,16 = 4.84, P = 0.0140) (Table 2).

312 
The net reproductive rate (R0) was higher for the caterpillars reared on kale because 
313 
they produced more offspring per female than females reared on broccoli or cabbage in the 
314 
F6, F12, and F18 generations. Among the cultivars, the R0 in kale was higher (64.8 
315 
females/female) than that in broccoli (57.1 females/female) and cabbage (53.0 
316 
females/female). Comparison of the R0 females among generations showed that there was a 
317 
significant difference between F12 generation (83.3 females, which showed higher R0 than P 
318 
generation (50.7 females) and F18 generation (53.9 females) (Table 3). This difference 
319 
between generations was also observed in broccoli, where the highest R0 occurred in the P 
320 
generation (90.1) and the lowest in the F18 generation (30.1) (Table 3). 
321 
 The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and finite rate of increase (λ) were higher for 
322 
caterpillars reared on kale compared with those reared on cabbage and broccoli, over two 
323 
generations. The developing kale sprouts generated an average of more descendants (0.37 
324 
females/female/day) than developed on broccoli (0.33 females/female/day) and cabbage (0.34 
325 
females/female/day). The λ was 1.43 female/female*day for kale, 1.40 females/female*day 
326 
for broccoli, and 1.39 females/female*day for cabbage. In comparisons between generations, 
327 
a significant difference was observed between the P and F18 generations for the two 
328 
parameters (rm and λ) in broccoli. The rm for the P generation was 0.39 females/female/day 
329 
compared to 0.27 females/female/day in the F18 generation. Since the λ in the P generation 
330 
was 1.48 female/female*day compared to 1.31 females/female*day in the F18 generation 
331 
(Table 3). A significant difference in parameters rm and λ was also observed for larvae reared 
332 
on cabbage between P generations (1.32 females/female*day) and the other F6, F12, and F18 
333 
generations reared on cabbage (Table 3). 
334 
The generation time (T) was smaller for DBM reared on kale when compared to reared 
335 
on cabbage and broccoli. Thus, the T of cultivars was 11.6 days on kale, 11.9 days on 
336 
15 
 
broccoli, and 12.0 days on cabbage. Comparing across generations, a significant difference 
337 
was observed between the F6 generation (13.1 days) and F12 generation (10.6 days) for the 
338 
larvae reared on broccoli. DBM showed longer T than P generation (13.4 days) than the other 
339 
generations reared on cabbage (Table 3). 
340 
 
341 
Feeding preference  
342 
 
343 
In dual-choice tests, the DBM larvae of the P generation that were reared on kale 
344 
preferred to feed on broccoli (68.7%) than cabbage (χ22, 3 = 4.08, P = 0, 0432). DBM reared 
345 
on broccoli, in the same generation, preferred cabbage (68.6%) over kale (χ22, 3 = 4.87, P = 
346 
0.0273) (Fig 1A). In the F6 generation caterpillars reared on cabbage leaves preferred to feed 
347 
on cabbage (67.6%) when presented broccoli (χ22, 3 = 4.12, P = 0.0422) (Fig 1B). The insects 
348 
of the F12 generation held on broccoli leaves preferred to feed on cabbage (72.0%) when 
349 
presented broccoli (χ22, 3 = 5.08, P = 0.0241) (Fig 1C). The larvae maintained on cabbage 
350 
leaves in the F18 generation showed the same food substrate preference when presented with 
351 
broccoli (69.8%) (χ22, 3 = 4.16, P = 0.0412) and kale (74.0%) (χ22, 3 = 6.11, P = 0.0134) (Fig 
352 
1D). 
353 
In the multiple-choice tests of the P generation DBM reared on kale, the highest 
354 
percentage of caterpillars feeding was found on kale (46.0%) and broccoli (40.8%) compared 
355 
to feeding on cabbage leaves (13.2%). In the same generation, in caterpillars reared on 
356 
broccoli, a higher percentage of feeding was observed on broccoli (53.8%) and kale (41.8%) 
357 
compared to feeding on cabbage (4.4%). DBM reared on cabbage were found on broccoli 
358 
(52.7%) than on cabbage (34.5%). In the F6 generation, caterpillars grown on cabbage 
359 
preferred to feed again on cabbage (39.0%) and broccoli (44.0%), instead of kale (17%). 
360 
16 
 
DBM in the F12 and F18 generations held on each cultivar (kale, broccoli or cabbage) 
361 
showed no preference for feeding among other cultivars.  
362 
 
363 
Ovipositon preference  
364 
 
365 
In the dual-choice test, the DBM adult P generation originating from caterpillars reared 
366 
on broccoli preferred to lay eggs on broccoli (68.7%) when presented with cabbage (χ22, 3 = 
367 
11.29, P = 0, 0008), but they preferred to oviposit on kale (59.8%) compared to broccoli (χ22, 3 
368 
= 5.35, P = 0.0206) (Fig 2A). Adults originated the F6 generation reared on kale preferred to 
369 
lay eggs on cabbage (60.9%) when presented broccoli (χ22, 3 = 15.53, P <0.0001). However, 
370 
when bred on broccoli, they displayed a preference for oviposition on kale (60.2%) (χ22, 3 = 
371 
8.65, P = 0.0033) or cabbage (59.5%) (χ22, 3 = 8.05, P = 0.0045) (Fig 2B).  
372 
In the F12 generation, the adults that originated from cabbage preferred to lay eggs on 
373 
cabbage (70.3%) (χ22, 3 = 11.81, P = 0.0006) and kale (69.0%) (χ22, 3 = 12.12, P = 0.0005) than 
374 
broccoli. Adults that originated from kale preferred to oviposit on cabbage (62.1%) (χ22, 3 = 
375 
14.21, P = 0.0002) (Fig 2C). In the F18 generation, the adults reared on cabbage preferred to 
376 
the oviposit on cabbage (71.5%) (χ22, 3 = 11.04, P = 0.0009) rather than on broccoli and also 
377 
preferred cabbage (65.5%) than in kale (χ22, 3 = 5.69, P = 0.0170). DBM reared in kale leaves 
378 
chose broccoli (54.0%) than cabbage (χ22, 3 = 6.37, P = 0.0116) (Fig 2D).  
379 
In multiple-choice tests, the P generation reared on cabbage oviposited the highest 
380 
percentage of eggs on broccoli (40.8%) and kale (33.6%), as compared to cabbage leaves 
381 
(25.6% ). In the F6 generation, adults originating from caterpillars fed on cabbage preferred to 
382 
lay eggs in broccoli (42.3%). However, when grown in kale, in the same generation, adults 
383 
preferred lay eggs on the same substrate, kale (52.6% of the eggs). In the F18 generation, 
384 
17 
 
insects reared on cabbage prefer to lay eggs on cabbage (43.2%) and those originally reared 
385 
on broccoli sprouts preferred kale (41.7%) and cabbage (34.9%).

387 
Discussion 
388 
Although several studies on the life-history and behavior of the DBM in cultivars have 
389 
already been conducted in different parts of the world, this is the first time this type of 
390 
research compared different generations of the population of DBM in cruciferous plants. The 
391 
results showed that the larval survival of the pest was similar in all Brassicaceae cultivars 
392 
tested along generations. Therefore, there was no increased mortality among the cultivars 
393 
examined. However, other biological aspects have changed in this study. During the larval 
394 
period, cultivars of kale and broccoli were more readily consumed than cabbage. This average 
395 
lower consumption of cabbage leaves was observed in all generations. Similar observations of 
396 
lower consumption of DBM were reported in Midori cabbage cultivars and hybrid TPC 681 
397 
when compared to cultivated kale (Volpe et al 2008). The lower consumption may be 
398 
explained by the plants’ physical characteristics, such as a waxy leaf surface. It has been 
399 
reported that occurs less leaf consumption of DBM larvae in plants with the alkane content 
400 
where there are most waxy (Eigenbrode et al 1991; Ulmer et al 2002). 
401 
Besides the aforementioned physical characteristics, the existence of deterrent 
402 
chemicals, such as ethanol extracts, that are present in Brassicaceae cultivars can increase the 
403 
consumption of P. xylostella. The amount of sinigrin present in the leaves of each plant 
404 
species changes the feeding behavior of the DBM larvae. This was evidenced in studies by 
405 
Thuler et al (2007) reported the absence of sinigrin in six commercial varieties of 
406 
Brassicaceae (including cabbage) created through genetic processes aimed at improving the 
407 
cultivars. In another study, the improvement of crop plants caused a reduction in 
408 
glucosinolate levels in cruciferous crops (Bodnaryk 1997). 
409 
18 
 
The plants of the family Brassicaceae are characterized as containing glucosinolates in 
410 
different quantities. These compounds undergo hydrolysis via an endogenous myrosinase 
411 
enzyme when a tissue is damaged, resulting in the formation of substances toxic to insects, 
412 
such as thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, and nitriles epithionitriles (Halkier & Gershenzon 2006; 
413 
Hopkins et al 2009). When induced, glucosinolates are known to have a negative influence on 
414 
herbivores and play an important role in prevention of further damage to the plants (van Dam 
415 
& Raaijmakers 2006; Van Dam & Oomen 2008). However, populations of insects that 
416 
specialize in plants containing glucosinolates, such as DBM, can possess mechanisms to 
417 
overcome the toxicity of hosts (Halkier & Gershenzon 2006). 
418 
The larval development period was different across generations. When the larvae were 
419 
reared on kale, broccoli, and cabbage, the first generation (P) was completed in fewer days 
420 
than the other generations, especially the last generation (F18). This suggests that the 
421 
caterpillars anticipated the development stages for not being adapted cultivars (particularly 
422 
broccoli and cabbage), over the generations the larval period was longer lasting. Boiça Junior 
423 
et al (2011), working with kale genotypes, observed prolongation of the larval period in P. 
424 
xylostella for some genotypes for one generation of the pest. Other results were reported by 
425 
Veiga et al (2010) in kale, when compared to first generation DBM, which had lower larval 
426 
period (6.8 days) against population reared by 60 generations in the laboratory, which 
427 
presented longer larval period (9.1 days).  
428 
Our study also observed a lower pupal period for caterpillars reared on cabbage. The 
429 
average cabbage was higher due to compensation of the larval period in F18 generation of 
430 
cultivar, which was longer. Variations and compensation in the DBM development period 
431 
may exist between the larval and pupal when offered different cultivars. Sarfraz et al (2007) 
432 
observed a faster development of P. xylostella in cultivars of Brassica juncea var. Czern when 
433 
compared with B. oleracea var. Red Acre, B. napus var. Conquest and B. napus var. Liberty. 
434 
19 
 
During adulthood, the average longevity of DBM males between cultivars and along 18 
435 
generations has not changed. Only occasional variation was found between generations for 
436 
insects reared on kale. On the kale cultivar, males survived 24 days, on average, to P 
437 
generation, surviving about 10 days longer than in broccoli and cabbage (Table 2).  
438 
In relation to female longevity, there was a change between the generations originating 
439 
from broccoli and cabbage. Females reared on both substrates survived for a longer period in 
440 
the P generation. However, the longer longevity did not correlate with the fertility parameter 
441 
presented in the study. For example, in the P generation, females survived for a longer period 
442 
in this generation, but the number of eggs deposited by females reared on cabbage was lower 
443 
in self-generation P (46.0 eggs) (Table 2). This difference observed in P generation 
444 
progressively disappeared in subsequent generations, showing that successive generations 
445 
have come to be beneficial for DBM.  
446 
The number of eggs deposited by females increased over generations in moths reared on 
447 
kale and cabbage (Table 2). Females deposited 1.95 and 2.17 times the eggs, respectively, in 
448 
the F18 generation compared to P generation. This increase in fertility not was observed when 
449 
studied up to the third successive generation of DBM. In other study, the number of eggs for 
450 
females reared on kale showed low variation, and was minimally affected along three 
451 
generations (Veiga et al 2010). The fecundity in insects of the Lepidoptera order is not altered 
452 
in adulthood (Leather 1988) because when the adult emerges, their eggs are already contained 
453 
in ovarioles. Then, changes in oviposit could be due to changes during the larval stage, as the 
454 
food substrate. Thus, the quality of the cultivar (host) during larval development would be the 
455 
most important step in reaching the maximum potential in fecundity of females (Awmack & 
456 
Leather 2002). 
457 
The life table parameters are the most important in estimating the success of a species 
458 
subjected to a particular environment, which in this case is the establishment of pest on 
459 
20 
 
different host plants (Birch 1948). The population of P. xylostella reared on kale, in general, 
460 
showed the highest net reproduction rate (R0) compared to those reared on broccoli and 
461 
cabbage. Therefore, populations reared on kale produced more offspring per female. The 
462 
evaluation of the chemical composition in cultivars is important for this parameter because, 
463 
according to Luengo (2011), kale, broccoli, and cabbage differ significantly in the amount of 
464 
nutrients and vitamin complexes they provide to feeding insects (Panizzi & Parra 2009).  
465 
Differences in net reproductive rate between the initial and final generations in kale and 
466 
broccoli were observed, but these variations were inconsistent in successive generations 
467 
(Table 3). It has been shown that variable and inadequate protein intake, as well as differences 
468 
in the quality of the different proteins and other nutrient levels, can generate a decrease or 
469 
increase in the growth rate of insects, occurring along the generations in each population 
470 
(Woods 1999; Sarfraz et al 2009). 
471 
The R0, rm, and  are important factors in the generation of descendants in a given 
472 
period, as indicated kale and cabbage best hosts. What about the comparisons between 
473 
generations, the P generation in broccoli was higher to rm and  parameters, indicating 
474 
increased production of offspring per female. However, in the F18 generation to increased 
475 
production of descendants it was obtained when insects were reared on kale and cabbage. 
476 
The results of the preference DBM between cultivars were different. In the double and 
477 
multiple-choice tests, caterpillars developed on kale and broccoli did not seek that substrate of 
478 
origin between generations. However, this occurrence was rarely observed with caterpillars 
479 
grown on cabbage, which demonstrated a feeding preference for discs containing the same 
480 
substrate (cabbage) in two of the four generations evaluated. This occurred in the F6, F12 and 
481 
F18 generations to feeding and oviposit, which may suggest a period of familiarization or 
482 
adjustment to the new substrate.  
483 
21 
 
Although there are many studies of insect food preference tests, the analyses are based 
484 
on only one generation. In this study, differences between generations were analyzed, and 
485 
variations were found that do not indicate imaginal conditioning of P. xylostella. Insects 
486 
reared for several generations on a single substrate are influenced by a strong selection 
487 
pressure, causing a tendency to develop of insects, but this behavioral manifestation may take 
488 
many generations to occurred (Barros 1998).  
489 
Analyzing all generations until the last (F18), verified the existence of a pre-imaginal 
490 
conditioning for DBM on cabbage, which would support the argument for learning across 
491 
generations. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that in recent generations (F12 and F18), 
492 
females preferred the same substrate on which the insect was reared. Studies have shown that 
493 
in plants, sinigrin was related to the oviposition stimulation process in P. xylostella (Spencer 
494 
et al 1999). Structures such as trichomes and waxy present in small amounts in the leaves can 
495 
also encourage a choice for oviposition, as these leaves possess lower mechanical protection 
496 
(Hariprasad & Van Emden 2010). However, preference for oviposition of P. xylostella in 
497 
cabbage was probably triggered by a set of stimuli, both chemical and physical factors, and 
498 
sites with the most attractive stimuli were preferred for oviposition (Justus et al 2000).  
499 
This study evaluated the possible occurrence of conditioning over DBM generations and 
500 
contributes to the understanding of P. xylostella behavior in Brassicaceae cultivars. We 
501 
emphasize that our study was the first to consider the behavior of the pest over several 
502 
generations, thereby demonstrating that this insect behavior is complex and highly variable 
503 
over time. However, more research is needed on the approach conditioning so these 
504 
interactions can be better understood.
