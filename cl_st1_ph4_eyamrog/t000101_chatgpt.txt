From a normative standpoint, policy change is deemed essential for enhancing social conditions, reducing inequality, and fostering sustainability. However, the challenge arises when change involves the dismantling of previously effective policies. Distinguishing between democratic policy change and policy dismantling becomes a critical task. To address these inquiries, this study delves into the transformations witnessed in Brazil following Jair Bolsonaro's assumption of office in January 2019. The analysis focuses on these alterations through the lens of the federal bureaucracy spanning various agencies and professional domains. The research methodology encompassed the collection of quantitative and qualitative data through a survey involving former and current federal employees, as well as semi-structured interviews with civil servants with experience in the federal government. The study's outcomes reveal that in Brazil, policy dismantling transcends conventional policy changes, characterized by authoritarian tendencies that have disrupted the federal bureaucracy and undermined state efficacy.
During his initial 100 days in office, Jair Bolsonaro implemented an executive order that gained notoriety in Brazil as the "revogaço," which entailed the sweeping annulment of 250 executive orders issued by his predecessors dating back to 1901. In a similar vein, within the first 24 hours of assuming office, Joe Biden signed 15 new executive orders, several of which revoked prior decisions and policies put in place by Donald Trump. While these actions may appear comparable and could be viewed as a natural outcome of the democratic process, a closer examination of the current Brazilian governmental structure reveals a distinct level and nature of policy dismantling taking place within the federal government, setting the country apart from the typical post-election policy shifts that occur following a change in the ruling political party.
From a normative perspective, policy change is considered essential for enhancing social conditions, diminishing inequality, and fostering sustainability. The extensive public policy literature on policy change has offered policy scholars various conceptual frameworks to comprehend the intricacies of the policy change process. In addition to this body of literature, Michael Bauer and his associates have delved into a particular type of policy change known as "policy dismantling." This term refers to "the cutting, reduction, diminution, or even complete elimination of existing policies" (Bauer et al., 2012, p. v).
The differentiation between ordinary policy change and policy dismantling may not be readily apparent to all. Is policy dismantling merely a form of policy change that typically occurs following a change in administration, aimed at reversing the actions of a predecessor? Does policy dismantling represent an undesirable form of policy change, thereby deviating from the presumed neutrality of the "theories of the policy process" (Sabatier & Weible, 2014)?
This paper aims to explore the distinctive characteristics that differentiate policy dismantling from regular policy changes, using the case of Brazil under Bolsonaro as a focal point. The Brazilian scenario illustrates how policy dismantling has been characterized by authoritarian tendencies that have disrupted the federal bureaucracy, a crucial component of the state's administrative framework and an independent entity within the policy-making process (Bauer, Peters, & Pierre, 2021). The turmoil within the bureaucracy has led to repercussions manifested in both the dismantling of federal policies and the weakening of policy capacity at individual and institutional levels (Wu et al., 2018). Therefore, this study addresses the gap identified by Bauer, Peters, and Pierre (2021) regarding the necessity for a more in-depth examination of the interplay between populist leaders who backtrack on policies and the public bureaucracy of their respective nations.
The paper aims to investigate what distinguishes policy dismantling in Brazil from regular democratic policy changes. While the answer to this inquiry is likely multifaceted, the research presented here delves into the inner mechanisms and viewpoints of the Brazilian federal bureaucracy. It suggests that policy dismantling in Brazil has incorporated authoritarian features, such as disdain for career civil servants, intimidation, harassment, and a subsequent phenomenon of 'bureaucratic reshuffling'. This process involved either the removal of bureaucrats from their initial roles or their voluntary departure due to apprehension of persecution.
This research contributes to the policy dismantling framework by delineating characteristics specific to what is termed authoritarian policy dismantling. In contrast to the nuanced approach of dismantling by default described in existing literature, illiberal populists opt for a direct and intentional assault on the resources and institutions upholding public policies and, by extension, the state.
This mixed-methods research project was initiated in the Summer of 2019, six months after Jair Bolsonaro assumed the Brazilian presidency. Data collection spanned two years and included a snowball survey involving 337 former and current federal employees, with 129 participating in semi-structured interviews lasting 1 to 1.5 hours. Participants were queried about their personal trajectories and career decisions, with no direct questions regarding policy dismantling. The reported data comprises information voluntarily provided by respondents during the interviews, which were subsequently coded and analyzed using NVivo software.
The notion that policy change is a constant necessity in developing nations has been challenged by instances where far-right administrations have lauded the dismantling of formerly progressive policies. This trend is not confined to developing countries but has manifested in various forms, such as the immigration policies in the United States during Trump's presidency, the criminal and drug policies in the Philippines under Duterte, and the environmental, social, human rights, and educational policies in Brazil under Bolsonaro.
The literature on policy dismantling predates the rise of illiberal populism in global politics. The collaborative research by Michael Bauer, Andrew Jordan, Christoffer Green-Pendersen, and Adrienne Héritier in 2012 delves into social policy dismantling processes that commenced prior to the 2008 financial crisis and were exacerbated by it. Their study is rooted in Paul Pierson's concept of dismantling from the 1990s, where policy dismantling primarily involved the elimination or reduction of policy tools within fiscal constraints. Pierson's original work focused on the dismantling of the welfare state during that era.
Bauer and colleagues recognized the potential applicability of policy dismantling beyond the realm of social policy, offering a valuable framework for understanding processes in other fields. In their 2012 publication, they expanded their analysis to include environmental policy alongside social policy, aiming to validate their proposed framework. The authors articulate their definition of policy dismantling as:
According to Bauer et al. (2012), policy dismantling refers to a shift in policies that can be direct, indirect, hidden, or symbolic in nature, resulting in a reduction in the number of policies within a specific domain, a decrease in the utilization of policy instruments, or a lowering of their intensity. This process may entail modifications to the fundamental components of policies or can be accomplished by altering the capabilities required for their implementation and oversight.
The definition presents a nuanced categorization of policy dismantling strategies, delineating between active dismantling, dismantling by default, symbolic dismantling, and dismantling by arena shifting. Moreover, it acknowledges the potential for dismantling to occur through the manipulation of policy implementation capacities. These components of the policy dismantling framework are not only valuable but also relevant to ongoing policy dismantling efforts in Bolsonaro's Brazil, as elaborated upon in the subsequent discussion.
The original framework aimed to address a perplexing contradiction: why would rational, utility-maximizing politicians, typically focused on securing re-election, willingly undertake potentially unpopular policy dismantling? This contradiction, while plausible in the context of fiscal constraints, may not apply to recent instances of policy dismantling within illiberal populism. In these cases, illiberal populists, by invoking narratives of the "deep state" or alleging partisanship among civil servants, openly dismantle established policies as a strategic move to appease their electoral supporters (Bauer et al., 2012, p. 31; Abramson, 2017).
The literature on policy dismantling has recently broadened to include an examination of policy changes that do not stem from fiscal and neoliberal cuts but rather arise from the directives of illiberal leaders. Bauer, Peters, and Pierre (2021) posit in a recent study that populist backsliders shape the administration into new illiberal forms through five key strategies: restructuring, resource redistribution, personnel control, instilling illiberal norms, and undermining accountability. Of particular relevance to this study is the third strategy, described as the "ideological cleansing of staff." In an upcoming publication, Bauer et al. (2021) argue that democratic backsliding should be viewed not only through the lens of the political or judicial systems but also by examining its impact on public administration, which plays a crucial role in policy implementation.
In their study, Bauer & Becker (2020) examine how populist backsliders have approached public administration in various countries, including Hungary, Peru, the United States, and Switzerland. They categorize the approaches into capture, dismantling, sabotage, and reform, and present a matrix that correlates the populist's perception of the state (positive or negative) with the strength of the administrative system (fragile or robust). When a populist leader holds a negative view of a state with a fragile administrative system, dismantling typically occurs, as seen in the case of Peru under Fujimori. The authors suggest that this pattern is also evident in Brazil under Bolsonaro, aligning with the findings of Sabourin et al. (2020) in their examination of family farming policies.
The conservative discourse surrounding public service often depicts bureaucracy as being unproductive, overpaid, and resistant to change. This narrative is reflected in the education literature, where teachers and their unions are frequently labeled as hindrances to educational reform (Moe, 2016). Contrary to these perceptions, public administration research has shown that bureaucrats possess decision-making autonomy (Lipsky, 2010) and can resist directives from higher authorities if they conflict with their personal values, a phenomenon termed 'guerrilla government' by O’Leary (2014). Building on this concept, Guedes-Neto & Peters (2021) conducted an empirical study using experimental methods to investigate how civil servants in Brazil would respond when instructed to carry out undemocratic projects, a concept explored by Brehm & Gates (1999). Their research, involving municipal civil servants in two Brazilian state capitals, revealed that when faced with hypothetical undemocratic tasks, bureaucrats at the municipal level tended to choose shirking as their preferred response.
In a similar vein, Morais de Sa e Silva (forthcoming) discovered that South-South cooperation projects under the Bolsonaro administration were being gradually dismantled at a slower rate than anticipated, primarily attributed to bureaucratic inertia. Despite the government's shift away from the previous pro-South foreign policy, bureaucrats across different agencies persisted in maintaining and operating South-South cooperation initiatives.
In this study, we will delve into a more comprehensive interpretation of Hirschman's organizational triad, which comprises exit, voice, and loyalty as outlined by Hirschman in 1970.
When customers cease purchasing the firm's products or when members depart from the organization, this is referred to as the exit option. Consequently, there is a decline in revenues, a decrease in membership, and management is compelled to seek solutions to rectify the underlying issues that have caused these exits (Hirschman, 1970, p. 4).
The notion of exit as a viable course of action may appear implausible when considering public employees with secure tenured positions. Nevertheless, there exist several, at times subtle, exit strategies that a civil servant could potentially explore: opting for a transfer to a different department or unit within the same institution or agency, seeking a transfer to another government agency or town, taking a temporary leave to pursue graduate studies, opting for an unpaid leave, or ultimately, completely abandoning the civil service. While it is commonly assumed that public employees remain in the same role at the same desk for their entire careers, the Brazilian federal administration, for instance, offers federal careers that allow for a certain level of mobility, albeit with varying degrees of mobility among different positions.
In their examination of the dismantling of family farming policies in Brazil and Argentina, Sabourin et al. (2020) identify a phenomenon they term "bureaucratic adaptation" (p. 62). They suggest that both the bureaucracy and civil society ultimately acquiesce and conform to the processes of policy dismantling. However, this study reveals that this apparent adaptation involves a certain level of hidden resistance by civil servants, who opt for exit as a personal strategy to evade dismantling within an authoritarian environment. Drawing on the insights of Levitsky & Ziblatt (2018), it is posited that contemporary autocratic regimes are not necessarily the product of coups or revolutions but rather emerge through the infiltration of institutions originally designed to uphold democratic principles.
Within this framework, this paper addresses specific questions: How does the bureaucracy respond to an administration characterized by illiberal populism? Do these responses impact policy dismantling processes? How does the bureaucracy aid in distinguishing between routine policy changes and policy dismantling? On one hand, the bureaucracy may openly resist or take actions to mitigate the extent of policy dismantling, as evidenced by Guedes-Neto & Peters (2021) in their experimental study. Conversely, out of apprehension, the bureaucracy may distance itself from the areas and institutions undergoing dismantling, inadvertently facilitating further policy dismantling by default. In this latter scenario, the state is left with both dismantled policies and diminished state capacity. Brazil's federal administration boasts a professionalized civil service, with institutions like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs featuring a structured bureaucracy selected through open public exams since the 1940s. Following the 1988 Constitution, public entrance exams became mandatory for all federal tenure-track employees. Subsequently, various new and specialized careers were introduced, including roles like Specialist in Public Policy and Management (EPPGG), Planning and Budget Analyst (APO), Foreign Trade Specialist (ACE), Infrastructure Analyst, and Technical Social Policy Analyst (ATPS). Data from IPEA (2021) indicates a notable increase in federal positions within the executive branch, rising from approximately 5 million in 1986 to slightly over 10 million in 2018. Despite the substantial number of civil service positions suggesting a sizable state apparatus, the associated cost at all levels (federal, state, municipal) and across all branches (executive, legislative, judiciary) only rose by 1 percentage point from 2004 to 2017, from 9.6% to 10.5% of the country's GDP.
When Bolsonaro assumed office on January 1st, 2019, he inherited a robust and well-established federal machinery in Brazil. The country had previously implemented Bolsa Familia, the world's largest conditional cash transfer program, benefiting 14 million impoverished families (Morais de Sá e Silva, 2017). Additionally, Brazil boasts a universal health system, SUS, providing free healthcare services to all citizens nationwide, including extensive immunization coverage. The nation also hosts a network of 69 federal universities, offering tuition-free, high-quality undergraduate and graduate education. While acknowledging imperfections, these institutions and policies have garnered international recognition and have served as models for knowledge exchange with other Global South countries (Porto de Oliveira, 2019).
In contrast to the case of Peru outlined by Bauer and Becker (2020, where a populist leader's disdain for the state intersected with a feeble administrative structure, Bolsonaro encountered a robust and well-established administrative framework. Similar to Fujimori, he initiated a trajectory towards neoliberal administrative changes, spearheaded by his Minister of the Economy, Paulo Guedes. However, beyond catering to market interests, Bolsonaro pursued an ideological agenda that clashed with longstanding Brazilian state practices in areas such as environmental conservation, social equity, racial and gender parity, and evidence-based public health initiatives. This collision course led to the implementation of authoritarian measures and procedures designed to instill fear, coerce, and isolate the bureaucracy.
Following the methods section, an analytical segment delves into the perceptions and career decisions of federal employees who were part of this study. This section elucidates common patterns that have emerged, shedding light on the continuous process of dismantling authoritarian policies in Brazil.
As part of a larger, multi-year research project, both current and former federal employees took part in an online survey and engaged in 1-1.5 hour semi-structured interviews conducted via Zoom. The survey involved 337 respondents, with 129 of them being interviewed. It is important to note that the research participants were not selected through a representative or purposive sampling method. Due to the Brazilian government's lack of provision of databases containing contact information of the federal bureaucracy, creating representative samples for non-governmental research projects becomes challenging. Consequently, this research initiative relied on a snowball sampling technique, primarily utilizing social media for survey promotion. The survey questionnaire underwent a pilot phase in the summer of 2019, involving a small group of federal civil servants at Brazil's National School of Public Administration (ENAP). Furthermore, the initial questionnaire underwent discussions with public policy professors and researchers in Brazil before being widely distributed post-adjustments.
While the sample may not have been fully representative, the survey responses displayed notable diversity in terms of federal careers and institutions. The subsequent tables provide an overview of this diversity. Notably, the "other" category in both tables contained a substantial number of respondents, leading to a lengthy list of institutions and careers that participants manually entered into the survey.
Among the 337 survey respondents, 240 are career civil servants, with approximately half of them being concentrated in two federal careers: Specialist in Public Policy and Government Management (EPPG) and Technical Analyst of Social Policy (ATPS). The significant presence of respondents in these two careers could potentially elucidate, as elaborated upon later in the article, the inclination towards exit strategies, given that both career paths, particularly the former, offer opportunities for individuals to transition between various federal institutions.
Survey respondents were requested to provide their email addresses if they consented to participate in a follow-up interview. These interviews were carried out in the Spring of 2021, more than two years following Bolsonaro's assumption of office. The insights gleaned from these interviews were particularly enlightening in addressing the research inquiries posited in this study. Notably, certain interviewees, especially those still employed within the federal government, necessitated multiple assurances regarding the confidentiality of their identities. Consequently, the research team implemented various measures to eliminate any identifiable information from all data sources. Some participants only felt comfortable sharing their perspectives and discussing current challenges towards the conclusion of the interview, after the structured questions had been addressed.
Regrettably, it was not uncommon for interviewees to display emotional responses during the interview process, whether discussing their current circumstances or reflecting on past work experiences. This occurrence led the research team to introduce a novel question at the conclusion of the interview questionnaire, prompting participants to envision their future and select a project they would be interested in pursuing. This approach was implemented to conclude the interview on a positive and optimistic note, aiming to mitigate the adverse psychological impact that the interview process appeared to be exerting on the participants.
Interviews were analyzed using NVivo software, facilitating coding and text queries. It is crucial to note that the terms utilized in the text queries and coding process did not directly stem from specific interview questions; rather, coded themes were spontaneously provided by respondents. This coding process, following a grounded theory approach (Charmaz, 2006), led to the emergence of new codes pertaining to career decisions and interviewees' perceptions. While not all interviews have been transcribed, analysis incorporated interview notes taken by the interviewers in instances where full transcriptions were unavailable. Direct quotes included in the paper are sourced from the 41 transcribed interviews, with translations from Portuguese to English conducted by the author.
Elite Squad, a Brazilian film that gained international recognition in the late 2000s, follows the narrative of Capitain Nascimento, the leader of an elite squad in Rio de Janeiro tasked with combating crime through any means necessary. A pivotal scene in the movie depicts Nascimento aggressively confronting a struggling recruit, demanding him to ask to leave (pede pra sair) in a moment that has since become a widely recognized meme in Brazil. This portrayal, featuring actor Wagner Moura, showcases a violent interaction where the recruit is physically assaulted, highlighting the coercive nature of the situation. Such instances of brutality in training, reminiscent of the country's military dictatorship era (1964-1985), underscore the lasting impact of authoritarian practices within military and police academies.
As evidenced by the data presented below, the process of policy dismantling in Brazil has entailed the erosion of bureaucratic structures. Numerous individuals have reported instances that have led, either directly or indirectly, to their own dismissal or resignation from their positions.
When President Rousseff was impeached in 2016 and replaced by her Vice-President Michel Temer, there was a prevalent sentiment within the federal bureaucracy that they would resist policy dismantling. Some indeed did resist, possibly aided by a broader political context that constrained Temer's influence. Assuming office under contentious circumstances, Temer's 2.5-year tenure primarily focused on Labor Reform and Pension Reform, achieving success in the former but facing failure in the latter. Other policy areas were not central to Temer's allegiance to the economic forces that facilitated his rise to power. Certain sectors of the bureaucracy were able to maintain business as usual, such as in human rights where Temer appointed the esteemed scholar Flavia Piovesan. Piovesan notably elevated the institutional standing of the LGBTQ rights department within the Ministry of Human Rights. In terms of foreign policy, Temer largely continued his predecessor's foreign policy positions, demonstrating commitment to OECD membership and upholding existing levels of South-South cooperation projects. This continuity can be attributed to what I have termed 'bureaucratic momentum' (Morais de Sa e Silva, forthcoming).
Following the impeachment process, widely labeled as a coup, several federal employees opted to either resign from their positions within the federal service or transition to alternative institutions. Some cited their unwillingness to cooperate with what they deemed an illegitimate government as their rationale for departure. Conversely, a portion of employees chose to stay in their roles to ensure the continuity of the policies they had been involved in. According to the data presented below, a mere 29% of respondents maintained their positions and affiliations from the time of the impeachment process in 2016 through to the 2018 elections.
This marked the initiation of a bureaucratic reshuffling process, characterized by the deliberate reorganization of the bureaucracy or the voluntary departure of bureaucrats from their roles. The subsequent quote underscores that this phenomenon is not solely attributable to individual decisions and inclinations but is indicative of a collective undertaking, shaped by a mutual understanding of the increasingly precarious or unsuitable political environment for conducting work.
Following the 2016 coup, a number of our colleagues at the Ministry of A10 made concerted efforts to relocate numerous individuals whom they believed would face persecution. In an interview, it was noted that several individuals within the ministry took proactive measures to assist those in need by metaphorically likening their actions to throwing out "life saver floats" in order to rescue people from potential harm.
The sensation of discomfort and unease that prompted numerous individuals to depart from their initial roles following the 2016 impeachment was articulated by various participants, as exemplified below. The excerpts highlight a compelling fusion of two factors, which also seem intertwined in the dynamics unfolding within the Bolsonaro administration: a significant portion of those opting to resign from their original posts and affiliations actively pursue alternative environments where they can engage in discreet activities, believed to afford them a measure of security.
During that period, I endured significant persecution which deeply affected me. Despite being offered a political appointment at the Ministry of A, I vehemently declined the position as my desire was to be left undisturbed. I expressed a strong aversion towards setting foot at location B and monitoring any policies further, as stated in interview 104.
In the new location, my primary responsibilities revolved around addressing human resources matters, particularly focusing on the training of civil servants. These tasks predominantly involved navigating through bureaucratic and administrative challenges, as highlighted in the interview (interview 9).
The table presented below illustrates the ongoing reshuffling within the Bolsonaro administration, with a mere 30.97% of respondents indicating that they have remained in the same position and institution since the 2018 elections. Departures from their current roles took various forms: some individuals shifted to different departments due to career constraints that limited movement across institutions, while others opted for temporary leaves to pursue further studies. More drastic measures were taken by some, who requested transfers to alternative agencies or cities. In a few extreme instances, individuals sought unpaid leaves to explore opportunities outside the public sector or even in foreign countries.
The concepts of exit and invisibility have become increasingly intertwined with the notion of survival.
In my former department, all civil servants departed for other departments, prompting me to negotiate a transfer to a different area that did not align with my personal interests but was the only viable option at the time. The constant pursuit of a conducive environment for survival resonates with me, driving my decision to seek a workplace where I could maintain a sense of dignity. This underlying motivation underscores my choice to relocate, emphasizing the importance of finding a space where one can work with integrity and purpose (interview 8).
Being away from Brasilia enables me to work without the constant pressure that my colleagues there face, particularly those involved in human rights policies. The distance grants me a sense of peace and freedom to focus on my work. In contrast, those based in Brasilia are constrained by the demands and limitations of the environment, hindering their ability to effectively carry out their duties. This disparity highlights the challenges faced by individuals working in the realm of human rights policies within the capital city.
Among my former colleagues, there has been a significant exodus. Only one member of my previous team remains within the agency, albeit having transitioned to working with policy A. This individual, who shifted from the B program to the A program, expresses a sense of tranquility in his current role, appearing somewhat detached. Meanwhile, another colleague has departed for Institute C, while yet another has moved on to Institute D. The dispersion of my former coworkers across various agencies is evident, with each seemingly content in their respective positions as they quietly anticipate retirement. The prevailing atmosphere is one of silence, with no one voicing their thoughts or concerns, as highlighted in interview 30.
Several respondents rationalized their decisions to leave by citing the dismantling processes they observed within their agencies, processes they found unbearable to witness. This phenomenon, both intriguing and regrettable, established a harmful cycle wherein policy dismantling prompted bureaucratic exits, subsequently fostering an environment conducive to further dismantling.
Upon reflecting on a year spent coordinating activities for the Conference on E, it became evident that departing from Ministry E was necessary due to the distressing experience of witnessing the dismantling of previously established initiatives. Interviewee 14 expressed a sense of melancholy and dissatisfaction with the situation, prompting the decision to disengage from the organization.
"I used to focus on conceiving and designing public policies in the past, but now I find that the execution and implementation of these policies are where the real impact lies. There seems to be no space for individuals like me who are more inclined towards policy design within the Ministry. Therefore, I have shifted my focus to a more behind-the-scenes role, where I engage in activities such as taking notes and documenting the changes and challenges that are unfolding. This work is not about immediate results but rather about building a repository of knowledge and understanding the intricacies of the processes at play" (interviewee 16).
"In a context where the agendas I previously supported are losing strength, the choice to depart from both the government and the country was straightforward. At present, the prospect of returning to Brazil or rejoining the government is not viable, as stated in interview 23."
Research participants not only sought invisibility and attempted to evade contexts of dismantling but also conveyed a perception that the Bolsonaro government fosters mistrust and contempt towards civil servants. The subsequent section delves into these articulated perceptions and the documented instances of widespread removals of civil servants and institutional dismantling, culminating in a state of decision-making paralysis.
When a democratic pluralist leader assumes office, it is customary for significant changes to occur in high cabinet positions, with the possibility of adjustments in mid-level positions and institutional reforms to align with the leader's vision. In the context of Bolsonaro's Brazil, the elected leadership's vision did not align with the federal civil bureaucracy, which was perceived as "leftist," "communist," or "petista" (supportive of PT, the Workers Party). Bolsonaro pledged to "despetizar" the federal government, indicating his intention to remove individuals he deemed to be affiliated with the Workers Party. In a concerning turn of events, during a 2018 campaign rally, Bolsonaro even went as far as to promise to eliminate all PT supporters.
On his third day in office, President Bolsonaro dismissed 3,500 individuals from their federal appointments (Batista, 2019). This action resulted in non-civil servants having to exit the government, while civil servants found themselves removed from senior positions. It is important to highlight that Bolsonaro assumed office in 2019, marking two and a half years since the conclusion of the PT government, during which significant bureaucratic reorganization had already taken place, as previously mentioned.
On January 3rd, 2019, Onyx Lorenzoni, newly appointed as Minister of the Center of Government (Casa Civil), announced via Twitter his intention to dismiss all political appointees at Casa Civil, stating, "We will fire all political appointments working at Casa Civil. We have to have people who are committed to what we represent." This mass layoff on the third day of the administration reflected the underlying assumption that none of the individuals previously employed within the federal government could possibly align with the values and goals of the new administration.
On the same day, the official Twitter account of the Presidency (@planalto) tagged Lorenzoni and declared: "We will be reassessing matters concerning participatory Councils. The Economic and Social Development Council, known as Conselhão, has already been dissolved through an executive order. A comprehensive review, akin to a meticulous combing process (pente fino), will be conducted on all councils within the federal administration. In Brazilian Portuguese, the term "pente fino" symbolizes a rigorous scrutiny process aimed at identifying and eliminating parasites.
The extensive removal process, coupled with sudden shifts in ministerial structures, resulted in a state of uncertainty for numerous policies, as described by an interviewee.
Until the commencement of 2019, I was employed in this sector, specifically until January 2019 when Secretariat H was dissolved. The General Coordination, where I had been employed from 2006 to 2016, along with the entire Department, was also dissolved during that period. Subsequently, there have been no policies pertaining to H at the Ministry of I. Furthermore, the entire department responsible for J policies was also dissolved, leaving these policies in a state of limbo throughout the entirety of 2019. Although these policies technically still existed, there was no specific sector assigned to oversee them in practice (interview 47).
The removal process continued unabated during the initial months of the Bolsonaro administration. According to one interviewee, each new appointment undergoes a 'background check' at the presidency, aimed at determining not just if the individual is a supporter of the PT party but also if they held a political position in any prior governments. Interviewees conveyed a sense of pervasive distrust and disdain towards civil servants within the current environment.
Initially, my assumption, which was proven incorrect, was that the Bolsonaro government would swiftly implement drastic measures and purge individuals. Contrary to my expectations, this did not materialize, and my prediction was off the mark. Instead, they adopted a more subtle approach, gradually asserting control over the state apparatus. This methodical process has led to a situation where none of my peers currently hold political positions within this administration. Former colleagues were systematically ousted due to their affiliations with previous governments. Notably, within the Cabinet for Institutional Security (GSI), military personnel monitor individuals' social media activities. Any hint of left-leaning views results in disapproval of their appointments, showcasing the stringent ideological vetting process in place (interview 04).
There was a significant instance of political persecution within the Ministry of I, where civil servants were ostracized due to perceived affiliations with political parties. These alterations occurred as a result of a general atmosphere of distrust towards all civil servants. The interviewee highlighted the necessity of gaining the trust of new arrivals, emphasizing the importance of demonstrating a commitment to performing well and dispelling any suspicions of sabotage (interview 47).
The rationale behind recent appointments has not been solely technical, as claimed by the President in portraying a new era within the federal government. The selection process appears to have retained a significant political element, suggesting that political considerations continue to play a crucial role in decision-making despite the emphasis on a new direction.
In fact, significant dismantling has been taking place at the Institute for K during the Bolsonaro administration, a process that is ongoing. Rather than a past event, it is a current phenomenon. The replacement of long-serving superintendents, individuals with decades of experience in policy K, by individuals with different backgrounds such as movie-makers and acquaintances of members of Congress has been observed. Numerous directors have been dismissed in recent months, indicating a widespread and deliberate dismantling process. This observation is not merely subjective; individuals are being substituted across all levels without clear rationale. The absence of a coherent project behind these changes is particularly concerning to the interviewee, who highlights the lack of a constructive vision. While acknowledging the nature of politics and the need for discussions, the interviewee expresses discomfort with the absence of a clear plan beyond the dismantling of existing structures, a trend that is unmistakably evident in the current state of affairs at Institute K.
The concept of purposefully dismantling the state is evident in additional interviews, alongside instances of decision-making paralysis.
There appears to be a deliberate effort to dismantle the state, aligning with the authoritarian regime being established. While laws may not be overtly repealed, there is a covert erosion of processes that ultimately undermines rights, creating a situation that seems irreversible (interview 41).
In the context of the research, a prevalent observation is the prevalence of paralysis. The individual in question holds the position of Minister and also serves as a church pastor. Despite his role as a professor at a university, it is noted that he did not have a prior career in the field of interest. While there were supposed ties to the university, it is clarified that he was solely a professor and not involved in the administrative aspects of the institution. This dual role as a pastor and professor underscores a perception of inaction and a policy of dismantling, as articulated in the interview excerpt provided.
The cabinet composition of the Bolsonaro administration has been characterized by the inclusion of highly controversial figures who embody his extreme-right ideological positions, both through their activities on social media and in their official capacities. Notable individuals among them include:
Ricardo Salles, the Minister of the Environment, has proposed leveraging the pandemic as an opportunity for the government to enact environmental deregulation.
Damares Alves, the Minister of Women, Family, and Human Rights, advocates for the belief that girls should wear pink and boys should wear blue.
Abraham Weintraub, the former Minister of Education, significantly reduced funding to all federal universities as a response to criticisms of the Bolsonaro administration.
Ernesto Araújo, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, adheres to the theory of 'globalism' and perceives a global conspiracy aimed at dismantling the Christian world.
Felipe G. Martins, the Special Advisor on International Relations to the President, was captured on live video making a hand gesture associated with white supremacy.
In April 2019, Paulo Guedes, the Minister of the Economy, referred to civil servants as 'the enemy' during a cabinet meeting.
Over time, certain controversial ministers were either replaced by more moderate and lesser-known figures or by military officers. According to Nozaki (2021, p. 10), there has been a significant rise in the presence of military officers holding political positions in the Bolsonaro government, increasing from 2,765 during the final year of the Temer administration to 6,157 in 2020 under Bolsonaro's leadership. At the time of the study, there were ten military Ministers in office. Nozaki (2021) characterizes this trend as "the militarization of public administration in Brazil."
The table presented below illustrates the frequency of specific terms used by interviewees when discussing their current career trajectories. The numerical values provide insight into the prevalence of certain challenges faced by civil servants, including themes of dismantling, fear, persecution, suffering, leaves of absence, and terminations ("exonerações").
Fear and worry frequently manifest in interviews, often stemming from personal experiences of research participants or reflecting instances of persecution and intimidation faced by colleagues. This prevailing institutional climate is characterized by a sense of apprehension, withdrawal, and self-censorship.
Presently, there exists a trend of restricting personal freedom of expression among civil servants, with numerous instances of individuals facing persecution for voicing dissenting opinions against the government. The interviewee recollects a time when they actively participated in street demonstrations, shared their views on social media, and engaged in protests. However, they now refrain from expressing themselves due to a perceived surveillance of private conversations. The fear of repercussions, including potential political persecution, looms large in their decision to remain silent (interview 7).
Today, I was taken aback by the news that professors at the Federal University of Pelotas are facing administrative prosecution for criticizing the President. The fact that such actions are being pursued is deeply concerning and raises questions about the state of academic freedom and freedom of expression in our society.
Efforts were made to terminate policy L, however, there exist opposing factions to L books, leaving the individual still navigating a precarious situation. Consequently, a shift towards more technical tasks was initiated. The individual acknowledges the underlying political context, which has progressively limited their ability to freely express opinions and influence decision-making, despite their role as an advisor. This lack of autonomy has resulted in a constant need for caution in communication, requiring meticulous consideration of both content and delivery.
The challenges faced during the Temer administration were significant, yet they pale in comparison to the current situation under Bolsonaro's leadership. The capacity to exacerbate existing issues appears boundless, rendering the current state of affairs exceptionally precarious. What distinguishes this period is the pervasive sense of fear that now permeates society. Previously, apprehension was primarily linked to professional repercussions such as potential demotions or social stigma. However, the current climate instills a deeper fear of genuine persecution. An illustrative incident involved a presentation on a proposed constitutional amendment, where the presenter was later cautioned by the organizer due to their critical stance on prevailing fiscal regulations. This exchange underscores the prevailing atmosphere of trepidation, yet it also highlights the resilience and determination to persevere despite these challenges (interview 51).
The testimonies provided by multiple participants, as evidenced in the quotes above, align with the significant volume of harassment cases documented by ARCA, the National Association of Public Careers for Development. As of July 22, 2021, federal civil servants had reported 867 instances of harassment within the Bolsonaro administration to ARCA's online platform. This oppressive environment, which coerces civil servants to resign, self-censor their thoughts, and render their professional contributions unseen, signifies not merely a routine policy shift but rather a systematic dismantling of policies with authoritarian undertones.
Due to the aforementioned processes, numerous federal bureaucrats have shifted away from their areas of expertise, seeking refuge in agencies offering less visibility and increased security. Certain institutions, inherently focused on technical rather than political objectives, have emerged as crucial sanctuaries for bureaucrats evading potential repercussions. These establishments have become sought-after havens, particularly for individuals with more flexible career trajectories like EPPGGs. Diplomats, in particular, have shown a heightened preference for roles outside Brasilia, with even lower-ranking C and D positions experiencing unprecedented demand.
As bureaucrats are either actively reshuffled or choose to exit voluntarily, the conditions for policy dismantling become more acute. As highlighted by interviewee 47 at the Ministry of Education, eventually, there is a lack of individuals to uphold a public policy. The absence of individuals possessing the necessary knowledge and institutional memory regarding the policy's functioning, its instruments, and the involved stakeholders leads to a situation where the policy is left unattended. With hardly anyone remaining to manage the policy, this process exacerbates the overall trend towards policy dismantling.
While it is acknowledged that instances of voice, shirking, and sabotage do occur, research participants did share examples of 'resistance'. This often manifested as the deliberate stalling of administrative processes, with the expectation that leadership turnover or the issue itself would eventually fade from the agenda. Additionally, some bureaucrats extended their resistance beyond the confines of their official duties, engaging in opposition activities outside of their work hours. However, even in these instances, fear remained a prevalent theme in the narratives provided by the participants.
This research aimed to contribute to the existing literature on policy dismantling within the context of illiberal populism. In the specific case of Brazil under the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, policy dismantling is not merely a typical outcome of the democratic process but rather reflects an authoritarian approach. This approach involves subjecting federal workers to intimidation, instilling fear, dismantling institutions, and inducing decision-making paralysis. Consequently, many of these workers choose to leave their positions, agencies, the federal government, and even the country. The absence of experienced civil servants, particularly those with expertise in implementing necessary policies, exacerbates the process of policy dismantling.
The paper aims to contribute to the experimental results outlined by Guedes-Neto & Peters (2021). While civil servants typically tend to avoid involvement in undemocratic initiatives, they may find themselves less capable or willing to resist authoritarian pressures. Instances of shirking and sabotage could decrease in scenarios where bureaucratic entities are intimidated or when exit strategies, in their diverse manifestations, are viable alternatives.
The study further complements the results of Sabourin et al. (2020), suggesting that bureaucratic adaptation could be limited to either the minority individuals who were excluded by their peers or to the newcomers who are being introduced to a new policy domain and thus lack a clear understanding of the ongoing dismantling process.
In Brazil's 2021 federal government, senior political positions are relatively low-paying compared to the private sector, especially considering Brasilia's high cost of living. The simplest solution would be to appoint civil servants who already receive a base salary. However, due to Bolsonaro and his ministers' lack of trust in the established bureaucracy, senior positions are predominantly filled by military personnel and members of the evangelical church. This raises the question of the fate of the bureaucracy, which continues to be reshuffled and pressured to align with the new administration's agenda, often resulting in requests for key figures to resign.
