Certain strains of coronaviruses have the ability to infect humans, leading to severe respiratory illnesses. Among these, SARS-CoV-2 is the specific virus responsible for causing COVID-19, a disease initially identified in Wuhan, located in the Hubei province of the People's Republic of China, on December 1, 2019. The first documented case of this disease was officially reported on December 31 of the same year, marking the beginning of a global health crisis. By March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the situation a pandemic, as the virus rapidly spread to numerous countries. As of the current writing, there have been over 2.4 million confirmed cases across 213 countries, resulting in more than 163,000 deaths worldwide. In Brazil, the first confirmed case emerged on February 25, 2020, with a subsequent rise in the number of affected individuals across various states. Presently, the country has reported over 40,000 confirmed cases with a mortality rate of 6.3%.
Statistics indicate that 80% of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 do not necessitate hospitalization, with only 20% requiring hospitalization, and among them, a mere 15% necessitate intensive care. Consequently, health care regulatory agencies in various countries are implementing measures to alleviate the strain on beds, equipment, and healthcare professionals essential for combating the pandemic. Furthermore, global class entities and professional associations have issued guidelines to direct the management of COVID-19 patients [3-5]. Notably, in Brazil, the Brazilian Association of Cardiorespiratory Physiotherapy and Physiotherapy in Intensive Care (ASSOBRAFIR) has published a range of recommendations on its website to combat COVID-19 [3].
In the intensive care setting, Brazilian physical therapists are at the forefront of advanced respiratory support, guided by the best available scientific evidence. However, the novel infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 presents an unprecedented challenge to researchers and healthcare professionals worldwide. The emergence of COVID-19 only a few months ago has led to its rapid global spread, leaving insufficient time for the development of clinical trials or systematic reviews to inform interventions. Treatment recommendations have been formulated based on the experiences of countries grappling with high case numbers of COVID-19, insights from publications on the management of other coronaviruses like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and research on ARDS.
Due to the heightened risk of contamination, notable distinctions exist between the general intensive care setting and an ICU designated for COVID-19 patients. In the latter, it is imperative for healthcare professionals to utilize personal protective equipment (PPE) such as long-sleeved gowns, gloves, masks with high filtration capacity (N95 or FFP2), caps, and face shields or goggles. Despite their crucial role in safeguarding against infection, these protective devices can lead to discomfort and potentially induce skin issues, particularly from prolonged mask usage. Moreover, the prevalence of mechanically ventilated patients with severe respiratory distress is notably elevated. Spontaneously breathing patients may swiftly deteriorate, necessitating intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation, often spanning 2 to 3 weeks. Consequently, the vast majority of patients are either receiving oxygen therapy or undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, underscoring the critical need for intensive physical therapy in this patient population.
The progression of the disease is marked by significant hypoxemia, stemming from various pathophysiological mechanisms affecting the ventilation-perfusion ratio. Generally, the use of low-flow oxygen therapy devices like nasal catheters and non-rebreathing masks with reservoir bags is recommended to minimize aerosol dispersion, given the high contagion risk through virus-laden droplets. Implementing high flow nasal oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation, even in optimal biosafety conditions, raises concerns regarding risk-benefit assessment. In the context of invasive mechanical ventilation, precautions such as employing a closed suction system, a heat and moisture exchanger filter near the patient's airway, and a barrier filter at the end of the expiratory branch of the ventilation circuit are crucial to prevent aerosol dispersion. Embracing a protective ventilation strategy involves applying volumes and pressures that prevent alveolar hyperdistention, alongside appropriate positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels. The utilization of the ARDSnet's "PEEP Table" for COVID-19 patients is contentious due to severe hypoxemia in some individuals with limited respiratory system compliance, rendering them unresponsive to PEEP adjustments. Conversely, unwarranted PEEP elevation can strain the right ventricle and exacerbate lung perfusion issues, necessitating individualized PEEP adjustments, ideally through a decremental titration protocol. The prone position is commonly employed for patients with compromised gas exchange, albeit with associated risks and contraindications that mandate careful implementation by trained personnel, considering variable patient responsiveness. Given the potential for intensive care unit-acquired weakness in ventilated patients over extended periods, early mobilization and therapeutic exercises warrant attention. Physiotherapists, integral members of the multidisciplinary team, play crucial roles in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, tracheal intubation assistance, and patient transport on mechanical ventilation, tasks that present unique challenges in the context of COVID-19.
The role of the intensive care physiotherapist in the context of COVID-19 extends beyond the examples mentioned earlier. It is imperative that the therapeutic approach is tailored to each individual patient. This necessitates frequent evaluations and reassessments, demanding significant attention and effort from the healthcare professionals involved. The actions taken by physiotherapists can significantly impact the prognosis of patients. During a single 12-hour shift, physiotherapists may need to perform a multitude of procedures in the ICU or COVID Emergency, including assisting with intubations, multiple pronations and returning patients to the supine position, conducting various monitoring assessments, titrating PEEP levels, adjusting mechanical ventilation, performing alveolar recruitments, facilitating weaning from mechanical ventilation, assisting with extubations, and participating in cardiopulmonary resuscitations, among other tasks. Given the respiratory severity of patients and the constant risk of contamination, the work environment in this setting is notably more physically and emotionally taxing than usual. However, the pandemic has underscored the crucial role of physiotherapists in intensive care, leading to increased recognition within the community and among healthcare managers.
