The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, leading to a global pandemic, was initially documented in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019. While the virus can manifest with mild symptoms, it also has the potential to result in severe complications, including fatalities. Transmission primarily occurs through aerosol droplets, with an estimated incubation period ranging from 2 to 14 days, during which infected individuals pose a high risk of spreading the virus to others. Endodontists face a heightened risk of exposure to COVID-19 compared to other healthcare professionals due to the nature of their work, which often involves the generation of aerosols and the provision of urgent care for patients experiencing conditions such as symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, acute apical abscess, and traumatic dental injuries. Consequently, this critical review delves into the considerations surrounding endodontic care during a pandemic, emphasizing the urgent need for treatment in emergency situations and outlining the necessary precautions to mitigate risks for both practitioners and patients seeking relief from their clinical pain.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), was initially identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 [1]. Since its emergence, it has escalated into a global public health emergency [2], prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. While most cases of COVID-19 in humans result in mild symptoms, in certain instances, the infection can lead to severe complications and fatalities [3].
The disease is transmitted through aerosol droplets [4] and has an estimated incubation period of 2 to 14 days [5]. It is understood that individuals who are asymptomatic or in the virus's incubation phase can still transmit the infection to others [5].
The American Dental Association (ADA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise oral health professionals to exercise extreme caution and restrict dental procedures to emergency situations [6,7]. This caution is warranted due to the role of aerosols in the transmission of COVID-19 and other viral infections, placing dentists and other dental professionals at high risk of exposure [8].
The aerosols generated by dental instruments can linger in the air and on surfaces for extended periods [9]. While the operator may remain unharmed if adequately protected during treatment, the air continues to be contaminated, posing a potential risk to operators once they remove their personal protective equipment (PPE) and for subsequent patients [10].
Patients presenting with non-urgent oral conditions are advised to refrain from visiting dental offices temporarily [11]. Furthermore, given the evolving understanding of this novel disease, dental facilities must be equipped to recognize potential cases of COVID-19 infection and promptly direct individuals with suspected, confirmed, or a history of COVID-19 to suitable healthcare facilities for further evaluation and treatment [12].
During the ongoing pandemic, it is imperative to minimize face-to-face consultations to mitigate the risk of infection, prompting the exploration of teleodontology as a viable alternative for dentists to assess treatment needs and ensure ongoing care [13,14], particularly for individuals afflicted with COVID-19 or those suspected of being infected [14]. Given the current epidemic situation, it is crucial to approach every patient as potentially carrying the virus, as the clinical manifestations of the disease can vary, potentially leading to dentists unknowingly treating patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 infections. Consequently, all dental practices must reassess their infection control protocols, engineering controls, and supply chains to adapt to these evolving circumstances [12]. Hence, it is essential to regard every patient as potentially infected with the virus and for all dental facilities to revisit their infection control measures, engineering controls, and supply chains [12].
In light of the aforementioned points, this critical review seeks to provide insights into dental care during the pandemic, focusing on endodontic care. The urgent nature of endodontic issues underscores the essential need for timely treatment.
Research on COVID-19 has extensively explored critical facets such as clinical severity, transmission patterns, and treatment modalities globally since the onset of the pandemic. Despite these efforts, a consensus on the specific dental treatment protocols for individuals afflicted with COVID-19 remains elusive.
It is crucial for dentists, particularly endodontists, to implement necessary precautions to safeguard themselves [2,13] and uphold the well-being of patients within the dental setting. Merely relying on protective measures does not guarantee the prevention of cross-contamination among patients [13,16].
Endodontists face a heightened risk of COVID-19 exposure in comparison to other healthcare professionals due to the generation of aerosols in their work and the essential nature of providing care to patients experiencing dental pain. Furthermore, the close and extended face-to-face interactions between patients and dentists during endodontic procedures significantly elevate the potential for cross-infection [4,17].
Protection guidelines for dental care during the COVID-19 pandemic are currently being developed, with a focus on categorizing patients based on their health status and carefully weighing the risks and benefits associated with essential procedures [18]. The prevailing consensus in existing literature suggests a preference for deferring elective dental treatments in favor of prioritizing emergency care [12,19]. This approach is particularly crucial given the potential for endodontic infections to result in significant pain, with endodontic emergencies being recognized as a significant subset of dental emergencies [2].
The spectrum of clinical conditions classified as endodontic emergencies encompasses symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, acute apical abscess, and traumatic dental injuries [4]. In a study examining dental emergencies amidst the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, Yu et al. [2] noted that exclusively dental emergency cases were directed to hospitals through online health consultations. Their analysis revealed that a majority of these emergencies stemmed from endodontic issues (50.6%), specifically symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, acute apical abscess, and traumatic dental injuries. Additionally, Bai et al. [11] observed a notable increase in the frequency of endodontic emergencies and the proportion of patients experiencing acute pain in 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019.
Emergency dental care for a COVID-19 positive patient may be essential, yet there remains a lack of consensus regarding dental treatment protocols for infected individuals [15]. It is advised against providing care in a primary dental setting due to the classification of COVID-19 patients as posing a level-three biosafety risk, indicating that procedures involving microbes could potentially lead to severe or even fatal diseases through airborne transmission [20]. In such scenarios, hospitals are deemed more suitable for treatment, offering enhanced air circulation to minimize health risks for healthcare professionals [15,21].
Yang et al. (2016) and Ather et al. (2012) propose that three straightforward assessments should be integrated into standard practice. The primary and most crucial assessment involves obtaining the patient's medical history, ideally conducted remotely through phone or video consultations. This approach allows healthcare providers to ascertain whether the individual has been in contact with confirmed cases, exhibits symptoms indicative of COVID-19 infection, or has previously contracted the disease.
Ensuring the patient's temperature is checked prior to entering the dental office is crucial, followed by conducting a rapid test within the office premises to confirm the presence of infection [12,16]. This step is paramount in containing the spread of the virus and minimizing waiting times, enabling prompt intervention for negative cases [4].
In cases where rapid tests yield inconclusive or positive results, it is advisable to delay care and direct the patient to a physician or healthcare professional for further testing to verify the presence of COVID-19 and guarantee appropriate treatment and clinical isolation [12,16]. The prevailing method for COVID-19 screening involves the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test. Nonetheless, as noted by Sharma et al. [4], this method relies on expensive facilities, skilled personnel, and typically requires a longer processing time.
Research has demonstrated promising outcomes in the testing of coronavirus diagnosis using saliva, including techniques like loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [22,23] and microfluidic RT-PCR devices, such as Lab-on-a-chip tests [1].
According to Yu et al. (2), reducing care time and controlling exposure to the virus are two pertinent strategies to mitigate the risk of contamination during endodontic treatment. The most recent guidelines concerning the utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE) for dental emergencies advocate for the use of N95 disposable masks, goggles, disposable gloves and caps, shoe protection, face shields, and cloaks (15, 19). However, in the context of endodontic emergency care for COVID-19 positive patients, the recommendation emphasizes comprehensive protection for the face and eyes against aerosols. This involves the utilization of full face masks equipped with air purifiers, offering five to ten times greater protection compared to N95 masks (15).
In terms of radiological examination, it is advisable to restrict pre-treatment radiographs to extra-oral techniques exclusively, as intraoral radiography has the potential to trigger vomiting and/or cough reflexes [24]. Additionally, computed tomography presents itself as a viable alternative, albeit at a considerable expense [2].
Another suggested preoperative measure involves rinsing the patient's mouth with hydrogen peroxide and/or povidone-iodine to reduce the viral load in saliva [18,19]. However, the efficacy of using 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate in this context is still lacking stronger scientific support [18].
Isolation barriers, such as dykes or rubber sheets, are recommended for use during clinical care in endodontics. While these barriers may not completely prevent aerosol diffusion on their own, they have been shown to significantly decrease or even eliminate the presence of salivary components in the aerosol [2, 12].
For cases involving vital pulp or pulpitis, pulpotomy or pulp capping can effectively reduce treatment duration [2]. In COVID-19 patients, following the initial emergency pulpectomy or pulpotomy, definitive treatment should be delayed until the patient has recovered, which should be a minimum of three days after symptom resolution [7]. However, it might be advisable to postpone this procedure for at least a month [15], given the uncertainty surrounding the duration of viral activity in patients [25]. Furthermore, single file systems present an alternative in endodontic treatment to streamline clinical procedures [26] and mitigate the risk of contamination during resterilization [2].
The post-care period necessitates patient care, supervision, and environmental disinfection procedures [18]. Waste management should be conducted safely, with waste conditioned in impermeable bags resistant to rupture and leakage, and stored in closed containers until collection by specialized services [18].
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to notable shifts in biosafety protocols, resulting in heightened emphasis on personal protective equipment (PPE) and the acquisition of additional equipment like thermometers within dental practices. Consequently, these changes have substantially escalated the overall costs associated with dental treatments [27].
The primary recommendations emphasize that endodontic treatment should be reserved for patients experiencing clinical pain conditions. In the context of COVID-19 patients, the guidance suggests that care should not be administered in a traditional dental setting but rather in a hospital environment.
The primary obstacle at present lies in the creation of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Dentists must not only concentrate on dental care and minimizing risks but also remain attuned to the psychological well-being of their patients. Future research endeavors should explore strategies aimed at curtailing aerosol transmission and diminishing the likelihood of COVID-19 contamination.
