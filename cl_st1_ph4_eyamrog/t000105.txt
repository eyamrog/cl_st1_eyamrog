ABSTRACT 
Background: A population study is an important tool that can be used to understand the actual 
epidemiological scenario of the Covid-19 in different territories, identify its magnitude, 
understand its transmission dynamics, and its demographic, geographical, and social 
distribution.  
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and dynamics of SARS-CoV-
2 infection in the population of two Brazilian cities during the pandemic first wave and 
subsequent socioeconomic and health effects.  
Materials & methods: This paper described the methodological procedures adopted and the 
prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population. A household survey was conducted

between October and December 2020, in two historic cities of Brazil's mining region. Anti-
SARS-CoV-2 antibody was detected using the Wondfo® rapid test. The face-to-face interview 
consisted of administration of a questionnaire containing registration data, sociodemographic 
and economic variables, living habits, general health condition, mental health, sleep habits, and 
eating and nutrition.  
Results: We evaluated 1,762 residents, of which 764 (43.4%) were in Mariana and 998 (56.6%) 
in Ouro Preto. For both cities, 51.9% of the interviewees were female, with a predominance of 
the age range 35 to 59 years old (47.2%). The prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was 
5.5% in all cities, 6.2% in Ouro Preto, and 4.7% in Mariana. The prevalence was similar 
between cities (P>0.05). 
Conclusion: The study was effective in verifying the seroprevalence of infection by the virus 
and its findings will enable further analyses of the health conditions of the population related 
to social isolation and the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION 
The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infectious agent causing COVID-19, led 
the declaration by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020 that the disease was a 
global public health emergency. Worldwide, the speed of spread and the risk of collapse of 
health services have posed ongoing challenges for governments, including the new waves of 
the disease [1-3]. 
In Brazil, the federal government's neglect and mismanagement in articulation of actions 
to pandemic control has led many municipalities to make important epidemiological 
surveillance decisions, in isolation, to avoid the spread of the virus in their territories. In this 
context, the difficulties inherent in the diagnosis and notification process, scarcity of human 
resources in the health services and epidemiological surveillance sectors, and lack of diagnostic 
tests have made it extremely difficult to understand the actual situation with respect to the 
frequency of both the disease and the infection [4-7]. 
Other difficulties related specifically to the disease include: the greater probability that 
only people with severe symptoms seek health care services and undergo diagnostic tests, the 
high percentage of infected people with mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic, and the 
social determination of the disease itself [5-7]. These factors can interfere with the dynamics of 
transmission, giving rise to underreporting, and the masking of the actual COVID-19 data.

Therefore, it is extremely relevant to assess the viral circulation situation at the local level, 
especially in smaller cities, where resources are even more scarce.  
Thus, a population study is an important tool that can be used to understand the actual 
epidemiological scenario of the disease in different territories, identify its magnitude, 
understand its transmission dynamics, and its demographic, geographical, and social 
distribution. It allows for the construction of valid indicators capable of describing the 
prevalence 
of 
the 
infection 
and 
predicting 
the 
risk 
of 
disease. 
Therefore, 
immunochromatographic tests for antibody detection represent an important tool for 
epidemiological surveillance services enabling the identification and interruption of the virus 
transmission chain, subsidizing the health surveillance actions that aim to increase monitoring 
and individual care, such as the adoption of prevention measures [8-10]. 
Therefore, a seroepidemiological survey that aimed to determine the prevalence and 
dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of two medium-sized Brazilian cities, in 
the Inconfidentes region, and the subsequent socioeconomic and health effects, was conducted. 
This paper describes the methodological procedures adopted and estimated the prevalence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population studied. 
 
METHODS 
Study design 
In this population-based serological study, a household survey was conducted in two 
historic cities of Brazil's mining region, between October and December 2020, during the 
pandemic first wave. The survey was carried out in three stages, with intervals of 21 days, in 
which different census sectors were evaluated in each stage.  
The study design followed the recommendations of the seroepidemiological investigation 
protocol for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the World Health Organization [11]. All the procedures 
adopted by this study, followed the Declaration of Helsinki and the Brazilian guidelines and 
standards for research involving humans. 
 
Study location 
Mariana and Ouro Preto are two neighboring, medium-sized cities located in the Serra do 
Espinhaço, a central-southern region of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais (Figure 1), known 
as the Iron Quadrangle. This metallurgical area is considered to be the largest national producer 
of iron ore. Since these cities have historical, sociodemographic, and geographical 
characteristics that are different from other Brazilian municipalities, and further, since surveys

conducted in other regions of Brazil may not reflect the real prevalence of infection in the 
resident population, it is important to understand the dynamics of the epidemic locally. 
Mariana was founded in 1696 and is considered to be the first village of Minas Gerais. It 
has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.742. The main economic activity is iron ore 
extraction, a strong generator of jobs, and public revenue [12,13]. 
Ouro Preto was founded in 1711 and in 1720, it was chosen as the capital of the new 
provincia of Minas Gerais [14]. It has a HDI of 0.741. The main economic activities of the 
municipality revolve around the mining and metallurgical industries, tourism, and services, 
especially those related to the Federal Institution of Higher Education which is based in the 
city. These generate high population mobility due to the flow of workers and students [12].

Study population and sample 
Residents in permanent households in the urban areas of the cities of Ouro Preto and 
Mariana, aged 18 years or older, were considered eligible for this study. According to data from 
the 2010 demographic census, there were 44,569 and 33,902 inhabitants, distributed in 17,753 
and 14,078 households, in Ouro Preto and Mariana, respectively [12]. The protocols adopted 
and described below were identical for both the municipalities.

Sample size calculation 
The sample size calculation was based on the population estimate for each city, taking 
into consideration a confidence level of 95%, a design effect equal to 1.5, and the parameters 
presented in Table 1, which also shows the sample distribution by stage of survey. Considering 
the losses resulting from refusals, absence of residents selected for the study, and the existence 
of closed households during the visit, a percentage of 20% of recomposition was added to the 
sample size in each city.

A three-stage conglomerate sampling design was adopted: census sector (selected for 
stages 1, 2, and 3 of survey, randomly and without replacement), households (selected from a 
systematic sampling process), and residents (one resident selected randomly, using the 
“Sorteador de Nomes®” applicative) [15]. 
 
Training the data collection team 
The data collection team was composed of researchers, interviewers, and phlebotomists. 
The interviewers were recruited from the academic environment, with those interested being 
students who were enrolled regularly in undergraduate or graduate courses. The candidates 
underwent interviews in which their availability and interest were evaluated. After the selection, 
the students received a digital document, a video that explained the research objectives. 
The interviewers were subdivided into teams coordinated by the six researchers. Each 
team received online training conducted by the coordinators/researchers, in which the project 
objectives and data collection methodology were addressed, and the interview questionnaire 
was disseminated. Subsequently, face-to-face training sessions for interviewers were conducted 
at the Medical School of the Federal University of Ouro Preto, on the use of the digital

questionnaire (Appendix 1) and how to approach the interviewees, ethical aspects, and 
biosafety during data collection. 
During the face-to-face training, the research team and medical infectologist responsible 
for the team's biosafety were present. The health monitoring of the interviewers was conducted 
through periodic evaluation, prior to the beginning of each stage of the survey, using health 
questionnaires associated with the results of serological testing (immunochromatography 
reaction). 
The phlebotomists also received digital documents and videos explaining the 
importance of their work and the research methodology. In a second session, these professionals 
were trained, in person, by a nurse who addressed the venipuncture technique for blood 
collection and biosafety measures. 
The videos that explained the theme of the project were also disseminated to community 
health agents who were responsible for guiding the coordinators in the census sectors of the 
areas of greatest social vulnerability, which were randomly selected in the first stage of the 
survey in both cities. All the videos were created in a language accessible to the target audience 
and addressed the role of each professional in the data collection team. 
 
Data Collection 
The data collection process included listing and approaching households, recruiting 
participants, the collection of venous blood, and interviews. The activities were carried out 
during weekends (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), aiming to enhance the participation of 
residents who worked during the week and increasing the representativeness of this population 
group. 
In the week prior to the collection, the research team carried out the enrollment of 
households in pre-selected census sectors and developed plans to raise awareness in the 
population through the distribution of folders and posters in public places as well as the 
dissemination of the survey via local radio stations, social media (Instagram and Facebook), the 
University TV, WhatsApp groups, and religious celebrations. 
An informative folder was attached in the door to randomly selected household, 
indicating that that household had been selected for the collection which would take place 
during the weekend. Taking into consideration the possibility of loss (refusal or closed 
household), an informative folder was attached to the neighbors on the left and right of the 
selected household (Appendix 2).

On the data collection days, the entire field team met at a support spot, where they 
donned personal protection equipment, received general instructions and were informed about 
the census sectors would be visited that day. The teams then moved to the census sectors where 
each interviewer approached the household and under the supervision of the researchers, 
selected the adult to be interviewed. In the case of a closed household, the absence of the 
resident selected or in the case of a refusal, the team would approach the neighbor to the right 
and, in the case of failure there, the household to the left of the one selected. If the refusal 
persisted, or if there were no residents in the house, the team moved on to the next house 
selected. There was no return to closed homes. 
After the presentation of the research process and the participant's acceptance, they were 
asked to sign the informed consent form and the phlebotomist collected the venous blood with 
a venipuncture in the antecubital fossa region, the participant seated, and the arm supported on 
an appropriate support. For the blood collection, a 7.5 mL S-Monovette® (Sarstedt) serum gel 
tube was used to obtain the serum which was used for the COVID-19 rapid test and the other 
biochemical analyses. A 2.7 mL S-Monovette® (Sarstedt) collection tube containing sodium 
fluoride/EDTA was used to obtain whole blood for the molecular biology analyses. 
At the end of the blood collection process, the interviewer commenced the face-to-face 
interview, which lasted between 30 to 45 minutes, varying according to the perception and 
dexterity of the interviewee in answering the questions. Data collection was conducted using 
the DataGoal® application that was installed on the tablets to capture the geographic 
coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the interviewee's home. 
All the recommendations of the national protocols to fight the new coronavirus were 
adopted, with an emphasis on hand washing, the use of personal protection equipment (apron, 
cap, disposable surgical mask, and goggles), changing every shift, approaching the research 
participants preferably in the peridomestic area and, when this was not possible, in a large, 
ventilated room [16]. 
The interviewers kept a minimum distance of 1.5 m from the interviewees, and physical 
contact was restricted to only the moment of biological material collection.  
 
Instruments and Data Collection 
The face-to-face interview consisted of the administration of a questionnaire, in electronic 
format, that contained registration data, sociodemographic and economic variables, life habits, 
general health condition, mental health, sleep habits, and food and nutrition (Appendix 1), as 
follows: 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2720

Registration data: sex, individual taxpayer registry (CPF) number, filiation, date of birth, 
telephone number, and symptoms in the last 15 days. 
Sociodemographic and economic variables: race/color, marital status, filiation, 
education, occupation, and family income prior to and during the pandemic. 
Lifestyle: routine activities and behaviors, sun exposure, lifestyle, participation in 
religious celebrations prior to and during the pandemic 
- Health conditions: Self-perception of health, presence of physical pain, use of 
medications/supplements, weight, height, and perception of COVID-19. 
- Mental health: Assessment of anxiety and depression symptoms using the General 
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) [17] and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [18] scales. 
- Sleep habits: Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
(PSQI) scale [19]. 
- Food and nutrition: Daily frequency of food consumption, perceived food prices, 
comfort food consumption, food accessibility, and availability of food at home, adapted from 
the research on Surveillance of Chronic Diseases by Telephone Inquiry - VIGITEL, from the 
Ministry of Health [20]. 
The questions about personal information were aimed at obtaining information for the 
registration and reporting of serological test results to the Ministry of Health, through the 
electronic system of epidemiological surveillance for notifications to the Unique Health System 
(e-SUS VE), to assist in the monitoring and analysis of the epidemiological situation of 
COVID-19 in the municipalities. The other questions assessed the living conditions of the 
population, allowing us to perform a situational analysis of the determinants of health. 
Data collection was performed using offline devices and, at the end of the day, in a place 
with a stable internet connection, the devices were synchronized and the information that was 
collected, was sent to the storage cloud of the software used (DataGoal®). The devices were 
then loaded for use on the next collection day. 
 
Laboratory Analysis - immunochromatography test for antibody detection 
At the end of each shift (morning and afternoon), the blood samples were checked, packed 
in a thermal box, and transported to the Epidemiology Laboratory of the Medical School of the 
Federal University of Ouro Preto for processing and storage by the technical team. In the 
laboratory, the serum tubes were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15 min, and a yield of 
approximately 3 mL of serum per sample was obtained. Then, the serum was aliquoted in 
different polypropylene tubes and portioned as follows: one tube with a 50 μL aliquot for testing 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2720

COVID-19 and the rest in aliquots of approximately 500 μL to 1000 μL for use in the other 
biochemical analyses. These were stored in a freezer at -80ºC until required. The EDTA tube 
was stored in a -20 °C freezer for the subsequent extraction of the genetic material. 
Serological screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was performed by trained 
professionals using immunochromatographic reaction-based tests. The diagnostic One Step 
COVID-2019 Test (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech®, China) was used to determine IgM/IgG 
antibodies in whole blood, serum, or human plasma, qualitatively, without distinguishing the 
immunoglobulin type [21]. 
In this study, according to the manufacturer's instructions, 10 μL of serum and three drops 
of the buffer solution were added to the reaction well in the test device. The sample was 
absorbed by capillary action and mixed with the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-dye conjugate, which 
flowed through the pre-coated membrane. In cases where the level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 
in the sample was at or above the cut-off range (minimum detection limit of the test), antibodies 
that were bound to the antigen-dye conjugate, were captured by the human anti-IgG antibody 
and the anti-μ-chain antibody complex and immobilized in the test region of the device, 
producing a colored test band, indicating a positive result. 
When the level of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody in the sample was zero or below the cut-
off, there was no visible colored band formed in the test region of the device, indicating a 
negative result. As a control for the procedure, a colored line appeared in the control region, 
indicating that the test was working correctly. The minimum waiting time for the reading was 
15 min, while the maximum time that was allowed was 20 min. 
According to the manufacturer’s validation data, the sensitivity of the One Step COVID-
2019 Test (Wondfo®) was 86.43% (95% CI: 82.58%–89.58%) and the specificity was 99.57% 
(95% CI: 97.92%–99.92%). It is important to note that the negative results did not exclude a 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the positive results cannot be used as absolute evidence of the 
presence of SARS-CoV-2. These results only indicate a previous exposure to the infectious 
agent [19]. 
 
Issuing and Delivery of Reports 
After the serological testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a report was issued and 
sent to each study participant. The reports served as information for the participants and teams 
of the COVID-19 Confrontation Committees in the municipalities. 
The reports were issued by professionals from the laboratory team, using Microsoft 
Excel® spreadsheets, which contained information provided by the participant (full name, date 
SciELO Preprints - This document is a preprint and its current status is available at: https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.2720

of birth, and contact phone number) and the results of the serological test (reactive or non-
reactive). In addition, the reports contained information regarding the interpretation of the tests 
and the precautions to be taken, as well as the contacts of the Health Surveillance Departments 
of each city, so that the study participants could ask questions and receive guidance on the 
procedures to be adopted, especially those whose results were positive. 
The reports were issued within seven days after collection of the data, in a pdf file, via 
WhatsApp messaging application. Participants who did not use the application, received the 
results by telephone and, for those who did not have a telephone, the report was delivered to 
the home. 
Finally, the Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets with the participants' data and test results 
were forwarded to the Mariana and Ouro Preto Health Secretariats for case monitoring and 
management. 
 
Database consolidation and consistency and sample weight 
At the end of the collection period, the database was consolidated by merging the three 
stages of the survey conducted in the two cities. A consistency analysis was then carried out to 
verify the consistency of the data, the presence of typing errors, or the absence of data. The 
sample weight of each selected unit (census tract, household, and individual) was calculated 
separately for each city, taking into consideration the inverse of the probability of selection, 
according to the sampling plan of the study and according to data from the 2010 demographic 
census. An adjustment was applied to compensate for the loss of interviews due to non-response 
and the weight of the household and the selected resident was calibrated, so that the population 
totals by sex and age group (18 to 29 years, 30 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, and 60 years and 
older) were consistent with the 2019 population projections (DATASUS) [22]. 
 
Data Analysis 
The relative frequencies of the sociodemographic variables were estimated for each 
stage of the survey (1, 2, and 3) and for all cities. The prevalence rate of seropositivity for 
SARS-Cov-2 and the confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated for each stage of the survey, 
per city, and for both cities. Pearson's Chi-square test was used to compare the proportions of 
the sociodemographic variables and the prevalence of seropositivity for SARS-Cov-2 between 
each stage of the survey. The weighting factors were incorporated into the analyses using the 
svy command of the Stata® software, version 12.0. A significance level of 95% (P≤0.05) was 
adopted.

Figure 2 - Distribution of the census sectors included in the survey, in the urban areas of the 
study cities. 
 
The global prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.5%, being 6.2% in Ouro Preto, 
and 4.7% in Mariana.  
 
DISCUSSION 
The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of Covid-19 present important 
diagnostic challenges and require the adoption of techniques capable of ruling out a possible 
infection, confirming a recent infection, identifying previous infections, and assessing the 
immune response. In this context, it is essential to understand the prevalence of the virus, so 
that containment measures can be adopted appropriately [8,9]. 
Since most patients develop antibodies only in the second week after symptom onset, the 
use of rapid tests for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in clinical practice is not 
recommended by the World Health Organization [23,24]. However, the use of these tests in 
population studies is relevant, because it allows the identification of a previous exposure to 
infection and the knowledge of the distribution and characteristics of the population that had 
contact with the virus, indicating geographical areas with higher viral circulation [8,9].

Immunochromatographic tests for antibody detection allow for frequent testing because they 
are inexpensive and easy to perform, making them useful in limiting the spread of the disease. 
However, these tests should not replace reference diagnostic tests, such as RT-PCR [8-10,25]. 
A review study on the efficacy of using immunochromatographic antibody tests in 
seroprevalence surveys showed that there was a significant increase in the accuracy of the 
diagnosis of COVID-19 over the first three weeks of symptom onset, with 30% in the first 
week, 70% in the second week, and over 90% in the third week. The authors also highlighted 
the low percentage of false-positive results (2%) observed with these tests [8]. Moreover, it is 
noteworthy that immunochromatographic serology tests perform better when performed with 
serum or plasma samples, especially in relation to diagnostic sensitivity [26]. 
In this sense, we believe that the timing of the collection after exposure is a factor that 
can interfere with the detection of positive cases during serological population studies. This 
may explain the differences in seroprevalence observed between the cities of Mariana and Ouro 
Preto in this study. Nevertheless, it is noted that the prevalence found in these two cities in the 
Inconfidentes region during the months of October to December 2020 was higher than that 
described in a population-based survey conducted in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 
from April 11 to May 11, 2020, which found a prevalence of less than 1% [27]. On the other 
hand, these results are close to those observed in states in the northeastern region of Brazil 
during a national household survey conducted between May 14 and June 7, 2020, which 
demonstrated a high heterogeneity in the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 
different regions of Brazil [28]. 
According to the literature, several factors can explain the differences found in SARS-
CoV-2 infection rates between regions and distinct population groups, such as disparities in the 
stage of infections, low testing, and late detection of cases; divergence in the adoption of control 
strategies, such as restrictions on the movement of people, local sociodemographic and 
socioeconomic characteristics, and environmental and meteorological factors, such as humidity 
and air pollution [4,29]. 
The limitations of our study include the restriction of the sample to two medium-sized 
Brazilian cities, which represent only 12.2% of the Brazilian municipalities. Residents in rural 
areas of the municipalities were excluded from the study. Although the refusal rate was within 
expectations, the response rate of 33.5% was lower than that observed in national surveys 
conducted in Brazil (53-54%) and Spain (60%) [28,30]. In 41.5% of households it was not 
possible to collect information from residents because they were absent.

Other studies linked to this project will be developed to further analyze the health 
conditions of the population studied, related to social isolation and the risk of contamination by 
SARS-CoV-2, as well as the socioeconomic impacts resulting from them. Therefore, in addition 
to estimating the prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population, the findings of 
this study makes it possible to understand the dynamics and profiles of illnesses in the 
population and their possible determinants, contributing to the improvement of health care, both 
in the Unified Health System and in the private network.  
The results will help deepen the knowledge about social inequalities in the study cities, 
favoring the implementation of public policies that minimize inequalities and their impacts on 
health, food, and quality of life of the population. 
 
CONCLUSION 
Despite the inherent limitations in the diagnostic efficacy of the rapid serological test for 
the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, its use proved to be effective in verifying the 
seroprevalence of viral infections in the cities evaluated, allowing researchers to assess the 
circulation of the virus and to determine the percentage of people exposed in the cities, 
providing a basis for public managers to make effective decisions, in a socio-health and 
epidemiological context, to reduce the number of cases and deaths. Furthermore, the findings 
of this study play an important role in providing information with regard the socio-economic 
and health impacts on the population, resulting from social distancing. 
New surveys are needed to understand the pandemic situation in these new phases, 
including, if possible, rapid antigen tests, which were not yet available in the first wave of the 
disease. In addition, genotyping is needed to identify circulating viral strains and behavior in 
the community.
