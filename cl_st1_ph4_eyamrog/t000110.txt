(Holocene diatoms from Xingu river: new records for the Brazilian Amazon and 
Brazil). Present study is the floristic survey and the distribution of diatoms observed in two 
sediment cores of the Xingu river, Pará State, north Brazil, and represents the past ~6,000 cal yr BP. 
Thirty-eight taxa distributed in twenty genera were recorded, among which five were new records 
for Brazil and nineteen new for the Brazilian Amazon. The most representative genus based on 
species number was Gomphonema Ehrenberg with six species. In brief, present new records 
represent a 75% increase in the total number of records for the Brazilian Amazon, and indicates that 
this region has not only been poorly investigated, but also suggests that its biodiversity assessment 
is underestimated. These findings highlight the efficacy of the paleolimnological approach as a tool 
for assessing biodiversity before the human impacts begin to affect the pristine conditions of the 
area. 

Holocene is the most recent interval of Earth history encompassing the present day. Together 
with the Pleistocene series it forms the Quaternary period, and possibly is the most intensively 
studied interval of recent geological time (Suguio 1999). Despite being a relatively short geological 
period, sedimentary evidence from the Holocene are sufficiently well preserved, thus enabling 
comparisons with data of the same nature in current processes (Walkers & Geissman 2009). 

Paleolimnological studies have proved to be a valuable tool for the increase of environmental 
biodiversity and floristic changes reconstructions (e.g. Smol 2008, Bennion & Simpson 2011, 
Davidson & Jeppesen 2013, Wengrat et al. 2018). Moreover, past environmental communities are 
very often the only available source of information when researching biodiversity prior to human 
impacts (Smol 2002, Le Treut et al. 2007). 

Diatoms have been widely used among the biological groups preserved in the sediments, 
because of their taxonomic distinction, abundance, preservation in the sediments, and rapid 
response to environmental changes (Reid 2005, Bennion & Simpson 2011). However, use of 
diatoms to indicate environmental changes requires high taxonomic precision (Birks 1994), since 
misidentifications may modify the interpretation in obtaining reliable data on modern diatom 
biodiversity (Buczko & Magyari 2007, Wetzel & Ector 2014). 

In Brazil, floristic and taxonomical studies of sedimentary diatoms over a long timescale are 
still very scarce. In fact, at the present time there are only four contributions to the subject, a 
floristic survey and the spatial-temporal distribution of diatoms from surface sediments and core 
samples (ca. 90 years) of an urban reservoir located in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (Faustino 
et al. 2016), a study on the water level variations based on the abundance and distribution of two 
diatoms in core samples (~830 years) of a marsh located on the Mutum Island, in the Upper Parana 
river floodplain (Ruwer & Rodrigues 2018),  a study to reconstitute paleoenvironments of the 
lacustrine Pinguela- Palmital- Malvas system during the Holocene (Hermany et al. 2013), and a 
study to infer the paleoecological and paleohydrological changes in five sedimentary cores of 
Itupanema Beach, Pará State (Ribeiro et al. 2010). 

We presently documented the floristic survey and the diatoms distribution over the past ~6.000 
years from two sediment cores of the Xingu river, Pará State, Brazil. The Amazon Basin represents 
about 40% of the national territory, and contains more than 60% of the water available to the 
country (PNRH 2006). Occupying two-fifths of South America and 5% of the Earth surface, the 
Amazon Basin covers a total area of approximately 7 million km², and represents the largest 
drainage basin in the world, thus playing a vital role in maintaining biodiversity (Wetzel et al. 
2011). Within this context, present study aimed at expanding the knowledge of tropical diatoms 
biodiversity before human impacts, and highlighting its biodiversity by providing new records for 
Brazil and the Brazilian Amazon. 

The Xingu river basin, one of the main eastern Amazonian river systems (figure 1 a) has an 
area of 531,250 km² and an average flow between 2,582 and 9,700 m3 s-1. Climate is tropical with 
an average temperature between 25 ºC and 27 ºC (ISA 2012). The Xingu river downstream range is 
a region well known for its atypical river course and diversified morphology known as the Volta 
Grande do Xingu (Xingu Great Bend, Figure 1 c). Near to the mouth, the river shifts to a lowland 
Amazonian river with a single slack water channel under the influence of the tides (Sawakuchi et al. 
2015). Samples used for the present investigation were collected in the lower Xingu river, in a 
floodplain lake (3°12’51.24”S, 52°11’24.25”W) located in the Arapujá island (Volta Grande do 
Xingu), in a Ria area (01°42’32.12”S, 52°16’47.42”W) near to Porto de Moz city. 

During the dry season of 2014, the cores were collected by divers from a deep zone of both 
sites. The location was selected based on the water depth profile coupled with riverbed sediment 
sampling. Divers collected a 122 cm core (XC1-02) from the Arapujá island, and a 362 cm core 
(XC-03) from the Ria, using a 6 m long PVC tube sectioned at 2 cm intervals. Core chronology was 
determined by Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and 14C dating. Two samples for quartz 
OSL dating were collected and prepared in the Luminescence and Gamma Spectrometry Laboratory 
of the Instituto de Geociências at the Universidade de São Paulo. Four samples were collected and 
prepared for 14C dating at the Analytic Radiocarbon Dating in Miami and the Radiocarbon 
Laboratory at the Universidade Federal Fluminense (LAC-UFF). For more details, see Sawakuchi et 
al. (2015). Based on the OSL and 14C dating, the base of the XC1-02 and XC-03 cores 
corresponded to about ~6.000 cal yr BP and 4.000 cal yr. BP, respectively, which covers the end of 
Mid-Holocene and the Late Holocene. 

For diatom analyses, organic matter was oxidized to be removed, using hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2 35%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl 37%), according to standard procedures (Battarbee et al. 
2001). Permanent slides were prepared using Naphrax (R.I. 1.6) as the mounting medium. Optical 
observations, measurements and photomicrographs were taken at 1.000× magnification, with a 
Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus microscope equipped with an Axiocam ERc5s high-resolution digital 
camera. At least 400 valves per slide were counted (Battarbee et al. 2001). Species abundance was 
calculated by dividing the individual species count by the total count expressed as percentages for 
each slide (subsample). Taxonomy and nomenclature followed specific publications (e.g. Lange-
Bertalot 1993, Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 1998, Morales & Manoylov 2006, Garcia 2010, Lange-
Bertalot et al. 2011, Reichardt 2015, Almeida et al. 2015, Tyree & Vaccarino 2016, Costa et al. 
2017b, Bartozek et al. 2018) and the valid names on-line catalog (Fourtanier & Kociolek 2011). 
Classification systems followed Medlin & Kaczmarska (2004) for supra-ordinal taxa and Round et 
al. (1990) for the subordinal ones, with the only exception of genera published after this work. After 
consulting the published literature (books and articles), the new records for Brazil and the Brazilian 
Amazon (Amazons, Amapá, Mato Grosso, western Maranhão, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Acre, and 
Tocatins States) were indicated. Furthermore, morphometric information is provided for the new 
records (M: valve mantle, D: diameter, L: length, W: width, L/W: length/width ratio, S: striae, A: 
areolae, and F: fibulae). Sediment samples are deposited at the “Herbário Científico do Estado 
Maria Eneyda P. Kauffmann Fidalgo” (SP) in the city São Paulo, Brazil (access numbers SP470331 
to SP513834). 

The diatom flora of the Xingu river over the past ~6.000 cal yr BP includes 38 taxa (30 species 
and varieties, and eight at the genus level, distributed in 20 genera). Eight taxa were identified only 
to the genus level because no similar taxon was found in the literature, and they probably represent 
taxonomic novelties. Taxa preceded by one asterisk represent new records for the Brazilian 
Amazon, and those preceded by two asterisks are first citations for Brazil.  All taxa above 
mentioned are listed below. 
 
The species differs from Aulacoseira canadensis (Hustedt) Simonsen (1979: 57) in the shape of 
the ringleist that is very solid and thick at the middle of the column. Another difference is in the 
areolae outline that is small and rounded in Aulacoseira crassipunctata Krammer (Bahls et al. 
2009). It was present in only 2% of the core samples, and had a maximum abundance of 6%. The 
species is present in samples from the Late Holocene, ~2.200 cal. yr BP to ~320 cal. yr BP. This is 
the first record of the species occurrence in Brazil.  

Valves linear-lanceolate, hyaline, with rounded ends. Axial area wide, occupying all the valve 
face. Striae not observed in LM. This taxon resembles Rimoneis inanis M.Garcia (2010) in the 
valve shape, although its valve ends are more pronounced and less rounded. Moreover, Rimoneis sp. 
present smaller valve dimensions (R. inanis, L:17-25 µm, W:2.7-3.3 µm). Currently, the genus 
Rimoneis presents only two species registered in the world, being R. inanis restricted to 
freshwater/brackish waters in sandy beaches of the Lagoa dos Patos lagoon and Guaíba river, 
located in Southern Brazil.  Rimoneis sp. occurred in 5% of the core samples, with maximum 
abundance of 4%. It is present in samples from the Late Holocene, ~3.750 cal. yr BP to 1.450 cal. 
yr BP. 

The population found resembles Staurosira construens Ehrenberg (1843) in its valve outline. 
However, it is distinct by presenting narrower ends. Staurosira sp. was identified in 82% of the core 
samples, and had a maximum abundance of 24%. The species is present in samples from the end of 
the Mid-Holocene, ~6.000 cal. yr BP up to the core top.  

The species was proposed by Almeida et al. (2015) from material collected from the Cachoeira 
da Graça Reservoir (São Paulo state), and according to those authors, S. acidophila is similar to 
Staurosirella confusa E.A.Morales (2005: 54-58), however, there are some clear differences in the 
arrangement and density of the striae (ca. 11 in 10 µm). This species also differs from Staurosirella 
oldenburgiana (Hustedt) E.A.Morales (2005: 118) in the width of the valve center and the presence 
of small areolae. It was reported from 52% of the core samples, reaching 4% maximum abundance. 

The species is present in samples corresponding to the end of the Mid-Holocene, from ~6.000 cal. 
yr BP up to the core top. Current study represents the first report of this species occurrence in the 
Brazilian Amazon. 

This species was identified as Staurosirella cf. acutirostrata (Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot) 
Almeida & Wetzel (2015: 267) due to presenting less tapered extremities and shorter valve length 
(L: 22-36 µm) than the ones described in Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 89, pl. 1, fig. 18-19, pl. 
2) It was reported in 48% of all core samples, thus reaching a 4.3% maximum abundance. The 
species is identified from samples collected toward the end of the Mid-Holocene, from ~5.760 cal. 
yr BP up the core top.  

Staurosirella dubia (Grunow) E.A.Morales & K.M.Manoylov has a similar valve outline when 
compared to Staurosirella pinnata (Ehrenberg) D.M.Williams & Round (1988: 274). However, S. 
dubia differs by having larger valves, lanceolate valve outline in the greater specimens, elliptical in 
the smaller ones, and wider striae (Morales 2010). It was found in 56% of the core samples, 
reaching 6% maximum abundance. Current species were present in samples from the end of the 
Mid-Holocene (~6.000 cal. yr BP) up to the core top. Current survey is the first report of this 
species occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. 

Present species resembles S. dubia (Grunow) Morales & Manoylov, however according to the 
authors S. subcapitata (Frenguelli) E.A.Morales has less lanceolate and silicified valves than the 
second species.  It occurred in 98% of all core, with a maximum abundance of 15%. S. subcapitata 
was identified in all subsamples from the Late Holocene (~4.000 cal. yr BP) up to the core top 
(~300 cal. yr BP). Despite the species was already reported for Brazilian Amazon, in the Negro 
river (Wetzel 2011), the present is to be considered the first publish citation for the Brazilian 
Amazon. 

According to Costa et al. (2017b), the type material of Eunotia camelus Ehrenberg illustrated in 
Reichardt (1995) included a population composed of two different species, a fact that brings some 
confusion regarding the classification of the species. In the southeastern Brazil, most of the 
populations identified as E. camelus actually are Eunotia longicamelus L.F.Costa, D.C.Bicudo & 
C.E.Wetzel. It was reported in 15% of the core samples, and reached 3% maximum abundance. The 
species is found in samples from the early Late Holocene (~1.514 cal. yr BP) to the core top. 

Eunotia longicamelus L.F.Costa, D.C.Bicudo & C.E.Wetzel was established by Costa et al. 
(2017b) on the basis of material gathered from the Ponte Nova Reservoir (Southeastern Brazil). E. 
longicamelus is widely identified and cited as E. camelus Ehrenberg, however, the first species 
shows narrower valves, dorsal margin with two or four major undulations, and less concave ventral 
margin (Costa et al. 2017b). The species was reported from 11% of the core samples, reaching 2.5% 
maximum abundance, and occurring since the end of the Mid-Holocene, from ~5.192 cal. yr BP up 
to the core top. Current survey is the first report of this species occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. 

This variety is quite similar to Eunotia rabenhorstii Cleve & Grunow var. triodon Cleve & 
Grunow (1881: 12a), but, having a single undulation on the dorsal margin is unique for the var. 
monodon Cleve & Grunow (Patrick & Reimer 1966, Costa et al. 2017b). The species was rare, 
occurring in just 2% of the core samples, reaching 1% maximum abundance. It is found in samples 
from the Late Holocene (~408 cal. yr BP). This is the first report of the occurrence of the variety 
monodon in the Brazilian Amazon. 

Eunotia superbidens Lange-Bertalot is very similar to Eunotia praerupta Ehrenberg (1843: 
414), regarding their size, but differ in the presence of a single undulation on the dorsal margin, and 
the greater striae density. The species also differs from Eunotia bigibba Kützing (1849: 6) mainly 
by the more depressed undulations and its larger valves. This species was rarely met during the 
present investigation, being distributed in 2% of the core samples and reaching 1% maximum 
abundance. It is present in samples from the Late Holocene (~1.514 cal. yr BP). Current 
investigation is the first report of the presence of the species in the Brazilian Amazon. 

Eunotia sp. resembles Eunotia myrmica Lange-Bertalot (2011), but the latter has narrower and 
cuneate apices, as well as smaller valve dimensions (Pavlov & Levkov 2013: L: 58.8-67 µm). The 
taxon was rarely observed, occurring in 2 % of the core samples and reaching 1% maximum 
abundance. It is present in samples from the Late Holocene (~811 cal. yr BP). 

Present species resembles Placoneis constans (Husted) Cox var. symmetrica (Hustedt) 
Kobayasi in its valves and rostrate ends. However, P. exigua differs by having larger valves than P. 
constans and presents a central area with a shorter striae surrounded by longer striae (Bartozek et al. 
2018). The species was reported for 6% of the core samples, thus reaching 1.5% maximum 
abundance. This taxon is met in samples from the end of the Mid-Holocene to the core top (~5.479 
cal. yr BP to the present day).  

The species was found in 21% of the core samples surveyed, and reached 2.5% maximum 
abundance. The species is found in samples from the end of the Mid-Holocene to the core top 
(~5.479 cal. yr BP to the present day). Current study represents the first report of this species 
occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. 

Based on the valve outline, Gomphonema acuminatum C.G.Ehrenberg is extremely similar to 
Gomphonema brebissonii F.T.Kützing (1849: 66) and Gomphonema coronatum C.G.Ehrenberg 
(1841: 211). However, G. brebissoni has a well reduced apical inflation, and G. coronatum a 
smaller inflation near the headpole (Kociolek 2011). Occurrence of G. acuminatum was rare, since 
it is found in only 2% of the core samples, reaching 1% maximum abundance. The species is found 
in samples from the Late Holocene up to the core top (~1.757 cal. yr BP to the present day). Present 
research is the first report of this species occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. 

Dimensions of Gomphonema brasiliensoides Metzeltin, Lange-Bertalot & García-Rodriguez 
are greater than those of Gomphonema brasiliense Grunow (Metzeltin et al. 2005: L: 24.0-60.0 μm, 
W: 6.6-9 μm and L: 22.0-44.0 μm, W: 5.5-6.7 μm; respectively). It was found in 13% of the core 
samples and reached 2% maximum abundance. The species is identified from samples from the end 
of the Mid-Holocene to the core top (~3.774 cal. yr BP to the present day). Present investigation 
represents the first report of this species occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. 

It differs from Gomphonema hawaiiense Reichardt (2005: 119) by having smaller valves 
dimensions (L: 24.5-34.0 µm; W: 4.5-6.0 µm and L: 32.6-55.0 μm; W:6.3-9.5 μm respectively). 
(Tremarin et al. 2009) and curved subcapitate apices. The taxon was found in 5% of the core 
samples, reaching 1% maximum abundance. This species is present in samples from the end of the 
Mid-Holocene (~4.345 cal. yr BP). Current investigation represents the first report of this species 
occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. 

Gomphonema pseudosphaerophorum H. Kobayasi has slightly narrower valves than 
Gomphonema sphaerophorum Ehrenberg (1845: 78, Tyree & Vaccarino 2016: W: 8.1-9.4 µm and 
W: 12.8-13.2 µm, respectively). Additionally, G. pseudosphaerophorum has dimly punctate striae 
radiating throughout the valve, whereas G. sphaerophorum has nearly parallel striae at the mid-
valve, becoming radiate toward the apices. Occurrence of representative specimens of this species 
was rare and only found in 2% of the core samples, reaching 1% maximum abundance. It is present 
in samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~456 cal. yr BP). Current study is the first citation 
of the occurrence of this species in Brazil. 

Valves lanceolate to rhombic-lanceolate, apices rostrate, axial area narrow, linear, and slightly 
widened in the central area. Raphe slightly curved. Striae parallel, slightly radiating towards the 
ends. Stigma positioned at the end of the longest central striae.  
This taxon presents morphological features similar to Gomphonema naviculoides W.Smith, 
regarding the valve shape. However, both species differ in valve dimensions and striae density. 
According to Reichardt (2015), G. naviculoides presents  35-45 µm in length, and 7.8-9.5 µm in 
width, with 12-14 striae in 10 µm. Due to the absence of ultrastructural details (SEM), we decided 
to retain Gomphonema sp. as a distinct taxon. It was present in 8% of the core samples, and reached 
2.3% maximum abundance. It occurs during the Late Holocene from ~1.322 cal. yr BP. 

This species was described by Grunow (1880: 21) as Achnanthes exigua and later on 
transferred to Achnanthidium exiguum by Czarnecki (1994: 157). However, according to Taylor et 
al. (2014) the type of A. exiguum have significant morphological differences as compared with 
members of Achnanthidium, suggesting that the transfer based on the structure of the raphe was not 
correct. Due to the presence of morphological features, such as sigmoid raphe, where the distal 
raphe ends curve to the different sides, uniseriate striae, and shape of the valves the species was 
transferred to Gogorevia by Kulikovskiy et al. (2020). The species is present in 5% of all core 
samples, reaching 1.5% maximum abundance. It occurred in the Late Holocene (~1.514 cal. yr BP). 
The species was already reported for Brazilian Amazon, in the Negro river, as Achnanthidium 
exiguum (Grunow) Czarnecki, however, the present is to be considered the first report for the 
country using its correct name. 

This species was described by Hustedt (1952: 392, fig. 99-100) as Cocconeis pulcherrima and 
later on transferred to Achnanthes pulcherrima by Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 18, pl. 69, fig. 
9-14, pl. 70, fig. 1, 4, p. 366, pl. 66, fig. 1-9). However, that transference was considered not valid 
because the basionym was not mentioned (Coste et al. 2010). Due to the presence of a cavum 
(rimmed depression at the valve central area), which is a distinguishing character for species in the 
genus, it was later transferred to Planothidium by Coste et al. (2010). It was present in just 2% of 
the core samples, and reached 1% maximum abundance. It occurred in samples that corresponded to 
the end of the Mid-Holocene (~5.479 cal. yr BP). This is the first record of the presence of this 
species in Brazil using its correct name, and the first citation for the species occurrence in the 
Brazilian Amazon. 

This material is identified as Achnanthes cf. inflata (Kützing) Grunow due to its representative 
specimens show slightly less rounded ends than the ones described by Grunow (1868). However, 
other morphological characteristics coincided with Grunow (1868) original description. Our 
specimens have wider valve ends than Achnanthes inflata var. elata (Leuduger-Fortmorel) Hustedt 
(1937: 206), and differ from Achnanthes coarctata (Brébisson ex W.Smith) Grunow (1880: 20) by 
the presence of a central inflation at the valve margin and by being not constricted as is the latter. 
The species was found in just 2% of the core samples, and reached 1% maximum abundance in 
samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~625 cal. yr BP). This is the first report for the 
Brazilian Amazon. 

Present species resembles Luticola acidoclinata Lange-Bertalot (1996) in its valve outline and 
dimensions (L: 10-30 μm, W: 5.0-8.5 μm). However, Luticola intermedia (Hustedt) Levkov, 
Meltzeltin & A.Palov exhibits a narrow and linear axial area, with 4-5 isolate areolae at the valve 
margin (Levkov et al. 2013). It was present in only 3% of the core samples, and reached 1% 
maximum abundance. The species is present in samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~689 
cal. yr BP). Current inventory is the first report of this species presence in the Brazilian Amazon. 

Caloneis sp. resembles Caloneis sp. Nº. 163/14 in Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 560, pl. 
163, fig. 14). However, the specimens from Xingu river present slightly panduriform valves. 
Further studies are required to confirm if this taxon is a new species. During the present study, the 
taxon was present in 11% of the core samples, and reached 2.5% maximum abundance, occurring in 
samples corresponding to the end of the Mid-Holocene (~5.192 cal. yr BP). 

The population of Diploneis elliptica (Kützing) Cleve var. elliptica showed valve morphology 
and striae density similar to the ones illustrated by Krammer & Lange-Bertalot (1986: fig. 108: 1-
4). However, samples analyzed from the Xingu river showed specimens smaller than those 
described for the species (L: 20-130 μm). It was present in 2.6% of the core samples, and reaches 
3% maximum abundance. D. elliptica var. elliptica was identified from samples corresponding to 
the Late Holocene (~1.730 to 560 cal. yr BP). This is the first citation of the species presence in the 
Brazilian Amazon. 

Considering the valve shape, Navicula notha Wallace resembles Navicula cryptocephala 
Kützing (1844: 95), but differs in having smaller valves, with an inconspicuous central area in the 
smaller specimens, and rhombic shape in the larger ones (Potapova 2011). The species occurred 
only in 3% of the core samples, and reaches 1.3% maximum abundance. It is present in samples 
corresponding to the Late Holocene (~2.909 cal. yr BP). This is the first report of its occurrence in 
the Brazilian Amazon. 

Sellaphora emilia Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot belongs to the group bacillum of genus 
Sellaphora (Mann et al. 2008). Differs from Sellaphora renata Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot in 
having valves with consistently straight margins, less broadly rounded ends and by the smaller 
valve dimensions (2007: L: 45.0-124.0 µm, W: 12.0-14.0 µm and L: 45.0-140.0 µm, W: 15.0-21.0 
µm; respectively). The species was present in only 2% of the core samples, and reaches 1% 
maximum abundance. It is also present in samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~1.757 cal. 
yr BP). Current study is the first report of the species occurrence in Brazil. 

This species belongs to the group “pupula” of Sellaphora and differs from Sellaphora pupula 
(Kützing) Mereschkovsky (1902: 187) in its linear elliptical valves, with broadly rounded poles 
(Mann et al. 2008). It was present in 35% of the core samples, reaching 6% maximum abundance. 
The species was identified from samples corresponding to the end of the Mid-Holocene to the core 
top (~6.000 cal. yr BP to the present day). Current study is the first communication of this species 
occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. 

Based on the valve outline, Sellaphora renata Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot is quite similar to 
Sellaphora lambda (Cleve) Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 206). However, S. renata lack of 
marginal spines present in S. lambda (Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 2007). The species was found in 
5% of the core samples and reached 1.5% maximum abundance. It was identified in samples 
corresponding to the early Late Holocene (~1.322 cal. yr BP).  

According to Wetzel et al. (2015), Naviculadicta sassiana Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998) 
was first described for the Amazonian region (Tapajós river, Brasil), and was later on transferred to 
Sellaphora based on the LM illustrations in Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998). Sellaphora 
sassiana was present in 5% of the core samples, reaching 9.6% maximum abundance. It occured in 
samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~408 cal. yr BP). The species was already reported 
for Brazil, from the Tapajós river, as Naviculadicta sassiana (e.g., Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 
1998), however, the present is to be considered the first report for the country using its correct 
name. 

In a review of several Sellaphora materials, Mann et al. (2004) mentioned that Sellaphora 
ventraloconfusa (Lange-Bertalot) Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot should be included in the Sellaphora 
seminulum (Grunow) D.G.Mann group, but all information available to date is still insufficient to 
confirm it. This species was present at only 2% of the core samples, and reached 1% maximum 
abundance. It occurred from samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~408 cal. yr BP). Current 
investigation is the first document of the occurrence of the species in the Brazilian Amazon. 

Lacuneolimna novagallia Tudesque & Le Cohu is distinguished from Lacuneolimna zalokariae 
Tudesque & Le Cohu (2015: 21) in its continuous depressions in valve face, wider costae, and more 
expanded “cross-bar network” (Tudesque et al. 2015). It was present in 0.6% of the core samples, 
reaching 2% maximum abundance. The species was identified from samples corresponding to the 
Late Holocene (~1.790 cal. yr BP). This is the first citation of the species presence in Brazil. 

In the present study, this taxon was identified as Pinnularia cf. liyanlingae, because the 
specimens presented smaller dimensions than those described by Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (2007, 
L: 94-200 µm, W: 24-32 µm). The taxon was found in 15% of the core samples and reached 1.5% 
maximum abundance. It was identified in samples corresponding to the early Late Holocene to the 
core top (~1.322 cal. yr BP to the present day).  

This taxa resembles Stauroneis sylviabonillae Metzeltin, Lange-Bertalot & García-Rodríguez 
in regard to the lanceolate valve shape, however, Stauroneis sp. has smaller valves dimensions and 
higher striae density than those described in Metzeltin et al. (2005: L:103-120 µm, W:20-22  µm, 
S:15-16 in 10µm).Moreover, S. sylviabonillae has proximal raphe fissures slightly deflected, such 
feature isn’t observed Stauroneis sp. Material examined also differs from Stauroneis anceps 
Ehrenberg (1843: 291-445 105) due to its narrow, rostrate, and long apices (Bahls 2011). In the 
present study, Stauroneis sp.1 was present in 5% of the core samples, reaching 2% maximum 
abundance. It occurred in samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~2.909 cal. yr BP).  

This material resembles that of Stauroneis schinzii (Brun) Cleve (1894: 146), however, the 
latter has very broadly rounded valve apices and greater cell dimensions (Patrick & Reimer 1966: 
L: 130-221 µm, W: 17-19 µm, S: 15-18 in 10 µm) than Stauroneis sp.1. The latter material is 
further characterized by having linear valves, obtusely rounded subrostrate apices, broad linear 
slightly irregular axial area that suddenly turns ovoid at the terminal ends, relatively small fascia 
that slightly expands toward the margin, broad raphe that somewhat narrows near by the proximal 
and distal ends, branched distal raphe ends that form semicircular hooks bending to the same 
direction, and radiate striae at the valve center that become parallel toward the ends. It is present in 
35% of the core samples, and reached 2.6% maximum abundance. The taxon was identified from 
samples corresponding to the end of the Mid-Holocene to the core top (~5.760 cal. yr BP to 
present). 

Nitzschia pusilluhasta E.A.Lehmkhul & C.E.M.Bicudo differs from Nitzschia amphibia 
Grunow (1862: 574) because the latter species has lanceolate valves with slightly protracted ends, 
and a gap between the central fibulae (Lehmkuhl et al. 2019: 25-26). It can be also misidentified as 
Nitzschia semirobusta Lange-Bertalot (1993: 149), however, N. pusilluhasta has greater valve 
dimensions and rectangular, short to slightly extend fibulae. It was present in 0.6% of the core 
samples and reaches 3% maximum abundance. In the current study, N. pusilluhasta was identified 
from samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~2.400 cal. yr BP). This is the first report of the 
species occurrence in the Amazon basin. 

Surirella sp. resembles Surirella terryi D.B.Ward ex W.A.Terry (1907: 127) in its heteropolar 
valves and the cuneate valve apices. However, the latter species has a more pronounced central area 
along the apical axis and greater valve dimensions (Ferreira & Bicudo 2017: L: 67-176 μm, W: 23-
35 μm). The species is also characterized by its asymmetric linear valves with a rounded headpole 
and a cuneate footpole, a narrow hyaline axial area, lack of costae, non visible fibulae, and low keel 
and alar canals parallel to each other. This taxon was present in 5% of the core samples, reaching 
1% maximum abundance. It was identified from samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~973 
cal. yr BP). 

Overall, 38 taxa from 20 genera were recorded along the study period (~6.000 cal yr BP). 
Moreover, five new records of diatom species were added for Brazil as well as nineteen new 
records for the Brazilian Amazon. 

Gomphonema was the most represented genus in species number (six species), followed by 
Eunotia (five species), Sellaphora (five species) and Staurosirella (four species).  

Considering the studied period, only three species exclusively occurred during the end of the 
Mid-Holocene reaching 4.5% maximum abundance. This low abundance of diatoms species during 
the end of the Mid-Holocene may be related to the deeper waters with hydrological flow. This 
finding is consistent with the results in studies in the Amazon Basin (e.g., Cordeiro et al., 2008, 
Moreira et al. 2013, Brugger et al. 2016, Fontes et al. 2017).  

In the Late Holocene, 20 species were reported reaching 45.2% maximum abundance, of which 
five are new records or the Brazilian territory (Aulacoseira crassipunctata, Gomphonema 
pseudosphaerophorum, Sellaphora emilia, S. sassiana e Lacuneolimna novagallia). In this period, 
the diatom assemblage was composed by benthic species suggesting a shallower water condition 
with with low conductivity, oligotrophic and acidic waters (Moro & Fürstenberger 1993, Van Dam 
et al. 1994, Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 2007, Bahls et al. 2009, Tudesque et al. 2015).Similar result 
was registered by Cardozo et al. (2014), in Lake Tota, Colombia during the Late Holocene and was 
attributed to a drier period with high temperatures and low precipitation. 

An additional 14 species were indistinctly distributed throughout the core, reaching 75.3% 
maximum abundance. The results showed that this variation in diatoms species can indicate water 
level changes in the Xingu river, so that at the end of the Mid-Holocene the system presented deep 
waters that gave way to shallower waters in the Late Holocene. 

In the last years, the Brazilian amazon basin has been experiencing a great number of new 
species (Wetzel et al. 2010a, 2010b, 2011, 2012a, 2012b, Burliga et al. 2013, Tremarin et al. 2013a, 
2014a, 2014b, Pereira et al. 2014, 2015, 2017, Almeida et al. 2017, Almeida et al. 2018, Canani et 
al. 2018) demonstrating how scant is the knowledge of the diatoms in this region. Furthermore, the 
present new records for the Brazilian Amazon represent a 75% increase in the total number of 
records for the region, and strengthen that the region remains poorly investigated and its 
biodiversity assessment is considerably underestimated. Finally, the present study highlights the 
importance of a paleolimnological approach as an available tool to assess changes in biodiversity 
over a long time scale and increase the knowledge of diatoms, especially in amazonian ecosystems.
